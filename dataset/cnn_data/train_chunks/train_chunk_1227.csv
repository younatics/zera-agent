"Hire Majesty: The Queen has agreed to allow businesses to take their pick of state apartments in St James's Palace . A Royal palace is to be let out to companies for up to £30,000 a day during next year’s Olympic Games. In a break with nearly 500 years of Royal protocol, St James’s Palace has thrown open the doors to some of its most lavish state apartments for private firms to rent during the London Games. The Queen has personally approved the plans to allow businesses to take their pick of the Palace’s Throne Room, its Tapestry Room and the Queen Anne Room for glamorous parties. And wealthy pleasure-seekers can take advantage of another stately offer elsewhere - with Leeds Castle available to hire for the Olympics at £1million. Guests at St James's will enjoy an exclusive . tour of the Palace as part of the exclusive celebrations. They will also be close to several key Olympic events, including the Beach Volleyball in Horse Guards . Parade, and the marathon, which will start and finish in the Mall. Nearby Hyde Park will be the venue for some swimming events. One . source said: ‘The Palace is exploiting its historical heritage and its . prime location. Officials have already begun contacting firms and . charities who they think might be interested in using the Palace. 'They are targeting organisations who . have an existing link with the Royal Household and that includes those . who have Royal Warrants.' All the dates are now reportedly sold out, after an overwhelming response from big businesses looking to throw a soiree to remember. St James’s Palace, which is still the official residence of the Sovereign, is normally closed to the public. Games rooms: Corporations have leapt at the chance to hold lavish parties at the palace next summer for £30,000 a pop . Plush: In a break with nearly 500 years of tradition businesses will be able to hire rooms such as the Throne Room (pictured) Now, under the hire plan, firms will be . able to invite guests to events in the Tapestry Room, which boasts an . original Tudor fireplace and a selection of tapestries woven for Charles . II, and the Throne Room, which contains a single throne for the . reigning Monarch. The third room on offer, the upholstered Queen Anne Room, is dominated by a portrait of George III. Companies can entertain up to 500 guests for lunch, dinner or a drinks reception. It is understood catering will be carried out by Palace staff rather than by private firms. The three rooms have each seen their fair share of history – the treaty which established the Council of Europe, for instance, was signed in the Queen Anne Room in 1949. Famous: The Palace was shown to the world after Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge chose one of its rooms to announce their engagement . David Starkey, the historian and broadcaster, said opening the Palace to the corporate world was perhaps inevitable. ‘I have attended charity functions at the Palace and it is ideal for this sort of entertaining,’ he said. Welcome idea: David Starkey said the Palace was ideal for entertaining . ‘We are in an age where everything is up for sale so we should not be surprised when the Monarchy jumps on the bandwagon. ‘In a real sense we reap what we sow. If we begrudge the Royal Family every penny piece, then what else are the Queen and the Royal household to do? ‘Buckingham Palace, for instance, is a highly decorated slum which needs tens of millions spent on it.’ But a senior member of the Royal Household attacked the plans as unseemly, The People reported today. 'St James's has the richest history of the royal palaces and it seems improper to hire it out to the highest bidder for corporate booze-ups,' they said. 'The general feeling among staff is that this is entirely inappropriate. The state apartments should be used for ceremonial occasions as normal to retain their prestige.' St James’s, commissioned by Henry VIII, is the official residence of the Sovereign, although no Monarch has lived there since William IV in 1837. The Palace remains at the centre of Royal life, however. Prince Charles’s official residence, Clarence House, is within its grounds and the Palace is also home to the Princess Royal and Princess Beatrice. Buckingham Palace last night defended the arrangements. A spokesman confirmed they would run for the duration of the Games but declined to give details of fees or the organisations that had booked. ‘I think everyone is very conscious that purse strings are tight at the moment and this is an innovative way of raising funds,’ he said. ‘All the monies raised will be able to supplement the Sovereign Grant and will be spent on the upkeep of Royal residences.’ Billionaire's playground: Leeds Castle is available to hire for £1million - £62,500 a night - during the 17-day Games . Trustees at Leeds Castle in Kent last week hired estate agent Knight Frank to make 'discreet enquiries' about who could be interested in staying there during the Games, according to the Sunday Times. The luxurious rooms are said to be available at a minimum of £62,500 a night, with an army of staff on hand to attend to guests; every need. A butler will deliver cocktails at dusk and a chauffeur will ferry rich visitors around the 500-acre estate. The castle - which is around two hours' drive from the Olympic Stadium - boasts a helipad, maze, golf course and 40 opulent bedrooms. Its wealthy guests will be able to hold banquets for 100 people, or indulge in jousting, hot-air balloon rides and driving a nearby steam train, said the newspaper. The castle was built in 1119 and remodelled by Henry VIII for Catherine of Aragon. It has been run by a charitable trust since 1974. It was used for Middle East and Northern Ireland peace talks and was the setting for concerts by stars including Elton John and Luciano Pavarotti.",Billionaires can also hire Leeds Castle for £1million during the Games .
"The Catts of Katy, Texas seemed to be a normal, quiet, family before their secret lives as bank robbers was revealed last year. Scott Catt, 50, and his 20-year-old son Hayden and 18-year-old daughter Abby stole $100,000 in two bank robberies before they were arrested at their middle-class apartment complex. In a confessional prison interview, Scott Catt told Texas Monthly how he recruited his two children to become his accomplices in crime. 'All I can tell you is that I thought it would help us as a family,' Catt said. 'I did it for the family,' he said. 'I swear to you, I would only rob banks for my family.' The Catt family robbers: Scott Catt (center), his 20-year-old son Hayden (left), and 18-year-old daughter Abby (right), were arrested last year after carrying out two bank robberies in Texas . Catt first started robbing banks after his wife's death in 1997 from breast cancer, when Hayden was five and Abby was two. The widower turned to alcohol and drugs to deal with the pain and began to struggle financially. It was around 2000 or 2002 that he carried out his first robbery at a bank in McMinnville, Oregon where the family was then living. After dropping the kids off at school, Catt drove to a nearby bank where he wore a ball cap, black sweats, a white painter's mask and sunglasses as a disguise. He threatened the tellers with an unloaded antique pistol and came away with $2,500. Trigger: Scott Catt says he first started robbing banks after his wife Beth's death from breast cancer in 1997. He says her death caused him to become addicted to alcohol, which negatively impacted his finance . Too young: Hayden was five and Abby (right) as just two at the time of their mother's (left) death . A few days later, police issued a grainy photo of Catt from surveillance footage. 'My mother said the man in the photo looked a little like me, and I just laughed,' Catt said. 'And that was it. We all went out for dinner that night. The police never came to knock on my door.' After that first heist, Catt was addicted and he continued to rob banks about once a year. Oregon authorities now believe Catt was responsible for about five unsolved robberies in the state. 'I didn’t feel like a criminal,' he told me. 'I didn’t load my pistol. I knew I wasn’t going to shoot anybody. And I kept telling myself that whatever money I got was insured, so who was really being hurt?' Catt led a double life, convincing everyone who knew him that he was just a devoted dad who made a point of cooking for his kids every night. Back in McMinnville, Catt is remembered as a single dad who supported his two kids and took them on summer trips to amusement parks. He also became the president of the swim club his kids participated in. Kathryn Lundeen, who served on the club's board says Catt 'showed a lot of leadership...I liked the guy. He never struck me as being a person who had poor judgement. The children only got involved after Catt moved to Texas for a new job as an engineer at energy-firm Kinder Morgan. Sister and brother: The Catts were arrested after a bank robbery last October. Abby (left) is serving a five year sentence and brother Hayden (right) is serving a 10-year sentence. Abby will be eligible for parole after 18 months, while her brother will be eligible after four years . Punished: Scott Catt will spend the next 24 years in jail for his many robberies. He will be 62 years old by the time he is able to leave prison . The job paid a comfortable $40/hour but Catt couldn't help start thinking about another robbery and getting more money per bust with a 'team of accomplices'. Catt didn't have any friends he knew he could trust in Texas, and instead turned to his two children. He also saw the money as a way to help them out. 'They were floundering,' he said. 'I could see the despair in Hayden, and I thought he could use—I don’t know—some inspiration, some excitement. Same with Abby. She had lost her self-esteem, not graduating from high school. All I can tell you is that I thought doing it would give us all a little boost in our lives—that it would help us as a family.' Catt first revealed his criminal side-job to son Hayden back in Oregon. 'We were . sitting at the kitchen table,' Hayden remembers. 'I was having some . coffee, and he said he had something important to tell me. He said he . had a second job as a part-time bank robber. The way he looked at me, I . knew he wasn’t kidding.' 'Who else can you trust except family?' Scott said. The . two eventually decided to approach Abby, who worked as a sales person . at a Victoria's Secret store in a local mall, hoping she could act as . their getaway driver. It was Hayden that approached his sister about the plan, while she was listening to music in her bedroom. 'I . need to tell you something,' Hayden said. 'Dad’s a bank robber, I’m . going to become one too, and we want you to join us...We want you to be our . wheel man.' Abby agreed, but mostly because she felt she had to protect her family. Family photo: Abby, Hayden and their father pose for a picture with their grandmother . Cool dad: Catt was devoted to taking his children on summer vacations, especially to amusement parks . 'This was something I felt like I had to do, to protect them, to make sure they got out of the bank and didn’t get shot or something,' she told me. 'I didn’t want to let Dad down.' The three conducted their first robbery on August 9, 2013 - on Abby's day off from Victoria's Secret. They covered the plates on Abby's Jetta and drove to a nearby bank where Catt and Hayden entered and ordered the tellers to empty their cash drawers. All the while, Abby idled in the parking lot and used a walkie-talkie to update her dad and brother on the time. After raiding the bank's vault, the father and son exited the bank and got into the Jetta as Abby drove a normal speed home. Back at the apartment, they emptied their bags and realized they had stolen $70,000. Double life: Abby was working at a Victoria's Secret store when she agreed to be her father and brother's getaway driver. Above, pictures from her social media accounts . They celebrated that night by treating themselves to dinner out at Tex-Mex chain Chuy's. Abby says she was anxious, waiting for police to come in the restaurant and arrest them. But her brother was walking on air. 'I felt exhilaration, the most intense high I’ve ever experienced,' Hayden said. 'It changed my life. I’ll be truthful about that.' But the money was gone in just a month. Catt spent it buying himself a new $10,000 motorcycle, a $17,000 Tahoe SUV for Hayden, a $12,600 Ford Focus for Abby as well as groceries, restaurants, clothes, furniture and, according to Catt, 'some partying'. They carried out their second heist on October 1. This time Catt and his son dressed as road workers, complete with overalls and orange safety vests. Clues: Catt and his son dressed as road workers for their robbery of the First Community Credit Union on October 1. Police eventually caught the family after tracing their safety vest purchases . The three raided the First Community Credit Union and came away with $30,000 this time. They weren't caught immediately, but this time the Catt family gave police a clue that would lead to their downfall. Witnesses at the bank remembered the robbers road-worker's uniforms and how the vests looked like they were brand new. Police then were able to trace purchase of the vests to a local Home Depot, and found the family at checkout on surveillance footage. The three were arrested at their apartment on November 9, the same day they planned to carry out another bank robbery. Abode: The Catt family was arrested at their middle-class apartments in Katy, Texas on November 9 - just as they were planning to raid another bank . The family immediately confessed to their crimes after their arrest and agreed to a plea deal late last year. Abby was sentenced to five years in prison, and will be eligible for parole in 18 months. Her bother got a 10-year sentence and will be eligible for parole in 4 years. Catt, meanwhile, got a 24 year sentence and will be 62 years old by the time he gets out of prison. In the months since his arrest, Catt has lost seventy pounds as he's racked with guilt for causing his children to become convicts. 'When I look back on what I did, what led to this place, I would have been better off—we all would have been better off—if I had gone on welfare and been a stay-at-home dad.' While both Catt children expressed remorse for their actions, they don't hold a grudge against their father for corrupting them. Hayden says when he gets out of prison he'd like to go to college, and maybe train to become an engineer just like his dad. Abby holds a bit more hostility towards her father saying, he 'should have been protecting me, instead of the other way around' But just before her interview, she came across her father in the prison infirmary and the two had an emotional reunion. 'He told me he loved me, to be strong, and to be patient. And then he said he was so sorry. I broke down and started crying. I mean, like I’ve said, he is my dad.' Father and daughter: While Abby holds a bit of hostility towards her father for entangling her into a life of crime, she says she still loves him .","Scott Catt and his two adult children were arrested after stealing $100,000 in two bank robberies last year .

"Homesick: Maciej Maciejewski, 34, firebombed a town hall in a bid to be deported from Britain . A homesick Polish man who firebombed a town hall in a bid to be deported from Britain has been ordered to stay in the country for two more years. Maciej Maciejewski, 34, was so desperate to return to his beloved homeland that he travelled 250 miles from his London house to Manchester. He then created a Molotov cocktail, before setting it alight and hurling it through the doors of the city's 146-year-old town hall. The fire was quickly extinguished by a porter and Maciejewski surrendered to police, telling them: 'I just wanted to go back to Poland.' But his hopes of being deported were diminished after he was jailed for 24 months at Manchester Crown Court - at a cost to the taxpayer of up to £75,000. Due to Poland being in the European Union and therefore subject to its laws on 'free movement', Maciejewski can not be legally kicked out of the UK and can only go to Poland at his own expense. The arsonist's sentence means he will have to remain in Britain until 2016 unless he is released early for good behaviour. The public cost . of a prison place in the UK is thought to be £37,500 a year. Sentencing Maciejewski, Judge . Andrew Blake told him: 'There is an old saying - if you play . with fire, you are going to get burnt. The reason why it is regarded as . serious is because the consequences can’t be predicted. 'Your . motivation you say, and I have no reason to doubt this, was to get your . fare back to Poland paid for. Well, this strategy was never going to . work. That’s not what happens. We are a member of the EU. 'If . you commit criminal offences in this country just as if you had . committed criminal offences as you have in the past in Poland, you go to . prison. 'The consequences could have been serious. There can be no doubt . about it that you carefully planned this expedition to Manchester. It . is inevitable that a prison sentence must follow.' Attack: Maciejewski was so desperate to return to Poland that he travelled 250 miles from his London house to Manchester. He then lit a Molotov cocktail and hurled it at the city's town hall. Above, police recover the weapon . Emergency crews: Firefighters are pictured outside the town hall, where the fire was extinguished by a porter . Earlier, the court heard how Maciejewski had concocted his plan to attack Manchester’s town hall because he was unemployed, penniless and thought it would be a ‘ticket back to Poland’. He had travelled from London to the city with the sole intention of damaging the building - eschewing the capital because he liked London and ‘didn’t want to do anything there’. On his arrival in Manchester at around midday on March 31, Maciewjewski bought petrol, poured it into an empty Budweiser bottle he had found in a bin and walked towards the town hall. The building packed with civil servants and hundreds of conference delegates, the court heard. Scene: Maciejewski threw the bottle-based incendiary weapon through the doors of the old building (pictured) In front of bystanders and office workers enjoying their lunch, he then ripped part of his t-shirt to use as a fuse, before lighting the cocktail and hurling it into the empty entrance of the town hall. The bottle shattered when it hit the wooden frame of the door and burst into flames. A porter quickly extinguished the fire . after employees complained of flames and smoke, but not before the blaze . had caused £250 worth of damage to the wooden doors of the building. Andrew Mackintosh, prosecuting, said Maciejewski, who has lived in England since 2008, had lost his travel documentation so was not eligible for work in this country, which had left him broke. He added: 'In interview he stated that he had come from Poland and had been living in London and that he had lost his documentation and had no means of getting work in this country and that he wanted to return to Poland. 'He had sought the help of the Polish Embassy but was not assisted. He decided to travel from London where he had been living rough to commit this offence in the hope he would be sent back. 'He had no intention of hurting anybody. He said what he did was a ticket back to Poland.' Maciejewski, who had 15 previous convictions including one in Poland for assaulting a public official, asked through his barrister if any prison sentence could be served in his native country. However, his request was declined by Judge Blake. Court: Maciejewski's hopes of being deported back to Poland were diminished after he was jailed for 24 months at Manchester Crown Court (pictured). The ruling is expected to cost the taxpayer up to £75,000 . Max . Saffman, defending, acknowledged his client had ‘failed to acknowledge . the particular danger’ of hurling a lit bottle of petrol at a building . full of people, but said it had caused only minor damage. 'There is a perverse logic in his actions. His thinking is perhaps he intended to commit an act of criminal damage but used fire for that,' he said. 'For no sooner had it started it was put out by an eagle-eyed security guard. It was £250 worth of damage - not a considerable amount. 'He didn’t wish for anybody to be hurt. He just wished to be returned to Poland as soon as possible.' Maciejewski was not ordered to pay any compensation for the damage caused.","Maciej Maciejewski, 34, travelled 250 miles from London home to Manchester .

"The FA have launched an investigation into West Ham fans mocking the disabled in a chant about Harry Kane, on the day Kevin Kilbane was abused for reporting the matter. Kilbane, the former Everton and Ireland player, said he felt compelled to speak out after Hammers fans sang that Tottenham star Kane ‘talks like a m*** and plays like one too.' The Match of the Day pundit found support from anti-discrimination group Kick It Out as well as Ismail Kaji, parliamentary affairs assistant at Mencap, who wrote a letter to West Ham and the FA urging action. The chants were aimed at Tottenham forward Harry Kane during Sunday's London derby at White Hart Lane . Kilbane is a patron of the Down’s Syndrome Association and his 10-year-old daughter Elsie has the condition. He went on Radio 5 Live  to explain how he found the chant distressing and addressed the anger his complaint had provoked in certain quarters. He was accused of being washed-up, branded a ‘grass’, and told to ‘stop crying’ by some Twitter users. He was also called a ‘m***’ among other vile terms. But many others backed Kilbane, one posting: ‘Never knew mocking disabled was important part of the game.’ Kevin Kilbane reported the club to the FA after hearing about the chants from his biographer Andy Merriman . Kilbane said: ‘I have two daughters, Elsie and Isla, my youngest. If she heard this chanting she would be distraught as much as Elsie. I had to speak to the FA but there were a number of other complaints that went in, not just me.’ Kilbane was not at Sunday’s game, but his biographer Andy Merriman — a Spurs season ticket-holder — contacted him afterwards. Merriman’s daughter, Sarah, also has Down’s Syndrome. The FA are also aware of video showing West Ham fans singing anti-Semitic songs on a Tube carriage the same day. The club said fans found guilty of such chanting will be banned. Sam Allardyce's side are now subject to a probe from the FA after the chants from the West Ham fans .","West Ham are subject to FA investigation after chanting about the disabled .

"An impromptu midnight fishing trip in Florida has turned up an extraordinary catch. And the fishermen captured the moment on video. Dustin Richter said it took him and his pals over two hours to wrangle a rare 11-foot long, 500-pound sawfish into shore at Boynton Beach Inlet on Sunday morning. 'Catching a fish like that is like once in a lifetime,' Richter told ABC. Scroll down for video .

Richet and his friends had planned to have a poker night, before making a last-minute decision for a late-night fishing session. 'About an hour after putting our lines out we were about to leave,' Richter said. 'But something started clicking, the reel started going off, and it felt about four or five feet. 'It got to the light and we saw the fish and saw it was a sawfish - we were amazed. 'It was 11 feet long and the bill was about 4 feet long.' Richter said it is extremely rare to see a sawfish, let alone catch one. 'It's just one of those prehistoric-looking animals,' he said.

"Sam Allardyce has vowed to finish West Ham United’s season in entertaining fashion after being subjected to abuse from his own fans during the emphatic defeat by West Bromwich Albion.

It’s the same all over the country. ‘It’s my job to get the players out on the field, hopefully entertain them and win as much as we can, which is what we have done for 85-90 per cent of this season. ‘The disappointment about this is it’s a Cup game and we’re out.

"Leicester’s 5-3 victory over Manchester United may have been the high point of their Premier League season so far, but Nigel Pearson insists he has tried hard to forget all about it. The Leicester manager has not wanted his players to dwell on that stunning victory, rescued after falling 3-1 behind, which saw a winless run of 13 games follow subsequently. That prompted questions about the adverse effect of winning in such style and Pearson would rather the match was never mentioned. Leicester City striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates after clinching victory against Manchester United . It was a day to forget for United boss Louis van Gaal after they conceded five goals at the King Power . ‘We’ve been trying to forget about it ever since,’ he said. ‘It was great but until we won at Hull that was the last time we won. ‘I think the best thing for us to do is concentrate on what we are doing at the moment. I don’t know if it has affected anything. It obviously has as the question has been asked. ‘The game at our place was a very good result for us, we had a very good second half and scored at vital times. But those are not sort of events that happen every week. I don’t spend much time looking at those angles.’ Esteban Cambiasso fired Leicester level as the Foxes went on to run out 5-3 winners . Van Gaal changed his 4-4-2 diamond system in the weeks after the 5-3 to a more defensively sound 3-5-2 formation. United fans have chanted for a switch back but last week the Dutch manager claimed 4-4-2 lacked balance and gives him a ‘twitchy a**’. He highlighted that crazy afternoon at the King Power Stadium as his root cause for his concern. Pearson believes United present awesome opposition whichever way they shape up – but did indicate Van Gaal might have risked his job had he failed to pick up results while toying with tactics. United have lost once in 14 games. Nigel Pearson briefs his players ahead of Saturday's trip to Old Trafford . ‘I’m expecting to play against a very good team,’ said Pearson. ‘I would hope that whoever we play have a healthy respect for us. ‘I’ve never been in any doubt their manager will play the way he wants to. But it may be a situation where he gets all his players in before he can totally play the way he wants. That happened with us. ‘But his track record as a manager is outstanding and he’s proved many times over the years he is capable of building sides. ‘I can only speak from my own experience but you have to get enough results while you’re going through the building process to keep people on side or keep your job.’","Leicester beat United 5-3 at the King Power Stadium back in September .

"CLICK HERE to read the full match report . Steve McClaren will not be taking over the vacant managerial position at Newcastle United, Derby County chief executive Sam Rush has insisted. The former England boss was installed as the favourite to succeed Alan Pardew, whose former side were booed by their own fans after a lucklustre third-round defeat by Leicester, but Rush said McClaren will be going ‘absolutely nowhere’ as the club bid for promotion to the Premier League. ‘Steve and I caught up after the Southport game, as we do after all games,’ said Rush. ‘We had a chat about the speculation and after our chat I thought it was sensible just to confirm that Steve McClaren is going absolutely nowhere.

His future is with us.’ McClaren, whose Championship side needed a stoppage-time penalty by substitute Chris Martin to secure a 1-0 home win over Conference strugglers Southport, has already brought in Darren Bent on loan this transfer window and Rush predicts more moves to strengthen the team’s promotion push. ‘We have concluded some early-January business and we believe there is more ahead of us,’ he said. As the search for Pardew’s replacement continues Newcastle stand-in coach John Carver will meet managing director Lee Charnley early this week to discuss his prospects of keeping the job until the end of the season. Newcastle caretaker manager John Carver saw his side lose to Leicester in the FA Cup . Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa (centre) heads in the winner at the King Power Stadium . Newcastle fans jeered their team off the pitch after crashing out of the FA Cup . But with Newcastle insistent that the man who takes over from Pardew will be known as the head coach and, according to Carver, have no say in transfer dealings, other leading candidates are already distancing themselves from the job. Ajax coach Frank de Boer is understood not to want it, and certainly not on those terms, while Rafa Benitez, currently at Napoli, would also not join under the conditions owner Mike Ashley wishes to impose on the new man. Carver’s best hope of securing the job appears to be his willingness to co-operate with the current ownership model. Carver said: ‘The conversation I had with Lee last Monday was: “Look after Burnley, look after the FA Cup game” and that was it. I’m sure we’ll talk this week.’ But Carver’s chances of securing the job were not helped by Saturday’s 1-0 defeat, with a goal by Leicester’s Leonardo Ulloa — and the outbreak of hostility from fans, who booed their team at the end and renewed their protests against Ashley. At the end Carver led the team over to the 4,5000 travelling fans who booed, gestured for the players to leave and chanted: ‘We’re s*** and we’re sick of it.’ Earlier they had demanded that Ashley ‘get out of our club’. Alan Pardew left Newcastle to take over at Crystal Palace where he spent time as a player . Former Liverpool and Chelsea manager Rafa Benitez is understood to be in the frame on Tyneside . Carver, a Newcastle man to his core, has travelled as a fan of the club before, including to the 1998 FA Cup final. Asked if he would have booed, he said: ‘Yes, I would. Because I would’ve been disappointed, because we’re out of the FA Cup. ‘It’s probably one of the toughest moments I’ve ever experienced in football. But the fans are entitled to do that. I was making sure the players were going to take it. Because when you do well you accept the plaudits and when it’s not going well you have to take it on the chin.’ Carver added: ‘I’d be mad not to want to be head coach. If ever there’s an opportunity it’s now. If I don’t throw my hat in the ring, I’ll never get that opportunity again.’","Former England boss one of the favourites to replace Alan Pardew .

"An Austrian politician is in line to get up to £16,000 in compensation after a hidden camera used for snapping wildlife photographed him having sex in a forest. The politician, who has not yet been named, will get the payout if a court rules the photographs violated his privacy. Carefully concealed and placed well away from areas frequented by people the motion-sensing camera was designed to record forest wildlife in the Austrian region of Carinthia but instead caught the politician's exploits. Legal experts said the camera contravenes Austrian laws restricting the use of surveillance cameras. Privacy:  The politician could be in line for compensation of up to £16,000 after he was caught having sex on a hidden camera in Carinthia, Austria . Hans Zeger, president of Argen Daten, an NGO specialising in data protection, told the Daily Telegraph that official permission was needed to place the camera. He added: 'At the very least it should have been marked with signs so visitors could adjust their behaviour and avoid the monitored areas.' However, the Carinthia Hunting Society, the organisation which placed the camera, defended the use of the equipment. 'I cannot say for sure how many cameras are in operation in forests in Carinthia as they do not have to be registered to us,' said Freydis Burgstaller-Gredenegger, the society's manager. 'We have never had any problems with the cameras up until now.' She added that the cameras were generally used to record animal feeding patterns. So far the politician's blushes have been spared by the society decision to keep both the photographs and his name secret.","Unnamed public figure photographed by wildlife camera in Carinthia, Austria .

"Tim Sherwood is closing in on the Aston Villa job after entering advanced negotiations with chief executive Tom Fox. The former Tottenham Hotspur head coach is understood to have been interviewed and expressed an interest in taking over from sacked Paul Lambert. Villa are keen to make a swift appointment to spark an upturn in results with the side in the Premier League relegation zone, but also want a manager who can stay for the long term. Tim Sherwood is in advanced talks with Aston Villa about replacing Paul Lambert . Sherwood has sought guarantees and financial assurances from Villa . Paul Lambert was sacked this week following defeat by Hull on Tuesday night . That would appeal to Sherwood, who pushed for an extended deal during talks with Spurs chief Daniel Levy before settling on an 18-month contract.

"Turkey’s prime minister has warned speculators not to try and make money off the back of the country's troubles, threatening 'we will choke you.' Tayyip Erdogan also warned protesters who have taken to the streets across Turkey demanding his resignation that his patience has its limits and compared the unrest with an army attempt six years ago to curb his power. Riot police used teargas and water cannon to disperse anti-government protesters from a square in the capital, Ankara, just a few kilometres from where Erdogan spoke. Limits: Anti-government protesters stand behind improvised barricade in central Ankara. Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan told flag-waving supporters on Sunday that his patience with mass anti-government protests had its limits . Power struggle: Erdogan moved to seize back the initiative by announcing counter-rallies next weekend . Response: In Ankara's Kizilay district, riot police fired tear gas and water cannon to flush anti-government demonstrators from a square . Threat: Many see Turkey's secular order threatened by Erdogan . He held six rallies on Sunday, a measure . of tensions after a week of the biggest demonstrations and worst . rioting of his decade in power. Thousands waved red Turkish flags and . shouted Allahu Akbar (God Is Greatest) as he accused protesters of . attacking women wearing headscarves and desecrating mosques by taking . beer bottles into them. 'I believe in Erdogan and his path. We will not let some looters hijack our country and our flag,' said a housewife who gave her name as Zeynep, waving a national flag with Erdogan's picture emblazoned on it. In the commercial centre Istanbul, tens of thousands flooded the central Taksim Square, where protests began nine days ago when police used teargas and water cannon against a peaceful demonstration over plans to build on a park there. Many see Turkey's secular order threatened by Erdogan. Turkey's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan addresses his supporters yesterday. He warned:  'Those who attempt to sink the bourse, you will collapse ... If we catch your speculation, we will choke you.

Protesters, many camped out in tents, . now control a large area around the square, with approach roads . barricaded by masonry, paving stones and steel rods. Police have . withdrawn completely from the area, water cannon kept hundreds of metres . away by the side of the Bosphorus waterway. Western . countries have held up Erdogan's Turkey as an example of an Islamic . democracy that could be emulated elsewhere in the Middle East. Violent . police action, however, has drawn criticism from the West and Erdogan . has increasingly accused foreign forces of trying to aggravate the . troubles. He also . rounded on speculators, foreign and domestic, in the country's capital . markets, vowing to 'choke' those who he said were growing rich off 'the . sweat of the people', and urging Turks to put their money in state not . private banks. 'Those . who attempt to sink the bourse, you will collapse ... If we catch your . speculation, we will choke you. No matter who you are, we will choke . you,' he said. Turkey's financial markets were turbulent last week and investors are preparing for more volatility this week. Control: Protesters, many camped out in tents, now control a large area around the square, with approach roads barricaded by masonry, paving stones and steel rods . Extended: Riot police officers gather after chasing protesters - the trouble has been going on for over a week now .

Early on Friday, the lira hit its . weakest point against its euro/dollar basket since October 2011, while . Istanbul's main share index lost around 15 percent over the week. The yield of Turkey's two-year benchmark sovereign bond hit a six-month high on Thursday. Three . people have been killed and around 5,000 injured in the troubles . rocking a country faced with war across its southern border with Syria. 'We . were patient, we will be patient, but there is an end to patience, and . those who play politics by hiding behind the protesters should first . learn what politics means,' Erdogan said, in one of his most strongly . worded speeches since the troubles began. Erdogan . did not specify who he thought was 'hiding behind the protesters'; but . one of his proudest achievements has been in combating a conservative . secularist establishment, especially an army that had toppled four . governments in four decades. Moving in: A policeman gestures to a water truck at Kizilay Square in central Ankara . Turbulent time: Riot policemen chase protesters at Kizilay Square in central Ankara . Cause: The nationwide unrest first erupted on May 31 with a tough police crackdown on a campaign to save Istanbul's Gezi Park from demolition . Injured: A beaten and shocked demonstrator is helped by other protesters after being confronted by riot police on Kizilay square . Troubled: Riot policemen chase protesters at Kizilay Square in central Ankara . Erdogan, who critics say has become authoritarian after three election victories in a row, compared the troubles with a confrontation with the army that became known as the 'e-Coup'. 'Today, we are exactly where we were on April 27, 2007.' On that date, the army issued a memorandum on its website denouncing plans to have Abdullah Gul, co-founder with Erdogan of the AK Party, appointed as president. The move would give AKP broad control over the state apparatus and the generals suggested they could act to stop it in defence of secularism. Erdogan's government had been expected, like others before it, to bow to the will of the military. But it faced down the army, chided it publicly for its intervention and went ahead with Gul's appointment. Camping out: Protesters spend their night at Taksim's Gezi park in Istanbul . Control: People sleep at Taksim Square - the protestors have now seized control of a large part of the area . It was a definitive moment in relations with the military, many of whose top generals have since been jailed after investigation of alleged coup plots against Erdogan. The Ergenekon plot had hinged on stirring widespread protests throughout Turkey and public disorder, followed then by bombings and assassinations that would clear the way for an army takeover to restore order. Erdogan clearly feels there are potentially powerful forces still ranged against him. Underscoring the drama of the moment, Erdogan, who denies Islamist ambitions for Turkey, made reference to two of his political models - former prime minister Adnan Menderes, hanged after a 1960 coup, and Turgut Ozal, a reforming president who some believe was poisoned to death. 'My beloved brothers, we're walking towards a better Turkey. Don't allow those who attempt to plant divisive seeds to do so,' Erdogan said at another speech in the southern city of Adana on Sunday, from atop of a bus emblazoned with his picture and the AK Party's slogan, 'Big Country, Big Power'. Meanwhile, a Turkish-American photographer has issued pictures from last week's protests in Istanbul on Facebook. Charles Emir Richards' pictures are accompanied by the message: 'You don’t need my permission to share the photos. 'I think it is especially important that people outside of Turkey share them to let it be known what is going on here.'

"James Dyson's vacuums may have conquered living rooms up and down the country, but the inventor is hoping to expand his empire. The London-based designer is putting his efforts into designing a giant vacuum cleaner to be used on rivers. Dyson envisions creating a device named the Recyclone barge, which uses the same cyclone technology as Dyson vacuum cleaners. James Dyson envisions using a device he has named the M.V. Recyclone barge, which uses the same cyclone technology as Dyson vacuum cleaners. The barge would trap plastic floating on the river's surface . The barge would trap plastic floating on the river's surface using large nets, pick it up using a suction system and then separate it for processing. 'By skimming a highly concentrated flow of larger sized plastics in polluted rivers, the M.V. Recyclone would effectively mine a major source of the pollution before it reached the sea,' Dyson told Ben Schiller at FastCoExist. 'Large skim nets unfurl from the rollers at its stern and are anchored on each side of the river. Hydraulic winches wind them in and out.' The nets then face upstream and skim the surface of the river for floating debris. The barge design has large nets on its front-end that trap plastic floating on the surface of a river. A suction system then pulls in the waste, where the plastic is separated, shredded and then sent for processing . Dyson explains that the plastic waste is shredded on board, and different grades of plastic are separated by a huge cyclone. The idea was sketched out for Time, and Dyson said he originally wanted the machine to be fixed at different points along a river. He claims that the amount of plastic debris in the oceans has grown a hundredfold in the past 40 years, and that much of this isn't biodegradable. As well as the increased waste, in the past 30 years, plastic production has increased by a 500 per cent. The entrepreneur believes plastic it in rivers before it heads to the ocean may be a solution to cleaning up the planet. The Recyclone barge has not yet been prototyped or tested, but Dyson said he is convinced it can work. Charles J. Moore, a U.S. merchant marine captain said he is 'utterly shocked' at the massive increase in plastic litter . Plastic. It's one of the most pernicious threats to the future of our planet. We all use it - it's part of our daily lives and has been for 50 years or more. Although plastic seems innocuous enough, your discarded coffee cup or plastic bag may be slowly killing life in the world's oceans - and, in the process, threatening our own existence on Earth. In a disturbing report, one of the world's leading experts sounds an urgent alarm on the state of our oceans. Charles J. Moore, a U.S. merchant marine captain and founder of the Algalita Marine Research Institute in Long Beach, California, says he is 'utterly shocked' at the massive increase in plastic litter found floating on the sea's surface in the past five years. He suggests it is a greater threat than climate change, adding: 'It's choking our future in ways that most of us are barely aware.' In the past 30 years, plastic production has increased by an astonishing 500 per cent. Once it was a by-product of petrochemical refining. Now it has become an integral element in human existence. Captain Moore and his team estimated that, in just three days' sampling, 2.3 billion pieces of plastic - from polystyrene foam to tiny pellets - had flowed from the urban centres of Southern California into its coastal waters .","James Dyson has designed a device named the Recyclone barge .

"Brown Ideye has praised his ‘mentor’ Kanu for helping him through a difficult start to his West Bromwich Albion career, and now wants to replicate his fellow Nigerian’s Wembley record. Ideye produced his best display since moving to The Hawthorns last summer by grabbing a brace and setting up Saido Berahino in the 4-0 demolition of West Ham. The club-record £10million signing said: ‘In Nigeria, Kanu is one of the big players who everybody looks up to, so I am happy that we talk. He calls me sometimes and I get advice from him because he played here, too. He tells me to keep working hard and things will turn out to be good for me.

"UKIP leader has vowed to stand down as leader if the party fails to breakthrough in next year's election . Nigel Farage has vowed to resign as party leader if UKIP fails to achieve a general election breakthrough next year. The UKIP leader said there was ‘not one ounce of complacency from me’ after he was selected last night to stand in the South Thanet seat for UKIP at next year's general election. His nomination was overshadowed by Boris Johnson’s decision to throw his hat into the ring to be the next MP for Uxbridge in west London. But Mr Farage said he confident that the Tories would lose votes to UKIP at the next election. He said: ‘I'm not pretending for one moment that it's going to be easy, but Ukip is offering something different and distinctive. ‘If we'd failed in the European elections I would have stood down, if we fail next year the party will pick someone better than me, but do you know what? That ain't going to happen.’ Mr Farage meanwhile told The Telegraph that Mr Johnson will be a ‘problem’ for the Tories after the next election. He said: ‘He [Boris] will be a problem for the Conservatives. He will appeal to the Tory grassroots, and have that little certain something that Mr Cameron appears to be struggling with.’ Mr Farage added: ‘While Boris on a good day sounds fairly Eurosceptic, and says that we must do this, that, and the other, the reality is that this is the same Boris who advocated an amnesty for all of the illegal immigrants in London a Boris who on a tour of India last year said EU membership was vital to the British economy. ‘So yes, Boris Johnson is engaging, people like him, but in policy terms, certainly at the moment, he’s a long way from the position that our voters are really looking for.’ He said: ‘Ukip will be a force in the House of Commons next year and if we get this right we may find ourselves in a hung parliament holding the balance of power.’ Leaked polling suggested that UKIP will target seats on the east and south coast of England held by Tory MPs, including three government ministers. The revelation reignited fears among the Conservatives that a strong UKIP performance could split right-wing voters and help Ed Miliband into power. However, speaking after his selection, Mr Farage said that his party will target Labour too: ‘Somebody once said I was David Cameron's worst nightmare. Well that's not true, I want to be Ed Miliband's worst nightmare too. This idea that Ukip voters are all ex Tories is baloney.’ London Mayor Boris Johnson will be used by the Tories to undermine the appeal of Nigel Farage and UKIP in the next election . Mr Farage’s comments come as polls showed more voters welcome the return of Mr Johnson to Parliament than the prospect of UKIP winning seats next year. A survey by YouGov has found 57 per cent of the public believes the London mayor’s decision to return to Parliament is ‘good thing’. Two thirds also believe it is likely that he will one day lead the Conservative party. By contrast, just 33 per cent think Mr Farage's candidature for Ukip in South Thanet is a positive thing, versus 54 per cent who think the opposite.","UKIP leader said there was 'not one ounce of complacency from me'

"'Confined': Valerie Trierweiler, partner of French President Francois Hollande, pictured in September last year. She remains in the care of a Paris hospital . Francois Hollande has finally gone to . visit his First Lady in hospital – a week after revelations about his . affair with an actress caused her to take ‘a pill too many’. The 59-year-old President of France slipped into see Valerie Trierweiler, 48, under conditions of great secrecy this morning. Today, more revelations about the length of the affair appeared in a magazine. Closer ran another article saying the president had been seeing Julie Gayet for three years. It . portrays Mr Hollande as a ruthless and calculating love cheat, who has . spent a large part of his time in power juggling two women. The . magazine adds that Miss Gayet met Mr Hollande in 2011 when Ségolène . Royal – the mother of Mr Hollande's four children and his partner for 30 . years – supported the actress's political activism. His . visit to the central Paris hospital came exactly a week after his . partner learned that Closer magazine was about to publish pictures of . him . leaving a love nest in the French capital. He . had been using it and at least two other properties to carry out a . relationship with Miss  Gayet, 41, since 2011, the magazine claims. Today, Mr Hollande’s aides also confirmed that he had seen Miss Trierweiler in person after spending the past week texting and calling her while she was being treated in hospital. The visit to see his partner came after his mistress phoned a Paris radio station and insisted: ‘I’m not pregnant’. Media . around the world had reported that Miss Gayet was four months pregnant. Miss Gayet, normally a high-profile film actress, has been in hiding ever since the pictures appeared in Closer. But Europe 1 radio station said she phoned them to deny the pregnancy claims, which first appeared on Twitter. The . scandal has caused outrage in France, where the Socialist politician’s . bungling of the economy has led to the unemployment rate spiralling, . along with the cost of living. The initial expose was broken last week after impeccably placed sources helped find the presidential love nest . close to the Elysee Palace, his official residence in Paris. Closer pinpoints at least two others. They . include another apartment to the west of Paris, and one in the Riviera . resort of Mougins, where left-wing Mr Hollande controversially owns . two private homes. In July . last year, the couple even enjoyed a break in Tulle, Mr Hollande's . constituency in central France, while Miss Trierweiler was on holiday by . herself in Greece and 'waiting for Mr Hollande to join her'. Mr . Hollande and Miss Gayet were seen wandering around the Tulle market . place where, in 2012, Miss Trierweiler had triumphantly kissed Mr . Hollande on his election as head of state. Mr Hollande and Miss Gayet were also seen in a restaurant in Mougin, and in one in central Paris. Photos . taken of them by passers-by, and by a concierge who worked in the Paris . office block where Miss Gayet has her production company office, were . regularly kept out the public eye, says Closer. Miss . Gayet last year also issued a statement through her lawyers denying . point blank that Mr Hollande was her lover – a claim which may come back . to haunt if she now takes over as the new first lady. Scroll down for video . On the campaign trail: Mr Hollande offers Miss Trierweiler a rose as they meet voters in Tulle in 2012. Closer magazine said that he began his 'turbulent romance' with actress Julie Gayet far back as 2011 . Before her husband's visit today, Miss Trierweiler contacted a radio station . in Paris to confirm that Mr Hollande had not visited her, . preferring to send ‘chocolates and flowers’ as doctors had forbidden him from seeing her. 'She . doesn't want people to think he is neglecting her at such a painful . time,' said a reporter for Paris radio station RTL who spoke to her. 'It . was the doctors who had forbidden the head of state to visit her, it is . a widespread practice in case of psychological distress. 'The patient is temporarily confined, kept at distance from their entourage to get better.' Miss . Trierweiler remains in the care of Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, where . she was admitted after first learning that Closer was to . reveal details of Mr Hollande's affair. 'She . is still very tired to the extent that she cannot stand up. Her blood . pressure and morale are low but she hopes to leave with her head held . high to and is prepared to fight, at least for her dignity,' said RTL. Glamorous: It is claimed that the French president and Miss Gayet, pictured last September, used two Paris flats for their regular trysts, one near the Elysee Palace and a second in the west of the French capital . Patrice . Biancone, Miss Trierweiler's spokesman, yesterday told The Associated . Press that she was making progress in her treatment. 'She has six days of rest behind her - that counts, after all,' he said, without elaborating. An . official in Mr Hollande's office, speaking on condition of anonymity . because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Miss Trierweiler had been . hospitalised for 'a crisis of nerves' after learning of the alleged . affair a day before Closer hit newsstands. That's . a different explanation to the one given by Miss Trierweiler to RTL, . and also to that given in the latest edition of Le Point, which claims . she took 'one pill too many' because the 'cold and ruthless' Mr Hollande . wanted to dump her. It is . claimed that while she did not want to commit suicide, she could not . deal with details of the president's confession of . his infidelity. 'She took a pill too many,' one source tells the Paris magazine. 'However, she never wanted to attempt suicide.' Miss Gayet with Mr Hollande's son Thomas at a 2102 rally: Closer reports that Mr Hollande met Miss Gayet in 2011 when Ségolène Royal ¿ mother of Mr Hollande's four children ¿ supported Miss Gayet's political activism . Le . Nouvel Observateur said . Mr Hollande wanted to split up with Miss Trierweiler, but her sudden . hospitalisation meant he could not. 'Francois Hollande had a dream but it only lasted the weekend,' said the left-wing weekly. Mr . Hollande had hoped, the magazine claimed, to get his official partner . to sign a joint announcement of their separation on Saturday. With a crucial conference before the world's press scheduled for Tuesday he thought this would be the 'least worst solution'. But by Sunday night, Mr Hollande abandoned the plan, because he feared it would make him look cruel and insensitive. Now . it is reported that Miss Trierweiler has 'not the slightest intention of packing her bags', . with the magazine stating: 'OK to forgive, but not OK to leave.' Awkward: A picture of Mr Hollande with the three women . in his life, including Segolène Royal, mother of his children (far . left), his alleged mistress Miss Gayet (in black, far right), and Miss . Trierweiler (shaking his hand) If . follows equally damaging claims that Miss Gayet boasted about her affair . with an 'older man in politics' just a few months after he came to . power. Despite . Mr Hollande's insistence that the scandal is a 'private matter' which . should be kept 'secret', Miss Gayet is the cover girl in the latest . edition of French Elle. In . it she is quoted as telling a friend 'more than a year ago' that she has . found an 'older man, very different from earlier boyfriends, who is in . politics.' This appears to confirm the claims that she and Mr Hollande were in the midst of their affair . within a few months of him being sworn in as French president in May . 2012. It was around this . time that Miss Trierweiler, a journalist for Paris Match magazine, began . to restyle herself as France's first lady. This . entitled her to five permanent staff, and numerous other perks, . including limousines, private jets and homes all over France. Options: Mr Hollande at a press conference where he said that he would make his mind up about who his first lady was by February 11, when he is due to be in Washington for a meeting with President Barack Obama . Even before making any official public comment, Miss Trierweiler made her . own views perfectly clear in the latest edition of Paris Match, which . runs a glowing profile of her. 'There . is no worse poison than indifference,' is a phrase widely being . attribute to her - suggesting that Mr Hollande has been distracted from . his relationship with her for a long time. Mr . Hollande told a Paris press conference on Tuesday that he would make . his mind up about who his first lady was by February 11th. This is the date that he is due to be in Washington for a meeting with President Barack Obama, and first lady Michelle Obama. In . words which may be considered extremely cruel by both women, Mr . Hollande confirmed that the presidential partner had 'no official . status' in France, and he was determined to keep costs down - whoever . was confirmed as first lady. Mr . Hollande is a lifelong bachelor, but has four children with former . presidential candidate Segolene Royal - a fellow Socialist. He and Miss Trierweiler have lived together since 2007.","Valerie Trierweiler has been in hospital since learning of the affair last week .

Instead he stayed and looks a man reborn. His goal here came on the hour mark and gave the first real glimpse as to why West Brom paid all that money for him last summer. Stephane Sessegnon slipped a pass down the line to Saido Berahino, who squared into the path of Ideye at the edge of the area. Ashley Williams flung his body to halt Ideye momentarily, but he managed to adjust his body and steer a finish into the far corner. It was his third Premier League goal of the season. Carry on like this and he threatens to be a success. With just one point separating West Brom from the relegation zone at kick-off, Tony Pulis’s claim on arrival at the Hawthorns that this would be his toughest management job has begun to ring true.

Saido Berahino emerged from the naughty chair to start up front alongside Brown Ideye, whose goal as a substitute at Turf Moor on Sunday salvaged a point for West Brom. The Nigeria striker, close to leaving West Brom in a cut price deal on deadline day, nearly scored again in the 12th minute. James Morrison’s corner was glanced on by Craig Dawson, forcing Lukasz Fabianski into a fine save. Ideye’s follow-up was blocked on the line.

"Darren Bent has questioned whether his continued absence from the Aston Villa team was a personal snub by manager Paul Lambert, as he looks to revive his career under Steve McClaren at Derby County. At 30, Bent says he still feels ‘as fresh as a daisy’ and is targeting promotion to the Premier League with his new club. But he also expressed confusion that he failed to get more than 78 minutes of Premier League football this season in a Villa side that has scored 12 times in all competitions — the lowest of any club in the top four divisions. Darren Bent (left) has left Aston Villa on loan after falling out of favour with manager Paul Lambert . ‘Some people have said, “Is it personal?” I don’t know to be honest,’ said Bent. ‘I spoke to Paul and he told me my chance was coming. He told me my attitude was first-class. Then the games came along and I wasn’t playing. ‘For whatever reason, he’s not used me — even though the team struggled to score, I’ve still not played. Is it deeper than what people say? It might be, who knows?’ Bent is set to make his Derby debut at Ipswich today, his first club, in a key clash between second and third in the Championship. It will be the first time he has returned to Portman Road as a player since leaving for Charlton in 2005. Striker Bent is pictured with his new Derby shirt and Rams manager Steve McClaren . The former England striker, who cost Villa a club-record £18million fee in January 2011, was a member of Lambert’s infamous ‘bomb squad’ sent to train apart two years ago as the Scot looked to trim costs. Bent, on wages of £65,000 per week, spent last season on loan at Fulham, scoring six times. But last summer saw a readjustment from Lambert after owner Randy Lerner admitted he was looking to sell the club. Assets were utilised. Alan Hutton came in from the cold to win a new contract, while Charles N’Zogbia features regularly. Bent, however, started only the League Cup defeat to Leyton Orient. Lambert watched Bent miss two chances and declined to give him more than 21 minutes in a game subsequently, preferring Gabby Agbonlahor and Andreas Weimann. Bent revealed his exasperation at missing out even when Christian Benteke was absent through injury and suspension. Bent is all smiles after penning a loan deal at Derby County until the end of the season . ‘I played in pre-season and did well, I had chats with numerous people and I thought I would play. For some reason I didn’t,’ said Bent. ‘Christian had done his injury and was out — and I still didn’t play! I don’t know what sort of option that made me. If Christian was fit, I was on the bench. If he wasn’t, I was on the bench.’ Bent eventually compelled Lambert to allow an emergency loan move to Brighton. ‘I don’t know any player with ambition who wants to sit there, week in week out, and not play,’ he said. ‘I thought, “I’ve had enough of this”.’ Despite the path his career has gone down these past couple of seasons, Bent insists he has ‘no regrets’ about penning his Villa deal, which expires this summer. He did, after all, realise his dream of becoming one of the Premier League’s centurion scorers. His top-flight tally stands at 106. Bent spent the last month on loan at the Amex, playing for Brighton and Hove Albion in the Championship . ‘When I was a kid coming through I just wanted to score 100 Premier League goals,’ Bent said. Featuring at Ipswich would bring his career full circle. Bent burst on to the scene in Suffolk as a 17-year-old in 2001. ‘They are the best days of your life when you’re in the youth team and parents are standing on the side wondering, “Is he going to come through?”. It’s a club I’ll always hold in high regard. I’d like to think I’d get a good reception.’ At his peak, Bent could claim to be one of the top Premier League strikers. Back in 2011, he was behind only Wayne Rooney and Didier Drogba for scoring over the previous six years. His Villa record of 25 goals in 53 starts bears scrutiny given the perception his time in Birmingham has been a failure. McClaren gave Bent two of his 13 England caps during his spell in charge of the Three Lions . McClaren acknowledged Bent’s career had ‘stalled’ but believes he can get a kick-start at the iPro Stadium. As national manager, the Derby head coach gave Bent two of his 13 England caps. He has been recruited to provide Chris Martin with support and competition. The aim is promotion, which might mean a permanent move for Bent. ‘It’s not a guarantee that I walk into the team because we have players doing well,’ he said. ‘I don’t think about shop windows, I just think about playing games.’","Darren Bent has joined Derby County on loan until the end of the season .

"Burglars who were spotted breaking into a shop were still able to spend three hours getting in and steal £5,000 worth of goods - after police were sent to the wrong village. The thieves were seen sawing a hole in a Spar door in Combe Martin, Devon, by a member of the public who immediately dialled 999. But instead of directing police to Combe Martin, emergency operators sent two squad cars five miles away to Illfracombe. 'Devastated': Owner Sue Sussex, 61, checked her CCTV and established the burglars spent three and a half hours at her premises in the raid last Friday morning at 1am . The bemused officers who found nothing happening are believed to have then returned to their headquarters, thinking it was a mix-up or a false alarm. Police blunder: Mrs Sussex said she had 'no idea why how they could make this sort of mistake' Meanwhile the burglars were able to get into the shop and made off with £5,400 worth of alcohol and cigarettes. Owner Sue Sussex, 61, checked her CCTV and established the burglars spent three and a half hours at her premises in the raid last Friday morning at 1am. She said: ‘They tried everything to get in but the shop is so secure it took them hours. The police would have literally caught them red-handed had they come to the right place. ‘I know the person who made the 999 call. He gave them all the correct information, the location and said it was happening right then. ‘I have no idea why how they could make this sort of mistake. It's such a drastic mistake. I'm absolutely devastated.’ A Devon and Cornwall Constabulary spokesman told MailOnline: 'A formal complaint has been received about this matter and as is usual in these cases we are unfortunately able to make any comment until this complaint has been dealt with. 'I can however confirm that inquiries have now begun in relation to the complaint and officers from the professional standards department will endeavour to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.'","Thieves were seen sawing hole in a Spar door in Combe Martin, Devon .

"It seems even extra-terrestrials retire to Florida. Residents of a Naples condo building swear that a UFO came to Earth to check out the swimming pool and stayed for 30 minutes Monday night. Security guard Debralee Thomas says she was monitoring the surveillance camera feeds when she noticed an unusual pair of lights that appeared to be hovering over the water. Scroll down for video . What is it? The video shows a disc-like object hovering over the pool before expanding and dipping into the waters, pulsing for half an hour . The lights appear to be illuminating a saucer-shaped object in the sky, residents claim . The strange object stuck around for about 30 minutes and then vanished without explanation . 'I realized that it was something that wasn't normal, so I was like ""Oh my, what is that,"" she told WBBH-TV. As a security guard who stares at video screens for hours, Thomas said she's seen some bizarre-looking things on her screens that turn out to be nothing at all. Bug that fly into the camera lenses, for instance, can offer a frightening spectacle for someone who doesn't know what they're looking at. But this was no bug. When she taped the encounter and showed the footage to her friends, they agreed that it indeed looked like something extraterrestrial. 'We watched it on tape and to be honest, . I was so grateful that it was there so I could say it was real...it . really happened,' Thomas said. Video evidence: Security officer Debralee Thomas was glad she caught the happening on tape . What's the interest? It's unknown why extra-terrestrials might be interested in this condo swimming pool in Naples . Thomas sent the video to the Mutual UFO Network, an Ohio-based UFO organization, for analysis. The leaders of the organization said they don't believe the video is a hoax. But, they can't say what the strange lights are. A wildlife biologist that examined the video for WBBH said the images could not have been an animal. Residents have been going into the condo's offices just to watch the video and see the event for themselves. 'I've . never seen anything like this,' said resident Curtis Kate. 'The . electrical charges coming from it, it's truly unbelievable.' The . mystery of the UFO remains unsolved for now, and Thomas is OK with that . just as long as it doesn't happen under her watch again.

"Nowhere in Germany signifies the rise of the far-Right more than Jamel in the economically-depressed east of the country. Dotted around the tiny village, which sits in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on the coast of the Baltic sea, are murals depicting Aryan families emblazoned with the words 'Free, Social, National', while targets showing charging soldiers are riddled with bullet holes. The vast majority of residents are neo-Nazis - and proud of it. There have been reports of pro-Hitler parties here during the summer where attendees chant 'Heil' around a bonfire. 'Their aim? A nationalist upbringing outside the mainstream,' said German magazine Der Spiegel in a report on the rising tide of neo-Nazism. A plaque attached to the boulder at the entrance to the village reads 'Village of Jamel - free, social, national'. According to media reports the hamlet of Jamel has been nearly entirely settled by Neo-Nazis . Chilling: A human-shaped target, riddled with holes, rests against a tree in Jamel . Jamel is close to the HQ of the German National Democratic Party (NPD), a far-Right organisation which won six per cent of votes in local elections and has five MPs in the regional parliament. The party says it rejects violence, but two years ago Sven Krueger, one of the men who first encouraged neo-Nazis to move to Jamel and an elected representative of the NPD, was jailed for four years for possession of a machine gun and a handgun. Stefan Koester, a regional MP for the NPD, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Many people want a different kind of politics. A politics which is social, family-friendly. 'Many of the occupants have their own views, and don't want to pretend what views they have.' The few residents who don't share their extremist views are reportedly subject to harassment and vandalism. Extremist: A sign of the far-Right NPD reading 'We keep our word' is fixed to the side of a container . Hound: A guard dog stands behind a fence in Jamel. The residents use rottweilers to warn off outsiders . The village is a troubling reminder for a country currently bracing itself for the shocking trial of a neo-Nazi accused of helping to murder eight men of Turkish extraction. Beate Zschaepe, 38, from Jena in east Germany, has been implicated in the shootings carried out by the National Socialist Underground, a neo-Nazi cell. She is charged with complicity in the shooting of the eight men, as well as a Greek and a German policewoman, in towns across Germany between 2000 and 2007, as well as two bombings in immigrant areas of Cologne and 15 bank robberies. The case is expected to expose grievous police and intelligence failings in allowing the NSU cell – comprising Zschaepe and her two lovers – to allegedly operate for so long, especially as they were under covert surveillance for much of the time that the murders were under way. The offices of the NPD party in Grevesmuehlen. Far-right extremist Sven Krueger has his offices there and lives in Jamel. The writing in red states: 'Better dead than slaves' There is a feeling in Germany that the . authorities did not take the murders seriously because the victims were . foreigners and that the country has been ‘blinded’ to the threat of violent neo-Nazism. The cell imploded after a botched bank robbery in November 2011, 13 years after they went underground to live from the proceeds of similar heists across the country. Her male accomplices, Uwe Mundlos and Uwe Boehnhardt, both died – Mundlos shot Boehnhardt before turning the gun on himself. German authorities are becoming increasingly concerned with the rise of the far-Right in Germany. Government figures say there more than 17,000 crimes last year were attributed to the Far Right, 842 of which were violent. Accused: Beate Zschaepe, a member of the neo-Nazi group National Socialist Underground before the start of her trial in Munich . There are an estimated 22,000 extremists and nearly half are estimated to be violent by security services. Germany also has a number of summer camps and special schools brainwashing youngsters into worshipping a movement that killed six million Jews in the Holocaust. A raid in 2011 on one camp turned up jigsaw puzzles showing Germany's pre-Second World War borders and colouring books where children were encouraged to crayon in the moustache of Hitler. Government officials say that 'several thousand' households in Germany are now raising their children to admire the Nazis. Worry: There is increasing concern that German children are being brainwashed by neo-Nazis who send them on Hitler-worshipping summer camps, much like those experienced by the Hitler Youth .","Jamel in east Germany is almost exclusively populated by neo-Nazis .

"Paul Lambert has fined teenage winger Jack Grealish for posting a message on Twitter reading: ‘Can’t wait to be happy playing football again.’ The 19-year-old included a photograph of himself smiling while on loan at Notts County last season, where he scored five times in 38 games. Lambert said he was ‘not happy’ with the social media statement, which was interpreted by some fans as suggesting his frustration at a lack of game time. The Villa manager had a meeting with Grealish, who has deleted the tweet, and instructed him to focus on football in no uncertain terms. Jack Grealish has been fined by Aston Villa for suggesting he is unhappy with his current situation at the club . Grealish hinted he was keen on sealing a move away from Villa Park in order to play regular football . Grealish, one of the country’s most promising talents, penned a new four-year deal last October as Premier League clubs circled his signature, but he has appeared infrequently since. He has started Villa’s two cup games and made it off the bench in nine Premier League matches – but has been left out of Villa’s last two squads as Lambert leans towards experience. A host of Championship clubs are believed to be interested in taking Grealish on loan this window, but with Lambert’s move for Scott Sinclair ‘dead’ he does not wish to lose an option out wide. He has fielded no enquiries for Grealish, who is recovering from a virus and may play some part in the FA Cup match against Bournemouth. Paul Lambert has told Grealish to concentrate on his football as nobody cares if he is 'boiling an egg' ‘I think he should stay off tweeting, that’s what I think,’ said Lambert. ‘I wasn’t happy. I told him to concentrate on football. I don’t think anybody needs to know he’s boiling an egg, you know. Personally nobody’s asked me for Jack (on loan).’ Lambert believes Carles Gil may be his only January signing as he battles to improve Villa’s dreadful scoring record of just 12 goals all season. ‘At the minute it doesn’t look like more additions,’ said Lambert. ‘Scott Sinclair one is dead anyway. Not going to go anywhere.’ Lambert insists he would love an FA Cup run to invigorate his team. He said: ‘I got pilloried last year. The FA Cup is vital to this football club and we will go and try and win it. We have to have a cup run. ‘If we can get a good cup run it is then in the memory for everyone. We would love to go to Wembley. We will go as strong as we can to win the game. I have rarely picked a weakened team.’","Jack Grealish's tweet suggested he was not happy at Aston Villa .

"A Saudi sheikh has warned women that driving could affect their ovaries and pelvises. Women are currently banned from driving in Saudi Arabia and many have protested against the statute. However, Sheikh Salah al-Luhaydan has warned them that their health could be at risk if they get behind the wheel. Scroll down for video . A sheikh has warned Saudi women - who are currently not allowed to drive in the country - that getting behind the wheel could damage their ovaries and pelvis . Sheikh Salah al-Luhaydan also claimed children of women drivers are born with 'disorders of varying degrees' He told Saudi news website sabq.org: '[Driving] could have a reverse physiological impact. 'Physiological science and functional medicine studied this side [and found] that it automatically affects ovaries and rolls up the pelvis. 'This is why we find for women who continuously drive cars their children are born with clinical disorders of varying degrees.' The comments come two years after a ‘scientific’ report claimed that relaxing the ban would also see more Saudis - both men and women - turn to homosexuality and pornography. The startling conclusions were drawn in 2011 at the Majlis al-Ifta’ al-A’ala, Saudi Arabia’s highest religious council, working in conjunction with Kamal Subhi, a former professor at the King Fahd University. In 2011 a report claimed that relaxing the ban on women driving would also see more Saudis - both men and women - turn to homosexuality and pornography . Their report assessed the possible impact of repealing the ban in Saudi Arabia, the only country in the world where women are not allowed behind the wheel. It was delivered to all 150 members of the Shura Council, the country’s legislative body. The report warned that allowing women to drive would ‘provoke a surge in prostitution, pornography, homosexuality and divorce’. Within ten years of the ban being lifted, the report’s authors claimed, there would be ‘no more virgins’ in the Islamic kingdom. And it pointed out ‘moral decline’ could already be seen in other Muslim countries where women are allowed to drive. Several women protestors have defied the law and got behind the wheel, with many facing punishment as a consequence . In the report Professor Subhi described sitting in a coffee shop in an unnamed Arab state. ‘All the women were looking at me,’ he wrote. ‘One made a gesture that made it clear she was available... this is what happens when women are allowed to drive.’ Women in Saudi Arabia have not been permitted to drive since the establishment of the state in 1932. Hundreds of women have protested against the law - with several facing punishment after the got behind the wheel. Gender roles in Saudi society come from Sharia - Islamic law - and tribal culture. The law is followed strictly throughout the country, but many issues regarding gender equality revolve around culture, not religion. In 2009 the World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Report ranked Saudi Arabia 130th out of 134 countries for gender parity. Under Saudi law, all females must have a male guardian, typically a father, brother or husband who has rights over many aspects of the woman's life. Women were previously forbidden from voting or being elected to political office, but women will be able to vote and run in the 2015 local elections, as well as be appointed to the Consultative Assembly. Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world that prohibits women from driving. Shaima Jastaniya, 34, was sentenced to 10 lashes with a whip after being caught driving in Jeddah in 2011. Another woman was stopped by a police patrol after driving six miles to collect her husband near their home in the town of Buraida. As her 'legal guardian' her husband had to sign a declaration that he would not let his wife drive again. One woman took to the roads for four days non-stop in an act of frustrated defiance. Housewife and mother Najla al-Hariri drove around the streets of the Red Sea city of Jeddah back in 2011 'to defend her belief that Saudi women should be allowed to drive.' She said: 'I don't fear being arrested because I am setting an example that my daughter and her friends are proud of.' She added that it was ridiculous she is not allowed to drive in her own country, despite the fact that she is an experienced driver, having driven for five years in Egypt and another five years in Lebanon. At the time the mother was also offering driving lessons to women. However, the protests sometimes end in tragedy. A young woman driver and three of her passengers were killed after she defied the kingdom’s ban on women motorists. The woman, who was in her 20s, had been driving a 4X4 with nine girlfriends on Saturday night in the capital, Riyadh, in an open area often used by young men in car races. Four of the women were killed when the vehicle overturned. The remaining six were injured and taken to a nearby hospital.","Sheikh Salah al-Luhaydan said if woman drove they would damage their pelvis and their children could suffer 'clinical disorders'

"This year I will be hosting Christmas lunch for ten people and, to make the occasion memorable, I have hit on a genius idea. Instead of using boring old plates I shall serve the roast turkey on dustbin lids. This will be followed by plum pudding presented in a baseball glove, all washed down with fine wines sucked from a woolly sock. How does that sound to you? Ridiculous and totally unappealing, by any chance? Chips served in a plant pot - trendy or bizarre? Fortunately for my guests, I’m only joking. But if I did go ahead I would only be following the latest pretentious restaurant-industry trend for dishing up meals on anything other than crockery. Eating out can be something of a gamble anyway, but one thing you could be sure of until fairly recently was that your meal would arrive on a plate. Not any more. If you dine at a trendy gourmet burger chain, a gastropub or an independent bistro, there is a high risk of your food being served on something else entirely. In the past couple of years I’ve eaten steak from a roof tile, chicken off a brick, chips in a flower pot and rhubarb crumble and custard out of a dog bowl. I’ve also sipped cocktails from jam jars and coffee from milk bottles, and used salt and pepper taken from egg cups, candle holders and ashtrays. The best was when I visited a friend in York and we ate at The Star Inn The City, where the bread was served in a flat cap, accompanied by butter slapped on a bit of old tree stump. Seeing our faces, the maître d’ assured us that the cap had never been on a head and the tree stumps were perfectly hygienic. He also admitted that, earlier in the day, an American tourist had threatened to walk out. I wouldn’t have gone that far, because the food was delicious and the staff were lovely. But I can see how picturing your bread and butter with a side order of dandruff and Dutch Elm disease could be an appetite-killer. It’s a trend that shows no sign of abating, even though most people loathe it. So what’s it all about? Food writer and author of The Kitchen Magpie James Steen says: ‘A lot of the time it’s down to the insecurity of the chefs — and because they’re not the ones trying to cut up meat on a slate or having their chips go cold because they’re in a wire basket.’ Scroll down for video . As far as I’m concerned, a lot of the blame lies with Jamie Oliver. In his books he often suggests plonking a saucepan in mid-table and letting guests feed from it like pigs at a trough. Anyone who has been to a Jamie’s Italian will have sat there with the table groaning under all the planks, floor tiles, fish bowls, tin buckets and glass jars their food will come in or on. A delicious meal served up on a dustbin lid makes it less appealing says Claudia Connell . And maybe Heston Blumenthal should take a share of the responsibility. It’s thanks to him that so many restaurants now come with a ‘concept’, when the only concept most diners require is to choose a meal and have someone cook it for them. Yet Mad O’Rourke’s Pie Factory in Dudley serves up its mixed grill on a garden shovel — and anybody who doesn’t want to listen to seagulls cries, then eat their fish and chips out of a giant shell, is regarded as a philistine. Once, I was presented with a burger on a mini-blackboard. The sauce was running everywhere, so I asked the waiter if I could have it on a plate instead. Very snootily, he replied: ‘I’m sorry madam but chef is not working with plates at this current time.’ Overseas it’s even worse. There is an Asian restaurant in New York where guests eat out of toilet bowls, and another where pizza is served on a hubcap. Mad O’Rourke’s Pie Factory in Dudley serves up its mixed grill on a garden shovel . Then there is Arzak, in San Sebastian, Spain, which has three Michelin stars. They like to dish up £100-a-head grub on iPads. Back in York, what does The Starr Inn The City have to say? ‘It’s a bit of fun,’ manager Sam Wheatley tells me. ‘We pride ourselves on serving locally sourced food and the flat cap is a cheeky nod to that. More people love it than hate it.’ At a time when many restaurants are struggling to survive, it’s understandable that they want to find ways to stand out from the crowd. But surely the best way is to serve up tasty food at fair prices.","The latest  trend is for dishing up meals on anything other than crockery .

However, his great-granddaughter Katharina Wagner has now said she will pass over private letters and correspondence belonging to her father to historians to be examined. Ms Wagner's father, Wolfgang Wagner, was a former member of the Hitler Youth as well as a  Wehrmacht soldier who ran the Bayreuth festival between 1951 to 2008. Twelve Jewish musicians who performed at the Wagner festival at Bayreuth were murdered by the Nazis. Ms Wagner, who is now co-director of the festival with her sister, told Der Tagesspiegal newspaper: 'He had a very negative to the Nazi regime and was happy that he was injured as a young man, and therefore got sent back from the front and survived. 'He always said we can be very happy that we lost the war.' But a well-known historian has accused the Wagner family of not being transparent. Hannes Heer, who created an exhibition about crimes of the Wehrmacht, said Ms Wagner did not allow him to look at her father's estate. She said it had not been possible at the time. But speaking to the The Daily Telegraph, Mr Heer said: 'The facts must come out about the negative role of Richard Wagner. 'Then you can approach the great artist Wagner with a clear conscience.' Wolfgang's mother, Winifred Marjorie Williams, was born in Hastings and married Wagner's son Siegfried. Documents between her and Hitler have been discovered by a relative. This photograph was taken during the summer of 1937 shows German Chancellor Adolf Hitler  talking with Winifred Wagner (centre) and her two sons Wolfgang and Wieland in Bayreuth . Last year a feud broke out between members of the Wagner opera family. Born in Germany on May 22, 1813, Richard Wagner went on to become one of the world's most influential and controversial composers. He is famous his epic operas which made him a favourite of Adolf Hitler. There is evidence that Wagner's music was played at the Dachau concentration camp to 'reeducate' the prisoners. He died of a heart attack in Venice on February 13, 1883. Katharina Wagner said she wanted family members to turn over every document they have in a bid to exorcise the ghosts of the Third Reich - including 'potentially explosive' letters penned by Hitler to Winifred Wagner, the Englishwoman who became head of the family in wartime. Hitler considered Richard Wagner, who died in 1883, as the greatest ever German composer. Because he and the late maestro both . shared a visceral hatred of the Jews, the music of Wagner literally . became the theme tunes of the regime. Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries was used to accompany footage of air attacks. The . Bayreuth Festival in his honour is the hottest ticket in the opera . world with a ten year delay for tickets and is attended by European . leaders. But because of . Wagner's hatred of the Jews - and his family's later love affair with . the Nazis - his music is banned to this day in Israel. Katharina Wagner hopes a reckoning with a dark past will lead to a rehabilitation of her great grandfather and his works. In October 2010 she sought to end a . post-1945 boycott of Wagner's music in Israel by inviting the Israel . Chamber Orchestra to play a concert in July 2011 at the Bayreuth town . hall. But her own visit to Israel was canceled after hostility from . Holocaust survivors. Katharina has previously spoken of her hopes of a 'cooperative working relationship' with members of her family - but has also threatened to go further in seeking court action to get her and other family members to open up about the past if they refuse to do so.

"Tim Sherwood admitted this defeat in his first match as Aston Villa manager was one of the lowest moments of his career, but insisted his current group of players will escape relegation. The contrast with Sherwood’s buoyancy at his unveiling last Monday could not have been starker. Victor Moses’s penalty in the third minute past the 90 sapped the joy from Villa Park, on a day that became one of Sherwood’s worst. ‘Yeah, it’s low, I’m low,’ he said. Stoke's late winner saw Tim Sherwood lose his first game in charge of the goal-shy home side at Villa Park . Victor Moses celebrates his penalty that gave Stoke  a late winner at Villa Park as Sherwood lost his first game . The match was heading for a draw until Ron Vlaar made the miscalculation that saw Villa slip to a sixth successive Premier League defeat. He brought down Moses in the area and received a red card for his troubles. So the bounce expected by owner Randy Lerner in appointing Sherwood failed to materialise. Villa actually dropped a place. Their next games, against Newcastle, West Bromwich, Sunderland and Swansea, must yield points. ‘I want them to play a bit more relaxed in the final third, get on the ball and go and express themselves,’ said Sherwood. ‘I think we’ve got a group who are capable of doing that. It’s about delivering on match day. ‘We know we need to improve and we need to start improving very quickly.’ Scott Sinclair put Aston Villa ahead at Villa Park in new manager Sherwood's official first game in charge . Mame Biram Diouf equalised for Stoke and is congratulated by  Moses jumping on the forward's back . Scott Sinclair did provide cause for optimism. His performance on the left wing was full of energy and his header to open the scoring was dispatched like a striker who has been banging in goals all season. Sinclair said the squad exchanged heated words in the dressing room. ‘They came in shouting and there was all the stuff you think of when players are angry after conceding in the last minute,’ he said. Mark Hughes was delighted by Stoke’s fifth away win, aided by Mame Biram Diouf’s equaliser just before half-time. He said Sherwood would get it right. ‘I think they have made a good appointment in Tim. He is a positive guy and that’s what they need,’ he said.","Aston Villa lost 2-1 against Stoke City in the Premier League on Saturday .

"Finnish reindeer herders have found a new way of keeping their livestock from being hit by cars - they cover their horns in fluorescent dye. The herders are trying out different types of reflective paints in the hope of finding a shade which can resist the harsh climate.

"Alexander the Great built a legendary empire before his untimely - and mysterious - death at the age of just 32 in 323 BC. Some historians argued was death was due to natural causes, while others maintained he was secretly murdered at a celebratory banquet. Now, an Otago University scientist may have unraveled the case some 2000 years later. National Poisons Centre toxicologist Dr Leo Schep thinks the culprit could be poisonous wine made from an innocuous-looking plant, according to a report in  the New Zealand Herald. Death by wine? New findings, which are ten years in the making, suggest that Alexander the Great died from drinking wine that was tainted with a seemingly innocuous plant called hellebore . Pretty but deadly: Veratrum album, known as white hellebore, is a plant that, once fermented properly, can be lethal . Dr Schep, who has been researching the toxicological evidence for a decade, said some of the poisoning theories - including arsenic and strychnine - were not plausible. Death would have come far too fast, he said. His research, co-authored by Otago University classics expert Dr Pat Wheatley and published in the medical journal Clinical Toxicology, found the most plausible culprit was Veratrum album, known as white hellebore. The white-flowered plant, which can be fermented into a poisonous wine, was well-known to the Greeks as a herbal treatment for inducing vomiting. Crucially, it could have accounted for the 12 torturous days that Alexander took to die, speechless and unable to walk. The new theory behind the death of Alexander the Great started here, at the University of Otago in New Zealand . Other suggested poisons - including hemlock, aconite, wormwood, henbane and autumn crocus - would likely have killed him far more quickly. Dr Schep began looking into the mystery in 2003 when he was approached by a company working on a BBC documentary. 'They asked me to look into it for them and I said, 'Oh yeah, I'll give it a go, I like a challenge' - thinking I wasn't going to find anything,' he said. 'And to my utter surprise, and their surprise, we found something that could fit the bill.' Dr Schep's theory was that Veratrum album could have been fermented as a wine that was given to the leader. Dr Leo Schep, toxicologist at the National Poisons Centre and scientist at the Otago University in New Zealand, thinks a poisonous wine made from a plant may have killed Alexander the Great . It would have tasted 'very bitter' but it could have been sweetened - and Alexander was likely to have been very drunk at the banquet. But whether Alexander was poisoned is still a mystery. We'll never know really,' Dr Schep concluded.","Alexander the Great died in 323 BC at the age of 32 .

"An elderly truck driver who killed a 43-year-old woman and injured her mother as they walked on a New York street will not face criminal charges. Police said James McDonald, 86, veered across East Genesee St in Syracuse, hitting college professor Jennifer Cook and her mother, Barbara Cook, in March. Jennifer Cook died in a nearby hospital, while her 72-year-old mother suffered critical injuries but was later released. McDonald, however, has not been charged over the death. He was let off with a ticket for passing a red light and failing to keep right, Syracuse Police Sergeant Gary Bulinski told Syracuse.com. Tragic: Rhode Island College professor Jennifer Cook (pictured left and right) was killed when driver James McDonald plowed his truck into her in March . Loving family: Jennifer Cook (third from left, back row) is survived by her spouse, Moira Collins (fourth from right, back row) who is also a professor . Sgt Bulinksi said police actively investigated the crash and neither McDonald's age or the weather seemed to be factors. He said McDonald, from Chittenago, held a valid driver's license and was not involved in recent accidents. The road was also clear. McDonald refused to comment when contacted by Syracuse.com. 'I don't care to talk about it, sorry,' he said before hanging up. The tragic incident unfolded on March 14 when Jennifer Cook and her mother were walking to a restaurant for lunch after a doctor's visit about 1.15pm. Cook, a Rhode Island College English professor, was in Central New York to visit her dying 93-year-old father, Frank Cook. Syracuse.com reported that McDonald plowed into the Cooks after swerving to avoid rear-ending a stationary vehicle ahead of him. The women were rushed to Upstate University Hospital where Jennifer Cook, from Rhode Island, died from her injuries. Her father Frank Cook died two weeks later. Scene: Police said James McDonald, 86, veered across the 900 block of East Genesee Street in Syracuse (pictured), near Phoebe's restaurant, hitting two pedestrians . Jennifer Cook's tragic death shocked and saddened students and staff at Rhode Island College, where she'd worked since 2004. 'Dr. Jennifer Cook was a well-liked and well-respected member of the English department and of the educational studies department,' college president Nancy Carriulo said in a statement, according to Providence Journal. 'We all thought that Jen, who was tenured a few years ago, had a long career ahead of her at Rhode Island College.' Cook, who received degrees from American University and the University of Massachusetts, was the executive director of the Rhode Island Writing Project which worked to train young teachers. 'She was a really extraordinary teacher. She had such an amazing impact on her students,' Ronald Pitt, vice president of academic affairs at RIC, told Providence Journal. 'It was an amazing thing to see her work.' English department chair, Daniel Scott, said Cook 'inspired and trained hundreds of students who are now teachers in Rhode Island and around the country'. Cook is survived by her spouse, Moira Collins, who is also a professor.","James McDonald, 86, plowed a pickup truck into Jennifer Cook and her mother Barbara Cook on a Syracuse road on March 14 .

"Fabian Delph believes he could have earned more money by switching clubs this summer but leaving Aston Villa for nothing ‘would not have sat right’ with him. The England midfielder admitted the prospect of moving to a team challenging for Europe had been tempting but insisted the pull of becoming a Villa hero swung the balance. He conceded his decision had shocked team-mates but argued he can make Roy Hodgson’s Euro 2016 squad playing regularly under Paul Lambert. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Fabian Delph: Delighted to sign a new contact with Aston Villa . Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph insisted that leaving the club for nothing ‘wouldn’t have sat right with me’ Delph poses with Aston Villa CEO Tom Fox having signed a four-and-a-half year deal with the Midlands club . He also revealed his close bond with owner Randy Lerner, who offered words of encouragement during a year with a serious knee injury, proved a factor. Delph surprised many by penning a four-and-a-half-year deal worth £55,000 per week despite interest from Liverpool and Tottenham, who he could have joined on a free this summer once his previous deal ran out. ‘I feel like I’ve been treated really good by the club. It wouldn’t have sat right with me leaving, especially on a free,’ said Delph. ‘Being on a free means financially I would have been better off. But I’m a kid from Bradford, brought up on a council estate. I am not money-driven. ‘I live a simple life. I love my family, and take care of them. If I can play week in, week out and feel like I’m still developing, I’m happy. ‘The lads are absolutely delighted. As soon as I told some of them they looked at me shocked to start with. Most people in my situation would be looking to move on. ‘They know what type of guy I am – I’m quite driven. They expected me to try to challenge for something that others clubs are challenging for. It would have been exciting. Delph, pictured against Switzerland, earned his first England cap in September whilst playing for Villa . ‘But I got into the England side by playing here and I’m sure I can stay in the England squad playing here. ‘I’ve got a lot of time for people at this club, even the cleaners. I love my team-mates. I see them as brothers. I’d run through a brick wall for them. ‘The chairman has been great. As a young boy, injured, for the guy who has invested money in me to call me saying, “Don’t worry you’ll come out the other end”, you can imagine what that meant to me. It was huge.’ Delph instructed his agent not to come to him with offers from clubs this month. ‘If I made the decision to leave Villa when I was out of contract, then conversations can start. Until then, there was no way I was going to be speaking to anybody. I told my agent to leave me alone as I want to focus on my football and getting myself fit.’ Delph did not elaborate on whether his contract contained a release clause. ‘I’m happy here and wanting to push on,’ he said. ‘If somebody did come in the future, put a bid in and it was right for the club I’m sure people would have a look at it. I’m here to stick it out.’ That includes providing Villa supporters with more to cheer than in recent years. An FA Cup run would help. ‘It would be absolutely terrific for the fans. I’ve been fighting relegation for three years. They have had to watch it. For them to have a bit of joy would be great.’","Fabian Delph has signed four-and-a-half year deal with Aston Villa .

"The Obamas have spent an estimated $2.5 million after Barack and the rest of his family took separate weekend breaks. President Obama spent Valentine's weekend in California, where he managed to squeeze in three rounds of golf at a California course owned by Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison. Meanwhile, his wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia flew to Aspen in Colorado for a skiing trip on board a separate presidential aircraft. President Obama pictured boarding Air Force One as after spending the weekend playing golf in California . As President Obama enjoyed the California sunshine, his wife's jet was spotted in Aspen, Colorado . However, President Obama did not look prepared for the heavy snow when he returned to Maryland, pictured . According to the White House, President Obama flew to San Francisco on Thursday afternoon where he had several events, before taking Saturday, Sunday and Monday off. He delivered a speech at a summit on cyber security before attending a round-table meeting with business leaders. His final official engagement of the weekend was a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee  at the home of venture capitalist Sandy Robinson. Guests paid $10,000 for dinner and a photograph with the president or $32,400 to co-chair the fundraiser. While President Obama was in California, his wife was in Aspen, Colorado, where she has spent several Presidents' Day holidays away from her husband. President Obama used his weekly television address to wish his wife a happy Valentine's Day. The trips come as it emerged Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha were reportedly jetting off to Japan in a few weeks. The Asahi Shimbun, reported that the mother and teen daughters will visit Tokyo and Kyoto in March but without the President who was in Japan last April. Last March, Mrs Obama and her girls visited China and have previously taken trips to Ireland and Germany. According to figures obtained by Judicial Watch, President Obama's VC-25A jet, better known as Air Force One, costs $228,288 per hour while it is in the air. President Obama, pictured on the course in 2013, has played 219 rounds of golf since he was elected . Michelle Obama, pictured in Aspen in 2014, has brought her daughters to Colorado for the past four years . It is estimated that the jet, which has a cruising speed of 575mph, spent approximately 10 hours in the air during its four-day trip to the West Coast, at a cost of $2,228,000. Previous golfing trips on Presidents' Day cost $50,000 in hotels and a further $16,000 in car rental. Mrs Obama's skiing trip in 2013 cost more than $81,000 according to figures released to Judicial Watch under the Freedom of Information Act. The earlier trip cost $13,000 in flights, $4,000 in car hire and a further $64,000 for renting an exclusive lodge. According to USA Today, President Obama played the Porcupine Creek Golf Course in Palm Springs, owned by Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison. The President had two days of engagements in northern California before playing three rounds of golf. He returned to Washington on Monday. The US Air Force has announced that the current pair of jets used to fly the president will be replaced by a pair of new Boeing 747-8 aircraft. Mr Obama has enjoyed 219 rounds of golf since he took office, according to a website that tracks the amount he plays. Mrs Obama's skiing trip is the fourth time she and her daughters visited the exclusive Colorado skiing resort. The visit was meant to be private, but visitors to the local airport spotted a private jet in presidential livery parked on the ramp.","President Barack Obama flew to California for a fundraiser and a speech .

"Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis has revealed that she terminated two pregnancies for medical reasons in the 1990s, including one where the fetus had developed a severe brain abnormality. In her new memoir Forgetting to Be Afraid, Davis writes that she had an abortion after an exam revealed that the brain of the fetus had developed in complete separation on the right and left sides. The book also describes ending an earlier ectopic pregnancy, in which an embryo implants outside the uterus. Scroll down for video . New revelations: Wendy Davis has admitted to having two abortions for medical reasons in the 1990s . Both pregnancies happened before Davis, a state senator from Fort Worth, began her political career, and after she was already a mother to two young girls, Amber and Dru. She writes that the ectopic pregnancy happened in 1994, and that terminating the pregnancy was considered medically necessary. Though such pregnancies generally aren't considered viable, and the mother's life could be in danger, Davis wrote that in Texas, it's ""technically considered an abortion, and doctors have to report it as such."" Bestseller: Davis' book will be released on Sept. 9 . Davis said she and her former husband, Jeff, wound up expecting another child in 1996 after they decided to stop taking birth-control measures. During her second trimester, Davis said she took a blood test that could determine chromosomal or neural defects, which doctors first told her didn't warrant concern. After a later exam revealed the brain defect, Davis said she sought opinions from multiple doctors, who told her the baby would be deaf, blind and in a permanent vegetative state if she survived delivery. 'I could feel her little body tremble violently, as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and I knew then what I needed to do,' Davis writes. 'She was suffering.' She goes on to say that an 'indescribable blackness followed' the pregnancy, and that the loss left her forever changed. Family: Davis (second from left) seen here with daughters Dru (left) and Amber (second from right), and boyfriend Will Wynn (right) Davis catapulted to national stardom back in June of 2013 after her eleven-hour filibuster temporarily delayed passage of Senate Bill 5, which contained sweeping new abortion restrictions in the state of Texas. Despite her efforts, the Bill was eventually signed into law on July 18, 2013. At one point during the filibuster, Davis said she almost felt compelled to talk about her failed pregnancies, but said she knew it would overshadow her effort to block the bill. Success: Davis seen here after her 11-hour filibuster delayed passage of Texas Senate Bill 5 . Anti-abortion groups, including those that have attacked her candidacy, expressed sympathy for the tough choice Davis confronted with the second terminated pregnancy, but said they hoped all decisions end in choosing to continue a pregnancy. 'That's an incredibly difficult position for anyone to find themselves in. While our heart goes out for the decision she had to make, again, still the value of life is precious,' said Melissa Conway, spokesman for Texans Right to Life. Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, daughter of former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, said in a statement that she was grateful for Davis sharing her story, though 'no woman should have to justify her decision.' Davis is now running for governor against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott. Abbott spokesman Matt Hirsch did not return messages seeking comment.","In her new memoir Forgetting to Be Afraid, Davis says both procedures happened in the 1990s .

"Tim Sherwood and Jurgen Klinsmann have emerged as leading contenders for the Aston Villa vacancy as the struggling club begin their search for a successor to sacked Paul Lambert. Villa are understood to have made initial contact with Sherwood, the former Tottenham head coach, who is one of a small number of available managers with recent Premier League experience. Klinsmann, the current USA boss, is also under consideration with owner Randy Lerner a known fan of his work with the national team. Former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood could be the man to lift the mood and change results at Villa Park . Extricating the former Germany international from his role across the Atlantic will be highly difficult, however, with the 50-year-old enjoying his life in California and keen to take his adopted country to the 2018 World Cup. Chief executive Tom Fox was at Bodymoor Heath on Thursday compiling a list of suitable candidates, as concern grows over Villa’s Premier League future. The club hope a replacement for Lambert can be made before Stoke visit Villa Park in the Premier League on February 21. Sherwood has been in the running for two previous jobs this season but has failed to agree terms. He came close to landing the West Bromwich Albion position last summer only for wage demands to prove an issue, while he appeared set for Queens Park Rangers until the move fell apart after the interview stage. It is understood he would be interested by the vacancy at Villa. United States manager Jurgen Klinsmann is also being considered but is said to be happy living in America . Paul Lambert was sacked on Wednesday as Villa manager with the club in the relegation zone . Klinsmann is liked by Lerner and Fox, both Americans, and money would not be an issue in attempts to lure him to England. Klinsmann, though, turned down Tottenham before Mauricio Pochettino was appointed would need convincing. Glenn Hoddle is another name in the frame. Villa desperately need fresh impetus to lift the mood and generate an instant lift in results after their slide into the bottom three. Avoiding relegation to the Championship is of utmost important. But the club also want a manager who will commit to the long-term and help develop young players through the academy. Head of recruitment Paddy Reilly is assisting the search. It has emerged that Lambert twice invited Lerner to sack him before the Villa owner finally pulled the trigger after defeat to Hull. Lambert raised the issue with Lerner last summer and then earlier this season but was asked to continue in the role. Sherwood, pictured celebrating with Emmanuel Adebayor, has been linked with a number of top jobs . Lambert left Villa on a sour note after being informed of his sacking via a phone call from Fox on Wednesday afternoon. The 45-year-old is thought to be hurt he was not told face-to-face, as Fox’s omission from his statement issued via the LMA indicated. Lambert did thank Lerner and previous chief executive Paul Faulkner and insisted he understood fans’ frustrations at Villa’s malaise. ‘I always shared their view that the football club is too big not to be competing at the top end of the table. I hope that can happen,’ he said. The Scot vowed to be back, adding: ‘You never stop learning in football management. My time as Villa manager will prove hugely beneficial in the next stage of my managerial career.’ Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner wants a manager who can make an immediate impact on the squad .","Tim Sherwood is the bookmakers' favourite to take over at Aston Villa .

"A formal investigation has been launched into the sinking of HMS Bounty - which went down in 18ft-high waves off the coast of North Carolina during Hurricane Sandy. The probe will focus on the cause of the disaster on Monday - which claimed the life of at least one crew member, while the ship's captain, Robin Walbridge, is still missing. The search for Mr Walbridge, 63, of St Petersburg, Florida, has been suspended following an extensive three-day search by coast guard ships, helicopters and aircraft. Scroll down for video: .

Brave: Coast Guard officers winch a rescued Bounty crew member to safety from the stormy sea . 'Suspending . a search and rescue case is one of the hardest decisions we have to . make,' said Captain Doug Cameron, the chief of incident response for the . Coast Guard 5th District. The Coast Guard rescued 14 crew member after they abandoned ship in two life . rafts. Claudene Christian, . 42, was among those rescued, but she died. An investigating officer will now receive evidence and testimony using formal rules and procedures, to try to get to the bottom of what happened, the Houston Chronicle reports. In its prime: The Bounty was built as a replica of the original 1789 ship HMS Bounty and had been seen in several films . The investigation will consider whether . any failure of equipment or personnel contributed to Ms Christian's death. It will also determine if further investigation is needed. The probe  is expected to take several months. HMS Bounty was originally built for the 1962 film 'Mutiny on the Bounty' starring Marlon Brando, and featured in several other films over the years, including one of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies. Mr Walbridge was captain of the three-masted tall ship, which sank about 90 miles off Cape Hatteras. Claudene Christian, 42, was among those rescued by coast guards, but she died. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the Walbridge and Christian families,' Capt Cameron said. The search persisted for days despite rough seas in the hope the expert seaman could stay alive in his survival suit in the relatively warm waters near the site of the shipwreck, the Coast Guard said. The water temperature was 79 degrees on Thursday. The original HMS Bounty became famous for a mutiny against its commander, William . Bligh, in April 1789. The mutiny was led by Fletcher Christian - an ancestor of . Claudene Christian. Mr Walbridge reportedly believed he could navigate the ship around Hurricane Sandy when the .

"More veterans are set to storm the barricades of Washington DC's shuttered national monuments today in protest at the government shutdown after Congress refused to fund the healthcare act. Former servicemen are plotting to occupy the capital's closed Second World War Memorial for a second day, and also broaden their protests to other sites including the Lincoln Memorial. The planned acts of civil disobedience by defiant veterans in their 80s and 90s threatens to fan the flames of an already fierce fight over who is responsible for denying the federal government the funds to operate. Next objective: Washington DC's Lincoln Memorial, which has also been closed by the government shutdown, could be next on the list of veterans' targets as they seek to broaden their protest against the political deadlock . Beyond boundaries: Veterans from Iowa were able to tour the World War II Memorial in Washington on Tuesday  after removing the fences closing the site due to the U.S. government shutdown . Defiant: Veterans on an Honor Flight tour visit the World War II Memorial in Washington DC even the the site was officially closed because of the government shutdown . The National Mall's memorial to the . U.S.'s Second World War dead became a political battlefield yesterday . when a group of 91 former servicemen who had travelled from Mississippi . 'stormed' its barricades. They . were among hundreds who had arrived for a planned visit to the memorial . morning to find it shuttered by the National Park Service after the . shutdown went into effect at midnight. And they were quickly joined by conservative politicians who accused Democrats of being to blame for the monument's closure. There . could be a repeat of those scenes today when more groups from the Honor . Flight Network - a non-profit group that arranges free visits to the . Second World War Memorial for veterans - arrive in DC to visit the . monument. One Honor Flight volunteer said they were considering staging further protests elsewhere. Jamie . Miller, a five-year veteran of the Marine Corps, told Buzzfeed: 'We are . thinking about jumping the Lincoln memorial too. If Lincoln was a war . memorial I would do it in a heart beat.' Gulf Coast Coast Honor Flight veteran Wynon Stewart, left, and his escort, Cat Aguda display a piece of police tape removed from the WWII Memorial . Yesterday . members of Congress, including Republican Reps. Michele Bachmann of . Minnesota, and Steven Palazzo, of Mississippi, rushed to Second World . War Memorial and cut police tape to let in the veterans. 'I find it disappointing and disgusting for our country to have to go through this,' said Bob Hunter, 90, of Gulfport, Mississippi to the Daily News. Mr Hunter survived a plane crash and climbed the Eiffel Tower to post a radio transmitter on top as a member of the Army Signal Corps during the Second World War. 'I feel like we deserve better,' Hunter said. 'Somewhere, somehow, somebody screwed up.' Tom Lucas, of Pontotoc, Mississippi was one of five brothers who fought in World War II, said the memorial’s closure 'hurt us.' 'I crossed the North Atlantic 20 times on convoy duty,' said Mr Lucas, 87, to the Daily News. 'I ended up in Tokyo Bay for the signing of the surrender.' 'We did our share, and the last thing people should do is not let us in and not let people open the gate.' 'We took on the Germans and the Japs and we whipped them, and then we have to take this sort of thing? It makes you wonder if these people work for the U.S government or for themselves.' Greatest generation: Rep. Steve King, of Iowa (bottom center), helped distract Park Service officers to allow veterans to enter the memorial . Call of duty: Rep. King is pictured with one of the veterans who traveled from Iowa to pay respects to their fallen comrades . Meet and greet: U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann (left) said she and her colleagues plan to continue coming down to the memorial every day to ensure veterans' access to the site . Tour: A group of 91 veterans from Mississippi were flown down to DC by a charity group to visit the memorial . MIchelle Bachmann said it was ‘pure joy’ when . members of the greatest generation were allowed in because they had . traveled so far to honor their fallen comrades. She . added that her fellow congressmen and women plan to continue coming . down to the memorial every day while the shutdown continues to ensure . veterans’ access. ‘America is not shutting down,’ she told CNN. ‘If we have anything to say about it, we're going to keep this open.’ Park . spokeswoman Carol Johnson said the service didn't want to keep veterans . out, but the agency was directed to close all memorials after the . Congress failed to approve a budget resolution, leading to the first . government shutdown in 17 years. Tough guys: Many of the veterans at the site were wheelchair-bound or relying on walking canes to get around . On the fence: U.S. Park Police close off the World War II Memorial in Washington after the first  government shutdown in 17 years went into effect . A long-running dispute between Democrats . and Republicans over President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act . stalled a temporary funding bill, forcing about 800,000 federal workers . off the job and suspending most non-essential federal programs and . services. ‘We’re looking about how to deal with this in the future,’ Johnson said. Leo Shane III, a reporter for the newspaper Stars and Stripes who was present at the memorial, tweeted that he witnessed Rep Steve King, of Iowa, distracting a Park Service officer while veterans knocked down the barricades. Members of The Mississippi Gulf Honor Flight - a nonprofit group that arranges free visits to the Second World War Memorial for veterans - made their way to the capital visit the memorial. Wayne Lennep, a spokesman for the organization, said they had planned the visit long before the shutdown and could not cancel the pilgrimage. Keeping history locked up: One of the clearest examples of the effect of the shutdown comes from the closure of all National Parks . Close as you can get: A last minute effort by Republicans to reopen the National Parks failed on Tuesday evening, thought it was viewed by many as a stopgap to lessen the backlash against the GOP . Nationwide: A cyclist had to cut his ride short on Tuesday in Saguaro National Park in Tuscon, Arizona . The 91 veterans, many of them wheelchair-bound or using walking canes to get around, arrived at Reagan National Airport in an $80,000 chartered plane on Tuesday morning. They boarded buses and arrived at the . memorial at around 11.30am, only to discover metal fences around the . site and printed signs announcing that the memorial has been closed due . to the government shutdown. Even . though park police officers were patrolling the area, they made no . attempts to stop the veterans and congressmen who came to their aid from . moving the barriers and entering the site. ‘I thought I was going to have to stand back when we first got here,’ veteran Robert Meredith told The Epoch Times. ‘I feel extremely lucky. This is really nice, a great honor.’ Fighting back: Protestors demonstrated by the Capitol demanding the House pass a Continuing Resolution without any amendments that attempted to defund the Affordable Care Act . Defending themselves: Republicans, lead by Senator David Vitter at the podium, called for Democrats to compromise and allow them to pass a version of a budget to end the shutdown . Sticking on message: Democratic House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi pushed for Americans to enroll in the national healthcare system that was launched today . The gray-haired and stooped visitors were able to lay a wreath at the Mississippi pillar and take pictures before leaving the site less than an hour later. Besides the travelers from Mississippi, a group of veterans from Iowa dressed in bright yellow shirts were also allowed to access the memorial. At the Korean War Memorial, a group of veterans from Puerto Rico also stormed the barricades to lay a wreath, The Washington Post reported. Major hurdles: Park rangers erect barricades as a visitor is turned away from a section of Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia . March: Furloughed federal employes march in front of a shuttered Independence Hall at Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia . Blockade: A barrier blocks the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial in Washington as national parks were closed due the budget battle . Rep. Bill Huizenga, of Michigan, called the veterans’ bold actions ‘the best civil disobedience we've seen in Washington in a while,’ according to The Gulf Live. The veterans’ decision to ignore the shutdown and move fences aside in order to pay their respects to military heroes has drawn bipartisan support from members of the House and Senate alike. Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, posted on Twitter that he would be donating his pay during the shutdown to the Honor Flight organization in his home state, while Republican Sen. John McCain, of Arizona, simply tweeted, ‘Good for them.’","Elderly servicemen yesterday 'stormed' barricades at WWII Memorial .

"It could be worth up to $2million, make 2,875 sandwiches, and has been hailed a 'Picasso of the sea'... but Donna Pascoe wants to stuff her record-breaking tuna catch and hang it on her wall. The game fisherwoman battled for more than four hours the 411.6kg (64 stone) Pacific bluefin before finally reeling in the high-speed leviathan - thought to be the largest ever caught with a rod and line. She hooked the fish - which is twice the size of a tuna sold at a Japanese auction last year for $1.09million - using a 60lb line near the Three Kings Islands off Cape Reinga of New Zealand. Scroll down for video . Big fish: Donna Pascoe, 56, hooked the 411.6kg (64 stone) Pacific bluefin tuna near the Three Kings Islands off Cape Reinga of New Zealand . The experienced angler first suspected something fishy was going on when her line began to tug. 'The line was peeling out like it was attached to a freight train,' said Donna, of Auckland, New Zealand. 'As usual, I was pretty nervous that I might get spooled. Thankfully, the fish stopped running and I was able to get a bit of line back in.' Unaware of the scale of her catch, Donna and her four-strong team battled for over four hours to drag the gargantuan 8ft 9' tuna onto her boat. 'It was a very stubborn fish, but I'm stubborn as well,' said Donna. Huge haul: After the 4 hour and 11 minute long battle, the fish was lifted on to the boat, with the help of the anchor winch . Big surprise: At 411.6kg, the fish weighs twice as much as a baby elephant and could fill 3162 cans of tuna . 'The wind had got up to gusts of 36 knots and I was getting drenched from the waves coming over the back of the boat. 'But I was determined to win this one. I knew we had to get the tuna on board before a shark came and bit a chunk out of it. Weight: 411.6kg . Length: 8ft 9ins . Edible meat (once filleted): 230kg . Approximate wholesale value: $13,200 (£8,000) Approximate retail value: $83,000 (£50,000) Potential auction value: $2million (£1.2million) Number of tins of tuna (160g, drained): 1,769 . Dishes of tuna sashimi: 511 . Tuna sandwiches: 2,875 . 'We were all speculating what it was. No way did I think it was a tuna.' After the 4 hour and 11 minute long battle, the fish was lifted on to the boat, with the help of the anchor winch. She said: 'Once we got it on board, everybody's mouth dropped open. It was absolutely amazing. 'I . was so excited that my arms and legs could have fallen off and I . wouldn't have noticed. I think adrenalin is a great thing and it . certainly kept me going.' At 411.6kg, the fish weighs twice as much as a baby elephant and could fill 3162 cans of tuna. It blows the current world record for a fish caught on a rod of 335kg out of the water. Alistair Blair, chairman of The Fish Society, . the largest online fish retailer in Britain, told MailOnline: 'The . wholesale value of a bluefin tuna that size would be in the realm of $8,300 (£5,000) to $16,500 (£10,000)  - that's about four times the value of an ordinary tuna. The retail value, of . course, would be much higher - somewhere around $83,000 (£50,000) or more.' Last . year, however, a 222kg bluefin tuna sold for $1.09 million at a Tokyo . auction. By that standard, Donna's fish could be worth up to $2 million . at auction. Titanic tussle: Unaware of the scale of her catch, Donna and her four-strong team battled for over four hours to drag the gargantuan 8ft 9' tuna onto her boat . Storm brewing: The rough seas made landing the leviathan even tougher . 'People would be willing to pay a lot for a record-breaking fish,' added Mr Blair. 'If you have got a bit of that fish to serve at your banquet then you've got something pretty boast-worthy. 'So this would appeal only to people who are billionaires. It's the fish equivalent of buying a Picasso painting.' He added that a whole bluefin tuna contains around 55 per cent of edible meat. That means it could make 1,769 tins of tuna (160g, brine drained), 2,875 tuna sandwiches or 511 dishes of tuna sashimi. Donna, however, is unable to sell it because the fish wasn't caught on a commercial vessel. Instead, she plans to have it mounted by a taxidermist at the Houhora Big Game & Sports Fishing Club in New Zealand. World record: Donna is now awaiting certification from the International Game Fish Association so she can claim the world record . Built for speed: Bluefin are the world's largest tuna and can live for up to 40 years. Built for speed, they can dive up to 4,000 feet and have retractable fins so they can seek out schools of herring, mackerel and eels . Donna explained: 'We were originally going to have it smoked and shared around our friends, but then we were talked out of this as it was so monumental.' Usually a fish is either stuffed with filler material like firmly packed sawdust or . it is stretched over a mold and shaped into the desired pose. Donna has chosen to make a mold, but the pose, she says, is yet to be decided. The enormous catch put Donna in first place in the tuna section for the New Zealand Sport Fishing Council Nationals Competition. She is now awaiting certification from the International Game Fish Association so she can claim the world record. Bluefin are the world's largest tuna and can live for up to 40 years.

Heavy snowfall made spotting the FA Cup’s salmon ball difficult, but there was no mistaking the sublime finish from Dave Edwards in the 109th minute that looked like it had won this tie for Wolves. The midfielder connected with a delightful backheel to Danny Batth’s cross and went sliding 20 yards in the snowflakes. The weather was such that fans joked about hardly seeing the ball and a message reading ‘I love Wolves’ was written on top of the home dugout. To those who want to do away with replays, this was a classic. Credit to Jackett and Kit Symons for sending their teams out fully intent on securing victory. Despite respective battles at either end of the Championship table, each side attacked throughout. Fulham bossed the first half, with McCormack to the fore. The £11million striker smacked an early shot from 25 yards that Carl Ikeme palmed wide. In the 13th minute Sean Kavanagh pulled the ball back to McCormack for a simpler chance inside the box, but he shot wildly off target.

"Ed Balls has spent the weekend insisting he is no longer part of a macho Labour gang. But he was throwing his weight around on the football field today as Labour took on a team of journalists in a traditional pre-conference match. The shadow chancellor, who has ridiculed the coalition for the flat-lining economy, found himself flat on his back as his team slumped to a 4-0 defeat. Strike: Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls hurtling towards the ball during a match against journalists at Sussex County FA ground . With Labour rocked by revelations about the culture of smears and spin in the memoirs of Damian McBride, Mr Balls has admitted he was part of a blokeish culture which damaged Labour. He told the Times newspaper: 'The period up to 1997 and after, yes, it was macho. I look back on that as a time we were young and inexperienced. 'It was something both [Blair and Brown] allowed to happen. It was a mistake and it was damaging to the government.' Today he took to the field to play for Labour against the Lobby XI, and as he hurtled around the pitch struggled to stay on his feet. Going... going... gone: Mr Balls misjudges his run and loses his footing as he tumbles over the line . Flatlining: The Labour heavyweight ended up on his back during the game against the Lobby XI . Legs akimbo: Mr Balls is one of the long-serving members of the Labour team, but they slumped to a 4-0 defeat . It is not just on the football field that Labour - and Mr Balls - are struggling. A . damning new poll last night revealed just 20 per cent of people think . he has the right policies for the economy - barely half of the 38 per . cent who back the Tories. The surprise surge in support for the . Tories comes after two successive quarters of growth, leading Mr Osborne . to boast that the economy has ‘turned a corner’. According . to the Ipsos Mori poll, 38 per cent of people now say the Conservatives . have the best policies on the economy, with Labour trailing on just 20 . per cent. Grudge match: The traditional pre-conference game was played at the Sussex County FA ground in Lancing, East Sussex . It marks a dramatic shift in the last six months, when the two parties were neck and neck. In March just 27 per cent of voters backed the Tories on the economy  with 26 per cent preferring Labour. Mr . Balls said he and Labour leader Ed Miliband would use the conference in . Brighton to set out what more they can do to tackle the cost-of-living . crisis and 'deliver a recovery that works for the many — and not just a . few at the top'. Writing in The Sun, he added: 'After three wasted years of flatlining, it's good news that our economy is at last growing again. 'But . there's a lot of lost ground to catch up. And I know that for millions . of working people across the country, it doesn't feel like a recovery.' Foul: Journalist Graeme Demianyk struggled to see off the threat of the shadow chancellor bearing down on him . Media handling: Mr Balls has faced questions about his close relationship with some journalists . On yer Ed: The Labour bruiser is known for being very determined on the football field . Ed Miliband today tried to distance himself from New Labour’s vile culture of spin and smears. He . insisted he had never been engaged in the sort of ‘reprehensible’ briefings against colleagues exposed in the memoirs of disgraced Gordon . Brown spin doctor Damian McBride. And . he insisted it was not in his nature to take part in such behaviour, . claiming: ‘I am not sure I have ever been accused of being macho.’ The Labour party conference in . Brighton risks being dominated by the McBride memoirs, which have lifted . the lid on the relentless in-fighting, briefings and smears which . dominated the last government. The . scandal risks reminding voters of Mr Miliband’s role as a close . lieutenant of Mr Brown, alongside shadow chancellor Mr Balls. Mr Miliband today insisted he had urged Mr Brown to sack Mr McBride amid . suspicions about his behaviour, which he said were ‘not my kind of . politics’. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, whose is married to Mr Balls, said Mr McBride was 'out of control'. She . told Sky News' Murnaghan programme: 'I think this is ... about a kind . of politics that really is appalling, that we should never go back to. 'It . is something that happened some years ago, but I think it's a sign of . how much the Labour Party has changed, the very different climate, the . very different way in which Ed Miliband is managing things and operating . things now, that's a good thing, we don't want to go back to the navel . gazing of the past.'

"Tony Pulis is considering building his team around Saido Berahino and insisted everybody at West Bromwich Albion wants him to stay beyond this transfer window. Berahino raised eyebrows by not celebrating any of his four goals against Gateshead in the FA Cup, furthering speculation he wanted a move away from the Hawthorns.

West Brom manager Tony Pulis has insisted striker Saido Berahino is a 'pleasure to work with' Pulis took charge of West Brom last weekend and says the club are keen to keep Berahino . But Pulis said the striker had been the last to leave every training session, staying late with assistants David Kemp and Paul Jewell, and work was being done to ensure he could play without off-field distractions. ‘We’ve had no offers for Saido, he is scoring goals and is a pleasure to work with,’ said Pulis. ‘We have to make sure he has a clear mind on the pitch. I’ve had a chat with him and he’s been smashing. We’d like to keep him.’ Berahino fires home his fourth goal and West Brom's seventh against Gateshead in the FA Cup third round .

Asked if he could construct his side with Berahino as the focal point, Pulis said: ‘Oh yes. He’s a goalscorer. He’s got technical ability and wonderful balance. He’s gifted.’ Pulis added: ‘Everyone is available in some form. Would I want to sell him? Not at all. He’s been first-class.’ However, Pulis is hoping to bolster his forward line with a bid for Watford striker Troy Deeney — a move which might suggest Berahino is close to leaving the club.","Tony Pulis has praised Saido Berahino as a 'pleasure to work with'

"A principal has turned herself in after she and two female staffers were accused of assaulting a former staff member of the high school. Thelma Jarrett, the principal of Coolidge High School near Washington, D.C., allegedly ordered the assault on former school worker Rashia King-Hicks, and took part in the attack, police said. The two other women involved in the alleged attack – Donna Pixley and Bridgette V. Stevens – kicked and hit her outside of the school’s football stadium after the homecoming football game. Scroll down for video . Hot water: Thelma Jarrett, the principal of a Washington D.C. high school, and two staff members have been accused of beating up a former co-worker after a homecoming football game . Court ruling: Jarrett was arraigned yesterday in D.C. Superior Court . Ms King-Hicks was watching the school’s homecoming game from the parking lot, according to the police report. She later told officers that police ‘came out of nowhere,’ punching her in the face. The police document goes onto say that the three women – including Jarrett – allegedly punched and kicked the defenseless woman until a mother of one of the school’s students saw the attack and used her body to shield King-Hicks. However, parent-teacher coordinator Terry Goings said that the account was all-wrong and that Jarrett was attempting to break up the fight. The Washington Examiner reported that the three women were put on administrative leave following the November 2 incident. D.C. school: Calvin Coolidge High School, where Jarrett worked as school principal . Long career: Jarrett has worked for the public school system for 19 years . The alleged assault comes as a shock, as Jarrett has been a cornerstone within the D.C. public school system. She was promoted three years ago to help change Coolidge High School, which has experienced its fair share of troubles. Jarrett has worked for the public school system for 19 years, and later turned herself in. She was arraigned yesterday in D.C. Superior Court, according to WUSA. King-Hicks, who was the former after-school coordinator for Coolidge, was not seriously injured in the attack, but said she is not commenting on the case, save for that she is baffled as to why they did it.

"Herman Van Rompuy, the President of the European Council, said EU leaders had agreed to ‘re-evaluate’ its agenda after voters ‘sent a strong message’ at the weekend . The EU sparked fury by demanding an extra £500million from British taxpayers – just hours after claiming it would take heed of damning election results. The European Commission was accused of ‘living on a different planet’ after asking member countries for a £3.8billion cash increase to its budget. Around an eighth of this will come from UK pockets, with the cash going on projects to help drive down Europe's chronic youth unemployment - as well as £200million for crisis-hit Ukraine including £60million from British taxpayers. The astonishing demand came just hours after Herman Van Rompuy, the President of the European Council, said EU leaders had agreed to ‘re-evaluate’ its agenda after voters ‘sent a strong message’ at the weekend. He announced a round of consultations with the leaders of the 28 EU members on future policies such as reducing the amount of regulation. The apparent climb down came a day after David Cameron demanded change – saying the EU had become ‘too big, too bossy and too interfering’. He travelled to Brussels on Tuesday to demand the union be dramatically scaled back, and to warn fellow leaders not to ‘shrug off’ the view of the European people that Brussels should hand back power to national governments. At a dinner in the Belgian capital that night, he won the first skirmish in his battle to prevent arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker taking the Commission’s top job when it falls vacant in the autumn. Britain's net contribution to the EU more than doubled between 2007 and last year - when taxpayers handed over more than £9billion to Brussels . But, despite the apparent successes, the Commission returned to form just hours later – by demanding its £110billion budget go up by £3.8billion to pay for youth employment projects and regional policy and extra help for Ukraine. Britain is one of the largest contributors to the union, meaning that around £500million would come from the UK. The request comes just days after European election results in which millions voted for parties opposed to ever closer union or the entire concept of the EU. UKIP came top of the poll in Britain, while there were successes for such parties in France, Germany, Italy, Denmark and Greece. Nigel Farage was all smiles during a meeting of leaders of European Parliament's political groups in Brussels yesterday . The claim for more cash from Britain comes after David Cameron told officials Brussels had become too big and too bossy . One European diplomat expressed incredulity at the Commission’s cash demands, saying: ‘What a smart way to react to the concerns of Europe’s voters: let’s ask them for more money. ‘The Commission must live on another planet if they think that Europe can reconnect with people by raiding their wallets,' the diplomat told the Telegraph. A spokesman for the British government said: ‘At a time when countries across Europe continue to take difficult decisions to deal with deficits, the European Commission should not be asking Europe's taxpayers for yet more money.’ The amount that Britain pours into the EU has more than tripled over the last decade, up from £2.9billion in 2002 to £9.5billion in 2012. European leaders – urged on by Britain – reacted to this by cutting EU spending between 2014 and 2020. But the small print means national governments can push spending up during the course of the year by claiming there is not enough money in the coffers to pay for previously agreed projects. A spokesman for the European Commission said: ‘Member states agreed to frontload youth employment and science from 2015 to 2014, which means more resources are needed. ‘Member states agreed to help Ukraine, which means more resources are needed. Member states sent far bigger bills for their cohesion (regional) policy projects than they told us they would, which means more resources needed.’","European Commission accused of 'living on another planet' with demand .

"He still counts the days, hours and minutes since his daughters died in the worst way imaginable. Since his wife was raped and strangled. The nightmares still come, but Dr William Petit keeps on going. 'You do what you have to do, you just keep going,' he says. With a new wife, a new home and a new purpose, William Petit - the lone survivor of the brutal 2007 Connecticut home invasion which saw two men break into his house, beat him unconscious and murder his family before setting the place alight - has done what many could not do. He keeps on living. His second wife Christine Paluf Petit, 36, has been a rock, always being there with him and for him  even if it means just to silently hold his hand. Enlarge . Dr William Petit headed down the aisle with new love Christine Paluf last August, five years after he was the lone survivor of the brutal home invasion that left his wife and daughters dead . Dr Petit with his wife Jennifer Hawke-Petit and their daughters, Hayley (left) and Michaela . She is there in the darkness to comfort him when he wakes from his nightmares, when he remembers that night and sees the faces of the men who ended his world. On a good night the 56-year-old will get five hours sleep, on a bad, two. He keeps lights on in the living room through the night. Speaking to Esquire magazine, he reveals he used to wake up like clockwork at 3am every morning - the time the brutal home invasion commenced - with the images of the men carved into his mind. He said: 'In the beginning when I couldn't sleep, it was always that night. It was always late at night since it started at two or three in the morning. 'I'd be bolt awake at 3am just . like clockwork, no matter what. And then it sorta switched to mornings. The mornings got bad. It would just always be right in front of me. Right in front of your face.' After their emotional wedding ceremony last year, which they shared with 300 family and friends, William and Christine moved into a new home on Farmington River in western Connecticut. They chose to sleep in the smaller bedroom rather than the master bedroom because it faced the water - bringing with it the view and peace they crave. It is a new home away from the Cheshire home William shared with his wife Jennifer for 18 years, where his daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, grew up. And also the place were they breathed their last breaths. William has not returned there since that fateful Sunday in July 2007. Throughout his sorrow and his grief, Christine has been a constant. Always being by his side to hold his hand and pull him through . After their emotional wedding ceremony last year, which they shared with 300 family and friends, William and Christine moved into a new home on Farmington River in western Connecticut . Memorials: His wife and daughter's tombstone which says, 'A voice cried in the wilderness' in the emblem and, right, flowers planted in memory of Michaela and Hayley . Through everything, Christine is a constant. Early in their relationship she learned how to be there for him when he was in a dark place but not say anything, she would just quietly hold his hand. He would thank her for that - for not doing anything - which is just what he needed at that time. Sometimes she makes jokes with him, trying to lift his mood when it drops. Sometimes she will refer to Jennifer, as she never wants him to forget one minute of the life he used to live. 'You don't like doing dishes do you? How'd that go over with Jennifer?' she'd tease, and Bill would laugh. Christine is determined to keep things light, happy and fun. She has decorated their new home from a dreary place to one filled with light and colors, voices and laughter. She met her husband when she was working at the Farmington Country Club, but they didn't make a connection until she offered her skills as a photographer to the Petit Family Foundation. She liked him from the beginning, but was unsure whether he liked her. She told Esquire magazine how she watched him grow and heal as time went on from behind her camera lens. She said: 'I watched him for years at those events, because I had to photograph him. And it was years before I could even get a smile. 'But then he sorta started to - you could just see things changing. Things were starting to lift just a little. 'And then there was this humor that was just shocking. When he's in good mood, forget it. Which was hugely important to me. Because you don't want to be involved with someone who you can't have a normal life with. Who's not going to be fun.'

Horror: An image shown to the court shows the charred bedroom of Hayley Petit after the attack . Killers: Joshua Komisarjevsky, left, and Steven Hayes, right, were . convicted of raping Mrs Hawke-Petit and murdering her and her two . daughters. They have both been sentenced to death . William quit practicing medicine and has now dedicated his life to the foundation. He is continually  touched by those who have reached out to him and donated their money, time and kindness. After the home invasion, 25,000 pieces of mail came from all over the world. Some sent money for the foundation, a dollar bill, a $5,000 check, a handwritten note, a card. They were all answered, even when there were no return addresses, the Petits found them. The donations still come in. Among one of William's favorites, according to Esquire magazine, are from three little brothers who, every year at their birthday parties, ask friends to make a donation to the foundation instead of buying a present. William thinks people understand the mission statement - to foster the education of young people, especially women in the sciences, to improve the lives of those affected by chronic illnesses and to support efforts to protect and help those affected by violence. The house burned down beyond any salvation, the building and its foundation had to be razed and carted away. Residents of the affluent cul-de-sace turned it into a memorial garden - though William never goes there. New-found happiness: Dr William Petit, the lone survivor of a brutal home invasion in Connecticut, has married photographer Christine Paluf. His wife and two daughters died in the attack in 2007 . Support: The family of Petit's deceased wife have wished him and Paluf the world of happiness . Together: The couple were joined by 300 friends and relatives at the wedding in West Hartford on Sunday . Soon after that July night, William's brother-in-law and a few others went over to the house and uprooted the garden. They took out the four o' clocks - Michaela's favorite flowers which she helped her dad plant in the back yard. Now the seeds of these are placed in . small packages inside brochures that say 'Michaela's Garden' and sold . for $10 for the foundation. Three hundred thousand seeds have been . harvested so far. Also uprooted was a chamaecyparis . tree, beside which Hayley and her father would play basketball. When she . was three, Hayley planted a Japanese maple tree on the other side of . the driveway.

"New shots of the rumoured iPhone 6 have been revealed ahead of an expected launch in August or September this year. The images, republished by nowhereelse.fr, are similar to ones leaked before and lend credibility to claims this is what the next device will look like. It appears that Apple’s latest creation will be thinner than its predecessors, and also have rounded edges, making it not too dissimilar to the HTC One. Latest images of Apple's supposed iPhone 6 were leaked last month (shown), showing a phone with an ultra-thin design and rounded images. The power button, typically found on the top of previous iPhones, appears to have been moved to the side, making the device easier to operate with one hand . The latest photos show that the tentatively named iPhone 6 will be made from metal, and will also be much thinner than Apple's current range of devices. Rumours suggest Apple is working on two versions of different sizes, with one being 4.7 inches (11.9cm) diagonally, the same size as the HTC One. A larger version is also expected to be released, measuring 5.5 inches (14cm) - slightly larger than Samsung's 5.1-inch Galaxy S5. In the images some changes to button placement can also be seen. The power button, usually found on the top of iPhones for example, appears to be located on the side of the device. The volume and lock buttons, however, will seemingly remain where they are. Look familiar? The rumoured back of Apple’s new iPhone 6 looks similar to that of the HTC One (pictured right) with a horizontal line at the top and bottom and curved edges. It also suggests Apple may have found a way to make its 'True Tone' flash technology smaller as the whole is different to an iPhone 5S . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up . until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest . phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 . millimetres). This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). By . comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 . millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches . (7.5 millimetres). Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 0.31 inches (7.9 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One is 0.37 inches (9.3 millimetres). It is believed the iPhone 6, which some think will go by the name of the iPhone Air, will sport a 1704 x 960 resolution display, and a powerful A8 processor. The iPhone 5s, by comparison, has a 1136 x 640 resolution, and the A7 chip. These hardware changes will be in addition to the features of Apple's latest iOS 8 software, unveiled last week, which include health monitors and smart notifications. This latest in a long line of leaks comes as Apple chief executive Tim Cook and senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, Eddy Cue, visited Apple’s new campus in Austin, Texas. During the tour, the pair told employees to prepare for the ‘exciting products’ the company has lined up for this year. This was previously teased in an email from Cook to employees in Christmas last year. These products could include Apple’s rumoured smartwatch and the iPhone Air. Australian blog MacFixit claims this is the rear case of the iPhone 6. As well as environmental readings, the rumoured sensors would improve the accuracy and speed of the phone's location services . In May, Australian blog MacFixit said: 'We have just received from our contact in China a photo of what seems to be the back of an iPhone 6. 'We believe the picture to be genuine as we have received leaked product pics in the past that have also proven to be legitimate after official Apple product launches.' German phone firm Deutsche Telekom then began telling customers Apple's iPhone 6 will launch on 19 September. The operator told call centre representatives to let customers know the date in a bid to stop them swapping operators, it has been claimed by apfelpage.de. Users of iPhone 6 could have sensors to track altitude, weather and even air pressure, according to code hidden in the iOS 8 operating system. This image is a screen grab from a video created by French site nowhereelse.fr. It features what is believed to be an industrial model of the iPhone 6 handset . According to Apple Insider, however, the date could be little more than an informed guess. 'The date is consistent with Apple's recent launches, making it likely an educated guess,' it said. Apple historically launches its new iPhone models on Fridays, and 19 September does fall on a Friday this year. Apple also began selling its latest smartphones during the same week last year, as the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c both became available on 20 September. In 2012 Apple made the iPhone 5 available on 21 September. Prior to that, the iPhone 4S launched a few weeks later, on 14 October 2011. Leaked images (pictured) and reports about Apple's next flagship phone - dubbed iPhone 6 - have been circulating since last year. If the rumours turn out to be true, the iPhone 6 will have a rounded, thinner design and a larger screen . French site nowhereelse.fr recently posted a video of a 'dummy' handset. It was made using an industrial model of the handset believed to have been made to help case and accessory makers ensure their products fit the new design. Taiwanese media then reported supply-chain sources similarly claiming a 4.7-inch screen version of the iPhone 6 will reach stores in August, with a 5.5-inch or 5.6-inch model released in September. However, the Economic Daily News did not say which markets would receive the phone first.","More images of the hotly anticipated iPhone 6 have been revealed .

"Scientists have said evidence which claimed to have unmasked Jack the Ripper is wrong because a decimal point may have been put in the wrong place during calculations to match the killer's delay with his descendants. Dr Jari Louhelainen, a world-renowned expert in analysing genetic evidence from historical crime scenes, claimed to have found the identity of the notorious killer after he studied DNA on a shawl found near one of the murder victims. He extracted DNA from the shawl and was able to match it to descendants of the alleged killer, Aaron Kosminski, and one of the Ripper's victims, Catherine Eddowes - ending more than a century of speculation. However scientists claim that Dr Louhelainen made an 'error of nomenclature' in his analysis and therefore the 126-year-old mystery of the killer's identity still remains. Scroll down for video . An image depicting police discovering one of the victims of the murders in London which took place in 1888 . They suggest Dr Louhelainen may simply have put a decimal point in the wrong place, leading him to mistakenly assume the DNA sequence he found was far more rare than it was and could be matched to descendants. In fact, they say, the sequence he found could be shared by the majority of the population and therefore cannot be matched to Kosminski - one of the suspects in the string of murders which took place on London's streets more than 100 years ago - or the Ripper's victim. Kosminksi, a Polish immigrant, was believed to have been unmasked as Jack the Ripper. He was 23 when the murders took place, and living with his two brothers and a sister in Greenfield Street, just 200 yards from where the third victim, Elizabeth Stride, was killed. The revelation ended doubt over more than 100 suspects, which included Queen Victoria’s grandson – Prince Albert Victor, the Duke of Clarence – the post-Impressionist painter Walter Sickert, and the former Liberal Prime Minister William Gladstone. Dr Louhelainen, a molecular biologist at Liverpool John Moores University, started work on the case after he was contacted by businessman Russell Edwards, 48, who bought a shawl at auction in 2007. It had been found next to Miss Eddowes and was stained with what was believed to be her blood. Experts claim errors in the analysis of the DNA mean that claims sequences are linked to those of Catherine Eddowes (left), one of the Ripper's victims, and suspect Aaron Kosminski (right) are wrong . Businessman Russell Edwards bought the shawl in 2007 and published the findings in Naming Jack the Ripper . The scientist extracted six fragments of DNA from the shawl using a method called ‘vacuuming’ because the sample was so old. This involved using a pipette filled with a special ‘buffering’ liquid which removes the genetic material without damaging it. He then used the database at Institute of Legal Medicine to match one with one of her descendants, Karen Miller, the three-times great-granddaughter of Eddowes. Another DNA fragment was matched to a descendant of Kosminski's sister who has asked not to be identify. There have been a number of suspects for the Jack the Ripper murders, including Kosminski (above) A poster calling for the capture of Jack the Ripper, which was published in the Police Gazette in 1888 . In a book published by Mr Edwards about the identity of the killer, Dr Louhelainen said the DNA was a global private mutation (314.4C), which occurs at an incredibly rare frequency of 1/290,000. He said he calculated this using the database at Institute of Legal Medicine. But experts say the mutation in question is actually 315.5C and not rare at all. It would have given a frequency of 1/29,000 at the time of Dr Louhelainen's analysis, as there were 29,000 entries on the database when he did his calculations in 2011. This suggests the decimal point was put in the wrong place, making the sequence far less rare, Sir Alec Jeffreys, the inventor of genetic fingerprinting, told the Independent. He said: 'If the match frequency really is 90 per cent plus, and not 1/290,000, then obviously there is no significance whatsoever in the match between the shawl and Eddowes' descendant, and the same match would have been seen with almost anyone who had handled the shawl over the years.' Mannis van Oven, professor of forensic molecular biology at Rotterdam Erasmus University and Hansi Weissensteiner, based at the Institute of Legal Medicine in Innsbruck, have also raised concerns about Dr Louhelainen's study. A spokesman for the Sidgwick and Jackson, which published the book, said they are investigating the error and that the author stands by the conclusions made.","DNA experts claim analysis which unmasked Jack the Ripper was wrong .

"Thousands of South African football fans packed themselves into the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban to mourn the loss of national team captain Senzo Meyiwa. Meyiwa was shot dead last week while apparently attempting to defend his girlfriend after burglars broke into her house near Johannesburg. The mood in the stadium ranged between sombre and festive, with red-eyed fans sobbing during the procession of the coffin and then blowing vuvuzelas and singing chants later on. Thousands of South African football fans packed themselves into the stadium in Durban . Thousands of people braved drizzling rain in the 85,000 Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban . One suspect, Zanokuhle Mbatha, has been arrested after witnesses picked him out in an identity parade. The 25-year-old briefly appeared in court on Friday and will reappear on November 11. Police had issued identikits of two black men on Tuesday. 'We've got every reason to be angry about Senzo,' Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula told the mourners. 'Justice is grinding and we will find them. We will never rest until we find all of them.' Meyiwa's death came days after the jailing of paralympian Oscar Pistorius for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp thinking she was an intruder lurking in his luxury Pretoria home in the capital of crime-ridden South Africa. Meyiwa's coffin, with the South African flag draped over it, is saluted at the funeral in Durban . Most of the crowd wore the Pirates' red or black but there were also people in yellow - worn by the Chiefs . The country remains one of the world's most violent, although the murder rate been dropping gradually. Police recorded more than 17,000 murders last year, or 31 per 100,000 people - seven times the rate in the United States. An average of 50 guns are reported lost and stolen every day from licensed owners, according to lobby group Gun Free South Africa. 'Lest we forget, this is not the first time that an icon of this nature departs in the fashion that Senzo departed,' said Kaizer Motaung, founder of the Kaizer Chiefs, the main rivals to the Orlando Pirates club Meyiwa played for.

"Sabre Norris may be the daughter of three-time Commonwealth Games gold medal-winning swimmer Justin Norris, but she's made a name for herself already. The nine-year-old recently gained fame over the internet when a video of her accomplishing her first 540 trick on a half-pipe went viral. It took the young skateboarder 75 attempts at the intense trick before she successfully launched off the ramp before spinning her board one-and-a-half turns and landing it back on the ramp. Scroll down for video . Sabre Norris from Newcastle in New South Wales found fame on the internet when a video of her doing her first 540 skateboarding trick went viral . It took Sabre 75 attempts before she successfully launched off the ramp before spinning her board one-and-a-half turns and landing it back on the ramp . The video shows the young girl painstakingly attempting the trick over and over again, but falling to her knees each time. Finally managing to keep from tripping off her board, Sabre was absolutely ecstatic at her achievement once her success dawned on her. Upon publishing her video via  The Berrics, Sabre, who is from Newcastle in New South Wales, told the skateboarding website that she doesn't actually know how to ride a bicycle. 'My skating all started because I wasn't allowed to get a bike because we don't have a garage. So my mum bought us skateboards instead,' she said. 'I started from rolling down my dad's business car park. I've been skating for about 3 years. My favorite trick is a 540. I watched Lyn-Z Adams Hawkins do it on the internet, and I just had to do it. The nine-year-old girl was ecstatic, screaming with joy when she finally achieved the incredibly difficult trick . The video shows the young girl painstakingly attempting the trick over and over again, but falling to her knees each time . 'That was my 75th attempt of the day. Every time I tried one and didn't land it I put a rock on the table. It ended up being my 75th rock. I was frothing. I did some 720s too. Not proper. I called it 540 to revert to splat. I didn't cry though. My goal is to do 100 of them before this Saturday. I'm up to 75. 'I still can't ride a bike, but I can do a 540.' The talented young girl also won first place in the girl's competition of the Australian Bowl-riding Championships in February of this year. But that's only the beginning of a list of goals the ambitious nine-year-old plans to achieve. Her surfboarding team was placed third team at the Australian Boardriders Battle in January, with Sabre holding her fingers crossed for a spot on the World Championship Tour one day.

"It sounds like the stuff of nightmares - but Guy Whittall will certainly be checking for 'monsters' underneath his bed, after waking up to find an eight foot crocodile hiding just inches from where he slept. The 330lbs giant had sneaked into the Humani lodge, Zimbabwe and spent the entire night lying quietly, just fractions beneath an oblivious Mr Whittall. The beast - a Nile crocodile - had managed to stay hidden for more than eight hours overnight. It sounds like the stuff of nightmares - but Guy Whittall will certainly be checking for 'monsters' underneath his bed, after waking up to find an eight foot crocodile hiding just inches from where he slept . Astonishingly the giant beast managed to stay hidden for more than eight hours . Mr Whittall (pictured) even perched on the edge of his bed organising his day -  unaware of the fact that a 330lbs creature lay just fractions away from his dangling feet . The following morning Mr Whittall - a former Zimbabwean cricketer -  had even perched on the edge of his bed, with his feet dangling over the edge, just inches from the crocodile's face, as he organised his day. But the 40-year-old remained oblivious to his uninvited guest and was only alerted when he was enjoying some breakfast in the kitchen and heard the petrified screams of a housemaid. Mr Whittall, who is a director at Humani, ran back to his room and was horrified to discover the enormous crocodile nestled under his bed. He said: 'The really disconcerting thing about the whole episode is the fact that I was sitting on the edge of the bed that morning, bare foot and just centimetres away from the croc. 'Crocodiles are experts at hiding, that's why they have survived on Earth for so long and why they are the ultimate killers in water. But the 40-year-old remained oblivious to his uninvited guest and was only alerted when he was enjoying some breakfast in the kitchen and heard the petrified screams of a housemaid . Staff from the centre managed to get a rope around its head, and then dragged it out by its tail as it fought furiously . Mr Whittall said he resisted being roped and hauled out from under the bed . 'They know how to keep quiet and go unnoticed, it's in their nature. 'The crocodile came from the Turgwe River which is a couple of kilometres from the house. 'They often wander about the bush especially when it's cold and raining. I think he liked it under the bed because it was warm.' He was forced to call in some of his co-workers who helped remove the crocodile from its new lair and release him back into Humani's Chigwidi dam. Mr Whittall said: 'Of course he resisted being roped and hauled out from under the bed, that's only natural. 'Catching and securing a croc of any size on land though is a fairly straight forward affair and we are experienced in that. When roped the large creatures thrash around frantically and are extremely powerful . Mr Whittall called in his co-workers who helped remove the crocodile from its new lair and release him back into Humani's Chigwidi dam . After dragging the croc outside, they were able to safely restrain it by tying up its mouth to avoid any bites . But soon the creature was released back into his natural habitat, where he happily swam away . 'The only real danger is getting bitten because it can't drown you. 'The most important thing is to get its snout roped and secured and then it's just a matter of restraining it and covering its eyes, to calm it down. 'Bigger crocs require more manpower obviously though. When roped they thrash around frantically and are extremely powerful. 'I just remember thinking ""goodness gracious, that's one for the books"".

"Bedlam broke out in the Texas state Senate on Tuesday night after a state Senator wearing pink running shoes tried to filibuster a sweeping anti-abortion bill for 13 hours, but fell less than two hours short. A crowd of hundreds of her supporters in the Senate gallery then took up her cause and attempted to shout down the Republican lawmakers before they could vote on the measure that would close nearly every abortion clinic in the state. The Republicans who control the Senate say they passed the bill with seconds to spare before the legislative session ended at midnight. Democrats claim time ran out and that any vote passing Senate Bill 5 is void. It remains unclear whether the bill passed in time, but the last-minute procedural wrangling on the floor of the Texas Senate is likely to be challenged in court. Scroll down for video . Failed: Texas state Senator Wendy Davis, 50, fell less than two hours short of successfully filibustering an anti-abortion bill . Filibuster: Texas state Senator Wendy Davis, a Fort Worth Democrat, attempted to block an anti-abortion bill by speaking for 13 hours straight . Pro tip #2: Wear comfy shoes. Mrs Davis wore pink running shoes to prepare for the marathon session of speaking - for which she was not even allowed to lean against the table . The drama in Texas began with . Democratic state Senator Wendy Davis, who laced up a pair of pink . running shoes about 11am Tuesday and settled in for a grueling marathon . filibuster. If she managed to continue speaking non-stop for 13 hours . until the Texas legislative session ended at midnight, she could prevent . the Republican majority for voting on - and passing - the bill. Strict . state Senate rules dictated that the 50-year-old mother of two could . not sit down, take a bathroom break or even lean against her table in . order to continue the filibuster. She also had to continue speaking . about subjects that were 'germane' to the bill. But, her filibuster failed about 10pm Tuesday night, less than two hours shy of her goal. Senate . Republicans ruled her out of order after 11hours when she . broke procedural rules three times - twice for speaking about subjects that . were not related to the abortion bill. The other infraction came when a Democratic colleague helped David put on a back brace about 7pm, after she had been speaking non-stop for eight hours. Democrats chose Davis, of Fort Worth, . to lead the effort because of her background as a woman who had her . first child as a teenager and went on to graduate from Harvard Law . School. In the hallway . outside the Senate chamber, thousands of women stood in line, waiting for . people in the gallery to give up their seats. Women's rights supporters . wore orange T-shirts to show their support for Davis, and Texas Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst . reminded those in the gallery that interrupting the proceedings could . results in 48 hours in jail. Packed: Dozens of supporters and opponents of the bill lined the state Senate chamber to watch the filibuster . Davis . tried to stay comfortable and sharp by shifting her weight from hip to . hip and slowly walking around her desk while reading notes from a large . binder on her desk. When a male protester stood in the Senate gallery . and shouted, 'Abortion is genocide,' Davis continued talking . uninterrupted as the man was removed by security. The . filibuster Tuesday directed national attention on the Texas statehouse . in Austin. Abortion rights supporters say the strict new abortion clinic . regulations would severely limit women's access to abortions in the . nation's second-largest state. President . Barack Obama tweeted: 'Something special is happening in Austin . tonight. #StandWithWendy,' along with a link to watch live coverage of . the filibuster. The hash tag #StandWithWendy became the second-most trending topic on Twitter and nearly than 150,000 people tuned in on the live video feed of the Senate debate. After Davis was forced to stop speaking, her Democratic colleagues attempted to carry on her work by launching numerous procedural appeals Dewhurst's ruling to end the filibuster. At one point Democratic state Senator Leticia Van De Putte protested that Dewhurst, who acts as the President of the Senate, had not responded to one of her motions. Thousands of supporters tried to shout down Republican lawmakers to prevent them from taking a vote on the bill . 'Did the President hear me or did the President hear me and refuse to recognize me?' she asked. 'At what point must a female senator raise her hand or her voice to be recognized over her male colleagues?' The comment drew cheers from supports in the Senate hall. After the Republicans cleared away all procedural hurdles - with minutes before the midnight deadline - it became clear that they were preparing to vote on the bill. The thousands of opponents of the law began screaming, booing and applauding from the gallery of the Senate in an attempt to stop Dewhurst from taking a vote before midnight. Both houses of the Texas legislature are controlled by the Republicans, who heavily favor the anti-abortion bill. Republican Governor Rick Perry has promised to sign the bill. The GOP holds 61percent of the Senate - just shy of the two-thirds majority needed to end debate and break a filibuster. If signed into law, the measures would close almost every abortion clinic in Texas, a state 773 miles wide and 790 miles long with 26 million people. A woman living along the Mexico border or in West Texas would have to drive hundreds of miles to obtain an abortion if the law passes. In her opening remarks, Davis said she was 'rising on the floor today to humbly give voice to thousands of Texans' and called Republican efforts to pass the bill a 'raw abuse of power.'","State Senator Wendy Davis attempted to filibuster for 13 hours to block strict anti-abortion bill .

"Syrian rebel fighters have been pictured eagerly unpacking Chinese-made surface-to-air missile launchers understood to have been smuggled into the country by African arms dealers. Taken in a remote area north of the city of Aleppo, the photographs show fighters from the Free Syrian Army assembling FN-6 anti-aircraft missile launchers for use against soldiers loyal to the Assad regime. The Chinese-made weapons are thought to have been provided to the Free Syrian Army by sympathisers in Qatar, who are likely to have purchased them from dealers with links to corrupt officials in the Sudanese government, before having them smuggled into Syria through Turkey. Weapons: Fighters from the Free Syrian Army eagerly assemble an FN-6 anti-aircraft missile launcher for use against soldiers loyal to the Assad regime . Power: The Chinese-made weapons are thought to have been provided to the FSA by sympathisers in Qatar . The exact source of this particular batch of Chinese-made weapons is not immediately clear, although only a handful of nations possess the FN-6 - most of them in Asia. Sudan is known to have purchased a large number of FN-6s from China and - despite international arms embargoes and the government's strong relations with Assad's allies in Iran - many of them appear to have ended up the hands of the Free Syrian Army. Last year the New York Times tracked a Sudanese shipment of Chinese-made anti-aircraft missiles and newly manufactured small-arms cartridges to rebel fighters in Syria. The weapons are likely to have been sold directly to Sudan by weapons manufacturers in China. FN-6 missiles were displayed at Sudan's Independence Day military parade of 2007. Once in Sudan, the weapons can fall into the hands of either corrupt officials or local warlords, who offer them for sale on the international black market, where wealthy Qataris, Jordanians and Saudis who oppose Assad's regime can purchase them and have them shipped directly to rebel groups. Unboxing: The exact source of this particular batch of Chinese-made weapons is not immediately clear, although only a handful of nations possess the FN-6 - most of them in Asia . Arms: Free Syrian Army sympathisers in Qatar are likely to have purchased the weapons from dealers with links to corrupt officials in the Sudanese government, before having them smuggled into Syria through Turkey . It is highly unlikely the Free Syrian Army would have purchased the surface-to-air missile launchers directly from China, who along with Iran and Russia maintain good relations with the Assad regime. Nor is it feasible that the rebels acquired the weapons in their usual method - from regime soldiers that have either abandoned their posts or defected to the FSA. The Syrian regime has no record of using the FN-6, although it does hold approximately 4,235 surface to air missile launchers from different manufacturers. Specially designed to engage low flying targets, the FN-6 is considered China's most sophisticated surface to air missile launcher to date. Using digital infrared technology, the FN-6 has a range of 3.7 miles and can lock on to and take out aircraft flying at an altitude of up to 2.1 miles.","Images show Free Syrian Army assembling surface-to-air missile launchers .

"Moved by the Assad regime's rapid advance, the Obama administration could decide this week to approve lethal aid for the beleaguered Syrian rebels and will weigh the merits of a less likely move to send in U.S. airpower to enforce a no-fly zone over the civil war-wracked nation, officials said Sunday. White House meetings are planned over the coming days, as Syrian President Bashar Assad's government forces are apparently poised for an attack on the key city of Homs, which could cut off Syria's armed opposition from the south of the country. As many as 5,000 Hezbollah fighters are now in Syria, officials believe, helping the regime press on with its campaign after capturing the town of Qusair near the Lebanese border last week. Opposition leaders have warned Washington that their rebellion could face devastating and irreversible losses without greater support, and the warnings are prompting the United States to consider drastic action. Secretary of State John Kerry has cancelled a Middle East trip to be present at White House talks over Syria . Running out of time: experts believe U.S. intervention could be straw that finally breaks the back of Syrian President Bashar Assad . Secretary of State John Kerry postponed a planned trip Monday to Israel and three other Mideast countries to participate in White House discussions, said officials who weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. While nothing has been concretely decided, U.S. officials said President Barack Obama was leaning closer toward signing off on sending weapons to vetted, moderate rebel units. The U.S. has spoken of possibly arming the opposition in recent months but has been hesitant because it doesn't want al-Qaida-linked and other extremists fighting alongside the anti-Assad militias to end up with the weapons. Obama already has ruled out any intervention that would require U.S. military boots on the ground. Other options such as deploying American air power to ground the regime's jets, gunships and other aerial assets are now being more seriously debated, the officials said, while cautioning that a no-fly zone or any other action involving U.S. military deployments in Syria were far less likely right now. The president also has declared chemical weapons use by the Assad regime a ""red line"" for more forceful U.S. action. American allies including France and Britain have say they've determined with near certitude that Syrian forces have used low levels of sarin in several attacks, but the administration is still studying the evidence. The U.S. officials said responses that will be mulled over in this week's meetings concern the deteriorating situation on the ground in Syria, independent of final confirmation of possible chemical weapons use. White House spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said Obama's advisers were considering all options to hasten a transition in Syria. ""The United States will continue to look for ways to strengthen the capabilities of the Syrian opposition,"" she said. Civil war: To date 100,000 people have been killed in the war between Assad's regime and rebel fighters . Any intervention could have wide-reaching ramifications for the United States and the region. t would bring the U.S. closer to a conflict that has killed almost 80,000 people since Assad cracked down on protesters inspired by the Arab Spring in March 2011 and sparked a war that has since been increasingly defined by sectarian clashes between the Sunni-led rebellion and Assad's Alawite-dominated regime. And it would essentially pit the United States alongside regional allies Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar in a proxy war against Iran, which is providing much of the materiel to the Syrian government's counterinsurgency and, through Hezbollah, more and more of the manpower. Syria's precarious position in the heart of the Middle East makes the conflict extremely unpredictable. Lebanon, across the western border, suffered its own brutal civil war in the 1970s and the 1980s and is already experiencing increased interethnic tensions. Iraq, to Syria's east, is mired in worsening violence. And Israel to the southwest has seen shots fired across the contested Golan Heights and has been forced to strike what it claimed were advanced weapons convoys heading to Hezbollah, with whom it went to war with in 2006. Iran could wreak havoc in the region through its support of Shiite militant groups, and U.S. officials fear Iran may seek to retaliate for any stepped-up American involvement by targeting Israel or U.S. interests in the region. It's also unclear what American action would mean for relations with Russia, which has provided Assad with military and diplomatic support even as it claims that it working with the United States to try to organize a Syrian peace conference. At the same time, it's unclear how Washington could fundamentally change the trajectory of a conflict that has increasingly tilted toward Assad in recent months without providing weapons to the opposition forces or getting involved itself. The administration has been studying for months how to rebalance Syria's war so that moderate, pro-democracy rebels defeat the regime or make life so difficult for Assad and his supporters that the government decides it must join a peace process that entails a transition away from the Assad family's four-decade dictatorship. But Assad's military successes appear to have rendered peace efforts largely meaningless in the short term. While Kerry and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov have been trying to rally support for the planned conference in Geneva - first envisioned for May and since postponed until July at the earliest - even America's allies in the Syrian opposition leadership have questioned the wisdom of sitting down for talks while they are ceding territory all over the country to Assad's forces. Force: The Syrian Army has 300,000 soldiers while the number of rebel fighters is estimated at around 35,000 . Beyond weapons support for the rebels, administration officials harbor deep reservations about other options. They note that a no-fly zone, championed by hawks in Congress such as Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., would require the U.S. to first neutralize Syrian air defense systems that have been reinforced with Russian technology and are far stronger than those that Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi had before the U.S. and its Arab and European allies helped rebels overthrow him in 2011. And unlike with Libya, Washington has no clear international mandate for authorizing any strikes inside Syria, a point the Obama administration has harped on since late 2011 to explain its reticence about more forceful action. Homs has one of the biggest Alawite communities in Syria and is widely seen as pro-Assad. The rebels control the city center, however, with regime forces besieging them on the outskirts. Many towns north of Homs also are rebel-controlled, while to the south Hezbollah-backed government forces have been clearing rebels from villages and towns. Fierce fighting there over the past three weeks has killed dozens of rebels, troops and Hezbollah fighters and wounded hundreds. Seizing control of Homs would clear a path for the regime from Damascus to the Mediterranean coast, and firm up its grip on much of the country.","Nearly 80,000 people have been killed during the Syrian civil war .

"If you thought his party-loving days were over – think again. Prince Harry attended an aristocratic friend’s wedding where hotel staff say he fell asleep at the bar and lost his wallet and iPhone. The Prince celebrated the wedding at the secluded, five-star Chateau Bela hotel in Slovakia, where for two nights he downed cocktails, was seen flirting with a mystery brunette and stayed up until 6am. Harry’s ex-girlfriend, Chelsy Davy, 28, was among the guests, and reportedly remained at his side for most of the weekend as well as splashing around with him in a swimming pool. Carrying on till morning: The picture, taken by a person at the wedding in Slovakia, shows the Prince, at about 6am, as he appears to be following the mystery brunette, who is wearing a flowing, dark-green skirt and a sleeveless black top . Our exclusive picture, taken by a person at the wedding, shows the Prince, at about 6am, as he appears to be following the mystery brunette, who is wearing a flowing, dark-green skirt and a sleeveless black top. In the grainy image, Harry, 29, who had his white shirt hanging out, seems to gesture at another young woman to join him and the unidentified brunette. In other photographs seen by The Mail on Sunday, the Prince was pictured talking to the two women while three male guests stand around and three others sit drinking and smoking at white tables on the hotel grounds. The Prince was attending the wedding of his friends Alexander Mavros, 34, and Alexandra von Krockow, 29, earlier this month near Sturovo, 100 miles east of the capital Bratislava. Conversation: Prince Harry (right in white shirt) is seen talking to two women at the party . He was among 250 guests who included business tycoons as well as members of some of the most aristocratic families of Europe. After arriving at the hotel on Friday afternoon, the Prince spent the early evening enjoying a barbecue accompanied by local gipsy music. The Prince and his friends then went into the hotel’s main oak-panelled bar, and ordered rounds of Bloody Mary cocktails and rum and Coke. A waiter, who didn’t want to be named, said: ‘The bar was open all night, and they just ordered Bloody . Marys, ten, 11, at a time. It was so busy. Harry also liked rum and Coke, and he ordered vodka as well.’ Following the first night of partying, reports appeared in Slovakian newspaper Novy Cas – which published the main picture above – and in the Hungarian newspaper Borsonline.hu. They claimed that the Prince fell asleep in front of a bus at the hotel and in the bar. When asked if Harry fell asleep at the bar in the early hours of Saturday morning, a barman replied ‘yes’, and then quickly changed the subject. Following the wedding on Saturday, Harry and his friends danced and drank until late at night. When they left a salon room, Harry forgot his wallet and iPhone on a table. Luckily, waiter Stephan Csonto, found them and returned them to him after rifling through the wallet and finding Harry’s name on his HSBC bank card. He said: ‘When I returned it to the Prince he was happy and thanked me and shook my hand. ‘I knew it was Harry’s as I had seen him with the same wallet before. He puts it on the table when he sits down. ‘He told us that the best thing about the wedding was that he could be himself, and nobody bothered him because he was Prince Harry. Mr Csonto continued: ‘He was so funny. He drank a bit during the wedding, but they all drank. ‘The English, they like to drink at parties. But he was having such a good time. He also told us he had never been to Slovakia before. He spent a lot of time with Chelsy, but they seemed to be good friends,’ he added. The main bar closed at 6am, and Harry and some other guests, including Ms Davy, went into the front courtyard of the hotel. Still the party prince: Harry and friends at the marriage ceremony of Alexander Mavros and Alexandra von Krockow, up until dawn at the hotel . A barman added: ‘I was about to drive off, and Harry was out in the grounds with friends. ‘He then jumped in front of my car with his arms stretched, shouting, “Arghh.” He then told me, “Don’t go, don’t go!” It was funny. His handprint is still on my windscreen.’ Brunch for the guests was served at 11am on Sunday, after which everyone gradually departed. It is believed that London-based Mr Mavros, a scion of a Zimbabwean jewellery dynasty, has been friends with the Prince for about three years. Harry caught a Ryanair flight from Bratislava on Sunday afternoon, bound for Luton. The bride’s mother, Countess Von Krockow, said yesterday: ‘Harry had a good time. ‘Of course people were a bit tipsy at the wedding – that’s what happens.’ The 47-room Hotel Chateau Bela is one of Slovakia’s most famous historic hotels.  Once the seat of the von Krockows, it is still owned by the family. Prince Harry stayed in a standard en suite double room on the first floor, costing about £90. Buckingham Palace refused to comment about the wedding weekend, as it was a personal matter.","Prince partied at the secluded five-star Chateau Bela hotel in Slovakia .

"Wendy Davis’ attempt to build her campaign to become the first Democratic Texas governor since Ann Richards in 1995 around her personal story of success against the odds has experienced somewhat of a hiccup - after it emerged that some of the facts have been misstated. Speaking in a recent federal lawsuit she said that she ‘got divorced by the time she was 19 years old... after I got divorced, I lived in a mobile home park in southeast Fort Worth’. It turns out that she was in fact 21 when she got divorced from a man called Frank Underwood and only lived in the mobile home for a few months. Controversy: Texas senator Wendy Davis misstated biographical details . Marathon: Davis spoke for 11 hours straight last year in a bid to derail an anti-abortion bill . Shortly afterwards she relocated to an apartment with her daughter, according to the Dallas Morning News. She has also blurred the funding of her education. Her official website states that she attended Texas Christian University ‘with the help of academic scholarships, student loans, and state and federal grants’ and went on to become ‘the first person in her family to earn a bachelor’s degree, graduated first in her class, and went on to Harvard Law School’. All that is true, but what’s omitted is the significant financial contribution her wealthy husband, lawyer Jeff Davis, made. He helped pay her Harvard tuition fees, even taking out a loan to do so. When this omission was put to her, she said ‘it was community resources, we paid for it together’, according to The New Yorker. This blurring of biographical details has led to Davis stating that improvements need to be made. She said: ‘My language should be tighter.’ Davis’ became a household name, both in the U.S. and abroad in June last year, when, wearing pink running shoes, she tried to filibuster a sweeping anti-abortion bill for 13 hours, but fell less than two hours short.","Davis stated that she got divorced at 19, but she was actually 21 .

"Fabian Delph believes Aston Villa are capable of inflicting another shock defeat on Chelsea despite a run of 10 hours and 12 minutes without a Premier League goal. Villa stunned Jose Mourinho’s side 11 months ago when Delph scored a late winner in an acrimonious game which effectively ended Chelsea’s title aspirations. Chelsea players Willian and Ramires, and Mourinho himself, were sent off and the Chelsea manager was fined for confronting referee Chris Foy. Delph’s goal, a deft back-heel, boosted Villa’s survival ambitions. Paul Lambert’s team need similar help now — they lie three points above the relegation zone in 16th having not won in eight matches — but England midfielder Delph said: ‘I have been looking at that fixture, it is always nice when you play against the big boys. Fabian Delph is hoping to end Aston Villa's run of 10 hours and 12 minutes without a Premier League goal . Villa dented Chelsea's title hopes when they beat them at Villa Park in March 2014 . Delph welcomes new signing Scott Sinclair to the club after he signed from Manchester City . ‘It was a great night for me and the team — a much-needed three points when nobody gave us a chance of winning. If I could do it again it would be fantastic. Anything is possible in football, you could have 85 minutes under the cosh and then nick a goal.’ He added: ‘It does seem to be physical every time we play those teams. You are not allowed to tackle as much these days but it should be an entertaining game, they have some great players. It will be a tough night’s work.’ Villa’s excruciating run without a goal goes back to December 20, and Delph is aware that he has yet to score this campaign. ‘I have always worked on my finishing,’ he said. ‘It is about getting in the right positions to have those opportunities to have a strike on goal. ‘I am pretty confident I will get one or two this season and looking forward I would like to think I can add seven or eight goals a season. That is my target.’","Fabian Delph scored against Chelsea to dent their title hopes last March .

"In the area nowadays you can find a £15-a-night caravan site with coin-operated hot showers. But while the Manor Caravan Park in Happisburgh, Norfolk, might not sound luxurious today - it's certainly a major improvement on what it would have been like there 1million years ago. Scientists now believe early humans created their first settlement at the coastal site - which lies north-east of Norwich - after finding a series of stone tools and fossilised animal remains there. On the coast: Scientists now believe early humans created their first settlement at the Manor Caravan Park (seen from above) in Happisburgh, Norfolk - after finding tools and fossils there . An artist's impression of Happisburgh, Norfolk, when scientists believe it was occupied by an ancient race of humans - who could have been the Homo antecessor or Homo erectus species . The artefacts have been dated to . nearly 1million years ago, which makes them the oldest found in Britain - . and suggests the species who lived there were primitive predecessors of . modern humans. They could . have been the Homo antecessor or Homo erectus species, who both had . comparatively small brains and might have even been cannibals as well as . hunters, reported The Sunday Times. The . dramatic discoveries are set to be revealed next month in the ‘Britain: . One Million Years of the Human Story’ exhibition at the Natural History . Museum in South Kensington, Central London. Scientists . believe the site the early humans lived on was on the River Thames, . which flowed out into the North Sea at that time - and are finding the . north Norfolk coast to be a goldmine of artefacts. Map: The caravan park in Happisburgh is located on the north Norfolk coast, north-east of Norwich . Experts are making many new discoveries with the coastline being one of the UK’s fastest-eroding - but they are yet to find any human remains from our predecessors, reported The Sunday Times. Professor Chris Stringer from the museum said: ‘From the earliest human fossils in Britain to one of the oldest wooden tools in the world, you will be surprised by the history hidden beneath your feet. ‘The story behind the humans who inhabited ancient Britain has taken us more than a decade to piece together. This gives us an exciting glimpse into our past (and) leads us to reflect on our future.’ Temperatures when the first humans arrived in Britain would have been several degrees colder than nowadays - and they would have also faced dangerous wildlife including sabre-toothed cats. However, they would have been attracted by the chance of hunting mammoths and bison - as well as being able to walk to mainland Europe, with Kent connected to Germany by land at that time. We still know relatively few facts about the homo antecessor, but it is . believed they were the first Britons because they were the only known to live . in Europe at the time. Fossil remains found in Spain suggest they had stronger . brows and bigger teeth than modern humans - but also smaller brains and potentially . even cannibalistic behaviour. They would have lived on the flood plains and marshes that . bordered the ancient route of the River Thames in Norfolk, alongside sabre-toothed cats, hyenas, . horses, mammoths and deer. They measured around 5ft 6in to 6ft, weighed between 9st and . 14st and are believed to have been right-handed.

"To millions of Christians, they are a symbol of peace. But to a pair of larger birds, the two doves released in the Vatican yesterday were nothing more than a chance for a bit of Sunday morning sport. No sooner had the birds been set free in St Peter’s Square – as a symbolic gesture of peace for Ukraine – than they were set upon by a seagull and a crow. Scroll down for video . Go: Pope Francis is joined by two children who release doves during the Angelus Prayer in St. Peter's Square . Off they fly: Francis was celebrating the prayer from the window of his studio overlooking St. Peter's Square . Windowsill: A seagull attacks a dove released by a child from the papal window during Francis's prayer . Attack: Two white doves had been sent fluttering into the air as a peace gesture by Italian children . The two larger birds swooped on the . defenceless doves during the Pope’s weekly Sunday Angelus prayer in . front of tens of thousands of worshippers gathered in the Vatican. After . saying a prayer for Ukraine, where at least three people were killed . during the latest clashes that have seen Kiev in flames, the Pontiff . helped schoolchildren release the doves from the window of the Apostolic . Palace as a peace gesture. But they were immediately attacked. The seagull pinned one . of the doves against the wall of the palace and pecked at its tail, but . was left with a mouthful of feathers as its victim made an escape.

"An Arizona Department of Corrections K-9 dog died last month after his handler left him in a hot department vehicle for seven hours. According to an initial investigative report, the dog named Ike was left in the back of his handler's SUV and locked in its kennel, without food or water for seven hours at the Arizona State Prison in Buckeye, Arizona. The officer left work early to take care of a sick child when he forgot he left the animal in the back of the vehicle. Scroll down for video... Hot dog: An Arizona Department of Corrections service dog that died last month had been left in its handler's vehicle for approximately seven hours, according to an investigative report (file photo) Arizona State Prison - Lewis in Buckeye, Arizona: The 7-year-old dog was inside the SUV from 6:45 a.m. to 1:50 p.m. when the temperature outside hit 98 degrees . The Maricopa County Attorney's Office . has received the case against correctional officer Jesse Dorantes but . prosecutors haven't decided whether to charge him, according to an . agency spokesman. An investigative report released Friday by the . Department of Corrections said Dorantes left Ike, his canine partner of . four years, inside of a cage located in a white Ford Escape because he . forgot that he placed him in the vehicle. Just before 2 p.m. the handler contacted his supervisor and let him know what happened. An official then went to check on the animal, but the dog was already dead. Overheated: Ike was found dead April 9 in the back of Jesse Dorantes' assigned SUV, which was left parked and unattended at the Arizona State Prison . The . sergeant found the K-9 dead in the locked cage inside the SUV. The . vehicle's windows were rolled up and there was no food or water. The 7-year-old dog was inside the SUV from 6:45 a.m. to 1:50 p.m. when the temperature outside was close to 100 degrees. A necropsy determined the dog died by elevated body temperature. Dorantes reportedly cried at the news and said he mistakenly forgot about Ike. The . veterinarian who performed the necropsy told investigators that Ike's . internal temperature was 110 degrees, despite having been packed in ice . and stored in a refrigerator. The dog's organs would have begun to fail at 107 degrees, according to the report. Investigators concluded that Dorantes was reckless in caring for Ike's needs and welfare, the report says . 'Clearly . the officer is very remorseful about this terrible situation,' said . Department of Corrections spokesman Doug Nick. 'When something like this . occurs, it's just a reminder to everybody, tragically so, that you need . to be very mindful of what your job is.'

"Dougie Freedman insists he is not frightened by the full transfer embargo imposed on Nottingham Forest for failing to pay Peterborough a fee of around £1.5m in the purchase of Britt Assombalonga. Forest have been automatically hit with a blanket ban on bringing in any players after missing the due date of January 30 for the latest installment on their club-record signing, it emerged last night. It meant Forest were unable to sign anybody on transfer deadline day and also rules that when the emergency loan window opens next week they will be prohibited from adding to their squad – unless Peterborough receive the funds. Freedman speaks alongside club ambassador John McGovern during a press conference at the City Ground . Nottingham Forest sacked club favourite Stuart Pearce after a poor run of form in the Championship . Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony was so infuriated he took to Twitter to brand the non-payment a ‘disgrace’. The League One club have complained to the authorities. As per Football League regulations, there will be five per cent interest added on the missing cash whenever it is paid and Forest could be subjected to a further fine. Forest were already under an embargo for breaking financial fair play rules, but able to bring in loan players and free agents as long as price guidelines were met. But this fresh development has left new manager Freedman facing a headache on entering the job following the sacking of Stuart Pearce. The former Bolton and Crystal Palace boss says he has experience of working in difficult circumstances and is adamant the squad is strong enough as it is. He also said owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi would meet his obligations. ‘I don't need to add anything so it is not top of my list to worry about,’ he said. ‘I've worked in these markets before where I've had no money. I worked when we are in administration at Palace. Forest failed to pay Peterborough a fee of around £1.5million in the purchase of Britt Assombalonga . Freedman is confident he can help Nottingham Forest climb up the table this season . Darragh MacAnthony has criticised a Nottingham Forest for their outstanding fee on a Peterborough player . ‘With the squad I have now, I'm not frightened of the word embargo. We all fall on hard times, it's life. We are not the first business not to pay on time. But the chairman will honour what he owes.’ Club sources insist Freedman has signed an 18-month contract but there has been speculation the deal is initially six-months with a view to another year. The 40-year-old is aware of the number of managers to have occupied the City Ground dugout since Al-Hasawi took charge – the Kuwaiti has fired four since July 2012 – but believes he can buck the trend by getting the best out of one of the Championship’s best squads. ‘This squad is underachieving, we have to start winning games, I'm sure we can do that. I am realistic. I am looking over my shoulder. I know the side has won three games in 21, so we have to make sure that changes. That is where my energy will be spent. ‘I can not sit here and say that we cannot win promotion, as Nottingham Forest manager.’ Pearce has been offered a senior advisory role at Forest which ambassador John McGovern likened to when Peter Taylor assistant Brian Clough. Pearce has not yet given an answer but is believed to have turned down the opportunity to continue his time at the club. McGovern said the timing of Pearce’s sacking was correct, suggesting the manner of defeat at home to Millwall ‘was the straw that broke the camel’s back’. He added: ‘Stuart made some great signings but the record has been poor.’","Nottingham Forest have been hit with a transfer embargo .

"Former Chelsea manager Avram Grant is on the verge of being named Ghana head coach ahead of Spaniard Juan Ignacio Martinez and former Switzerland assistant coach Michel Pont. The 59-year-old led Chelsea to the Champions League final in 2008, where they lost to Manchester United, and also managed the Israel national team for four years. He will be appointed provided he is able to reach a financial agreement with the country's football association. Grant is a financial agreement away from being named the next head coach of Nigeria . The Israeli came within a penalty kick of winning the 2008 Champions League trophy with Chelsea . 'If we reach an agreement with him we'll appoint him as Black Stars coach,' GFA boss Kwesi Nyantakyi told the BBC. 'If we don't reach an agreement with him, we'll look at our second option.' 'We're going to engage Grant on the details of the job requirement and expectations which will span from remuneration, conditions of service and others,' Nyantakyi added. 'We are going to re-negotiate effectively. We know his salary expectation but we'd like to see if we can beat it down further.' Grant will be charged with leading Ghana to a fifth African Cup of Nations title . The Israeli is set to replace James Kwesi Appiah who took charge of the Ghana team at the World Cup . The Black Stars have been without a coach since James Kwesi Appiah was replaced by Maxwell Konadu on a temporary basis after the opening two 2015 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.

"U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services plans to seek a vendor to produce as many as 34 million blank work permits and 'green cards' – the paperwork that authorizes immigrants to live and work in the United States – as the White House prepares to issue an executive order after the Nov. 4 midterm elections. According to a draft solicitation published online, the government agency will look for a company that can produce a minimum 4 million cards per year for five years, and 9 million in the early stages. President Barack Obama has pledged that he will make a move on immigration reform this year. His original timetable called for a decision by the end of the summer. Republicans have decried the plan as an 'amnesty' for millions of illegal immigrants, including hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied minors who have come across the U.S.-Mexico border this year. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO AND THE DOCUMENTS . '#Not1More': An immigration activist heckled President Barack Obama on Sunday as he spoke during a campaign event for Democratic Maryland gubernatorial candidate Anthony Brown . Along with its solicitation for blank green cards and work permits, USCIS published images showing what the finished cards will look like . A draft RFP – a Request For Proposal – is typically published in advance so government contractors can prepare to submit their bids when the final version is published. The draft came complete with photos of what the finished cards will look like. Breitbart.com first reported on the planned solicitation. Obama's high numbers of illegal immigration 'removals' – what used to be called 'deportation' – has earned him the nickname 'deportation president,' but most of those ejected border-crossers never get to the interior of the U.S. Still, activists have protested his policies, including some who heckle his speeches. One yelled at him Sunday in the middle of a campaign stump speech supporting Democratic Maryland gubernatorial candidate Anthony Brown. A USCIS official told MailOnline on Monday that the draft was published 'in case the president makes the move we think he will,' but added that the agency's Document Management Division (DMD) is by no means committed to buying the materials. A second official at the agency said the proposal was drafted as a contingency in case immigration reform legislation passes in Congress, not in anticipation of action from the White House. Either way, the online draft explains that 'DMD requires card consumables for the production of USCIS' Permanent Resident Card (PRC) and Employment Authorization Document (EAD) cards.' 'These cards and related consumables, when assembled, become highly specialized and secure identification documents.' And a successful bid, the draft solicitation says, will be able to support a 'potential ""surge"" in PRC and EAD card demand for up to 9M (9 million) cards during the initial period of performance to support possible future immigration reform initiative requirements.' Advocates for Mexican and Central American immigrants have lambasted Obama for deporting illegal aliens even though the numbers are down sharply. This Sept. 8 protest in front of the White House featured a crying young boy (left) whose father was deported . Obama delayed his immigration action until after the midterm congressional election to avoid alienating law-and-order voters, but can afford to frustrate illegal imigrants – who can't legally cast ballots . Former State Department foreign service officer Jessica Vaughan, now an immigration expert at the Center for Immigration Studies, told Breitbart that the RFP 'seems to indicate that the president is contemplating an enormous executive action that is even more expansive than the plan that Congress rejected in the 'Gang of Eight' bill.' That legislation, which passed in the U.S. Senate last year only to be stalled in the House of Representatives, was a broad reboot of American immigration policy that won support from a handful of Republicans. In included a provision to provide a pathway to citizenship for so-called 'dreamers' – people living in the country illegally who were brought to Americans as children before June 15, 2007. Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which he ultimately enacted without congressional support, uses the EAD cards as part of its implementation. USCIS says it processed 862,000 EADs overall between January and June of this year. But 'the guaranteed minimum for each ordering period is 4,000,000 cards,' according to the draft RFP. 'The estimated maximum for the entire contract is 34,000,000 cards.' The company that ultimately wins the contract will also be required to store the blank cards until the government needs them.

South African Football Association President Danny Jordaan made the announcement at the memorial service  and also promised a statue of the goalkeeper would be built to stand outside SAFA's headquarters at Soccer City in Johannesburg. The goalkeeper was shot and killed in an apparent house robbery on Sunday, unleashing dismay and anger in South Africa over the violent death of one of its most popular players. Meyiwa had captained South Africa to the top of their qualifying group and was yet to concede a goal in qualifying, putting Bafana Bafana on the brink of sealing a place at next year's continental championship.

Mourners wore costumes in support of Meyiwa and the South African team he played for, Orlando Pirates . To honor Meyiwa, SAFA was given special permission by the Confederation of African Football to move next month's qualifier against Sudan from Nelspruit in the north to Meyiwa's hometown of Durban on the east coast, Jordaan said. South Africa will qualify for the Cup of Nations if they win. The game on November 15 will now be played at Moses Mabhida Stadium, where Meyiwa's funeral will be held on Saturday. Meyiwa was fatally shot while visiting his girlfriend in Vosloorus township near Johannesburg. He was attempting to protect Kelly Khumalo during a robbery at her home. The 27-year-old skippered his club side Orlando Pirates in their 4-1 win against Ajax Cape Town on Saturday night, and was pictured looking happy with girlfriend Khumalo, a South African pop star, earlier on Sunday. But the South African police service say Meyiwa was fatally shot when armed men broke into the house where he was staying at around 8pm.. Police are hunting three suspects in the shooting and have offered a reward of around £14,000 to catch them. On Thursday, Jordaan challenged South Africans - who are used to high levels of violent crime - to hand in illegal guns, which he said will be put in a furnace and melted down to build Meyiwa's statue. Jordaan said the more illegal guns given up, the bigger Meyiwa's statue would be. Meyiwa's girlfriend Kelly Khumalo, a South African singer posted this picture with him on Sunday, hours before he was shot dead . Meyiwa and Wayne Rooney after a Vodacom Challenge match between Orlando Pirates and Manchester United in 2008 . 'That statue will stand in front of SAFA House and when you walk into SAFA House, you must walk past Senzo,' Jordaan said. Meyiwa had been in superb form for both club and country recently, leading Orlando Pirates to last season's African Champions League final, including a superb performance against TP Mazembe during which he saved two penalties. Since breaking into the national team last year, he claimed the No 1 spot in the absence of Itumeleng Khune, and was made captain in September. Female boxer Phindile Mwelase (right) was also mourned at the service after she died on Saturday . Former world champion 800-meter runner Mbulaeni Mulaudzi was killed in a car crash on Friday . The South African goalkeeper played for Orlando Pirates from 2006, becoming first choice for the club in 2012. In 2008 he swapped shirts with Wayne Rooney when Manchester United played the Pirates in a pre-season friendly in Durban. In 2013 his performances in the African Champions League were nothing short of exceptional. He kept seven clean-sheets in 16 games, helping the Pirates to the final. After making his debut in 2013 against Swaziland, Meyiwa won six caps for South Africa, the most recent coming this month, as captain. During the current Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign Meyiwa has played all four games for South Africa, without conceding a single goal. In September he was made captain of the national team in the absence of Itumeleng Khune.

"Under fire: Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond . More than a third of Scottish businesses would consider moving out of the country if there were a Yes vote in the independence referendum, according to a shock new poll carried out for The Mail on Sunday. The survey shows that Alex Salmond’s campaign to persuade Scottish voters that jobs and economic livelihoods would be secure in a newly independent nation has failed to convince the business community North of the border. The bombshell results reveal: . The poll carried out by Survation gave 100 leading Scottish businesses with combined sales of more than £15 billion the chance to voice their concerns over possible independence with a guarantee  of anonymity. Alistair Darling, the former Chancellor who leads the Better Together pro-union campaign, attacked Mr Salmond, Scotland’s First Minister, for his refusal to outline an alternative to keeping the pound. He added: ‘Alex Salmond has turned the referendum ballot paper into a betting slip. Without the most basic economic fact – what money we would use – voters will have to decide whether they are prepared  to take a leap in the dark.’ Danny Alexander, Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘These results are another hammer blow to the credibility of the SNP. ‘They clearly show that job numbers and prosperity in Scotland  will suffer in the event of a Yes vote. A vote for Yes will see large numbers of businesses planning to  leave Scotland.’ The poll took place after Scotland’s giant Standard Life pensions provider said it was looking at relocating funds, people and operations to England in the event of Scottish independence. Alliance Trust, another major Scottish financial services group, has said it has begun to set up businesses registered  in England, while Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds may have to move their official legal homes South of the border, in line with  EU directives. The bosses of Shell and BP have made  it clear that they would prefer Scotland to remain part of the union. Although the poll appears to back Mr Salmond’s aim of keeping the pound in an independent Scotland while staying in a currency union with the rest of the UK, that plan has been rebuffed by the three main UK political parties. Mr Darling added: ‘Of course, the SNP response to this is to claim that it is all a bluff – and it is revealing that the nationalists use a gambling metaphor in responding to this. Alex Salmond and Deputy SNP Leader Nicola Sturgeon. The poll took place after Scotland¿s giant Standard Life pensions provider said it was looking at relocating funds . ‘But for the people of Scotland this isn’t a game. We are talking about the livelihoods of millions of Scottish families here. ‘Leaving the UK and losing the pound means more cost, higher prices and bigger risks for Scotland. Leaving the UK means losing jobs.’ Kenneth Gibson, an SNP convenor of the Scottish Parliament’s finance committee, took a different view. ‘Business in Scotland clearly wants a currency union with the rest of the UK if there is a yes vote, and that is exactly what the Scottish Government is proposing,’ he said. The poll showed a small minority of Scottish businesses saw any benefit to independence, while the majority reckoned there would be no benefits at all.","Alex Salmond has failed to persuade businesses of economic security in an independent Scotland, poll suggests .

"Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony has launched a furious tirade against Nottingham Forest over the non-payment of a substantial fee for Britt Assombalonga. MacAnthony did not name names but took to Twitter to describe a situation he calls a ‘disgrace’ that undermined Peterborough’s efforts to recruit players on transfer deadline day.

It is believed Forest could become subject to a total transfer embargo – banning even loan signings once the window for such moves re-opens next week. Forest are currently barred only from bringing in permanent transfers as part of their punishment for financial fair play breaches. Writing on Twitter late last night, MacAnthony said: '(sic) Ok Posh fans, there wont be any incoming signings today but that has nothing to do with players having to leave etc, the real reason is due - To a certain championship club failing to make an agreed large payment (not thousands btw) last week on plyr they bought from us.

"Teens have abandoned Facebook in favour of Instagram and Twitter, researchers have found. A new survey by investment bank Piper Jaffray found that more than 9 out of 10 American teenagers regularly use social media. It reveals Facebook's fall from grace has been sudden - from being used by 72% of teens in the spring to just 45% now. Scroll down for video . Facebook's fall from grace has been sudden - from being used by 72% of teens in the spring to just 45% now, while just 12% said they used Google+ . In the survey, analysts examined how children's social media preferences have changed over the last six months. Instagram has become even more popular, with 76 percent of teens currently saying they use it - up 7 percent since last spring. Twitter ranked second, used by 59 percent of teens. Facebook came in third. Pinterest and Tumblr each claimed a little over 20 percent. Another 20 percent of teens said they use 'other' social networks, not named in the survey but likely including some popular anonymous messaging services and the disappearing-message app Snapchat. Apple remains the top consumer electronics brand for teens, according to the annual fall survey of 7,200 teens, conducted in classrooms and electronically. Kevin Systrom, Instagram Chief Executive Officer and co-founder: The firm has now overtaken its owner, Facebook, in the teen market . About 67 percent own iPhones (up from 61 percent in the spring), with an even greater number (73 percent) saying their next device will be an iPhone. However, response to the Apple Watch remains, in the words of Piper Jaffray technology analyst Gene Munster, 'tepid', according to Re/Code. Only seven percent of teens said they already own a smartwatch — and just 16 percent would be interested in shelling out $350 to buy the Apple Watch. 'The concept of wearing a watch for teenagers is foreign — and I think that's part of what is reflected in that response,' said Munster. 'The second piece is, it's still something that people need to hear more about, beyond what Apple has to say about it, before people get interested in it.' something to think about: Facebook is nolonger the most popular social network among teens - although luckily it does own Instagram, which pipped it to the post . Researchers also analysed wider teen habits. 'Our fall 2014 survey results indicate teens continue to diversify their tastes through discovery of emerging brands and multi-brand experimentation, even as their views of the economy worsen,' said Steph Wissink, co-director of research and senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. 'We also observe trends that indicate teens use social media, mainly Instagram, to create their own unique personal brands and seek peer affirmation.

Lying in wait: A catfish lurks in the waters of the Tarn River while it waits for a pigeon to stray too close . Pounce: The fish lunges from the water and snaps up the bird in its jaws . Catfish in south-west France have been spotted leaping from a river to snap up the unsuspecting birds, before wriggling back beneath the water to swallow them. The unusual behaviour - similar to the way some marine mammals beach themselves to snap up prey from the shore - has never been seen among catfish in their native range. It has led researchers the University of Toulouse to dub them 'freshwater killer whales'. Between 1m and 1.5m long, European catfish are the largest freshwater fish on the continent and third largest in the world. Most catfish are bottom feeders, consuming aquatic plants, other fish, decaying vegetation, fish eggs and crayfish as well as snails, aquatic bugs and minnows. Feeding ground: Researchers spent five months watching . the catfish from a bridge over a small gravel island over a stretch of . the Tarn passing through the city centre of Albi, north-east of Toulouse . However in the Tarn river, where they where introduced in the early Eighties, they seem have adapted their natural behaviour to capture prey in their new environment. Researchers spent five months watching the catfish from a bridge over a small gravel island over a stretch of the Tarn passing through the city centre of Albi, an ancient town about 50 miles north-east of Toulouse. Over that period they observed 54 beaching incidents, in which the catfish managed to snap up a bird 28 per cent of the time, dragging them back into the water to gobble them up. While the beachings were quick - lasting from less than one second to no more than four seconds - in about 40 per cent of cases the fish lunged so far from the water that more than half their bodies were exposed. Just when you thought it was safe: In five months they observed 54 beaching incidents, in which . the catfish managed to snap up a bird 28 per cent of the time, dragging . them back into the water to gobble them up . To go back in the water: The beachings were quick, but in about 40 . per cent of cases the fish lunged so far from the water that more than . half their bodies were exposed . Along comes a hungry catfish: The unusual behaviour - similar to the . way some marine mammals beach themselves to snap up prey from the shore - . has never been seen among catfish in their native range . Catfish are named for the long, sensitive whiskers (known as barbels) around their mouths, and the those of the Tarn fish would perk up whenever they were hunting fish. That finding, combined with the fact that the fish only went for those pigeons who were moving, suggested the the catfish used water vibrations to hunt rather than visual cues. While the study highlights an interesting example of unusual behaviour, the researchers said the ecological causes that have led to the unusual adaptation are still unknown . Catfish were only introduced to the Tarn in 1983, and they now flourish there, leading the researchers to speculate that increased numbers of the fish could have led to a decline in marine prey. The findings were reported yesterday in the open-access journal PLoS ONE.","Catfish in the Tarn River in south-west France are the only ones ever to be observed exhibiting the behaviour .

"A demolition crew made a spectacular blunder after it arrived at the right residential street, at the agreed time but then knocked down the wrong house.

"Roberto Martinez has admitted he is unlikely to sign a striker to replace Samuel Eto'o as he backed Arouna Kone to deliver Everton's goals. Eto'o completed his move to Sampdoria earlier this week, which leaves Everton, who have failed to score in four of their last six Barclays Premier League fixtures, with Romelu Lukaku and Kone as the only recognised strikers. Kone has endured a wretched time at Goodison Park, scoring only once since his £5million move from Wigan in June 2013 and being restricted to a handful of starts because of a serious knee problem, but Martinez's faith in him is total. Roberto Martinez has backed Arouna Kone to fill the void left by departed striker Samuel Eto'o . The Cameroon legend holds aloft a scarf after completing his move to Serie A side Sampdoria . Eto' o stands with his hands on his hips during his first training session with Sampdoria . 'At the moment Kone is fully fit and ready to give a lot to the team so we do not need anyone to replace Samuel Eto'o in that position,' said Martinez, whose squad have just returned from a warm weather training break in Qatar. 'We have players performing in that number 10 position – Ross Barkley and Steven Naismith - and with Romelu and Arouna we are strong in that department. 'We are not looking at this window to find solutions. We worked in the summer to find solutions so the work is to get players back in confident mood. We have not lost any of the talent of last season. Saying that we will always try to use the window in our favour. The work now is to recover the confident mood of the players.' Kone has scored just one goal since moving to Everton for £5million in 2013 . Romelu Lukaku (left) and Kone (right) are now the only two recognisable first team strikers at the club . Martinez also insisted that the penalty miss by Kevin Mirallas is now 'water under the bridge' Martinez - who insists the controversial penalty miss from Kevin Mirallas against West Brom is now 'water under the bridge' - is hopeful that key midfielder James McCarthy will be back to face Crystal Palace on Saturday. The Republic of Ireland midfielder has been sorely missed during his absence because of a hamstring problem but his manager now feels he is ready to relaunch his campaign. 'James is a very important player,' said Martinez. 'He will be refreshed and fully fit. We want him to get back and be the same way. He had been a real important part of the success that we had last season and we want him back as quick as we can. We are facing a team that is full of confidence and in a very good moment of their season. We are well aware of how difficult it will be. They have a lot of pace and defend very well. We know that we are in a position where we want to get more points. We have a chance to be ourselves again and kick start our season.

"Out on the pitches at Chelsea’s training centre in Surrey most mornings, some of the old boys are looking after the future of the club. Andy Myers, Jon Harley, Jody Morris, Eddie Newton and Tore Andre Flo are among the former players employed in various coaching roles by Chelsea’s head of youth development Neil Bath. In a couple of years’ time, assuming John Terry winds down his playing career at the highest level, Chelsea will need a strategy for another player they consider to be one of their own. John Terry has been Mr Chelsea since signing his first professional contract with the club in 1997 . The Blues captain has a contract at Stamford Bridge that takes him beyond his 35th birthday . There are lessons to be learned following the botched handling of Frank Lampard’s last summer after 13 years and 211 goals as a Chelsea player. ‘I didn’t even get to say goodbye to the fans,’ he complained in an interview last weekend. He has made it clear how much that small gesture would have meant to him. In the great debate about Lampard’s perceived treachery for joining Manchester City, take a moment to think about him attending the funeral of former Chelsea physio George Price on Monday. Lampard had to ask Manuel Pellegrini for permission to travel south to be at the church service for a man hugely respected by Chelsea players and staff, past and present. Alongside him was the captain Terry, one of Chelsea’s many representatives after he had taken a coaching session with the Under 15s at Cobham in the morning. At some point there will be a void in Terry’s life at Chelsea and it is important for the club to make sure he has a meaningful and responsible role when that moment arrives. Terry is a hero to the Chelsea fans - the 'Captain, Leader, Legend' banner is on show at Stamford Bridge . Slowly his PR is improving, taking baby steps to repair the damage caused by the FA’s decision to fine him £220,000 and ban him for four games after he racially insulted Anton Ferdinand. Terry has always protested his innocence and Chelsea backed him all the way in both Magistrates Court and the FA hearing. Terry, for all the problems over the years, remains the soul of the club. He is a blue blood. One of the biggest issues to confront is the super-salaries of the top players and persuading them to take a massive drop in income as part of a continuity package. Terry and Frank Lampard enjoyed glory-filled years as team-mates at Chelsea . But Lampard was allowed to leave Stamford Bridge last season and is at Chelsea's title rivals Man City . Terry probably earns somewhere in the region of £7.5million as a Chelsea player, but he would be a paid a fraction of that if he was on the first-team coaching staff. This is an area for Chelsea to consider, to find a way of bridging the salary gap and employing him in various areas of the club to make it appealing. The transition from player to manager is rarely smooth, but Terry has designs on succeeding Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge at some point in the future. His next playing contract, which will take him beyond his 35th birthday, is a ‘formality’ according to Mourinho. Lampard was another long-serving player who had a special place in the hearts of the Chelsea faithful . Beyond that, it is time for Chelsea to consider what is next because they simply cannot afford to let Terry leave Stamford Bridge through the back door. There are lessons to be learned from Liverpool, where their failure to make plans for Steven Gerrard’s future beyond his playing days has cost them. Most people working within the game believe this to be a mistake. Two years previously they lost another core member of that Liverpool team when they allowed Jamie Carragher to retire without thinking the consequences through. When Gerrard leaves for LA Galaxy in the summer, there is a possibility that Liverpool will field a team under Brendan Rodgers next season without a local boy in dressing room. Steven Gerrard, another one of the England old guard, is being allowed to walk away from Liverpool this year . Upstairs there are traces of the old boot room mentality, with Kenny Dalglish an ambassador of the club, but sadly the role appears to have limited responsibilities. At Manchester United, where the influence of former players has always played a large part in the club’s thinking, they always try to do the right thing. Ryan Giggs moved seamlessly on to the coaching staff when Sir Alex Ferguson retired and he is an important member of Louis van Gaal's technical set-up at Old Trafford. Others have not been forgotten, with Brian McClair (director of youth academy), Bryan Robson (global ambassador) and Sir Bobby Charlton (United director) playing significant roles. They are there to ensure continuity, to make sure that the United legend lives on and to impress the culture of the club on staff and players who have never experience life at United. It is 10 years since Mourinho, with help from Lampard and Terry, started picking up regular silverware . Terry has designs on succeeding Mourinho as manager of Chelsea one day . One day, probably long after his playing career has ended, Terry will accept that he tested Roman Abramovich to the limit over the various scrapes he has been in over the years. What cannot be ignored is his contribution to the club on the field. Last weekend, when he took to the field for Chelsea’s Barclays Premier League clash with Newcastle, he drew level with Lampard with his 648th appearance. Only Peter Bonetti (729) and Ron Harris (795), both sourced from the club’s youth team in the Sixties, are ahead of him now. At 34, Terry remains the last player to successfully graduate form Chelsea’s academy to become an established first-team player. Since 1997, when he signed his first professional contract at Stamford Bridge, no-one has rivalled him. With Terry around the place, changing that could be a priority.","Chelsea must make sure John Terry has a role when he stops playing .

"Chelsea completed a £27million deal for Juan Cuadrado on transfer deadline day in a move that sat Andre Schurrle head back to Germany and Wolfsburg. Fiorentina star Cuadrado, 26, will cost the Blues an initial £23.3million which will rise to £26.8m with bonuses. Here's 10 things you need to know about Jose Mourinho's new recruit. Colombian winger Juan Cuadrado sealed a £27million switch to Chelsea from Fiorentina . Chelsea sold German Andre Schurrle to free up the funds to buy Cuadrado . 1. Watch out Willian . The first question on Chelsea fans' minds will be where will Cuadrado fit into the team? Realistically, the Colombian has quite a fight on his hands given the way Mourinho's side have been performing this season. After all, they are five points clear in the Premier League and reached the final of the Capital One Cup after beating Liverpool on Tuesday night. Mourinho has a well-established and highly-effective 4-2-3-1 system and Cuadrado is most likely to feature on the right-hand side of the trident that plays behind Diego Costa. So it's Willian that is looking over his shoulder with alarm. The Brazilian has featured in 31 matches for Chelsea this season, scoring three times and contributing three assists. It's not a spectacular record and Mourinho won't be shy in pairing his new signing with the much more in-form Oscar and Eden Hazard. Cuadrado is expected to challenge Willian for his place on the right-side of Chelsea's midfield . Jose Mourinho will likely team Cuadrado with Oscar and Eden Hazard if he retains the same system . 2. Pace to burn . The first thing Chelsea fans will notice is the raw pace Cuadrado has to offer. He will rampage down that right side, leaving defenders for dead with his speed, trickery and athleticism. Even if he starts on the bench against City (assuming all the paperwork can be completed in time), Cuadrado will generate quite a buzz of excitement around Stamford Bridge when he first collects the ball and zooms off. He was given the nickname 'Vespa' by his former Fiorentina team-mate Luca Toni in reference to the ubiquitous scooters that nip in and out of the traffic on Italian city streets. Cuadrado likes to do the same with defenders, nimbly weaving in between them with his close control. Cuadrado takes off on a run for Colombia during their World Cup match with Uruguay last summer . 3. And work rate to match . You always got the impression Mourinho demanded a little bit more from Schurrle in terms of work rate, including the all-important tracking back when Chelsea attacks broke down. While Cuadrado's primary purpose will be to carry Chelsea forward, he does muck in with the defensive work too and that will be appreciated by Branislav Ivanovic, manager and fans alike. 4. What about his scoring record? As with all Chelsea's creative players, Cuadrado will be expected to chip in with a few goals as well. It's a part of his game that the winger has worked hard on and his scoring rates have improved with every season in Italy. Speaking in 2013, Cuadrado revealed how he'd worked hard at improving this aspect of his game. 'I spend hours and hours shooting at goal after training,' he said. 'Who knows how angry the goalkeepers Neto and (Cristiano) Lupatelli are at having to hang back with me before they're able to hit the showers.' Cuadrado celebrates after scoring for Fiorentina in the Coppa Italia match with Atalanta this month . Cuadrado moved to Udinese from Independiente Medellin, one of the leading clubs in his homeland, in 2010. During his youth career, he was actually a striker but didn't really have a good enough scoring record and so the coaches thought his electric pace would be better utilised out wide. He failed to find the net in his two seasons with Udinese before a season-long loan to Lecce in 2011-12 kick-started his career. There, he scored three goals in 33 matches to get the ball rolling and since moving to Fiorentina, Cuadrado has scored 26 times in 106 outings. Cuadrado celebrates after converting a penalty in Colombia's win over Japan at the World Cup . 5. What about setting up goals for others? Again, this is an area that has improved with age for Cuadrado, whose crossing and passing in the final third has become more assured and incisive. At the World Cup last summer, Cuadrado finished joint-top of the tournament's assist chart with Germany's Toni Kroos on four apiece. Kroos, however, played in two matches more. Two of Cuadrado's came as Greece were swept aside 3-0 in Colombia's opening group match and he also scored a penalty in the third group game, a 4-1 win over Japan. And in the last-16 clash with Uruguay, after Rodriguez had scored his award-winning volley, Cuadrado soared into the air to cushion a very high cross down for the top scorer to grab a crucial second. For Fiorentina, he registered 11 assists last season and has three so far this term. Yet another choreographed dance routine involving Cuadrado - this time for Fiorentina . 6. He knows how to celebrate in style . Most people will remember Cuadrado from the vibrant Colombia side that reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup last year. Though James Rodriguez was the undoubted star in Jose Pekerman's team, Cuadrado played an integral part as his assist record testifies. The Colombian celebrations also stick in the memory - those colourful, choreographed dance routines that even involved the substitutes on the touchline. Perhaps we'll see Chelsea inventing their own signature moves soon. Cuadrado does enjoy a backflip too, so stand clear! The winger celebrates in typically flamboyant fashion after scoring for Fiorentina against Guingamp . 7. He's a tough cookie . One of the things Mourinho and Chelsea fans need to be reassured about is whether Cuadrado can cope with the robust and physical nature of the English game. The evidence so far suggests that he's pretty resilient. Cuadrado has consistently been one of the most fouled players in Serie A, unsurprising given that defenders don't take too kindly to being made to look like fools. But his athleticism means he can withstand most challenges and his injury history is very encouraging. He missed five games for Fiorentina in September 2013 but that's about it. 8. His early years were far from easy . Cuadrado was born in the coastal town of Necocli, which is one of the oldest settlements in Colombia, though he was raised further south in the city of Tumaco. His father, Guillermo, a truck driver, was shot dead when he was just five years old. Speaking on a Colombian interview show, his mother Marcela said he had to be the perfect student in order to play football. Playing as a forward, Cuadrado started out at Atletico Uraba but on the recommendation of the club's founder Nelson Gallego, he was moved to the wing. After a brief spell at second division side Rionegro, where he mostly languished on the bench, he was signed by Independiente Medellin, one of the country's biggest clubs, in 2008. Cuadrado scored on his debut against Boyaca Chico and the wheels were soon in motion. Cuadrado holds off the challenge of Brazil's Marcelo in the World Cup quarter-final in Fortaleza . 9. Italian jobs . Cuadrado only actually spent one season at Independiente. He attracted interest from Italian clubs and joined Udinese on a five-year contract in July 2009. Opportunities were initially limited for the then-21-year-old, who made just 12 appearances in his first season and the same number in his second, failing to score a goal in either. A change of scenery was probably a good idea and he was sent out to fellow Serie A side Lecce for the 2011-12 campaign. With more regular football, Cuadrado started to show his talents, scoring three goals and setting up two more in a season of 33 league appearances. It wasn't enough to keep Lecce in the top flight but his performances did catch the eye of Fiorentina. They paid £4.5m for a 50 per cent ownership stake in Cuadrado. Cuadrado in action for Lecce during his loan spell at the Italian Serie A club from Udinese . In his first season at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, he opened his account in a 4-1 win over Cagliari and finished the season with five goals and seven assists as the Viola finished fourth. But 2013-14 was his breakthrough season, with a string of impressive performances leading to 15 goals and 11 assists in all competitions. The most important came against his former club Udinese in the semi-final, second leg of the Coppa Italia, securing a 3-2 aggregate success and a place in the final against Napoli (which they lost 3-1). The winger became a popular figure at Lecce for his dance celebrations with team-mate Luis Muriel . 10. International honours . Cuadrado earned his first international call-up for Colombia a year after his transfer to Udinese, playing and scoring against Venezuela in September 2010. Since then, he has been a regular in the side, with 37 caps and five goals to his name.","Juan Cuadrado sealed £27m switch from Fiorentina to Chelsea .

"Online store Cafe Press has come under fire for selling baby clothes with pornographic content and merchandise which activists say promote rape. The retailer, which specialises in user-customised products and gifts, has items for sale on their website printed with the slogans, 'You Smell Like Porn,' 'F**k me like a porn star,' 'Awesome butt sex,' and 'Retired XXL porn star,' among many other similar products. 132 items are available in a category labelled 'Adult Sex XXX Porn Baby Clothing', including baby and toddler onesies, shirts, bibs, and blankets. The site has also been accused of promoting rape culture and trivialising sexual assault, by selling a shirt with the slogan, 'No Means Yes, Yes Means Anal'. The slogan, 'No Means Yes and Yes Means Anal' was originally used by a sorority at Yale which yelled the saying at a women's dorm on campus . The slogan was also available on the site printed on a child's rash shirt, sparking outrage among social media users, and raising concerns about other merchandise  which overtly sexualises children. Collective Shout, a campaign movement against the objectification of women and sexualisation of girls, is calling for consumers to blacklist the website and boycott buying it's products for Christmas. Campaign managers Melinda Liszweski and Cailtin Roper said the slogans made light of sexual assault and fuelled the sexualisation of children. 'Slogans like this make a mockery of sexual assault and undermines the efforts made by society to reinforce that there are boundaries,' Ms Liszewski said. 'We’ve been trying to say for a long time that if no consent is given, it's rape, and this reverses that. More than that, children are not capable of giving consent,' she said. 132 items are available in a category labelled 'Adult Sex XXX Porn Baby Clothing', including baby and toddler onesies, shirts, bibs, and  even blankets, as seen above . The retailer, which specialises in user-customised products and gifts, has items for sale on their website printed with the slogans, 'You smell like porn,' and 'F**k me like a porn star' 'Awesome butt sex,'and 'Retired XXL porn star,' are among   products available . 'I don’t even know how they place these items under freedom of speech. There are other freedoms that need to be protected including keeping children safe from harm. There is no freedom in fuelling sex towards children.' The Twitter page for Cafe Press has been bombarded with customers expressing their anger at the products, calling the incident 'sick', 'disgusting', 'despicable', and 'reckless', and claiming that the slogans perpetuate rape culture. 'This is disgusting. How can you justify selling this kind of thing?' asked one Twitter user. The site reportedly operates on user-generated content uploaded by individuals, where any member can load designs which is then available on all types of merchandise. Collective Shout's Ms Roper said that the organisation had contacted the company nearly two years ago, drawing attention to the inappropriate merchandise, and were told that there was a 'computer glitch' that had allowed the products to fall through the cracks. Despite promising that they would modify the system to ensure that the products were not available for purchase, Cafe Press has allegedly not taken action and has continued to sell items which Ms Roper said take a 'pornified, pro-rape' stance. Collective Shout's Ms Roper said that the organisation had contacted the company nearly two years ago, drawing attention to the inappropriate merchandise . Despite promising that they would modify the system to ensure that the products were not available for purchase, Cafe Press has allegedly not taken action . These items were available on the website until 2013, when Collective Shout campaigned to have them removed from the store . 'Cafe Press are serial offenders. This not the first time this has happened, and they have known about this issue for a long time,' Ms Roper said. 'Every time someone alerts them to the issue, they say that they had no idea, and promise to do something, but have failed repeatedly,' she said. Two of Collective Shout's spokespeople tested the company's promise a month after it was made, and were able to not only order, but receive in the mail, baby onesies with the slogans 'SL_T all I need is the U', and 'Incest: good thing it's illegal otherwise everyone and their sister would be doing it.' At least one item available on Cafe Press with pornographic content was specifically designed for a baby, with a onesie featuring the slogan 'No, my mommy does not like it in the ass. I'm here, aren't I?'. After spotting the 'No Means Yes' shirt this week, Ms Roper contacted the company via Twitter  to seek immediate action, and was told that 'like before.. You must contact our content usage department for further assistance.' Ms Roper and other Twitter users were quick to point out that it was not their responsibility to draw the company's attention to their own products, and raised the point that the items should not have been created in the first place. 'Its really clear that Cafe Press either doesn't care, or has no control over what they actually sell,' said one Twitter user. Campaign managers Melinda Liszweski (left) and Caitlin Roper (right) said the slogans made light of sexual assault and fuelled the sexualisation of children . 'Cafe Press are serial offenders. This not the first time this has happened, and they have known about this issue for a long time,' Ms Roper said . Twitter users were quick to point out that the items should not have been created in the first place . Another user suggested that the website should have a policy that ensures that offensive user content is vetted and removed, which Ms Roper said should be standard practice in a company as large and lucrative as Cafe Press, which has been established for 15 years and has in excess of 13 million members. ‘I think it’s a massive issue using children's clothing to promote what they would called 'adult sexual humour', even though it's clearly rape 'humour',' Ms Roper said. 'It's highly inappropriate, and not just distasteful but entirely unacceptable,' she said. 'The 'No Means Yes' slogan did not come out of nowhere, it came from fraternities at Yale who stood outside women's dorms and yelled it at them.' Ms Roper said that the slogan normalises serious crimes against women and makes it more difficult for people to have empathy for victims and survivors of sexual assault and rape. ‘Imagine being a victim of rape or sexual violence and seeing this slogan,' Ms Roper said. 'This is inhumane violence that has been done to you, and other people are seeing it as a punchline.' Collective Shout will shortly be releasing their annual Christmas blacklist, which details companies that objectify women and sexualise children. A spokesperson for CafePress told Daily Mail Australia that they had 'taken action to extensively remove the offensive content' from their site. 'Please know that these designs do not reflect the views of CafePress employees and we regret any offense or concern caused by the images in question,' the spokeswoman said. ‘CafePress is an automated service that allows users to upload merchandise designs into online shops and/or the CafePress marketplace. ‘At times, users may upload designs that others find distasteful or offensive, but are nevertheless consistent with our policies for expressions and content on our website. We encourage our customers to notify us at cup@cafepress.com if they see user content on CafePress that they feel violate our policies.'","Cafe Press has been accused of promoting rape culture and encouraging the sexualisation of children .

"At White Hart Lane last Wednesday, Burnley manager Sean Dyche turned to the fourth official and asked him: ‘What’s the ******* point of having that (the earpiece) if you don’t ******* tell him.’ It was over something innocuous, debating whether Tottenham Hotspur should have been awarded a corner in the moments leading up to Mauricio Pochettino’s team scoring their third in this FA Cup replay. Managers at the very highest level of the game have had enough of this lottery, frustrated by the match officials’ seemingly random decisions. Sadly the modern training methods used by clubs in the Premier League means that the game is drifting further and further away from the referees. Burnley boss Sean Dyche (left) was left frustrated with decisions during the match with Tottenham Hotspur . Dyche did not believe Spurs should have been awarded a corner in the build-up to Vlad Chiriches' goal . Referee Craig Pawson was the official on the receiving end of Dyche's frustrations last week .

Replays show referee Mike Dean appearing to be looking at where the ball is and the off-the-ball action . Santi Cazorla (left) puts a right footed penalty past the diving Joe Hart to give Arsenal the lead from the spot . The official that night at White Hart Lane was Craig Pawson. At 35 he is something of a spring chicken compared with Chris Foy (52), Phil Dowd (51), Mike Dean (46) or Martin Atkinson (43), but what chance do they really have of keeping up with 20 Premier League outfield players for 90 minutes? The answer is none. Last weekend’s round of fixtures in the Barclays Premier League brought another fresh round of debatable decisions, all of which could be solved with the assistance of some video technology. Even Arsene Wenger admitted that Arsenal had been fortunate to earn a penalty at the Etihad on Sunday when Nacho Monreal collided with Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany. At Turf Moor, Phil Dowd failed to spot Burnley’s Scott Arfield throwing Crystal Palace defender Joel Ward off the ball (and off the pitch) for Burnley’s second goal. Jose Fonte appeared to handle at St James’ Park during Southampton’s impressive victory over Newcastle United. On Monday evening at Goodison Park, Everton could easily have been awarded a another penalty when West Bromwich Albion defender Claudio Yacob appeared to throw Stephen Naismith into the goal during the 0-0 draw with Tony Pulis’ team. The reality is that we are asking a group of guys, most of them in their mid-thirties upwards, to make the correct calls when they are on the move. At least in tennis and cricket, both fast moving sports, the officials are stationary when they make a decision, and they usually have the benefit of video technology for further assistance. The Premier League is operating in an era when the game’s speed merchants can run sub-11-second 100 metres and there isn’t a top referee in world football who can keep up with the sprint kings. It is little wonder then that referees, who cannot recover aerobically in anywhere near the same time as a 20-something player in peak physical condition. They cannot keep up. The test for international UEFA referees has changed in recent years from a 12-minute continuous test around a running track in which the official had to run 2,700 metres. Since then it has moved on, split into two sections designed to test speed and endurance. The first tests speed, with referees given a running start to complete six 40m sprints in less than six seconds, each with a 90-second recovery. A Premier League player would not even break sweat. A test for stamina is the second part of the elite referees’ test, with 10 laps of the 400m track (10 x 150m in sub-30secs) with a recovery in between. That’s meat and drink to a Premier League player. In the past, various studies have indicated that fatigue plays a part in the ability to make cognitive decisions. Premier League referees, tiring in the second half of the game, are most likely to make errors as the clock ticks down. Despite the inconsistencies, change seems a long way off because it will need six of the eight members of the International Football Association Board to vote in favour of technology. Four of the board members are from FIFA and the other four are picked from each home nation. Change is rarely swift. It took an age for the goalline decision system to be approved, but it is rarely called upon. The bigger decisions take place in other areas of the field. On Sunday, after Arsenal’s ultra-impressive victory over the defending champions at the Etihad, Wenger admitted he was in favour of video assistance for offsides and fouls. Referees’ chief Mike Riley and the recently-retired Howard Webb have visited Holland recently, where the a trial system is in place for the fourth official to use video technology. Jose Fonte went unpunished for this clear handball despite referee Bobby Madley having a clear view . Newcastle United's Emmanuel Riviere protested to referee Madley, who waves his appeals away . Despite Riviere's impassioned appeals to the official, Newcastle were not awarded the penalty . Replays clearly showed Jan Vertonghen to be inside his own half as he ran clear to score a disallowed goal . The Belgian's celebrations were cut short when assistant Stuart Burt inexplicably flagged for offside . Crystal Palace were frustrated by Danny Ings' goal as they thought there was a foul by a Burnley defender . West Bromwich Albion's Claudio Yacob (left) clearly has both hands on Everton striker Steven Naismith (right) Yacob appears to make clear contact with Naismith inside the area at Goodison Park on Monday night . Naismith is on the verge of falling inside the area with Yacob clearly all over him with both of his arms . Alan Pardew (right) remonstrated to referee Phil Dowd after the official blew just before a Palace corner . Premier League footballers, like Liverpool's Raheem Sterling, can run super-fast speeds for long periods . Top-level officials cannot be expected to keep up with Premier League players for 90 minutes alone . Alexis Sanchez and other stars are ultra-fit and can keep running at high speeds for extended periods . Fatigue causes cognitive decision-making to become more difficult, so referees need extra help . If Wenger’s ideas are to be taken on board, then the ability to use instant replays to determine fouls and, by extension, simulation can only help the game in this area. Most people would welcome that, particularly in an age when overseas players are being encouraged to protect themselves by refining their falling technique to a) prevent injury and b) to win free-kicks. This is a modern scourge, one of the biggest issues confronting the game at this moment. With the technology in place, it would lead to a far greater understanding of the game. Referees' chief Mike Riley visited Holland to see a trial system where the fourth official used video technology . Technology would've been able to assist referees in making difficult decisions at key moments last weekend .","Last weekend's Premier League games saw several controversial decisions .

"Few honeymooners could hope for such a magical moment. But one photographer celebrating his wedding was lucky enough to witness a stretch of beach lit up by bioluminescent phytoplankton. Will Ho stumbled upon the awe-inspiring sight on a windy night in the Maldives. Scroll down for video . The minute creatures are thought to emit light when they are stressed and as Mr Ho said the evening was a windy one, it is likely the organisms were agitated by waves (pictured) Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by a living organism. It occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi and microorganisms such as phytoplankton. The word comes from the Greek 'bios' for living and the Latin 'lumen' for light. Bioluminescence is a type of light energy produced by a chemical reaction. Different types of animals use bioluminescence in different ways. Deep sea squid use it for counter illumination camouflage so they match their environmental light, but Anglefish use it to lure prey with a light-up dangling appendage from their head that draws in smaller fish, which they can eat. Fireflies use bioluminescence to attract mates by flashing their abdomens, while their larvae use it to repel predators. Millipedes also glow to put predators off of eating them. The Taiwanese photographer saw tiny organisms, which glow like fireflies, riding waves and being washed up on the beach, to create dazzling patterns in the shallow water. The minute creatures are thought to emit light when they are stressed and as Mr Ho said the evening was a windy one, it is likely the organisms were agitated by crashing waves. He took a couple of photos of glowing footsteps, which are caused as the organisms can be present in wet beach and get stressed when they are trodden on, making it possible for a person to see an illuminated path of where they have walked. While bioluminescent phytoplankton has . been known about for some time, it is only recently that biologists have . worked out what causes them to glow. The photographer, who was celebrating his wedding, was lucky enough to witness a stretch of beach lit up by bioluminescent phytoplankton . The Taiwanese photographer captured tiny . organisms, which glow like fireflies, riding waves and being washed up . on the beach, to create dazzling patterns in the shallow water. The bioluminescent phytoplankton can survive in the sand and glow if they are trodden on, so that footsteps are illuminated (pictured right) Marine Biologist Jorge Ribas told Discovery News the water is filled with bioluminescent phytoplankton called Lingulodinium polyedrum. The microorganisms glow when stressed and reasons for their agitation include strong waves, a kayaker’s paddle splashing the water or a surfer carving up the water. Mr Ho said: 'It was lucky for me to see such beautiful scenery and I took several pictures as great memories, but it's sad to see the garbage on the beach (centre) when I zoomed in the picture in my laptop.' He took the photos on a beach in the Maldives near a Thai restaurant that can be seen lit up in the background . ‘It was lucky for me to see such beautiful scenery and I took several pictures as great memories, but it's sad to see the garbage on the beach when I zoomed in the picture in my laptop,’ Mr Ho wrote on his Flickr page. The glowing beach phenomenon has been spotted around San Diego, California on a fairly regular basis since 1901, but there, the water appears slightly red because of an algal bloom, known as a red tide. Mr Ho took photos of glowing footsteps and glowing clusters of the plankton on the beach (pictured), which are caused as the organisms can be present in wet sand and get stressed when they are trodden on, making it possible for a person to see an illuminated path of where they have walked .

"Sandhole farm in Congleton, Cheshire has welcomed an unlikely guest, a long-haired creature from almost 5,000 miles away called the Himalayan yak. The mammoth-like beast, which is normally found in the chilly climates of Tibet, Russia and Mongolia, weighs half a tonne. The width between the tip of the left horn and the tip of the right horn is 4ft. Unlike traditional cows, the yak does not make a 'mooing' sound and instead makes a grunting noise similar to that of a pig. A year and a half ago, Helen and Matthew Worth became the first people to breed the yak in the UK. Holy yak: This fierce looking bovid weighs half a tonne. The breed originates from been the Himalayas and the animals normally live in freezing temperatures on the Tibetan plateau . The yak, pictured here with one of its calves, can survive in temperatures as low as - 40 degrees. The animals have wide horns and are nimble on their feet . Helen and Matt Worth own a 200 acre farm in Congleton, Cheshire. Vet Mrs Worth completed a diploma in Bovine reproduction at The University of Liverpool after her first veterinary degree . After researching yaks for 18 months, the couple imported the bull and three female yaks from Germany and Holland. They have already produced two pure-bred calves, by impregnating traditional holstein cows and hope to produce another bull. Their yaks are covered in a mass of . thick, wiry hair to keep them warm in their native climates and have . enormous horns to help shovel thick snow. Wild yaks - Bos grunniens in Latin - can grow up to seven feet tall and weigh up to a tonne. And a yak could soon be coming to a village near you because the couple has since sold the bull's semen to some six farmers. In a few months when their new herd is ready, Mr and Mrs Worth will be visiting local gastropubs and farmers market to promote the meat- said to be incredibly lean and low in cholesterol and saturated fat. Yak has long been eaten in countries such as India and Tibet. Yak milk and butter is also used as an alternative to traditional milk and butter. The hair is used to make blankets and . clothes and is even used in the UK for wigs worn in theatrical . performances. The meat is already popular in America, with yak burgers, yak stew and yak roast on restaurant menus. Health benefits of yak can be compared to chicken but the taste is similar to traditional beef. The yaks eat the same food as traditional cows and have similar temperaments. But their fur is much longer and they have horns measuring 4ft from the extremity of the left horn to the end of the right . Yaks also produce healthier milk than traditional cows - and at a faster pace. A yak fetus develops at a quicker speed than a tradition cow, bringing the gestation period down from nine months to eight. This means the process of impregnating the cow again is greatly sped up, meaning they can produce more milk. Mrs Worth, a 38-year-old vet, said: 'Many farmers I work with own dairy farms and they practise block calving, where they get all their cows pregnant at the same time. Mr and Mrs Worth have imported the first yak into the UK. The hope that the trend will catch on . Yows: The half yaks are new additions to the herd at Sandhole Farm in Congleton, Cheshire . 'This is normally done in the spring time . because there is a lot of green grass available for them to feed on, so . it is economical for farmers and nutritional for the cows. 'Cows have a gestational period of nine months and it would be ideal for a cow to have a calf once a year but that gives them just three months to recover. 'I heard that other countries were breeding their cows with yaks because yak bulls have a gestational period of just eight months. Yak meat is currently not in common usage in the UK but it is already popular in America. Countries such as India and Tibet use the animal's milk to create an alternative cheese and butter. But pure-bred yaks can only produce enough milk for their calves so the yak needs to be crossed with a traditional cow. Although the taste of the meat is similar to beef, its health benefits are equivalent to chicken. Recipes containing yak meat can include: Shepherd's pie, Yak stew and Yak chilli. Although the meat is healthier than regular meat yak milk is higher in fat than traditional milk . 'It gives the cows longer to recover and more of an opportunity for them to become pregnant again.' The vet said her fascination with the animals began when she did some research and discovered that yaks had been bred for thousands of years in the Himalayas. She said: 'Families would have originally had a yak as their house cow to be used for things like milk and butter. 'Pure-bred yaks only produce enough milk for their calves however, so they started crossing them with cows. This resulted in a hybrid that produced enough for the family. 'Not only does breeding cows with yaks make the gestational period shorter but the meat itself is very lean and low in cholesterol.' The female yak is smaller than its male counterpart but has all of the same features - including its horns . Rural Cheshire is almost five thousand miles from Tibet - the traditional home of the yak. Yaks are found in the Himalayas  and as far as Mongolia and Russia. Despite their fierce appearance, the majority of yaks are domesticated animals .","Britain's first yak has been imported by Cheshire farmers Helen and Matthew Worth .

"It was ugly, it was somewhat lucky, but Hull City found victory in a game Steve Bruce called one of the biggest of his tenure to intensify Aston Villa’s relegation fears. A good occasion for Bruce to end his personal hoodoo against Paul Lambert, this his first Premier League win over his rival manager at the fifth attempt. Lambert is now under immense pressure to find a way of averting a Villa slide that grows increasingly alarming. When Dame N’Doye added a late second to Nikica Jelavic’s opening strike, a banner reading ‘Lambert Out’ was unfurled in the away section. Chants of ‘Sacked in the morning’ were sung. Home debutant Dame N'Doye runs away in celebration after scoring for his new Hull side to secure the three points against Aston Villa .

CLICK HERE to view Sportsmail's Match Zone with the heat maps and graphics from the clash at the KC Stadium. Above is new Hull recruit N'Doye’s debut heat map. The final whistle brought more calls from the travelling fans for Lambert to go. As Villa dropped into the relegation zone for the first time this season, the damning statistics mounted up. This was their 15th Premier League match without scoring, their tenth consecutive match without a win. Hull fans taunted Lambert, asking for a wave as their team coasted to victory in the closing stages. True, Allan McGregor pulled off a marvellous double save to deny Ashley Westwood from range then Christian Benteke from closer. But Abel Hernandez could have made this worse for Villa had he not lashed a shot wide when clean through. Some away fans make their feelings known at the KC Stadium as a 'Lambert out' banner is unveiled by some Aston Villa supporters . Aston Villa's record in the League since September 20 reads: . P21, W2, D6, L13, 8 goals for; 33 against - a sequence of... LLLLLLDDDWWLDLDDLLLLL . Bruce used his programme notes to describe this game as ‘mammoth’ for both clubs. Certainly of huge significance in the fight against relegation, the encounter also had an ice-age edge, played in plunging temperatures. The Hull manager would have been heartened to be able to start N’Doye, his £3million deadline day signing, up front for the first time. Having come on as a substitute in the draw at Manchester City, the Senegal striker began his full debut impressively, holding up the ball and looking for quick passes to his partner Jelavic. For the visitors, Lambert selected Scott Sinclair from the off, his first start in the Premier League since at West Bromwich Albion in December 2013 - also against Hull, coincidentally. New signing Dame N'Doye of Hull City and Ciaran Clark of Aston Villa compete for the ball during the Premier League clash on Tuesday . Hull City boss Steve Bruce puffs his cheeks during the first-half of action at the KC Stadium as his side take on Aston Villa . Fabian Delph of Aston Villa goes past Nikica Jelevic of Hull City as the England midfielder attempts to build another attack . Tom Cleverley was dropped to the bench by Lambert for the first time since joining on loan from Manchester United, ending rumours he was contractually obliged to play. Cleverley began in the dugout sitting alongside Benteke - once more out of the team - and club captain Ron Vlaar, who has lost his place following injury. All three would have been perceived as essential at the start of the season. While Villa controlled large periods of possession their attacks failed to trouble the Hull defence, a consistent theme of their slide into trouble over recent months. Any shots came from range and were usually off target. Jelavic celebrates his opener with new strike partner Dame N'Doye, who set up the Croatian to fire Hull ahead after 22 minutes . Aston Villa midfielder Carles Gil evades the challenge of Hull City's David Meyler during the Premier League match at the KC Stadium . Bruce’s team operated largely on the counter and were more incisive. Twice Jelavic would have been clear were it not for the quick thinking of Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan. In the 22th minute however, the American was left stranded. N’Doye slipped a pass to Jelavic who advanced into the box and struck a left-foot shot. Ciaran Clark slid to block but succeeded only in looping the ball over Guzan and into the net. Hugely fortunate and potentially hugely important. The KC Stadium, scene of only two previous Hull victories, let out a roar. It could have swiftly got better for those home fans. Ahmed Elmohamady swung over a cross that found N’Doye free but he miscued his header horribly wide. N'Doye of Hull attacks a cross for the home side as defender Clark and Villa keeper Guzan attempt to clear their lines . Aston Villa's midfielder Fabian Delph springs into action to keep possession away from Hull's striker Nikica Jelavic . Carles Gil was once again Villa’s most creative player, brave on the ball and in the challenge, despite his diminutive stature. He even squared up to Tom Huddlestone after one tackle. Fight perhaps, but little finesse for Villa. A signal of their listless attack came when Fabian Delph shot aimlessly from 30 yards. As the ball drifted well wide, the home fans sung ‘That’s why you’re going down.’ The same refrain was aired when Ashley Westwood sent his free-kick flying past the post. Lambert sent Benteke on for the ineffectual Andreas Weimann at the break, aware Villa’s chances of adding to four away Premier League goals would be enhanced by the Belgian’s presence. He shot wide from 18 yards with his first touch. Villa kept probing without purpose and Hull doubled the lead with 16 minutes to go. Elmohamady crossed, substitute Gaston Ramirez headed back and N’Doye arrived to poke home at the second attempt.

"According to Samir Nasri, Manchester City’s stars will live in fear if they fail to make the grade in the Champions League. Ahead of the clash with Bayern Munich, the midfielder spoke of new faces coming in at the end of the season as part of a dressing room purge. ‘Let’s be honest, we need to do something or otherwise next year it’s going to be new players,’ he claimed in the hours before they played Pep Guardiola’s team. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Samir Nasri: We needed a miracle... and we got one . Samir Nasri is closed down by Franck Ribery (left) and Jerome Boateng of Bayern Munich on Tuesday night . Nasri has a chuckle to himself during Manchester City training before the Bayern Munich clash . Samir Nasri fears Manchester City players could be sold if they crash in Europe again . Unless City’s players have been specifically warned about their futures by Manuel Pellegrini, history suggests failure in either of their twin targets will not make a blind bit of difference. Judging by City’s commitment to their current squad of players he can rest easy at night, whatever their results between now and the end of the season. This is not Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson, where he developed a habit of jettisoning players who were still at the top of their game. That policy at Old Trafford kept the dressing room on their toes, establishing a relentless drive and hunger for success. Sergio Aguero was City's saviour again on Tuesday night with a sensational hat-trick . Nobody was safe and it is part of the reason they won 13 Barclays Premier League titles, five FA Cups and two European Cups during Ferguson’s reign. He liked to keep the dressing room fresh. At City, where life is good and the money is even better, they have 17 players in the first team squad who are contracted to the club until 2017 at the very least. Yaya Toure (suspended against Bayern), Bacary Sagna, Matija Nastasic, Gael Clichy, Pablo Zabaleta, Willy Caballero, Fernandinho, Jesus Navas and Alvaro Negredo, on loan at Valencia, have contracts until 2017. There is a bigger commitment to Stevan Jovetic, Aleksandar Kolarov and Edin Dzeko, who are all tethered to the Barclays Premier League champions until 2018. City manager Manuel Pellegrini (right) is unlikely to jettison players if his side flop in Europe again . Bigger still are the contracts recently signed by five players - Sergio Aguero, captain Vincent Kompany, David Silva, Eliaquim Mangala and Nasri - to keep them at the Etihad until 2019. In short, they are going nowhere. Successful contract negotiations are usually good news for supporters. After last season’s success, stability seemed important. They have a different way of doing things at City and recent history suggests these players will be safe as houses at the end of the season. The big clear-out of star names has never actually occurred. Since the big money came to the blue half of Manchester, Carlos Tevez (who left for Juventus in 2013), Gareth Barry, Javi Garcia, Kolo Toure and Mario Balotelli have exited the club. None have been missed. Aguero (left) and David Silva have both signed deals with will keep them at City until 2019 . When United were kings of Manchester, they did things a lot differently under Ferguson. Nobody was safe. Last week, after the former United midfielder Michael Stewart helped Scotland’s press team to a 7-1 victory over England’s media side, he gave a fascinating insight into Fergie’s methods. Stewart only made a handful of appearances for the club after graduating from Eric Harrison’s academy side, but he witnessed the manager's ruthless streak on many occasions. For the top players the threat of leaving United was real and that power strengthened the manager’s position within the dressing room. Ferguson ruled the roost. Sir Alex Ferguson ruled Old Trafford with an iron fist when he was Manchester United manager . David Beckham was sold by Ferguson because the boss thought the midfielder was trying to undermine him . The most successful manager in United history occasionally got it wrong and he has apologised countless times for his ‘senior moment’ when he sold Jaap Stam to Lazio in 2002. In his most recent book - My Autobiography - he makes no apology for allowing some of the biggest players in United’s history to leave at a time when they believed they were at the top of their game. There are countless examples. Despite the success of the title-winning teams in the Nineties he sold Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, Andrei Kanchelskis, Lee Sharpe and Gary Pallister at various times. In 2003 he sold David Beckham to Real Madrid for £25million all in after claiming that the midfielder had deliberately attempted to undermine him in front of the supporters. Paul Ince (left) was sold in 1995 despite being a driving force in Ferguson's first two title triumphs . Juan Sebastian Veron was moved on because Ferguson ‘couldn’t find a position for him’ and Ruud van Nistelrooy was sold to Real Madrid: ‘He became a really difficult boy. I don’t think he was popular by the end’. Mark Bosnich, who had issues with his weight according to Ferguson, was sold to Chelsea after calling to order a Chinese takeaway in front of the United manager. Owen Hargreaves, signed from Bayern Munich in 2007, was ‘a disaster’. And there was no room for sentimentality - captains and iconic figures Bryan Robson and Steve Bruce were moved on in the mid-Nineties. Ruud van Nistelrooy was flogged to Real Madrid when he 'became a really difficult boy' Juan Sebastian Veron (right) was moved on because Ferguson 'couldn't find a position for him' Ferguson liked to keep that dressing room living in fear of change, to remind players that United always had a replacement in mind. City have been busy accumulating players, some very good ones at that, but they operate under a different set of criteria at the Etihad. They have kept all their big names sweet by tying them to lucrative, long-term contracts as part of a strategy to keep the club at the top of English football. Beyond the money, they need to find a different way to motivate them. The sale of Jaap Stam (left) is Ferguson's main regret and something he puts down to a 'senior moment' VIDEO Pellegrini proud of City fightback .","Samir Nasri said earlier this week Manchester City players would be sold if they did not improve their performances .

"The Home Counties outbreak of TB in cats was a 'wake-up call' that justifies the continued badger cull, Owen Paterson said. The Environment Secretary announced that the controversial pilot cull of badgers in Gloucestershire and Somerset would continue this year. But he postponed a roll-out of the pilots to other areas after an expert panel criticised the effectiveness of last-year's cull. Princess Anne's remarks have been met with fury from animal rights campaigners and zoologists, who argue that gassing - which was banned in 1982 - is inhumane (file picture) Mr Paterson said an outbreak of bovine tuberculosis in nine cats in Newbury, Berkshire, demonstrated the scale of the problem. The Daily Mail revealed last week that four people caught TB from their cats last year after it was transferred from cattle, possibly via badgers. One of the victims, 19-year-old Jessica Livings, was struck down with pneumonia and had to have emergency surgery. Doctors believe Jessica and her mother, Claire, caught the disease from her kitten, Onyx. Seven of the nine affected cats had bite marks and wounds which suggested the disease had been transmitted either by badgers or other cats. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr . Paterson said: 'As we have seen graphically with the experience in . Newbury, this is a disease which does transport to other species. 'It is a zoonosis [an infectious disease] which can be caught be human beings. 'In the Newbury example, it looks as though the cats had the same spoligotype as cattle. Last month Jessica Livings, 19, revealed she had caught TB while cleaning an open wound on her pet cat, Onyx . 'There is not yet a direct link with badgers, but it may be that badgers had the same type of TB. 'It just shows it is a real wake up call to us all, that this is a deadly serious disease. 'We've got to address it, not just in cattle but also in wildlife, because we want to have healthy cattle, healthy wildlife and healthy humans.' Bovine TB is a huge problem which has devastated Britain's farming industry. The spread of the disease is thought to be accelerated by badgers, and it can also be passed to other animals including cats, rodents and deer. Around 40 people a year catch bovine TB, usually from unpasteurised milk or from working closely with infected cows. But the Newbury outbreak was the first documented case in the world of humans catching the disease from cats. The two pilot badger culls, in West Gloucestershire and West Somerset, will continue with improvements recommended by an independent expert panel, said Mr Paterson. The panel's report said more and better trained marksmen were needed. The study found that less than 48 per cent of badgers in the Somerset area were killed, and less than 39 per cent in Gloucestershire, compared to the 70 per cent which scientific research says is needed to cut TB in livestock. It also found that a number of badgers took more than five minutes to die, others were hit but not retrieved and some were possibly missed altogether. Mr Paterson said plans to expand the culls to ten other areas have been cancelled. He said: 'The four year culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire are pilots and we always expected to learn lessons from them. 'It is crucial we get this right. That is why we are taking a responsible approach, accepting recommendations from experts to make the pilots better. 'Doing nothing is not an option. Bovine TB is a terrible disease which is devastating our cattle and dairy industries and causing misery for many people in rural communities. 'We need to do everything we can, as set out in our strategy, to make England TB free.' The Government and farmers insist culling is necessary to tackle the disease which saw more than 26,000 cattle slaughtered in England last year, but opponents say it is inhumane and ineffective and alternatives such as vaccination should be pursued. Opponents of the cull were quick to criticise the decision to push on with the plans. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said plans to expand the culls to ten other areas have been cancelled . Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle said Mr Paterson was declaring 'open season' on badgers. She said: 'There is no strategy here, this is an unscientific fudge for you to try and save face. 'How can you possibly justify continuing a method of killing, free shooting, which has been found to be inhumane by the independent scientific advisors? 'You ignore scientific evidence, make a decision based on your own prejudice and then offer retrospectively to tell me and others what the policy is and expect us to agree with you. ;If you proceed as described, your culls can no longer called evidence-based policy... what you have announced now is an open season on badgers in the culling areas.' MP Tracey Crouch, a prominent Tory opponent of the cull, said the pilot culls were 'a cruel, indiscriminate and ineffective means of culling badgers'. She told Parliament: 'The culls were an expensive failure and as a consequence bovine TB could in fact spread to areas that are currently free of the disease.' The British Veterinary Association, which supported the cull pilots, criticised Mr Paterson for failing to consult it and other interested parties. President Robin Hargreaves said it would examine the 'concerns about the humaneness and efficacy' raised by the report before deciding its response. He said: 'We have made it clear that we can only support badger culling if the method used is humane, safe and effective. 'That is why BVA called for controlled shooting to be tested and critically evaluated against these criteria by an independent group of experts.' But National Farmers Union president Meurig Raymond said: 'Obviously there is bitter disappointment within the farming community that we are not extending the roll-out of the culling strategy at this time.'","Owen Paterson says cull in Somerset and Gloucestershire will continue .

"When the sun is shining, it’s tempting to take an impromptu day trip or mini-break to the seaside. But pet owners who want a day or two off from their beloved cat or dog need to ensure their pet will still get regular meals. Now one entrepreneur has come up with an automatic pet food dispenser to solve this problem and provide food while owners are away. Scroll down for video . One entrepreneur has come up with an automatic pet food dispenser to provide food while owners are away. Here, a black labrador waits for his meal to be dispensed by the Wi-Fi connected PetPal feeder . The stainless steel cylinder measures 32inches (81cm) tall and 11inches (28cm) in diameter. It connects to a Wi-Fi network so owners can feed their pets remotely. Owners communicate with the feeder using an Android or iOS app. The feeder dispenses a measured meal five times in 24 hours and can be used manually by pushing the lid if owners are at home. Users can take a photo and video of their pet using the app. The feeder also has a motion sensor and can take a 30 second video when movement is detected. When food is low, an email is sent to owners to remind them to top the feeder up. The feeder claims to be waterproof and raccoon and squirrel-proof. The stainless steel cylinder can be programmed to provide meals at certain times of the day, or a user can remotely control it using an app on their smartphone or tablet. Unlike other automatic feeders, the PetPal can take photos and videos of dogs and cats and allows absent owners to talk to their pet via a built-in microphone and speaker. The device was invented by Ken Powers in California, who came up with the idea after he struggled to find someone to feed his two cats when he went on holiday. Powers, who works as an electrical engineer, said: ‘I wanted to be able to interact with the cats while I was on vacation.’ ‘I have been in the electronics business . for 30 years, so once I committed to making a feeder, I wanted to make . the best feeder on the market. The stainless steel cylinder can be programmed to provide meals at certain times of the day or a user can remotely control it using an app on their smartphone or tablet. The app (pictured) also lets people watch a live stream of their hungry pets . ‘The cats needed to be fed outside, and the feeder had to prevent the raccoons from taking all the food. ‘The PetPal feeder easily connects to your Wi-Fi network, and you connect to your PetPal via an Android or iOS app.' He explained users of the high tech dispenser can feed animals up to five times a day, or log in using the app to decide when to feed their pets themselves. Unlike other automatic feeders, the PetPal (pictured) can take photos and videos of dogs and cats and allows absent owners to talk to their pet via a built-in microphone and speaker . ‘You can talk, listen, feed, watch and take photos and videos. There is even motion detection which takes 30 second videos of your pet,' Powers continued. The feeder measures 32 inches (81cm) tall and has a diameter of 11 inches (28cm). Powers failed to secure the funding he needed for the device on a recent Kickstarter campaign, but is intent on raising cash to put the invention into manufacture in other ways. There is currently no indication as to when the feeder will be available to buy, however. It is estimated to cost £217 ($365) and Powers aims to reduce the price to £178 ($299) once PetPal is mass produced. The device was invented by Ken Powers, in California, who came up with the idea after he struggled to find someone to feed his two cats when he went on holiday. Food shoots out of the cylinder into a bowl that is attached (pictured) up to five times a day .","PetPal feeder can be programmed to provide meals at certain times of the day and is controlled remotely using an app .

"Rampage: Truc Hyunh attacked a customer who complained about bad service before brandishing a butter knife at officers and kicking them as she was dragged away . An Idaho waitress was arrested after hitting a customer, threatening cops with a butter knife and then kick them as she was hauled out of a Vietnamese restaurant where she worked, police said. Truc Hyunh’s rampage Saturday afternoon at Pho 79, in Boise, started when a customer complained of bad service – she hit the customer in the face, authorities said. Hyunh, 29, told KBOI the wild waitress has a history of problems and that she spent three months in a hospital last year, they hope she gets help after this latest incident. ‘She hit the customer. I hear boom. I go out and tell her no no no,’ Pho 79 owner Henry Do recalled to KBOI. Police soon showed up, and officers noticed ‘physical evidence of the battery on the victim, including a bruise on the victim's jaw,’ according to a Boise Police press release. The cops confronted her in the kitchen and she pulled a butter knife on them, Do recalled. Do was standing in the doorway to the dining room and they were standing in a small area barely big enough for three people when she became aggressive, he said. Hyunh grabbed the knife, positioned herself in ‘a fighting stance and verbally challenged the officers,’ police said. Weapo0n of choice: Hyunh threatened police with this butter knife, according to Pho 79 owner Henry Do . Where it happened: At Boise Vietnamese restaurant Pho 79 . Grand exit: Hyunh reportedly kicked the officers who dragged her out of the establishment . They eventually convinced the mother of five to put the knife down and arrested her, but she repeatedly kicked police as she was dragged out, both Do and authorities said. She was charged with felony battery on a police officer, misdemeanor resisting arrest and obstructing an officer, authorities said. Both the customer and Do declined to press charges, but Hyunh was booked into the ADA County Jail and has yet to be released. Do said told KBOI she no longer works at the restaurant though. ‘If she come back? No,’ he said while shaking his head.","Truc Hyunh reportedly hit a customer in the face who complained of bad service .

"Nadine Williams outside Swansea Crown Court. The transvestite, formerly known Dean Williams, is on trial charged with rape . A transvestite showed his friend his collection of female women's outfits and shoes and gave her a tour of a sex dungeon before raping her, a court has heard. Dean Williams, also known as Nadine, was looking after the house of cross-dressing dominatrix friend Nicky and asked her to go to the bedroom as he wanted to 'show off' his female clothing. Swansea Crown Court was told that before the attack Wiliams, 38, had relied on his friend for support through his decision to cross-dress. Prosecutor Huw Rees said: 'Williams met the woman not long after he had announced he was transgender and wanted to be known as Nadine. 'He wore women’s clothes that day and was very open about his cross-dressing. 'The woman said she would support him through this period of change.' Williams, of Port Talbot, South Wales, denies rape and two charges of assault by penetration. Mr Rees described how the victim agreed to go with Williams for drinks and a meal at the Big Can pub in Neath, south Wales. Mr Rees added: 'They left the pub and went to the home of a friend of Nadine’s. 'Nadine had told her there was an S&M room there with cages, whips, chains and dominatrix apparatus on the walls in an upstairs bedroom they called The Dungeon. 'Nadine asked if she wanted to see the dungeon and his women’s clothes. 'They went into the room and Nadine suggested they try out some of the equipment but she declined. 'Nadine kissed her and she pushed him away and told him not to be so stupid. He offered to show her his clothes and they went into the next bedroom where he pushed her on the bed, straddled her and ripped off her top and bra. 'While he was doing this he was snarling and growling. 'She was trying to kick him off and she bit his shoulder. 'Her jeans and boots were removed by him and he raped her. “She said: “I told him: 'No, f*cking get off.' Accused: Williams outside Neath Magistrates Court, left, and smiling outside Swansea Crown Court earlier this week . The court heard he performed oral sex on her but she then managed to escape the bedroom and run downstairs with her top and jeans in her hand. Mr Rees described the attack, adding that Williams had forced his hands on her as she tried to re-dress, hurting her. He said : 'She was crying and couldn’t understand why it was happening. She managed to get off the settee and ran out of the house.' After her escape, the victim text  a friend: 'Help me. He just tried raping me. In a mess.' She was later found by a friend sitting on stairs and in a hysterical state. Williams was arrested at 5am and told police: 'She was here earlier on and we had sex together, but but was consensual.' After being accused of rape, Williams said that because of his condition his genitalia had receded into his . body-but the woman had pulled it back out so that they could have sex. Crime scene: The street in Neath in which the alleged rape involving Nadine Williams took place . The jury was shown tapes of the woman’s interviews with police. The woman, who is in her 30s, said: “Nadine was telling me about his cross dressing and I said I would support what he was doing. 'It was weird but I’d rather be a support to him than an enemy.' She also described her shock at being shown the sex dungeon. She said: “He was telling me he was becoming an escort and that Nicky was being paid to be a dominatrix and he was trying to get into it. 'It was a bit freaky to be honest. I was trying to laugh it off, that’s when he went for me and tried to kiss me. “He said I should get into it but I said no.' The trial continues.

"As many of us prepare to head abroad for summer holidays, many will be lamenting not starting their bikini diet months ago. But if the prospect of stripping off on the beach leaves you in a cold sweat help is at hand. Kayla Itsines, 23, from Adelaide, South Australia, has become an internet sensation with her bikini body guide earning her an astonishing one million Instagram followers, including Victoria’s Secret angel Candice Swanepoel. Scroll down for video . Kayla, who works as a personal trainer in Adelaide, Australia, began gaining fans online by posting pictures of herself and her own workouts . Kayla updates her worldwide following, which includes Victoria's Secret Angel Candice Swanepoel, daily through her social media accounts . The 23-year-old now has over one million followers on Instagram alone, all looking to achieve a body similar to hers . Kayla advocates consistency with both diet and exercise to achieve the best results . Kayla's workouts are all about high intensity circuits which focus on problem areas as well as burning as much fat as possible in the shortest time . With a body that would not look out of place on a catwalk, Kayla seems to have mastered the equation needed for an ultra slim and lean physique, coupled with a high level of fitness and strength without bulk. Speaking with Femail, Kayla shares her personalized workouts and meal plan that can help you slim down fast in time for your holiday. However she doesn’t advise crash dieting, which can ultimately lead you to pile the weight back on. ‘Girls so often fluctuate between taking their health seriously and not doing anything at all. With a body that would not look out of place on a catwalk, Kayla seems to have mastered the equation needed for an ultra slim and lean physique . ‘Nothing is worse for your body than . constantly putting it through changes like this. This frequently is the . cause of bloating, rapid weight gain or weight loss, emotional eating . and disappointment. So find a simple plan and stick to it! Consistency . is vital.’ 1. ALWAYS eat breakfast. Even if you don’t necessarily feel like it! Having a good serve of protein, carbs and fats in the morning is the best way for you to start the day! You will have lots more energy to keep you going until lunch time. 2. Try to eat three main meals and two small snacks a day. I recommend spacing out your meals 2-3 hours in between each other for convenience. I always make sure I leave the house with two nutritious snacks. Almonds and grapes are my favourite as they are easy to carry in my bag and eat on the go! 3. Take a multivitamin. Although you might feel like you are eating enough nutritious food everyday, our bodies can sometimes still lack vitamins. I take a multivitamin EVERY morning to help boost my immune system! 4. Don’t be a afraid of carbs! Carbs are key for maximum energy, stamina, concentration, recovery and better fluid balance. They are so important for people who are working out regularly because they are the primary fuel for your body. Your brain is almost entirely fueled by carbohydrates, so its pretty important you eat them. Think of carbohydrates as the gas needed to fuel a car. Without gas, a car won't run. Likewise, without carbohydrates, your body will not have the fuel it requires to run through an entire day. Carbs are an essential part of your diet, just don’t eat too many. Kayla’s pre-holiday workout consists of  targeted circuits which aim to work on specific ‘problem’ areas of the body while also burning calories. Her diet plan aims to give you plenty of energy for her intense workouts, while reducing fat and calories to help you slim down. And when it comes to food when you get to your destination, Kayla advises avoiding the traditional holiday binges. ‘I just returned from my first ever trip to Europe actually and my biggest piece of advice would definitely be to find a really good restaurant or café, that has healthy, cheap meals, and keep going back. There are so many places that both overcharge and provide some really bad versions of simple dishes. Find your favorite place/s for breakfast, lunch or dinner and keep using it. ‘As far as choosing what foods to eat, it’s pretty simple really. Do your best to follow your normal day at home. Anywhere in the world will have “similar” foods available for each meal. It’s just a matter of tailoring the slightly different options to suit your needs.’ On the beach, well tailored swimwear is essential to looking trim. ‘Wear a bikini that actually fits, especially around your bust. There is nothing worse than a bikini that is too big or too small. If you need help, take a friend shopping with you and get them to adjust sizes, as you need. ‘If you’ve got it, flaunt it! Wear a bikini to accentuate your beautiful body shape.' This breakfast is high in protein and healthy fats to keep you full and energized through the day . Breakfast – Toast with poached eggs, avocado & tomato . My favorite breakfast is toast with poached eggs, avocado, and tomato. Plus, a cup of herbal tea. I love berry tea in the mornings.

"Sandwich chain Subway may market itself as the healthy fast-food option, but its customers are not as fit as you might expect. New research has found that the more branches of Subway a country has, the more likely its population is to be obese. Nations with a high density of Subways - such as the U.S., Canada and Australia - have more people classified as being extremely overweight. By contrast, countries like Norway and Japan where there are few of the sandwich franchises also have relatively low obesity rates. Popular: But countries with many branches of Subway tend to have higher rates of obesity . The study, published in the journal Critical Public Health, blames global free trade for allowing international fast-food chains to dominate cuisine around the world. It was revealed last week that despite its healthier image, Subway meals contain more salt and nearly as many calories as those from McDonald's. However, the research published today does not single out Subway as particularly unhealthy, but instead uses it as a stand-in for all fast food, owing to its status as the world's largest restaurant chain. Scientists found the country with by far the highest concentration of the sandwich restaurants was Australia with 21.65 per 100,000 residents, followed by the U.S. with 7.52 and Canada with 7.43. These countries also had some of the highest rates of obesity, even after adjusting for other factors such as income, inequality, urbanisation, and motor-vehicle and internet use. Healthy? Researchers blame trade liberalisation for the global spread of fast food such as Subway . However, the authors admitted they could not say for sure that the density of fast-food restaurants caused obesity, but merely that it was associated with it. They also acknowledged their research did not take into account the time lag between the appearance of such restaurants and a given country's obesity epidemic, while the study was also limited to just 26 advanced economies and one fast-food chain. Nevertheless, they insist the research is an important contribution to the understanding of obesity as a global problem. They accuse groups such as the World Trade Organisation of contributing to obesity by encouraging exports of domestic goods, imports of foreign products and the opening of markets to foreign investment. The researchers dub this process 'globesization', and claim it is linked to the increasing power of international food companies, supermarkets and fast-food restaurants.","U.S., Canada and Australia have most Subways and highest obesity rates .

"A Texas dad was sentenced to six months in jail in a dispute over his child support paymetns - despite the fact that he had paid his ex-wife all that he owed her. Clifford Hall's child support payments are all caught up - he even paid back $3,000 that he says were inadvertently withheld from his ex-wife by his employer prior to the hearing. But a judge in Texas said that fact did not excuse an initial delay - leaving Hal unable to pay more child support payments as he spends time in jail. The confusion, according to Hall's attorney, Tyesha Elam, stems from someone changing the amount of Hall's mandatory child support payments without telling him. Deadbeat? Clifford Hall was sentenced to jail even though he owes no money on his child support payments . Jail: Hall is preparing to turn himself in to begin serving a six-month jail sentence . 'I discovered for some reason his employer was withholding a large . amount some weeks a small amount some weeks a zero amount some weeks,' Elam tells MyFoxHouston. Hall, saying that he 'didn't want to go to jail, basically,' paid the $3,000 balance on his child support bill prior to a November hearing in front of Judge Lisa Millard in November. At the time of the hearing, Hall owed nothing. 'Opposing counsel testified twice that he's all paid up,' says Elam. However, the attorney for Hall's ex-wife argued that he should be required to pay an additional $3,000 for his ex's attorneys fees. Judge Millard agreed. Disrespected: Judge Lisa Millard says Hall walked out of the courtroom when she found him in contempt of court . 'The Judge ended up sentencing him to 6 months in jail.' Elam says. Hall was stunned. 'When she said I remand you to the Harris County Jail for 180 days my mouth just dropped,' Hall told the station. In addition to the attorney fees, Hall apparently wasn't following the court's scheduled times to pick up his son for visits - a change to his visitation stipulations he claims he knew nothing about. Houston community activist Quanell X says he's never seen such a blatant miscarriage of justice. 'This entire situation is shocking to me,' X says. 'I've never seen one like this.' 'The court failed the child,"" he continues. 'The court failed Mr. Hall the system broke down.' Hall says that sending him to jail is not going to help him or his son. 'I can't be there for my son in jail,' Hall says. 'I can't pay child . support in jail. This is not in the best interest of the child.' Activist: Community activist Quanell X says the court has failed both the child and Hall's son . Judge Millard, however, says that when she found Hall in contempt of court, he got up and walked out of the courtroom - which is enough to anger any judge. Millard says Hall's attorneys can file a motion for reconsideration, which would allow her the opportunity to hear from both parties and reassess her decision. Hall's attorney currently is working on an appeal. Hall, meanwhile, is preparing to turn himself in to begin his sentence in a few days. As for his son, Hall says, 'I'm his father it's my responsibility to take care of him.'","Clifford Hall was sentenced to six months in jail despite not owing any money in child support .

"The chances of a team managed by Jose Mourinho giving up a seven-point lead with 14 matches left is as likely as Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert putting Chelsea’s staff on his Christmas card list. Mourinho walked off the Villa Park turf a winner for the first time — too quickly for Lambert to shake his hand — but insisted he would only see Chelsea as champions when the title was sealed. ‘A Jose Mourinho team is a team like the others,’ he said. ‘If we have a seven-point lead with two matches to go we are champions. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (right) and Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert (right) shout instructions . Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic celebrates scoring the Blues' winner at Villa Park on Saturday . Juan Cuadrado (left) takes on Villa's Cissokho as the Colombian came on for his Premier League debut . Villa’s run without scoring was the fourth worst in Premier League history. 'If we have a seven-point lead with three matches to go we need two points. And it’s not three matches, it’s 14, so there’s a long time to go.’ By May, this may well be viewed as a pivotal weekend in the title race, one when the leaders recovered from conceding to the worst attack in English football while Manchester City failed to beat lowly Hull at home. It can also be seen as another chapter in the fraught relationship between Chelsea and Villa. Lambert was left seething by the behaviour of a Mourinho ally, understood to be Rui Faria — a renowned wind-up merchant — 10 minutes before the interval. Didier Drogba went down holding his head following an aerial duel with Ciaran Clark, prompting an exchange of words in the technical areas. Lambert removed his coat as if ready for action. Eden Hazard slides and clenches his fists in celebration after putting Chelsea ahead against Villa on Saturday . Afterwards, Mourinho appeared to criticise Lambert by suggesting Villa should not be struggling near the bottom of the table. ‘If they go down it is not because of the quality of their players,’ said Mourinho. ‘I believe they are not going down. This is a big club.’ Asked if it would be Lambert’s fault if Villa dropped a division, Mourinho replied: ‘I am saying nothing. I am saying that’s football. They have more than enough.’ The pair clashed earlier this season when Mourinho tried to shake Lambert’s hand before full-time in Chelsea’s 3-0 win at Stamford Bridge. Mourinho had tongue wedged in cheek when saying Lambert and his then assistant Roy Keane were ‘very polite and well-educated people’.

Okore and Ciaran Clark run over to the Villa supporters to celebrate scoring the goal which ended the drought . Lambert seemed surprised at any praise coming from the Portuguese. ‘Whether he is trying to put pressure on me, I don’t know,’ said the Scot. ‘Was it genuine? We’ll call it genuine-ish. I would love to learn from him as a manager but I wouldn’t like to learn things off the pitch from someone in his dug-out.’ Lambert must switch his focus to more important matters. Villa travel to Hull on Tuesday for a game of great significance. Jores Okore, who scored Villa’s first Premier League goal in 11 hours, said only victory would do. ‘It’s a really big game against a team who are close to us,’ he said. ‘Those are the matches you need to win.’ Eden Hazard and Branislav Ivanovic scored the goals against Villa that increased Chelsea’s lead over City. Mourinho called the Serbian one of the club’s best signings and his winner a half-volley to make ‘every striker in the world proud’.","Chelsea beat Aston Villa 2-1 on Saturday to go seven points clear at the top .

"Mauricio Pochettino believes Harry Kane can score 30 goals for Tottenham Hotspur this season but insists the 21-year-old striker must maintain his focus and desire to improve. Not since Jurgen Klinsmann in 1994-95 has a Spurs player reached that total in a single campaign, but Kane’s brace against West Bromwich Albion brought him to 20 goals with at least 18 games left. His impressive displays have seen him strongly tipped to make Roy Hodgson’s squad for England’s forthcoming March internationals. Tottenham striker Harry Kane has been in impressive form for Mauricio Pochettino's side so far this season . Kane has been tipped to be included in Roy Hodgson's squad for England's upcoming March internationals . WEST BROMWICH ALBION (4-4-2): Foster 5; Wisdom 5.5 (Gardner 60min, 5), McAuley 5.5, Dawson 6, Lescott 5.5; McManaman 5.5 (Ideye 60, 4), Morrison 7 (Dorrans 88), Yacob 6, Brunt 6; Berahino 6, Anichebe 6.5 . Subs not used: Rose, Baird, Pocognoli, Sessegnon. Booked: Berahino, Yacob. TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR (4-2-3-1): Lloris 7.5; Walker 6.5, Fazio 6.5, Vertonghen 7, Rose 6; Paulinho 6, Mason 6.5 (Stambouli 74, 5); Lamela 6.5, Dembele 7 (Chadli 62, 6), Eriksen 8; Kane 8.5 (Soldado 88). Subs not used: Vorm, Dier, Townsend, Davies. Booked: Lamela. Scorers: Eriksen 6, Kane 15, 64 pen. MOM: Harry Kane. Referee: Kevin Friend 6.5. ‘I never put a ceiling on any player,’ said Pochettino, Tottenham’s manager. ‘If he scores 20, why not 30? If you have potential and can improve it is up to you. ‘Always a player can improve. The problem arrives when the player believes he can’t. It is important he keeps this mentality, that he is hungry to keep going.’ Kane said: ‘I set myself (a target of) 10 at the start of the season and then 20. I will set myself another little target that I will try and get to — and do it as quickly as possible. There are still a lot of games to go and I’m feeling confident on the pitch.’ Kane was deadly at The Hawthorns, providing the attacking spearhead as Spurs controlled the game in one of their most complete performances of the season. Christian Eriksen opened the scoring with a sweet free-kick in the sixth minute, cementing his reputation as an expert from set-pieces and setting the stage for his two-goal team-mate. Kane’s first was a slick and powerful finish and his second, from the penalty spot, expertly dispatched. It was Kane’s first goal from the spot, with usual penalty-taker Andros Townsend not on the pitch. Pochettino will let the players decide who takes penalties in future. ‘It’s a feeling. It’s an emotion,’ he said. ‘If it’s Andros, if it’s Harry, they decide on the pitch. They are both specialists.’ West Brom tried to mount a comeback with Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris producing three wonderful saves to deny James Morrison, Claudio Yacob and Saido Berahino while Craig Dawson hit the crossbar. Pochettino has revealed Spurs duo Kane and Andros Townsend will decide who takes future penalties . Hugo Lloris produced several world class saves to deny the likes of Saido Berahino (pictured) Christian Eriksen’s superb free-kick takes him to nine league goals for the season. That tally makes him the top scoring midfield player in the Premier League in 2014-15. But the hosts were well beaten and Albion boss Tony Pulis is desperate for reinforcements before Monday night's transfer deadline. Joleon Lescott operated at left back for the second game in succession after the FA Cup win over Birmingham, highlighting an area Pulis wants to strengthen. Lescott, a centre back, does not wish to play there regularly. ‘The manager has asked me to do a job but I came here to play centre half,’ he said. ‘I am not a left back. I might be able to hold my own now and again but we need specific players in their right positions.’ Pulis added: ‘I’m not spinning as many plates as I usually spin, but if the ones drop for us I’ll be very pleased. We’re battling away with every other team in the Premier League to try and improve.’ West Brom manager Tony Pulis is hoping to add to his squad before Monday night's 11pm transfer deadline .","Harry Kane has netted 20 times for Spurs so far this season .

"River Monster's intrepid host Jeremy Wade faced down his greatest fear when he came face-to-face with a deadly 200 pound anaconda on the latest edition of his hit show, River Monsters. The British adventurer was followed by the crew of the Animal Planet smash as he navigated the Amazon River in Brazil, searching for the culprit in a series of recent, bone-crushing human deaths in Porto de Moz, in the deepest rainforest. The dramatic encounter, which aired on Monday night, put Wade, 58, into the murky waters of the mammoth river, where he literally stumbled upon a slumbering snake he estimated to be at least 20-feet long. Scroll Down for Video . Beast: This is the anaconda that Jeremy Wade encountered in the Amazon during the latest episode of his hit series, River Monsters - he estimated it to be 200 pounds . Kitted out in scuba diving gear, Wade, who has helmed six seasons of River Monsters, audibly gulped before he exclaimed, 'Look at the size of this! I've stumbled into a potential man-eater.' He had made his way to Brazil to try and figure out what particular river monster had killed a man whose body was found dead with huge bruises on his neck and torso and with numerous crushed bones in his body. During the course of his investigation he also found that other people in the vicinity of Porto de Moz, almost 1,500 miles from Rio de Janerio, had gone missing in the water's surrounding the town. When he came face-to-face with the beast, Wade was left with the conclusion that he had in fact found the likely culprit for the death and disappearances. Huge: Jeremy Wade can be seen approaching the huge snake in the river just off Porto de Moz, in the Brazilian rainforest . Reach out to touch: Jeremy Wade conquers his fear to such an extent that he reaches out to the huge semi-aquatic snake . Anaconda's in the Amazon can grow to 22-feet long and the non-venomous species is the largest snake native to the Americas. Reports of anacondas 35–40 feet or even longer also exist and there is currently a $50,000 cash reward currently on offer for anyone who can produce a specimen more than 30-feet long. While rare, fatal instances involving anaconda's and people have been recorded across the Amazon basin. Wade hosts Animal Planet's ""River Monsters,"" the network's most popular series, where he goes around the world to find ugly and often legendary creatures that lurk in murky waters. Intrepid: Jeremy Wade has fronted six series of River Monsters and the British explorer is preparing for the seventh . Killer: This man was found crushed to death with huge bruising across his body near to Porto de Moz  - believed to have been caused by the snake that Wade encountered . Deadly: The anaconda has a fearsome reputation across the Amazon and is believed to have even been responsible for human deaths . The British Wade was an avid fisherman as a boy and was on the lookout for more adventure. He wrote an article on his six-year search for the arapaima, the largest freshwater fish in South America, that caught the eye of a television producer. He began working for Discovery in England, attracting the attention of Animal Planet. A special Wade did for Animal Planet attracted so much attention, it was expanded into the series. About half the viewers are people who fish, Wade said. Many are attracted to the idea of seeing creatures they have never even heard of. Many of the fish, because they are from fresh water, are particularly ugly, he said. Wade, when he catches the object of a show's search, always releases it back to the wild. He urges people who are near some of the waters featured on ""River Monsters"" not to be frightened, but to be aware of what fish might be near them and understand their behavior.","River Monsters host Jeremy Wade came up close and personal to a 200-pound anaconda in the latest edition of his hit television show .

"At 42 years and 110 days old, Mark Schwarzer is hardly a fresh-faced debutant. But the Australian goalkeeper insists he feels ‘fitter, stronger, better’ than ever as he fights to make his first appearance for Leicester City on Saturday at White Hart Lane. Nigel Pearson never gives much away about team selection, but an FA Cup tie against Tottenham may provide his new signing with some action. Ben Hamer has done an excellent job deputising for the injured Kasper Schmeichel, who is still a few weeks away from fitness after breaking a metatarsal, but Schwarzer is eager to play his part, following a spell at Chelsea behind two of the world’s best in Thibaut Courtois and Petr Cech. Mark Schwarzer joined Leicester on an 18-month deal from Chelsea in January . The veteran goalkeeper had Thibaut Courtois and Petr Cech ahead of him in the Chelsea pecking order . ‘I want to be judged each week, to have that pressure again,’ he tells Sportsmail. ‘It’s something the last six months has lacked. I feel very fit and ready to go.’ The man with 109 Australia caps has signed an 18-month contract at Leicester and should Pearson hand him a start today, he aims to grasp it with both hands. Were Schwarzer then able to help his club stay in the top flight, he stands every chance of breaking John Burridge’s long-held record for oldest player to appear in the Premier League. Schwarzer attributes the freshness he feels in his forties to a switch in gym workouts five years ago, rather than any drive to play past Burridge’s mark of 43 years and 162 days, set when keeping goal for Manchester City in 1995. ‘It has been mentioned that if I play for a certain time I will break records but it’s not something that inspires me,’ he says. ‘I continue because I enjoy playing and training so much, and hopefully I’m good enough. The former Fulham keeper poses after being unveiled as a Leicester player earlier this month . Schwarzer, who could become the oldest Premier League player next year, watches from the bench . ‘That’s why Leicester have signed me, because they believe I’m still good enough to perform at the highest level and contribute to the team.’ Keep in mind March 16, 2016. Any Premier League appearance beyond that for Schwarzer will see Burridge’s record surpassed. A sign of Schwarzer’s longevity can be gauged by the fact he played behind Pearson in the Middlesbrough team that won promotion to the Premier League in 1997-98. ‘He was one of the best centre halves I’ve played with,’ says Schwarzer. ‘He is as a person and manager like he was as a player: very straight, very calm, very assuring and confident in his own ability.’ Tom Lawrence, who started Leicester’s FA Cup win over Newcastle, was aged one when Schwarzer made his debut on these shores for Bradford City. The likes of Liam Moore, Jeff Schlupp and Riyad Mahrez were not born as he began his career at Marconi Stallions in Sydney 25 years ago. The 42-year-old holds up the Leicester goalkeeper shirt after being unveiled . Schwarzer joined Chelsea from Fulham on a free transfer in 2013 and made 12 appearances for the club . But Schwarzer has plenty left in the tank, and experience to lend the Leicester dressing room. ‘In the gym and in diet it’s all changed significantly in the last five or so years,’ he says. ‘That’s why I’m still playing, because of those changes. ‘I have done goalkeeping-related weights that still allow you to maintain your flexibility but also build strength and help prevent injuries. It’s stuff that previously I haven’t enjoyed but I’ve turned the corner. ‘I don’t wake up with aches, I don’t get out of bed thinking, “Gosh, I feel 42”. That’s just a number. It’s all about what you can physically do and how you play and perform. That’s all I want to be judged on.’ Schwarzer, with 508 top-flight appearances in English football, will be a vocal presence. ‘To be honest I talk just for the sake of talking,’ he says, laughing. ‘I want to help people. It’s about self-belief. There are going to be times when people make mistakes and it’s not about berating them; it’s about trying to pick them up. We’re going to have to fight as a team.’","Mark Schwarzer signed an 18-month deal at Leicester this January .

"Rapist footballer Ched Evans's girlfriend has quit Twitter after she was branded a 'gold-digger' and 'disgusting' for standing by him despite his conviction. Evans, a striker for Sheffield United and Wales, could be released from prison today having served half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl in his home town of Rhyl. The case has sparked huge controversy following comments by ITV star Judy Finnigan in which she suggested the 25-year-old should be allowed to return to his club because the victim was 'drunk' and the rape was 'unpleasant' but 'not violent'. Her comments, and the possibility he could return to professional football, has caused outrage - an online petition opposing his return  has now gathered almost 150,000 signatures. Scroll down for video . Rapist Ched Evans and his girlfriend Natasha Massey, who remains standing by him despite his conviction . Evans has been supported throughout by his long-term girlfriend, businessman's daughter, Natasha Massey . Natasha Massey was subjected to a barrage of online abuse after coming out in defence of her boyfriend . But yesterday Evans girlfriend 25-year-old Natasha Massey, who remains convinced of her boyfriend's innocence, quit Twitter after receiving a torrent of abuse from trolls. The Sun reported she closed her account after she was called 'disgusting', a 'gold-digger' and an 'embarrassment'. Meanwhile Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, has also waded into the debate saying that Sheffield United should 'think really long and hard' about re-signing the rapist striker. He warned club bosses they cannot 'wish away' the Evans' rape conviction and must remember that the players are not just footballers but role models to millions of fans. Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg told LBC: 'I think the owners need to think really long and hard about that fact that when you take a footballer on, you are not taking just a footballer these days you are also taking on a role model. 'You are taking on a role model, particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on the football pitch on a team like that, and he has committed a very, very serious crime.' To the fury of thousands of people, the club's manager Nigel Clough revealed on Wednesday officials had discussed bringing the striker back following his release from prison. Evans has been an inmate at Wymott Prison in Lancashire, a specialist Category C jail for sex offenders . This morning almost 150,000 people had signed a petition requesting Sheffield United did not resign Evans. The controversy erupted after Judy Finnegan, during her debut as a panellist on Loose Women this week, suggested Evans should be allowed to go back to the club. After a huge backlash about the remarks branded 'disgusting' and 'damaging', she was eventually forced to 'apologise unreservedly' for the offence she had caused. However her daughter Chloe has since been viciously trolled online. Yesterday it was revealed police are investigating after a Twitter user told the 27-year-old, that her mother had given her 'blessing' for her to be raped.

"Steve Bruce could be the man to end Alan Pardew’s four-year tenure at Newcastle United — and is keen on replacing him if the position becomes vacant. The atmosphere turned toxic at St Mary’s as Pardew watched his team crumble against Southampton to leave them bottom of the table and without a win in their first four league games. Owner Mike Ashley was in the stands to witness his club’s diabolical performance and could hear the away fans turn on Pardew and constantly call for his head. Hull manager Steve Bruce is keen on replacing Alan Pardew if the position becomes vacant . Sources close to the Newcastle boss indicated he was in the dark about his future at the club yesterday, but Pardew hosts Hull at St James’ Park on Saturday when there will be no let-up from the home supporters and defeat could spell the end. Tensions will already be high. It is the first time Pardew has been on the touchline against Hull since he headbutted their midfielder David Meyler last season. That earned him a seven-match ban from the FA and a £100,000 fine from Newcastle. Hull boss Bruce remained coy on the possibility of taking over at Newcastle, the club he supports, but it is understood he is interested in the job if Pardew is sacked. Newcastle fans have never really taken to Alan Pardew and are now calling for his head . Bruce said: ‘After what happened to me at Sunderland I know how difficult the North East is. I have only been at Hull a couple of years and they have been really good. They gave me the chance to get up and running again and for that I will always be grateful.’ On Saturday, Southampton were as good as Newcastle were bad. New signing Graziano Pelle scored a header and tap-in in the opening 20 minutes which set the travelling supporters on Pardew’s back. Goals from Jack Cork, who had never scored a league goal in three years at the club, and Morgan Schneiderlin, in second-half stoppage time, finished them off. Alan Pardew's Newcastle have performed poorly since January when they sold Yohan Cabaye . The travelling supporters who made a 660-mile round trip unfurled banners saying ‘Pardew is a Muppet’ and ‘Pardew Out’. Pardew famously signed an eight-year contract with Newcastle just under two years ago, having led them to fifth place in the 2011-12 season. He told Sky Sports: ‘It is not easy to digest and not easy for the players either to play under those circumstances, so we have to be strong and try to tough it out this week and come back next week. ‘We just have to put ourselves on the line, really, and be brave. Certainly, we have a bit more quality than we showed today, for sure, and we need to get that on the pitch.’ Southampton manager Ronald Koeman said: ‘I understand how difficult the situation is for them, and for their manager. They have qualities, they showed that as well, and for that reason it was a great result for us.’ Newcastle owner Mike Ashley handed Alan Pardew an eight-year contract less than two years ago . Newcastle legend Alan Shearer admitted Pardew is under huge pressure. He said: ‘Results have not been good enough since January. ‘From the first minute, Southampton went after Newcastle and they could not cope. Having said all that, I am led to believe they spent nearly £40million but that the manager does not have a say in that. Inevitably, in the long run, that does not work.’ The last time Newcastle failed to win their first four league games was in 2005 under Graeme Souness. By February that season, he was gone.

"The fact that humans live beyond their reproductive usefulness has long been thought to be a biological process that uniquely separates us from the great apes. But the discovery of an orangutan going through menopause could nullify that theory - and suggest we’re not so dissimilar after all. Gina, an orangutan at Durrell Wildlife Park in Jersey, was being tested for breeding when scientists found she was no longer fertile. previously thought almost exclusive to humans. Scroll down for a world-first video of an orangutan giving birth (Warning: graphic content) Gina, pictured here with her baby Jaya, is the first ape found to have undergone a menopause. This biological process was originally thought to be exclusive to humans. This suggests humans are not as dissimilar from orangutans as first thought . The research will feature in Channel 4 documentary series Born in the Wild on 22 June. Durrell Wildlife Park is located on the island of Jersey in the English Channel. It was founded by naturalist and conservationist Gerald Durrell in 1958, then called Jersey Zoo. Gerald passed away in 1995 but is survived by his wife Lee, who now runs the park. Since then the park has grown enormously with almost 200,000 visitors passing through its gates every year. It is also heavily involved in the conservation and protection of endangered species through the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust. This international charity works globally to save species from extinction. Gina is a wild-caught female that was confiscated from smugglers at Singapore airport in the 1960s, and has been a resident at Durrell since 1968. In those 46 years Gina has given birth to seven babies, most notably the male Jaya in 2004, who was born by caesarean section - the first such procedure carried out on an orangutan. Almost a decade after Jaya’s birth, the now 49-year-old Gina was being considered for breeding. Female orangutans are widely believed to remain fertile until the end of their lives, rather than undergoing a menopause, as seen in humans with whom they share 97.6 per cent of the same DNA. Before making the decision to breed with her, Gina was scheduled to be fully health-screened to establish whether she could safely contribute another genetically important youngster to the captive breeding program for her species. In addition, her reproductive status was assessed and these procedures coincided with the filming of this episode. Gina was being prepared for breeding when it was found that she had undergone a menopause. The finding was made during an ultrasound examination (pictured) that showed the tell-tale signs of a post-menopausal reproductive system . However, whilst anaesthetised, vets noticed one facet of Gina’s assessment was unusual. During the ultrasound examination carried out by Neil MacLachlan, Consultant Obstetrician at Jersey General Hospital, Gina’s uterus, endometrium (lining of the uterus) and vagina unexpectedly displayed tell-tale signs of what - in a human patient - would indicate a post-menopausal reproductive system. A further series of blood tests affirmed that Gina is believed to be the world’s first medically-confirmed case of an orangutan that has undergone a non-pathological age-related cessation of reproductive abilities - a menopause. “I suppose that I’m not totally surprised to find that orangutans have a menopause - they really are so very similar to humans,’ said MacLachlan. ‘Indeed it looks as if they go through the menopause at a very similar age. ‘Now the orangutans are living longer, we will probably see more in the menopausal state, and this will allow breeding programmes to be better managed. ‘Gina has really been an informative animal and I hope she can now relax a little from being such a wonderful mother.’ A further series of blood tests affirmed that Gina is believed to be the world's first medically-confirmed case of an orangutan that has undergone a non-pathological age-related cessation of reproductive abilities - a menopause. She is shown here being carried to the hospital by vets . The programme also features the Durrell staff’s footage of their 25-year-old orangutan Dana giving birth to her first surviving baby. This is the most detailed - if not the world’s first - footage of an orangutan birth. Following a stillbirth in 2009 that almost cost her life Dana had been considered infertile. However, MacLachlan’s pioneering work to clear Dana’s blocked Fallopian tubes resulted in a pregnancy in 2012. Staff at Durrell, determined to ensure Dana and baby would survive her 2013 delivery, watched her around the clock. As a result they were present, with cameras rolling, when she went into labour late one June evening. Catch Born In The Wild at 8pm this Sunday on Channel 4 . We are incredibly fortunate to have the support of our collaborative medical colleagues on Jersey,' said Durrell’s Head Vet, Andrew Routh. 'Working with the team at the Wildlife Park we have, together, been able to make huge advances in the reproductive health care and breeding management of these incredible apes.' Durrell hope that the new findings broadcast in this programme will further compel people to speak up for orangutans, and support their conservation, before they are lost from Earth forever. McLachlan added: ‘Realising how close to humans the orangutans are, I just wish that the rest of  mankind would give them the same respect that they deserve and the support to live in peace, in their own environment; surely their basic civil rights?‘ .","Orangutan at Durrell Wildlife Park Jersey has gone through the menopause .

"Nigel Pearson insists he will have nothing to do with the frantic business of transfer deadline day and wants all his deals concluded in advance. Leicester City are in the market for a central defender, an attacking midfielder, and a striker – but Pearson is content to fight for Premier League survival with his current squad if his ideal recruits cannot be secured.

Pearson addresses his Leicester players during training on Thursday . Pearson said: ‘I have generally been looking – but unless the players feel right for us I’ll be doing no more.

I don’t see why deals done so late, certainly won’t be getting involved myself. Brinkmanship. 'All I think about is what we do, I’m not interested in what others do. We have tried do business want to do and got two done very quickly. Leicester splashed out £9million on Croatian striker Andrej Kramaric from HNK Rijeka earlier this month . 'If can strengthen we will. It will be nice to have options of course, we’ve managed to keep relatively fit squad and hope that continues. ‘There have been no approaches for our players as far as aware of. We’re not in a position to let anyone go anyway. Never discount anything, there has been speculation surrounding couple of players, but no bids to my knowledge.' Pearson revealed Matthew Upson is ready for first-team football having missed the season so far through an ankle injury. But the former England centre-back’s return will not influence Pearson’s desire to find another player in that position. The Foxes brought in goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer on a free transfer from Chelsea .","Leicester splashed out £9million on Croatian striker Andrej Kramaric .

"Britain's first bus powered by human waste has taken to the streets. The 40-seater 'Bio-Bus' is fuelled by biomethane gas, generated by the treatment of sewage and food waste at a processing plant in the south west. And a single tank of the gas - produced using the typical annual waste of just five people - is enough to power the vehicle for 190 miles (305km). Scroll down for video . An environmentally-friendly bus that developers say will improve air quality runs on a rather unlikely fuel - human poo, among other sewage. Commuters today boarded the first bus in the UK to be powered by this waste from local residents . Bosses said the groundbreaking vehicle will improve air quality, and proves that their is value in human faeces. Today's maiden voyage saw the first passengers travel on the route from Bristol Airport to Bath, Somerset -  a distance of around 20 miles (32km). Faeces could soon be used to power a future generation of mobile phones, scientists from the University of East Anglia have claimed. The researchers discovered a natural process that occurs within the bacteria found in poo, that could help improve ‘bio batteries’. It is hoped the discovery could produce energy for portable technology, such as smartphones, mobiles, tablets and laptops. The gas is being produced at a Wessex Water sewerage plant, run by energy firm GENeco. Mohammed Saddiq, director of GENeco, told Bristol Post: 'Gas powered vehicles have an important role to play in improving air quality in UK cities. 'But the Bio-Bus goes further than that and is actually powered by people living in the local area, including quite possibly those on the bus itself.' The annual waste of a bus-load of people would provide enough power for a return journey from Land's End to John O'Groats, while producing fewer emissions than a diesel engine. Charlotte Morton, chief executive of eco-friendly organisation Anaerobic Digestion and Bioresources Association, said: 'The bus also clearly shows that human poo and our wasted food are valuable resources. 'Food which is unsuitable for human consumption should be separately collected and recycled through anaerobic digestion into green gas and biofertilisers, not wasted in landfill sites or incinerators.' The 40-seater 'Bio-Bus', pictured here preparing for its maiden trip from Bristol to Bath, runs on gas generated by the treatment of sewage and food waste at a nearby processing plant. It comes complete with an interesting design on the side of the vehicle . Bio-fuel promoters said that the bus, which is expected to ferry up to 10,000 passengers a month, shows the 'value' of waste and heralds a more sustainable future for public transport . GENeco this week also became the first company to start delivering gas generated from human waste directly to 8,300 homes by the national grid. The waste plant in Avonmouth, Bristol, treats 75 million cubic metres of sewage waste, and 35,000 tonnes of food waste, every year. Using anaerobic digestion - the process of using bacteria to break down substances in the absence of oxygen - the plant is able to produce 17 million tonnes of biomethane a year. The annual waste of a bus-load of people would provide enough power for a return journey from Land's End to John O'Groats while producing fewer emissions than a diesel engine .

"The man they call Bomber is recalling his part in the last FA Cup tie between West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City. He is picturing the coach journey through streets filled with people, the tense atmosphere and the celebrations that followed. It is 47 years since Tony Brown sent a missile into the net to secure West Brom a 2-0 victory and propel his team to their most recent piece of major silverware. That semi-final, in front of more than 60,000 fans, took place on April 27, 1968, at Villa Park, the stadium equidistant from these local rivals. Tony Brown (left) and Jeff Astle pictured in the dressing room after the 1968 semi-final win over Birmingham . The Bomber, as Brown was known, scored a club-record 279 goals for West Brom during a 17-year spell . On Saturday they meet again, in the fourth round of the Cup at St Andrew’s; an encounter eagerly anticipated by both sets of supporters. ‘It brings back memories,’ says Brown. ‘Since the draw we’ve had Blues supporters saying they’ll get their own back for ’68 — they haven’t forgotten. The city is very excited.’ In a club-record 720 competitive matches between 1963 and 1980 Brown, now 69, scored a club-record 279 goals, despite operating in midfield. Perhaps none will be treasured more than his rocket at Villa Park. ‘Bobby Hope put me through at the edge of the box and I drilled an angled shot into the far corner. That settled it really,’ he says with the same straightness as the shot was hit. The late Jeff Astle, another legendary figure for the club, had scored the opener. Brown adds: ‘We had a free-kick just outside the box. Bobby Hope touched the ball to me and I drove it. The keeper dived and saved it, but parried it out and Jeff followed it up.’ Bomber poses with the FA Cup in front of a stature of himself at the Hawthorns . The Bomber smashed home West Brom's second goal during the semi-final win in 1968 . Astle also scored the only goal in the final at Wembley against an Everton side containing World Cup winners Alan Ball and Ray Wilson. Lifting that trophy remains perhaps the highest peak in the club’s history. The win over Birmingham provided the perfect penultimate chapter. ‘It was a tremendous day,’ says Brown. ‘Especially because it was a local derby. It was a sell-out crowd and there was all the ballyhoo of knowing Wembley was the prize. It added an extra tingle to the game. ‘We all had to meet at The Hawthorns to get a coach that would drive us the short distance to Villa Park. We passed through swarms of fans lining the way. It is a tremendous ground. ‘Both sets of fans made the occasion. You could cut the atmosphere with a knife. We were nervous, too. I know we won 2-0 but they had better chances than us. Fred Pickering, their lad up front, had three or four but didn’t stick them away. Fortunately Jeff and I did.’ Brown says good fortune played a part throughout their run. ‘In the third round we had Colchester away. They scored first and I equalised with a penalty. Brown is applauded by West Brom players and staff at the unveiling of his statue last November . Brown holds the FA Cup as he poses with Denis Law beside the statue at the Hawthorns . ‘Then, with about three minutes to go, they scored again and we thought we were out. John Talbut, our big centre half, kicked the ball out of the ground in disgust. But the referee for some reason disallowed it. Even today our lads don’t know why. We got them back to our place and won comfortably. ‘In the next round we were losing at home to Southampton and I hit one from outside the box but never got a good connection. Their goalkeeper went down on one knee to collect but the ball hit a divot, bounced over his shoulder and into the back of the net. We could easily have gone out. When we beat Liverpool in the quarter-final after a second replay we really believed it would be our year.‘ . Brown nearly missed the final with a thigh injury — ‘it was touch and go’ — but recovered and was able to enjoy the day he had dreamed of as a schoolboy. ‘The first thing we did was take the Cup straight in the bath and drink champagne from it,’ he says. ‘We stayed in London that night and went to the Astor Club, had a good sing-song. One thing that sticks in my mind was the manager Alan Ashman not letting the trophy out of his grasp.’ The Bomber made a club-record 720 competitive appearances for West Brom between 1963 and 1980 . Brown's statue at the Hawthorns, pictured before the match against Hull earlier in January . Brown knows Tony Pulis craves a similar scenario, even if Premier League survival is his primary mission. ‘He’s said a couple of times in interviews that he likes the FA Cup and wants to do well in it — that’s music to my ears. We’ve had one or two managers in the past who haven’t really bothered about it. ‘It has changed. The priority nowadays is to stay in the Premier League because that’s where all the money is — that didn’t come into the equation through the years I played. Cup games were something special. ‘The youngsters must get all these stories about Wembley from their parents and grandparents. I know it’s a long way off but it’s the dream the fans have — and players should as well. ‘I think it will be a really hard-fought game. Blues have picked up since Gary Rowett has come in. He’s put a bit of spirit back into them. He’ll be steaming into them, emphasising there is a big scalp here to be won. ‘I’m sure Tony will have the lads up for it. What I’ve noticed in these few games is that he plays every ball. His passion for the game is clear. You hope that gets through to the lads in the dressing room. I’m sure it does.’","West Brom beat Birmingham 2-0 in the FA Cup semi-final in 1968 .

"Bordeaux coach Willy Sagnol has apologised for making disparaging comments about African players in football, although he still maintains they were misinterpreted against a backlash of widespread criticism. Sagnol, capped 58 times by France and a member of the team which lost the 2006 World Cup final to Italy, gave a question and answer session on Tuesday to readers of Sud Ouest's regional newspaper when the subject of African players was raised. He said: 'The advantage of what I would call the typical African player is that he isn't expensive when you sign him, (he is) a player who is ready for combat, but football isn't just about that. Willy Sagnol explained his comments on African players in football at a press conference on Thursday . The Bordeaux manager had pre-prepared notes to refer to during the press conference . Ludovic Sane - Senegal . Abdou Traore - Mali . Henri Saivet - Senegal . Thomas Toure - Ivory Coast . Cheick Diabate - Mali . Andre Poko - Gabon . Wahbi Khazri - Tunisia . David Djigla - Benin . Explaining himself, he continued: 'Football is also (about) technique, intelligence. You need a bit of everything. You need Nordics too, Nordics are good.' Speaking on Thursday at a pre-match news conference ahead of Saturday's game with Lens, Sagnol tried to explain his comments. He added: 'If by my lack of clarity, or my imperfect semantics, I may have shocked, humiliated or hurt people then I am sorry. 'The interpretation that these people may have made does not reflect my way of thinking in any way or my humanist convictions.' However, he said the comments made sense in a sporting context. 'When I spoke about the African (player) who is cheaper and ready for combat, I simply meant to talk about the young African player arriving in Europe with all of his will to win and often to escape from a precarious situation,' Sagnol continued as he read from pre-prepared notes. 'Then, since we were in a debate about football, the intelligence I spoke of was obviously related to tactical intelligence. Sagnol has been criticised for the comments he made regarding African players . Lens manager Antoine Kombouare is among those unhappy with the comments Sagnol made . 'The forming of young players in Africa, probably because of a lack of financial means, or (lack) of infrastructure, isn't always as complete as what's available in Europe.' Sagnol distanced himself from accusations that his viewpoint was offensive. 'In no way did I mean to talk about an individual's intelligence in the proper sense of the term. Regarding certain accusations of racism, I'm 37 (and) I've spent 32 of them in a football dressing room. I've never had a problem with anyone,' the former Bayern Munich player said. But Lens coach Antoine Kombouare, who was born in New Caledonia, is among those who felt offended by Sagnol. 'Let's make things clear: this is not a case of him being clumsy. He's really messed up,' Kombouare said. 'What he said is serious. It's unacceptable. Explaining that an African player is cheaper ... I felt humiliated and hurt.' The International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA) strongly condemned Sagnol, as did former Marseille president Pape Diouf, who called for African players to boycott one round of French league games in protest. Bordeaux coach Sagnol played alongside Lilian Thuram during his time with the France national team . Bordeaux forward Henri Saivet said the whole squad appreciated Sagnol's apology . French Football Federation president Noel Le Graet, who formerly employed Sagnol as coach of France's Under-21 side, defended him, while former teammate Lilian Thuram - an active anti-racism campaigner - was more measured. 'I played alongside Willy, he's somebody I respect. I know him very well,' Thuram told Sud Ouest. 'I don't think you should put Willy Sagnol on trial, but you should put prejudice on trial. Each one of us harbors some prejudice, which is why people working in football, who have a certain exposure to the media, should be educated on this subject.' Sagnol's captain at Bordeaux is Senegal international Lamine Sane, who called Sagnol's comments 'clumsy' before defending him, as did club president Jean-Louis Triaud. 'He doesn't have any twisted ideas. He believes in all the black players in the team,' Sane told French radio. 'We believe in him and we hope to go very far with him.' Bordeaux forward Henri Saivet, who is black, told RMC radio that Sagnol apologised. 'We all now pertinently well that the coach is not a racist,' Saivet said. 'It's true that, at first, we asked ourselves a few questions. But he explained how it happened. He apologised to the players. That was very important.'","Willy Sagnol has apologised for his comments on African football players .

"Only half of U.S. citizens pay federal income tax, according to the latest available figures. In 2009, just 50.5 per cent of Americans paid any income tax to the federal government - the lowest proportion in at least half a century. And the number of people outside the tax system could have climbed even higher since as the economic downturn has continued to bite and unemployment has remained high. Figures: This graph from the Heritage Foundation shows that half the population of the U.S. pays no federal income tax at all . The decreasing number of taxpayers threatens government revenues, and could also cause resentment from those who believe that welfare recipients are taking money out of the economy. 151.7million U.S. citizens paid no federal income tax in 2009, according to figures compiled by the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank. In 1984, the middle of the Reagan era, 85 per cent of Americans paid federal income tax, meaning just 34.8million people did not. The figures include children, the retired and others who do not participate in the labour force. Nonetheless, they largely reflect the sudden jump in the unemployment rate after the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession. Unemployment rose from around five per cent at the beginning of 2008 to a high of 10 per cent in October 2009. Crisis: Unemployment has declined slowly under Barack Obama . As well the increased number of jobless people, the reduction in the number of taxpayers is a result of low-income workers taking pay cuts and reduced hours, and therefore slipping out of the tax system. It also includes people who illegally fail to file a tax return even though they might have earned enough money to do so. Another finding by the Heritage Foundation shows that 21.8 per cent of U.S. citizens receive financial assistance from the federal government. This means that 67.3million people - a record high - are 'dependent on the federal government', excluding government employees who rely on the public sector for their salaries. The conjunction of fewer taxpayers with higher welfare payments has led to intense pressure on the public purse, with the national deficit running at $1.3trillion per year. The Heritage Foundation argues that the reduction in the number of taxpayers will create an electorate dominated by non-taxpayers, who will always support higher taxes and spending because their own money is not at stake.","151.7m people - 49.5% of the U.S. population - paid no federal income tax in 2009, figures show ."
"The Ballon d’Or is awarded to the world’s best player in Zurich on Monday but I am far more interested in who is named coach of the year. Carlo Ancelotti, for securing Real Madrid’s 10th Champions League, and World Cup winner Joachim Low will have their supporters but if it was down to me, the prize would go to the third man on the shortlist — Diego Simeone. His work with Atletico Madrid, which was crowned by winning La Liga last season, has been unbelievable for the past three years and I watched in awe again on Wednesday night when he inspired his side in the Copa del Rey to a third consecutive victory over Real.

That is three straight derby wins after losing the Champions League final to their neighbours. You would have thought losing in Lisbon would have had a psychological impact on Atleti but nothing could be further from the truth. Simeone is the type of manager you would run through a brick wall for — I’d even come out of retirement for him! — and you can see his squad have total belief in him. He would be a magnificent addition to our game. In some ways, Atleti remind me of the Liverpool sides I played for under Rafa Benitez and Gerard Houllier. We might not have been the easiest on the eye but we had absolute belief that wherever we went in Europe we would get a result. Simeone has given that to Atleti.

"The sobering reality of life in a city that was decimated by an earthquake that killed 185 people exactly four years ago has given England valuable perspective as they attempt to put their World Cup back on track against Scotland. Christchurch is still in recovery, with signs of devastation still evident throughout a city centre that is barely recognisable to those members of the England party who were last here seven years ago. Ian Bell has fond memories of his time here and hopes the staging of three World Cup matches at the picturesque Hagley Park Oval, culminating in England's must win game against the Scots, can help the recovery process. Ian Bell has fond memories of his time in Christchurch and will be hoping England can beat Scotland . Bell talks to the media during an England press conference at the picturesque Hagley Park Oval on Sunday . England must win their game against Scotland and Bell will be keen to make progress at the World Cup . 'We were given a really interesting talk on what happened here and it puts a lot of things in perspective after the way we played against New Zealand,' said Bell. 'Having remembered Christchurch as a busy, sporting city it's amazing to come back to this. 'We started the tour here in 2008 and I remember being 12th man at the old rugby ground. To see some of the slides and pictures of what it looks like now was moving. 'To be here again and to see how they have been able to put sport back on is really nice. It was incredible to hear about it. The way everyone has got together moving forward and the role sport has played is something we can learn from.' It was a welcome reminder on what really matters to a team who will be under enormous sporting pressure when they take on supposedly the weakest team in their group in a match that has taken on huge significance for England. Bell not only wants to beat the Scots on Monday but beat them well to banish the memories of the total capitulation against Australia and New Zealand. 'It's about how we react now and we have to put in a good performance,' said England's senior batsman. 'The result is obviously the most important thing but it would be nice to win with real clinical cricket. We haven't produced anything like that in the opening two games.

Mark Ramprakash, the England batting coach, has been impressed with the maturity, a problem in the past, Hales has shown here and says that he has been 'knocking hard' on the door. England may now open it and let him in. Finn was smashed for 49 off just two overs by Brendon McCullum in Wellington and may now be taken out of the firing line in favour of the senior spinner in Tredwell who has struggled for opportunities since Moeen Ali's off-spin became a regular part of the England attack.","England lost their first two 2015 Cricket World Cup matches .

"Tragic: Caroline Lovell died delivering her own baby daughter at home . A passionate advocate of home births has died after her own home labour. Campaigner Caroline Lovell, 36, went into cardiac arrest while giving birth to her second daughter, Zahra, at her home. She was taken to hospital but died the next day. Her daughter survived. The tragedy, in Melbourne on January 23, will re-ignite debate about the safety of home births. NHS statistics show that between 2000 and 2008, home births in the UK soared by 54 per cent. Mrs Lovell had made arrangements for a private midwife to assist with the delivery, but unknown complications during the birth caused her heart to stop. By the time paramedics arrived at her home, she was critically ill.The photographer, who leaves behind her husband Nick, her first daughter Lulu, three, and newborn Zahra, had lobbied the Australian government for more state support for women who wanted home births. In 2009 she told a health inquiry that midwives who assisted with home births needed proper funding and legal protection, in line with other countries. Her written submission warned that ‘lives will be in threat without proper midwifery assistance’ from the state. She wrote: ‘On a personal note, I am quite shocked and ashamed that homebirth will no longer be a woman’s free choice in low-risk pregnancies. ‘As a homebirthing mother I will have no choice but to have an unassisted birth at home as this  is the place I want to birth  my children.’ Mrs Lovell had spoken of her excitement at her impending arrival.On October 19, she posted a message on the Facebook site for her massage business that read: ‘Maternity leave officially started this morning… had a beautiful last night at work and will keep you all posted on my burgeoning growth as a mother to be – second time round.’ The Midwives in Private  Practice group said it was the first time they had heard of a mother’s death following a home birth. A spokesman said: ‘It’s very,  very rare.’ In England, about 1 baby in 50 is born at home and women are usually assisted through labour and birth by a professional such as a midwife. Many women opt for home births because they prefer a relaxed, familiar environment and would rather avoid a hospital visit. The safety of home births is a subject of frequent debate and many experts have called for a ban on the birthing technique. They argue women who give birth outside of a clinical setting put themselves and their newborns at risk. In many developed countries, home birth declined rapidly over the 20th century, for example in the U.S. home birth declined from 50 per cent in 1938 to fewer than 1 per cent in 1955. According to the American Pregnancy Association the risks associated with at-home delivery include fetal distress, cord prolapse, hemorrhage and high blood pressure. New data suggests home births have risen by 29 per cent in the U.S. triggered by the 'Hollywood influence', better safety measures and lower costs. A senior midwife told the Mail that a severe haemorrhage was the most likely cause of death, but an inquest has yet to be held. The . Association for Improvements in the Maternity Services in the UK said . the tragedy should not put expectant mothers off  home births. Chairman . Beverley Lawrence Beech said: ‘While this is very sad, it is extremely . rare – almost unheard of – for women to die during home births.‘Research clearly shows that home births in the UK are no more dangerous than hospital births. ‘If anything, it is safer and you are much less likely to have unnecessary medical intervention.’ In the UK, women are provided with NHS midwives if they opt for a home birth. But in Australia, women are discouraged from giving birth at home and expectant mothers must find a private midwife. Mrs .

"Britain should stop complaining about European migrants and build them more housing and infrastructure, a leading Brussels bureaucrat declared last night. European Commissioner László Andor said that the UK is ‘taking advantage’ of EU migrants who provide ‘economic and financial benefits’. Rather than complaining about the pressure migrants put on housing and public services, he said, ministers should just spend more money to accommodate them. Scroll down for video . European Commissioner László Andor said that the UK is ‘taking advantage’ of EU migrants who provide ‘economic and financial benefits’ Last night his comments provoked outrage. Tory MP Philip Hollobone accused Mr Andor of ‘staggering complacency’. He said: ‘The pressure on infrastructure from the number of immigrants coming to our shores is more than many communities can cope with. We have schools having to accommodate pupils who don’t speak English, GP lists which are oversubscribed and huge pressure on public transport and other facilities. ‘This all needs to be paid for and is an extra burden on taxpayers. It also increasingly makes people feel we are not living in Britain as we would like it to be –and people want their country back, and that means some control over numbers coming to the UK.’ In an article for the PoliticsHome website, Mr Andor said that free movement of people through the EU is a ‘huge benefit’ to the workers themselves but also helps employers solve ‘labour shortages and skills gaps’. The Hungarian economist said EU workers ‘usually’ pay more in tax and welfare contributions than they receive in benefits and so are ‘net contributors to the UK exchequer’. He added: ‘As a result, UK workers have to pay less tax than they would in the absence of workers from other EU countries.’ Mr Andor said that he accepts there are ‘some challenges’ resulting from migration but claimed the risk of benefit abuse is ‘minimal’. He said: ‘In countries with significant incoming migration, there can be problems when there is a large, sudden influx of people from other EU countries in to particular towns or areas, putting a strain on schools, housing, healthcare and infrastructure. ‘But the answer to these problems is to invest in new facilities, housing and services, not to turn away people that are working hard and more than paying their share into the UK’s budget. ‘The UK authorities should listen to people where these problems arise, and be prepared to invest in new infrastructure and services to address these problems, rather than simply take advantage of the economic and financial benefits of workers coming from other EU countries.’ In November last year Mr Andor also sparked fury by claiming that Britain risked becoming the ‘nasty country of Europe’. He said Government plans to curb benefits for migrants fuelled hysteria and might even scupper the single market. But he was immediately slapped down by Home Secretary Theresa May, who said that his comments show Brussels is increasingly ‘on the wrong side of the argument’. Mr Andor, who earns £212,000 per year as EU Commissioner for employment, social affairs and inclusion, also said that existing rules were already strong enough to combat ‘so-called benefit tourism’. However, critics have pointed to Hungary’s own Jobbik Party which has called for the expulsion of Hungarian gypsies. Labour MP John Mann has said that Mr Andor should ‘sort out his own backyard’ before criticising the UK.","EU Commissioner for jobs said migration from eastern Europe good for UK .
Laszlo Andor said foreigners pay more in tax than they get in benefits .
Hungarian official said answer to strain on services was more investment .
A report by Sheffield University last night pointed to ‘rapid population growth’ in Britain as a reason why living standards are falling. However, it said that a growing population may actually be ‘necessary for economic growth’ and that the shift towards dominance of the service sector in the economy means that even stronger population growth is needed to keep the economy growing."
"India announced themselves as genuine contenders to defend their World Cup title on Sunday by humbling South Africa's vaunted pace attack before bowling out the Proteas for an emphatic 130-run victory at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In front of a heaving crowd of 86,000, opener Shikhar Dhawan struck a sparkling 137 and Ajinkya Rahane an explosive 79 to fire India to a mammoth 307-7 and ensure their opponents would need a record chase at the stadium to win. India were then outstanding in the field, sharing the wickets and running out two batsmen as South Africa were skittled for 177 with 10 overs to spare, losing their last seven wickets for 44 runs.

It was India's first win against South Africa at the World Cup after three previous losses. Though the match may have little consequences for their respective campaigns, India, roared on by a blue-clad, flag-waving army of fans will have reaped a huge confidence boost from downing the highly-fancied South Africans following their emotional opening win over Pakistan. Melbourne resident Dhawan's sparkling ton anchored century-plus partnerships with Virat Kohli (46) and Rahane as AB de Villiers' men toiled on a steamy day in the field after losing the toss. In an uncharacteristically clumsy fielding display, the Proteas dropped three catches, including a sharp chance to Hashim Amla at backward point that reprieved Dhawan on 53. Adding to their Proteas' pain was an apparent hamstring injury to seamer Vernon Philander who bowled just four overs. India by contrast were positively South African in their fielding, with Mohit and India captain and wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni combining to run out de Villiers for 30, an important breakthrough to end a 68-run partnership with Faf du Plessis.

Du Plessis was unable to dig in after raising his half-century, miscuing a slog straight to Dhawan at mid-off to be out for 55 and leave his team reeling at 133-4. JP Duminy (6) and David Miller (22) followed quickly, the latter run out by an excellent throw from Umesh Yadav at square leg. The South African tail then expired quickly. Ravichandran Ashwin finished with 3-41 to lead the India bowling, with fast bowler Mohammed Shami and medium pacer Mohit grabbing two wickets each. South Africa's selectors dropped Farhaan Behardien in favour of Wayne Parnell and the move back-fired with the fast-bowling all-rounder conceding 85 runs from his nine overs. Parnell would eventually dismiss Dhawan in the 44th over after the 29-year-old skied a pull shot to Amla at long leg, having raised his seventh ODI century. The faith in Imran Tahir was better-placed, however, with the leg-spinner capturing Kohli's wicket with a full toss. Rahane bashed three sixes in a glittering 60-ball knock before being trapped lbw by Steyn with four overs to spare.","India beat South Africa by 130 runs after bowling them out for 177 .

"It’s hard to recall a bowling performance as complete as that from England. Sure, it was a good toss to win and conditions were ideal. But they barely put a foot wrong until they allowed MS Dhoni and Ishant Sharma to scrape together a few for the last wicket. Even that, though, only took India to 148. It was important that Chris Woakes and Chris Jordan backed up the two big guns. Woakes has bowled pretty well in this series without much luck, while Jordan has been short of rhythm.

But it was clear that Alastair Cook now has more faith in them, just as he’s developed faith in Moeen Ali. For maybe the first time, the captain wasn’t trying to make sure that one of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad was always bowling. Cook hasn’t suddenly become a brilliant captain because his seamers are bowling well, just as he wasn’t a dreadful captain when they were struggling earlier in the summer. But he’ll be quietly excited about the mood around this team. Waiting in the wings are Steven Finn and Liam Plunkett, while next off the batting rank are guys like Alex Hales, James Vince, James Taylor and — in limited-overs cricket — Jason Roy. Samit Patel’s in the mix too. When you look at where they’ve come from, it’s quite an effort. Losing 5-0 in Australia, the home defeat by Sri Lanka, then going 1-0 down to India. The whole team deserves a lot of credit. But the two men Cook owes most to are Anderson and Broad. In a gruelling five-Test series, they’ve been the guys who have come through and kept up the pressure on the likes of Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli. Keeping up: Anderson finds time to have a bit of fun on the first day of England vs India at the Oval . Technique: Anderson (pictured) and Broad are the two men who captain Alastair Cook can thank the most . Fit: In a gruelling five-Test series, Anderson (pictured) and Broad have been the guys who have kept up . The fact that those two keep making the same mistakes is down to the pressure exerted by England’s new-ball bowlers. Pujara was bowled by another Broad nip-backer, while Kohli has forgotten where his off stump is, mainly thanks to the working over Anderson has given him. As for India, their batsmen look mentally shot — with the exception of Dhoni. He came in for a bit of criticism after taking Wednesday off to go shooting, but obviously a sense of perspective helps a bloke like him who has so much on his plate. A few of his team-mates could maybe do with something similar. Bowler: Broad may require knee surgery after this Test but looked to keep up his high intensity on Friday . Celebrate: Broad has helped revive Cook's captaincy with his fine form against India throughout the series .","Chris Woakes and Chris Jordan took three Indian wickets each on day one .

"The NBC News crew exposed to Ebola were forced into mandatory quarantine after chief medical correspondent Nancy Snyderman violated their voluntary isolation to visit her favorite soup restaurant, reports revealed. The 62-year-old was one of seven people ordered to cut off all human contact for 21 days on Friday as doctors treat the station's cameraman Ashoka Mukpo for the deadly disease. It emerged this weekend that the crew would have been allowed more freedom if it weren't for Snyderman's alleged trip to Peasant Grill in Hopewell Boro, New Jersey, last Thursday. Scroll down for video . Ventured out: Nancy Snyderman violated her voluntary isolation to visit her favorite soup kitchen, according to reports . Witnesses claimed Snyderman arrived at Peasant Grill in Hopewell Boro, New Jersey, wearing shades . Witnesses claimed the physician and broadcaster wore sunglasses with her hair in a ponytail as she pulled up outside the restaurant and a man dashed in to grab the order, according toTMZ. The website confirmed today the man who ran inside was a member of the NBC crew who was also under quarantine. Nancy Snyderman and NBC News had yet to respond on Monday to MailOnline's requests for comment. Dr Snyderman is said to be a regular at the restaurant and has often used their catering service. The team had initially been encouraged to isolate themselves following Mukpo's diagnosis. The group was reporting on the Ebola outbreak for NBC News in Liberia when Mukpo was diagnosed with the deadly virus just a day after he was hired to work on the team. However, someone in the NBC crew violated the voluntary agreement forcing New Jersey officials to step in and issue a mandatory quarantine order on Friday night. Dr Snyderman (pictured while reporting in Liberia) was one of a group that had contact with Ebola patient Ashoka Mukpo, their cameraman . The doctor and the other crew members will now have to cut all human contact for the next 21 days . The cameraman was infected in West Africa but is being treated in Nebraska. Mr Mukpo returned to Twitter on Monday to thank well-wishers for the 'good vibes' and say that he was feeling better. It also emerged this weekend that the freelance cameraman was facing half a million dollars in medical bills. A page on charity fundraising site, Gofundme, revealed he had raised close to $48,000 towards the cost of his treatment. A spokesman for NBC said the network could not comment on any individual case, but noted that the team was deemed to be low-risk upon its return from Liberia. He added that they had agreed to follow the guidelines set by local health authorities which included the 21-day isolation period. He said: 'We fully support those guidelines and continue to expect that they be followed. 'Our team are all well with normal temperatures, which they check multiple times a day, and they are also in daily contact with local health officials.' Meanwhile, in a phone interview with the Today show last week, Dr Snyderman said all the gear she and her crew used was being disinfected because they all shared work space and vehicles. Ashoka Mukpo was infected in West Africa a day into working for NBC but is being treated in Nebraska . Mr Mukpo, 33, revealed on Monday afternoon that he was feeling better and thanked well-wishers for their 'good vibes' The State Health Department insisted the rest of Mukpo's crew remains symptom-free and there is no reason for concern of exposure to the deadly virus to the community as further diagnoses are revealed . She also said that she believed she and her team were at a low risk because they have been 'hyper-vigilant'. The State Health Department insists that the crew remains symptom-free and there is no reason for concern of exposure to the deadly virus to the community. Hospitals across the U.S. remained on high alert on Monday over the outbreak of Ebola. Despite wearing protective clothing, a nurse in Texas was diagnosed this weekend with the disease after treating Thomas Eric Duncan, the first man to be diagnosed in the U.S. Nina Pham, 26, from Fort Worth, Texas was one of the team of medical staff at Texas Health Presbyterian where she treated Mr Duncan. She is now being kept in isolation at the same hospital and is said to be in a stable condition.

"Fernando has revealed he is studying Nemanja Matic in a bid to improve his own game as Manchester City's enforcer, ahead of the key clash with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. The Brazilian, a summer signing from Porto, played against Matic on numerous occasions as the Serbian turned out for Benfica and calls his Premier League rival 'incredibly important' to Jose Mourinho's side. Saturday night's encounter between reigning champions and current league leaders has been billed as a title decider and much of the war will be won in midfield battles. Fernando tussles with Middlesbrough's Patrick Bamford during Saturday's FA Cup clash . 'It's a specific position and one that is really important for every team all over the world,' Fernando said of the holding role. 'I played against Matic in Portugal several times and he is a really great player. He has so much quality. 'There are not many players like him left now, I think, but he is one of those I try to look at and learn from as I try to improve the way I play that role. 'He is a player that has become incredibly important to Chelsea. I always try to watch these players in this position because there are so few left. I know I can learn from them.' Chelsea's Nemanja Matic battles for possession with Liverpool's Philipe Coutinho . Fernando has come in for criticism in recent weeks and admits he is still adjusting to England. 'It’s always hard to start a life in a new country, changing places and cultures,' he said. 'You are trying to adapt on the pitch and away from it, and with things like the language, that is always quite difficult. 'I have been here for six or seven months now, though, and I am starting to find a little bit of continuity in my work and getting used to things. 'It is a little different. The players here are always running. It is a very physical, very strong sort of football. It is very intense and I have suffered a bit because of that as I try to adapt. Fernando says he is still adjusting to life in England following his summer switch to City . 'And then there are things like the conditions you have to play in: it snowed when we played against West Brom, and it rains a lot. 'I was prepared for that, though, and I knew that it would always be very difficult when we played away from home. These are all the things you have to adapt to, as well as your team and the league itself. 'I am quite a physical player, a player who likes that part of the game, marking players, to help out his team, to provide support to the players in front of me. 'That was what made me want to take this opportunity, to see if I had the characteristics that suit English football.'","Fernando has revealed he is studying Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic .

"That was a really important innings for Ian Bell. There had been a lot of focus going into this game on the senior players’ lack of contribution, and after Alastair Cook responded with 95 on Sunday, that left Bell among the batsmen needing to perform. This was just what he needed — and it was a pleasure to watch. Stand up and be counted: Ian Bell stepped up when it mattered to hit 167 against India . Double act: Ian Bell and debutant Jos Buttler inspired England into a commanding position . Bell’s previous Test hundred was 20 . innings ago, at the end of the home Ashes series where he’d been the . only England batsman to stand up to the Australians. In that series, he . perfected the late cut on slow, low pitches — a stroke he was encouraged . to play because Michael Clarke took men out of the slips and didn’t . always protect third man. I . think Bell managed to train the brain to play the shot, and it brought . him a lot of runs. But since then, on bouncier surfaces, he had failed . to adapt. When there is more life in the track for the seamers, the late cut becomes a more dangerous option. You have to be careful. The signs in this innings were that he was alive to the risk. Bell generally shelved the shot until the pitch got a bit slower and lower, and the Indian bowlers tired. I also liked the way he chose the moment to attack. Long time coming: Ian Bell had not hit a Test century in 20 innings . In . the past, Bell has been in the shadow of the likes of Kevin Pietersen . and even Jonathan Trott. Now he’s the senior man in that middle order, . and that means seizing the moment. The way he went after Ravindra Jadeja . in the afternoon session was a sign he was happy to take . responsibility. It’s a subtle change of mindset for a guy who now needs to show the likes of Joe Root and Gary Ballance the way ahead. Bell . also went past 7,000 Test runs during the course of that onslaught, and . into England’s top 10 Test runscorers, ahead of Andrew Strauss. I . remember Darren Gough motivating himself by carrying around a list of . Test wicket-takers, and ticking them off as he went past them. Perhaps . Bell could now do the same, because he’s achieved plenty of other things . in his career: 100 Tests, 21 hundreds, Ashes wins. Seeing . himself overhaul some of the great names in English batting may be just . the motivation he needs as he moves into the last few years of his . career.

"That was the most one-sided game I have ever seen. It was a complete annihilation. We thought England would be better once they stopped playing Australia but this was worse. Give full credit to New Zealand because they produced the most complete performance I have seen in one-day international cricket. The way Brendon McCullum led them with imaginative, attacking tactics and aggressive field placings made this a lesson for England in how to play modern one-day cricket. Morgan described McCullum as 'the most destructive batsman in the world' after England's heavy loss . The bottom line is that England still play old-fashioned limited-overs cricket. Their default position in difficult times is still to go back to Test players, like we have seen with Gary Ballance, rather than a more attacking option. If they keep going down that road they will keep getting bitten. They look a fearful side who were up against a team playing without fear. It was swing bowling that did for them — orthodox swing bowling like they would have faced since they were kids. Very good swing bowling from Tim Southee, yes, but this is international cricket and opposition bowlers are allowed to swing it. New Zealand captain McCullum seems to enjoy the moment as he consoles England captain Eoin Morgan . This wasn’t mystery spin or sub-continental conditions. They should have coped much better than they did. Look at how McCullum went about it in reply. OK, he is in the form of his life and he was only chasing 123 but he came charging at England and did not let them settle. In contrast, most of our batsmen look out of nick. I hope whoever was responsible for making those late changes to England’s team before they played Australia will sit back now and learn from this. All we are doing is going round in circles when we should have been settled. England's James Taylor (left), Ian Bell and Moeen Ali trudge off the field after defeat by New Zealand . I’m not one for always thinking that players outside the team are better than the ones in it and I’m not sure England would achieve anything from throwing Alex Hales in now. Hales should have been picked for the 50-over team as soon as he scored that World Twenty20 century in Bangladesh and he would have played 20 one-day internationals by now. Yes, he had a few technical problems when he first played in ODIs but that’s what happens at the highest level. As it is we drop people like him before we have given them a proper chance and their confidence evaporates. England back players in Test cricket but do not have the same principles in one-day cricket. Tim Southee tore through England's batting order, taking 7-33 and restricting England to 123 all out . Bell is bowled by Tim Southee to kick-start England's humiliation by the co-hosts . Now it is clear there is a huge gulf between what Australia and New Zealand are doing and what England are producing. So how do we close the gap in time for this World Cup? England have got to ask why players like Hales and Ben Stokes are playing fearlessly for their counties, the Lions, and in the Big Bash but are not doing it with England. What happens to them when they get inside that England dressing room? Are they being weighed down by too many theories? It should be about the culture of a team, not endless strategies. Eoin Morgan must look at the way his good friend McCullum is doing the job and go down that same road. And do it as quickly as possible.","England were annihilated by New Zealand at the World Cup on Friday .

"Manchester United are due to hold talks with Danny Welbeck over his future in the coming days. The England forward is unsure how much of a role he will play this season with Louis van Gaal and will weigh up his options over the next fortnight. Hull have tried and failed to sign him while Sunderland are keen as their search for strikers continues. Tottenham and Everton would be expected to show an interest also although the latter may struggle to afford a deal. VIDEO Scroll down for Alonso masters the master as he nutmegs Real legend Zidane . Doubts: Danny Welbeck wants talks with Manchester United over his future at the club . Unsure: Welbeck does not know where he will fit into manager Louis van Gaal's plans . Welbeck has been happy at United but wants to play and knows with European football his opportunities will be more limited this season. Van Gaal is also eager to see how James Wilson copes this season after impressing for the club's U21s. United are giving a trial to 15-year-old Belgium youth star Indy Boonen, who left Genk this summer, but may only sign one, possibly two, players between now and the close of the window. United's hierarchy maintain they are not chasing Real Madrid's Angel Di Maria nor Roma defender Mehdi Benatia who is a target for Bayern Munich. Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus is likely to become more of an option next season when his £20million clause kicks in. Roma's Kevin Strootman is also still in their their immediate plans. It is understood, former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso has also been offered to United and others as Real Madrid continue to look to trim their squad. Offered: Real Madrid want to trim their squad and have earmarked Xabi Alonso as one player who could leave . Arteta injury woe may make Arsenal go to market . Mikel Arteta's ankle injury will prompt Arsenal to consider their transfer options over the coming days. Arsene Wenger has been focusing on getting his side through the Champions League qualifier with Besiktas but has had an eye on recruiting a defender with Atletico Madrid's Toby Alderweireld and Kostas Manolas from Olympiacos among the options. However, the need for more defensive qualities in his midfield remains. Much faith has been placed in the versatility of Calum Chambers but Arsenal have taken a fresh look at his former Southampton clubmate Victor Wanyama. The Kenya midfielder impressed scouts in last week's game against Liverpool where he helped suppress the influence of Steven Gerrard on the game. While Morgan Schneiderlin earned plaudits for his return, Wanyama's performance was noted as he gave Southampton's defence extra protection and allowed the front five to advance in the second half. Option: Arsenal are considering a move for Victor Wanyama (left) as cover for Mikel Arteta . Coach Ronald Koeman is a fan of Wanyama but the 23-year-old has become unsettled by the sales in the summer and is keen to see who else the coach brings in over the next fortnight. Wanyama's role at Southampton has been understated but the statistics support his affect on the team with less goals conceded when he plays. The Premier League's top six are continuing to monitor his progress. Arsenal have also asked about Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Adrien Rabiot. The talented 19-year-old is expected to spend another season on the periphery of PSG's first team and is keen to leave but it won't be easy as the French champions demand £24m for him despite his contract having just one year left. AC Milan have offered Rabiot a two year loan. Wenger says Arsenal have not had offers for any of his players but noises out of Germany persist that Lukas Podolski is a target for Galatasaray among others and the striker could be sold for £10m. Balotelli on brink of shock Liverpool move . Liverpool have agreed a fee of £16million and hope to complete a permanent deal for Mario Balotelli. The move has surprised many at Anfield as Brendan Rodgers was adamant there was too much baggage with the Italian for him to fit into Liverpool's harmonious group. The turnaround comes as Rodgers recognised the need for extra quality in attacking positions remains and Liverpool's other options have diminished. Liverpool were prepared to pay the £12m loan fee and £8m in wages for Radamel Falcao's season loan from Monaco but the player still wants Real Madrid and the manager's reservations over Samuel Eto'o are that he is too much of a spent force. Talks had been continuing with the Cameroon striker's people up to Wednesday. Return: Mario Balotelli is set to join Liverpool for £16million from AC Milan . No go: Radamel Falcao wants to move to Real Madrid rather than Liverpool . Everton have also held talks with Eto'o's representatives but while Roberto Martinez recognises the qualities the 33-year-old still possesses he has similar reservations to Liverpool and wonders whether a tight budget will be put to better use on younger players. Belgium starlet David Henen will complete his move from Anderlecht but could go out on loan. Meanwhile, AC Milan will look to replace Balotelli with an ambitious attempt to sign Jackson Martinez from Porto. They will also make a renewed request to Arsenal for Joel Campbell on loan. Porto have asked about Hull City target Vincent Aboubakar from Lorient. Steve Bruce is hopeful though of reaching accord with Blackburn for Jordan Rhodes as reported in Sportsmail. Leeds target an Italian job (or two) Leeds United's expected march on the Italian transfer market is continuing as they show an interest in Udinese full-back Marco Davide Faraoni. Owner Massimo Cellini has closed a £1m deal for Ternan striker Mirco Antenucci and is holding talks over a loan for Cagliari's Brazilian playmaker Adryan, and the 22-year-old Faraouni is seen as less of a risk having played for Watford in the Championship last season. One player Leeds did miss out on, forward Kieran Agard, has joined Bristol City who have agreed a fee with Rotherham. The 24-year-old failed to agree personal terms with Leeds but League One Bristol City and manager Steve Cotterill have struck a deal. Spurs braced for a double departure . Tottenham are braced for a renewed push from Napoli for midfielder Sandro while Roma have made further enquiries for defender Vlad Chiriches. On the move? Totenham midfielder Sandro is wanted by Serie A side Napoli . Roma's Walter Sabatini and chief executive Mauro Baldissoni have been in London to assess what the market demand is for their players while also looking at options in attack and defence. Fernando Torres at Chelsea and Manchester City's Matija Nastasic were discussed a couple of weeks ago and further talks were held this week. Roma have Mattia Destro and Mehdi Benatia to offer but Destro in particular has been told by new Italy coach Antonio Conte that he must play regularly if he wants to make the national squad and a move to Chelsea does not promise that. Tottenham is a possible option for Destro but that may depend on what cash they are offered for Roberto Soldado. Chiriches is an alternative to Nastasic, who also has interest from Juventus and Arsenal, but the Romanian is also nursing a back injury at the moment which may slow down negotiations. Napoli will look to take Sandro on loan after the injury to Manchester United's Marouane Fellaini. Chopra to play under Little Master... and James . Former Blackpool, Newcastle and Sunderland striker Michael Chopra has been signed up to play for Sachin Tendulkar’s Kerala Blasters in the inaugural Indian Super League. Kerala, who are co-owned by Indian batsman Tendulkar, will be managed by former Liverpool and England goalkeeper David James who has also been selected as the franchise’s marquee player. Chopra, 30, who has scored 114 goals during spells with Cardiff, Watford, Ipswich and Blackpool, was Kerala’s first pick in Thursday’s International Players Draft in Mumbai. He said: 'I am very excited to have been picked by Kerala Blasters. I just can't wait to get the boots back on and get on the pitch.

"Strictly beat The X Factor on Saturday night in the ratings war, winning an average audience of 9.9million viewers . When Denise Van Outen was signed up to Strictly Come Dancing, there were mutterings that her stage school training might put her at an unfair advantage. Now those complaints have got a whole lot louder after the presenter and West End star topped the leader board with an impressive score of 32 out of 40. Miss Van Outen, 38, flaunted her pedigree dancing a jive with partner James Jordan on Saturday night, and executed a perfect cartwheel, despite suffering whiplash in training. Scroll down to watch a video . Fabulous! Denise Van Outen and James Jordan topped the scoreboard following an impressive jive . But viewers were unimpressed and vented their frustration on social networking site Twitter. Fashion journalist Hilary Alexander alluded to Miss Van Outen’s spells in musicals Chicago and Legally Blonde. She said: ‘Fantastic jive from James and Denise – and so it should be! She’s had plenty of West End experience.’ Another objected to a high score being given so early in the competition. Celebrating: Miss Van Outen and James Jordan celebrate after topping the leaderboard . ‘Nobody should be getting all eights, so unfair on the other contestants for Denise to be in Strictly.’ Former TV presenter Johnny Ball didn’t stand a chance. West End star: Critics have claimed Denise van Outen has an unfair advantage in the show after following roles such as Roxie in Chicago . The former television presenter found himself and partner  Iveta Lukosiute in the dance off against Daybreak's Richard Arnold and Erin Boag. After . giving his all in his final waltz, Johnny was applauded and given a . standing ovation as he emotionally said: 'I did pretty well for my age'.

"Click here to read former England coach David Lloyd's column following the heartbreaking news of Phillip Hughes' death . You never expect something like this to happen in your game. Yes, we have seen serious injury in cricket and yes people have died playing the game, but I just did not believe it could happen to a professional in the modern, helmeted era. This is an absolute tragedy for the family of Phillip Hughes, his friends and the whole cricket community. It will stay forever with those team-mates and opponents who were on the field with him at the SCG on Tuesday. I have seen people hit on the head in a cricket match and thought, ‘Crikey that’s bad.’ But if a batsman is knocked down you always expect them to get back up again. You don’t expect them to stay down, like poor Hughes did. VIDEO Scroll down to watch A tribute to Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes . Australian batsman Phillip Hughes tragically passed away aged 25 after being struck  by a bouncer . Hughes (left) chats with Simon Katich (right) before play at the third Ashes Test  at the Edgbaston in 2009 . I never feared facing a cricket ball and maybe as a pro you have to be like that if you are going to succeed. But I know that if I was playing now I would be feeling very different about what could happen the next time I went out to bat. You are taught as a batsman to keep your eye on the ball but if you cannot hit it then your instinct when batting or fielding at short leg is to turn your head away, as Hughes did at the SCG when he went through with the shot too early. You do it as an act of self-preservation if you cannot hit the ball or get out of the way of it but it can expose the back of your head and neck where Phillip was hit. I was always told that your temple was the area in most need of protection, not the back of the head. This will make everybody who plays the game at any level think again, not to mention the manufacturers who try to make helmets as effective as they can be. Sportsmail's Nasser Hussain (left) commentates during the toss before the 2013 third Ashes Test at Old Trafford as England captain Alastair Cook (middle) invites Australian counterpart Michael Clarke to call . If anything, short leg fielders are even more vulnerable than batsmen because you are in the lap of the Gods fielding there. I would urge all cricketers, young and old, to think about their safety as much as they possibly can. As I said here the other day, it is in the nets or watching others bat where you can be most at risk. Keep your eye on the ball at all times. I didn’t know Phillip well but those who did say he was a terrific lad who was very popular among his team-mates and throughout the game, not only in Australia but in England and wherever else he played. He was a little fighter on the field, as we saw with the way he overcame technical issues to be on the brink of a Test comeback with Australia, but this was one fight he just could not win. It really was a freak accident. The Adelaide Oval, Hughes' home ground, pays poignant tribute after the news broke on Thursday . Cricket Australia have a tricky decision to make as to whether next week’s first Test against India should go ahead at the Gabba. How can people like Brad Haddin, David Warner and Nathan Lyon, who were there at the SCG with Hughes, holding their dying friend in their arms, possibly think about playing now? I think it should come down to each individual’s decision. The Test could be held as a tribute to Hughes but if any of the players do not feel in the right frame of mind to play again so soon then that will obviously be respected by everyone. Should the game change? Well, protective equipment will inevitably be looked at but there is only so far you can go with helmets. If they are so heavy and comprehensive that they can effect movement or vision then they could do more harm than good. It is a balancing act. Maybe the game needs to look at intimidatory bowling at tail-enders too. We used to giggle when we saw someone like Phil Tufnell backing away from fast bowlers but this tragedy puts that very much into context. What I would say is that fast bowling is one of the great attractions of cricket. Watching Mitchell Johnson last winter was absolutely exhilarating, the best part of the Ashes. It is a great skill and not one that can be taken away from cricket. Cricket will take stock, do everything it can do, but ultimately it will carry on. It has to. For now all we can do is offer every sympathy to Phillip’s family and friends who are going through something no cricketer’s loved ones ever should.

"With her Made In Chelsea partying days behind her Millie Mackintosh has been embracing the seriously healthy lifestyle with gusto… and reaping the benefits. The 24-year-old star is looking better than ever thanks to an intense workout regime and super lean and green diet with plenty of juices and supplements. And it appears Millie credits one particular magical potion for her dewy complexion. She's recently tweeting and sharing pictures on her Instagram account of bottles of Skinade sitting beside her perfectly balanced meals. Millie posted this 'barefaced selfie' with her Twitter followers, claiming her glow stems from drinking Skinade . The former Made In Chelsea star, who is now a serious health fanatic, also shared this snap of her ultra healthy meal with a bottle of Skinade on the side . Millie is a fan of sharing her meals, and various juices and healthy drinks, with her fans . TV presenter Laura Whitmore and designer to the stars Melissa Odabash have similarly praised Skinade on their social media accounts. So what distinguishes it from the plethora of other supplements and health drinks on the market? The 150ml drink claims to provide everything your skin needs to remain healthy from the inside, rather than from a cream or moisturiser. Each bottle contains skin boosting ingredients including collagen, omega 3 and 6, vitamin C, the amino acid l-lysine and B complex vitamins, said to be at the same level as 9 tablets would provide. Laura Whitmore apparently used Skinade to her through a day of shooting, posting this snap of a bottle against a table of make up . Presenter Laura Whitmore is renowned for her enviably fresh looking and glowing skin . Designer Melissa Odabash is another fan of Skinade, posting this snap of four bottles lined up . And ultra-fit Millie, who has previously confessed she is ‘obsessed’ with exercise and even wears her workout clothes on her ‘day off’ from the gym, is probably also won over by the minimal 35 calories in each bottle. But at £90 for a 30 day supply it will certainly put a dent into your monthly budget, and some experts argue that it will do no more for you than eating a healthy well balanced diet will or drinking more water in terms of the appearance of your skin. Beauty . expert Elsa McAlonan says: ""I am cynical - but then have seen friends who . swear by collagen drinks and supplements and . have amazing glowing skin. But it could be down to a . number of factors - for healthy skin you need plenty of sleep, exercise, a good . diet, regular facials - plus drink plenty of water  - and follow a good . skincare regime, of course.' And plastic and . reconstructive surgeon and skin cancer expert  Dr Marko Lens added:  'There is no scientific evidence that collagen oral supplements have any . effects on skin health and appearance at all. 'Furthermore, there is no . guarantee that oral collagen would be any more effective than any diet rich in . proteins (such as meat, cheese, eggs or beans) at restoring the collagen in . your skin.'","Stars such as Millie and Laura have been posting pics of Skinade .

"Four to six weeks or, in football terms, about eight games. That's how long Manchester City must make do without Sergio Aguero. The same Aguero who, on May 13, 2012, scored a goal timed at 93:20 to win the Barclays Premier League title. The same Aguero that less than three weeks ago scored a Champions League hat-trick to single-handedly dismantle Bayern Munich. Talk of when Chelsea's season would be curtailed by a supposedly inevitable Diego Costa injury has muted. In a cruel twist, it is Manuel Pellegrini who must cope without his MVP, not Jose Mourinho. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero lies injured holding his knee on the pitch at the Etihad against Everton . Aguero's knee injury will keep him out for four to six weeks, and has been confirmed by Manuel Pellegrini . An emotional Aguero catches his breathe on the sidelines as he is substituted with the injury on Saturday . Aguero was able to walk off unaided but a scan revealed the extent of the unfortunate injury to his knee . Aguero leaves the Etihad pitch with an injury that could keep him out for up to six weeks through winter . Aguero’s final contribution of 2014 was 75 seconds on December 6. Manchester City beat Everton without him, but only through the softest of penalties that should never have been. More than 90 minutes, injury time included, and they could not penetrate Everton without referee Andre Marriner’s help. Whether Aguero is to Manchester City what Luis Suarez was to Liverpool remains to be seen. But, as luck would have it, they could hardly have asked for a more inviting fixture list. Leicester City, Crystal Palace, West Bromwich Albion, Burnley and Sunderland, all loitering in the bottom seven of the Premier League, await the champions between December 13 and January 1. Sheikh Mansour, owner of Manchester City, did not strike oil to tinker with a toy. His £200million Etihad Campus is the finest in world football and 15 points are expected. Followed by Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup third round, then Everton, Arsenal and Chelsea, by which time Aguero is expected to be fit. Come late January, we will know if the sky blue eyes have blinked. The time of Aguero's Premier League title-winning goal is on the wall of City's £200million training complex . Aguero's hat-trick against Bayern Munich kept City in the Champions League less than three weeks ago . City remain in the Champions League after going to Rome as they made their way into the last 16 . A comparison of City's performances with and without Aguero since his debut in the Premier League . The sad truth is, no matter how appealing the fixtures, he is a bigger loss than Pellegrini would care to admit. With Aguero, their Premier League win percentage is 69.6. Without, it dips to 63, they score less goals (2 to 2.3), have fewer shots (12.8 to 13.4) and don’t take as many points (2.1 to 2.2). Over at Stamford Bridge a few may argue they have the best in the Premier League, though Costa’s 11 goals in 999 minutes to Aguero’s 14 in 1,054 are inferior and he's enduring a barren run. Aguero's form of 2014 obliterates 2012 and 2013, too, as shown below. Quite comfortably, actually. In layman's terms, City have lost almost a goal a game (0.93) and five shots (4.93) from one of the Premier League's deadliest finishers. Scratch beneath the surface and Pellegrini’s reliance shows. Jesus Navas last scored in the Premier League on January 18, James Milner on December 21, 2013, and Samir Nasri on May 11. The nearest colleagues to Aguero's 14 are Yaya Toure and Stevan Jovetic on four. Aguero's form this Premier League season (far left column) has obliterated his averages in the past two years, and Chelsea striker Diego Costa only has him beat in shot accuracy (far right column) Aguero's form of 2014 obliterates 2012 and 2013 but injury will see the striker out for up to six weeks . 19 - Sergio Aguero . 6 - Yaya Toure . 5 - Frank Lampard . 4 - Edin Dzeko, Stevan Jovetic . 2 - David Silva, Pablo Zabaleta . 1 - Clichy, Demichelis, Navas, Milner, Nasri, Pozo . Edin Dzeko has two, and Jose Pozo, so new he is absent from the club website’s official squad list, has none. Can Pellegrini trust them to fill the void? Would you? Gary Neville wouldn’t, hence his suggestion Aguero’s injury could cost them a third Premier League title. It wouldn’t be the first time. In 2008, Alex McLeish said Eduardo’s broken leg and dislocated ankle at Birmingham cost Arsenal. They were six points clear in February, before finishing third. In 2010, Sir Alex Ferguson was convinced an ankle injury to Wayne Rooney cost Manchester United, who ended a point behind Chelsea. Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville tweeted on Sunday that Aguero's injury could decide the Premier League title . City manager Manuel Pellegrini will be without his key striker until 2015 and must rely on others now . Manchester City, however, have prevailed since Aguero’s absence, even without a true lone striker, which the average positions in their last four matches demonstrate, shown below. Higher than any other player, Aguero (No 16) was supported by Jovetic (35) and Nasri (8) against Southampton and Sunderland, with Navas (15) glued to the right wing. They won 3-0 at St Mary’s and 4-1 at the Stadium of Light. Straightforward. Then, Everton. Aguero off, replaced by Pozo who, in turn, was substituted for Dzeko (10) on 63 minutes. Nasri averaged the highest position with Milner (7). And so to the Italian job at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. No Aguero. No Vincent Kompany, Toure or David Silva, either. Only the second match City  played since 2011 with those four not starting. Dzeko (10), one blank away from matching the longest drought of his Manchester City career, was given the unenviable task of deputising for Aguero. Manchester City average positions with Aguero (No 16):  vs Southampton (left) and vs Sunderland (right) Manchester City average positions without Aguero: vs Everton (left) and vs Roma (right) Edin Dzeko, one blank away from matching the longest drought of his City career, deputised for Aguero . Pellegrini dug in his heels, denying Manchester City are a one-man club. ‘It is one thing that a player can be in a very good moment as Sergio was until today but I don’t think he has carried us. Every big team must have important players like Sergio,’ he said. ‘I suppose (Cristiano) Ronaldo is very important for Real Madrid, (Lionel) Messi is very important for Barcelona but neither of those teams are all about just one player.’ He was right. Half chances came and went for understudy Dzeko but, through Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta, they won 2-0. A team effort. Samir Nasri (centre) scored as City beat Roma 2-0 to do the Italian job without injured striker Aguero . City goalkeeper Joe Hart (left) applauds the travelling fans that went to Rome and emerged with a 2-0 win . vs Sunderland: 64.6% - 761 . vs Everton: 51.4% - 484 . vs Roma: 42.6 - 421 . Against Leicester, they will try to retrieve their passing game, which has diminished as opposition got harder. At Sunderland, they enjoyed 64.6 per cent possession and made 761 passes. At Everton, it plunged to 51.4 possession and 484 passes. At Roma, even further to 42.6 possession and 421. Crosses went up, too, which Manchester City rarely turn to when the 5ft 8in Aguero is clinging on the shoulders of the defence. But football is a results business. Two down, six or so to go. Leicester at the Etihad next. So, as Neville suggests, should we consider them done for? Sir Alex briefly thought so on May 13 two years ago then, at 93:20, he paid the price. Aguero will be missed by Pellegrini and Co up front but City have shown they are no one-man team . March, 2012: Injures foot against Chelsea. Misses two games: City draw both. August, 2012: Injures knee against Southampton. Misses three games: City win one, draw two. April, 2013: Injures hamstring against Wigan. Misses next game: City lose against Tottenham. September, 2013: Picks up knock against United. Misses next game: City lose against Aston Villa. January, 2014: Injures calf against Tottenham. Misses three games, City win one, draw with Norwich and lose against Chelsea.

"For a lot of people their car is their pride and joy - but how many of us would splash out £250,000 on keeping it off the roadside? A double garage has sold in London for over a quarter of a million pounds - nearly £100,000 more than the national average cost of a house. According to the latest Land Registry figures the average UK home costs £169,624. But while many struggle to get their foot on the property ladder, one buyer has snapped up a double garage for a cool £251,000. A double garage unit in North London was sold for £251,000 at an auction this week, putting it at a level well over the price of an average British home. For the money the new owner can enjoy mains electricity in each of the two garages, and there is an option of connecting to water on-site. The storage facilities went for more than three times the list price when they went under the hammer at a property auction in London yesterday afternoon. Described as a 'postage stamp of land', the site is situated on a leafy street in Highgate, north London. But the new owner may have got a steal, in an area where a five bedroom house can set you back £6million, the land has been sold with development potential. However, no planning rights have been obtained yet. The garage is in leafy Highgate, North London where a five bedroom property could set you back £6million . Estate agents described the site as being:  'Conveniently situated with a frontage to Clifton Road, in a popular residential area close to both the local shopping and travelling facilities of Crouch End and Highgate.' Auctioneer James McHugh, of McHugh & Co - the estate agents who hosted the auction, said: 'This was an exceptional price and sales like this are quite rare. 'There were two garages in Crouch Hall Road on a small plot of land 25ft two inches by 34ft in depth that were listed at £80,000. 'There was a lot of interest in the room and finally they were knocked down for £251,000. 'Someone thinks there is development potential although we didn't sell it with any planning consent or permission. 'It's a modest site, but if you get planning permission you may get a house on there.' The previous owners, who had a portfolio of properties dotted around London, had owned the plot for 19 years. Mr McHugh added: 'Such sales are not uncommon in London, but ones like the plot in Crouch Hall Road are rare. 'They often come with development potential and developers will see that potential and pay large sums to secure ownership.' The Highgate double garage is not the only London lock-ups with a hefty asking price. Many tiny spaces in the capital have sold for a small fortune with buyers keen to take advantage of their investment potential. In 2010 a dilapidated row of storage units in Primrose Hill went on the market with a whopping £1.25million asking price. But the new owner could rest assured that they would own property in the same trendy area as Kate Moss. The lock-ups which in Primrose Hill which, because of their trendy postcode, had a £1.25million asking price . In 2012 a 6-metre long garage went on the market for £525,000, but that was because of its pricey postcode in Knightsbridge - home to Harrods and some of the world's richest people. A garage in Knightsbridge which went on the market for £525,000 in 2012 . And in August this year a 224sqft Highgate lock-up, which had been converted into a studio flat went on the market for £250,000.

"‘What would people say if I only asked to ban Muslim clothing? They would burn me as a Muslim hater’ Far Right: French National Front leader Marine Le Pen has called for a ban on Jewish headgear . Far right politician Marine Le Pen has caused outrage across France by calling for the banning of the Jewish skullcap in public. The leader of National Front won a fifth of the popular vote during the first round of May’s presidential election on a largely anti-Muslim immigration agenda. Now in an interview she has called not just for a ban on the wearing of Islamic veils in public, but also the kippah – leading to France’s most senior Rabbi to describe her view as ‘deeply deplorable’. Her inflammatory words come at a time of heightened tensions caused by a Paris satirical magazine’s decision to publish a series of cartoons mocking both Islam and Judaism. One of the images in Charlie Hebdo shows a Prophet Mohammed character being pushed around in a wheelchair by a Rabbi. Ms Le Pen told Le Monde that all religious headwear should be banned ‘in shops, on public transport and on the streets’. ‘It’s obvious that if the veil is banned, the kippah should be banned in public as well,’ she said. The French parliament passed a ban on full-face coverings, including the Islamic veil in 2010 and the law came into force last year. Miss Le Pen, whose infamous father Jean-Marie Le Pen is a convicted racist and anti-Semite, also called for a ban on public prayers. And she said kosher and halal foods should be outlawed in schools, along with foreign governments being allowed to pay for mosques. ‘Jewish skullcaps are obviously not a problem in our country,' she said, insisting nevertheless that France has to ‘ban them in the name of equality’. ‘The situation in our country has changed. We used to have a fragile balance between religions, but massive immigration has changed that,' Ms Le Pen said. ‘Veils and jilbabs are putting us under pressure. France is a victim of sectarian political groups due to the ruling parties’ incapacity to deal with the problem. ‘What would people say if I had only asked to ban Muslim clothing? They would burn me as a Muslim hater.’ President Francois Hollande attacked Ms Le Pen’s comments. ‘Everything that tears people apart, opposes them and divides them is inappropriate,' he said. 'We must apply the rules, the only rules that we know - the rules of the Republic and secularism.’ Religious headgear: The kippah, or yarmulke, is usually worn by Orthodox or Hasidic Jews who believe the head must be covered at all times . On Friday Mr Hollande opened a new Holocaust memorial in Paris, commemorating the thousands of Jews who were sent to their deaths after being held at the Drancy internment camp. The camp was run by French policemen working alongside the SS, and rolling stock from France’s national railway, SNCF, was used to take victims to Germany. Jean-Francois Cope, leader of the opposition UMP party, was similarly outraged, saying Ms Le Pen barely knew what secularism was. Mr Cope said: ‘Marine Le Pen wants to ban any signs of religion on the streets, starting with the veil and the kippah. ‘By doing this, she shows she does not understand anything about secularism. Secularism is not about the eradication of all religious expressions in society.’ Gilles Bernheim, France’s Chief Rabbi, said: ‘Mixing up the tradition of the skullcap and the veil only generates more confusion in people’s minds. I deeply deplore her statement.’ And Richard Prasquier, leader of the  CRIF Jewish council in France, said the Ms Le Pen’s claims showed there were ‘secular fanatics just as there are religious fanatics'. 'Obviously, I am hostile to both,’ he said. The CFCM, France’s main Muslim council, meanwhile said that Le Pen wanted to ‘set up a totalitarian regime in France.’ There are around half-a-million Jews in France, many of them living in major cities like Paris, where skull caps have been a familiar sight for centuries.","Ban on full-face coverings - including the Islamic veil -  came into force in France last year .

"The Petrol Retailers' Association has warned fuel prices could increase by 5p per litre before the end of September . Petrol prices are set to rise 5p per litre as global factors including the civil unrest in Syria and Egypt push up crude oil prices, retailers have warned. The fall in Libya's oil exports and the rise in demand from Asia have also forced the price of crude oil up, the Petrol Retailers' Association has said. The association made the prediction as the Goldman Sachs Group suggested Brent crude prices could rise to $115 a barrel in the 'very near term'. The association's chairman Brian Madderson said: 'UK petrol prices have not yet seen the full impact of this crude oil increase due to the rapid and slightly unexpected revaluation of pound sterling from $1.48 to $1.56. 'Therefore it was concerning to read recent comments from the City that the ""pound is overblown"" and will soon come hurtling down towards the $1.45 level. 'We calculate at current wholesale prices that this will add a further 5p per litre at the pump before the end of September and hit businesses and households in the pocket at a time when pundits are forecasting a continued increase in retail sales to drive growth in the economy. 'Should the Middle East tensions escalate further and crude oil prices react accordingly, the Bank of England’s new inflation targets could be significantly challenged.' Last week it was revealed motorists are having to deal with a ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ attitude to petrol pricing as some towns charge far more for unleaded and diesel than others, according to the AA. The motoring organisation said that in some areas there are 'pump price dogfights', as supermarkets and other forecourts battle to be the cheapest. But in areas that lack this competition, prices remain higher. Unrest in Egypt and Syria are among the factors for the rise in crude oil prices, according to the PRA. Much of Cairo has been flooded with armoured vehicles and soldiers in a crackdown on protests . It came as the AA's monthly fuel price report revealed petrol pump prices had gone up by an average of 3p a litre since June and were showing no signs of falling away.

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was the first to endorse Portuguese compatriot Luis Figo’s highly unlikely bid for the FIFA presidency. However, that support was not enough to stop Chelsea from cancelling a press conference at Stamford Bridge where Figo was due to launch his election manifesto. Instead the event took place at Wembley on Thursday. The Paris Metro racism row involving Chelsea fans would have put paid to Figo’s appearance there in any case, because racism questions would have overshadowed the event. But it emerged on Thursday that Chelsea called off Figo’s launch ahead of the Metro incident because the club wanted to stay apolitical and felt it ‘inappropriate’ to host a challenger to Sepp Blatter. Luis Figo launched his FIFA presidential manifesto at Wembley Stadium, and spoke about the World Cup . Figo speaks to the assembled press in front of a message explaining his plan to 'give back' to football . Chelsea weren’t aware when the booking was first made that it involved publicising Figo’s manifesto — and action was taken immediately it became clear what would be happening. The decision was made at communications department level, according to Chelsea. And it can only be speculation as to whether owner Roman Abramovich would have wanted Figo using his club, with Russia the next hosts of the World Cup organised by Blatter-led FIFA. Meanwhile, Figo’s manifesto was full of varied proposals from redistributing more money to grassroots football to a 48-country World Cup. But he still came across as a pawn in UEFA’s multi-ball attack on Blatter rather than a genuine contender. However, at least he could reel off FIFA executive names in answer to the inevitable question about how many he knew. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was the first to endorse Figo’s highly unlikely bid for the FIFA presidency . The ECB’s restructuring, which neither new CEO Tom Harrison nor chairman-elect Colin Graves have explained, includes the ruling body’s best known figure Mike Gatting being axed from his role as managing director of cricket partnerships. Former England captain Gatting has been reduced to a 50-days-per-year ambassadorial role, which might explain his silence over such shabby treatment. The ECB are already advertising for Gatting’s replacement to be called director of participation and growth. Ex-England captain Mike Gatting has been axed from his role as managing director of cricket partnerships . Sky Sports, who have already broken the bank for their £4.2billion spend on Premier League football, have pledged another £88m to the Football League to extend their deal for another season in 2018-19.

Leeds, pantomime club for all seasons, are still unravelling dysfunctional governance from before Ken Bates sold up in 2012. Former director Melvyn Levi’s wife Carole had her harassment case against Bates upheld at the Court of Appeal before three judges. Levi had won his harassment case — his wife initially lost — against Bates three years ago. It followed Bates using Leeds’ in-house Yorkshire Radio station to broadcast appeals for Levi’s whereabouts and using the matchday programme to suggest Levi’s marriage was in trouble. Levi is now consulting lawyers on whether to pursue former Leeds chief executive Shaun Harvey, now Football League CEO, on the same charge. Levi alleges Harvey was involved in organising the radio broadcasts. Harvey made no comment. Next week’s International FA Board summit in Belfast will see FIFA president Sepp Blatter collide with the FA’s Greg Dyke and David Gill, who were both vocal at last year’s FIFA Congress about the need for a new leader of FIFA.

"Newcastle United will sign Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow from Nottingham Forest - but the pair will spend one last season at the City Ground. The north-east side reached an agreement with Forest boss Stuart Pearce to see off competition from Arsenal, Queens Park Rangers and West Ham for their signatures.

Rising star: Newcastle United have signed 20-year-old defender Jamaal Lascelles from Nottingham Forest, though he will be loaned back to the Championship club for the season ahead . Safe hands: Newcastle have also signed Forest's goalkeeper Karl Darlow, though he will too remain with Stuart Pearce's side for another 12 months . Defender Lascelles, 20, had signed a four-year contract with Forest back in August 2012 and became a regular in the team last season. 23-year-old goalkeeper Darlow is a product of Aston Villa's academy, moving to Forest back in 2006. He emerged as the club's No 1 back in 2012 and has 67 first team appearances for the club. Agreement: Forest manager Stuart Pearce believed that Newcastle would be the best destination for the pair . Possible deal: Newcastle United have been keen on France international Clement Grenier for a while . Meanwhile, manager Alan Pardew remains keen to bring in another striker, while a deal for Clement Grenier at Lyon remains a possibility.

Mr Stoupin spent four months photographing corals and due to the complexity of the techniques he used, would spend up to 10 hours to produce one or two images . Some of the pieces were no bigger than 2cm and high magnification was needed, such as to capture this Blastomussa coral with its intriguing microscopic spines . However, to capture the rainbow of colours, a special torch was used to light up the corals. According to Mr Stoupin, an advanced full-spectrum light, rather than normal white light from a torch, allows the different colours to be made visible. He said: 'Corals, even the biggest ones, have details, which would escape our attention. The marine biology student used an advanced full-spectrum light, rather than normal white light from a torch, to photograph the different colours in this sample of Blue-Crlimrph coral in all its glory . He originally planned on photographing coral underwater, but knew he would need precise motion and a camera positioned on something solid, which is next to impossible underwater . 'I thought that corals would be especially fascinating but the technique requires precise motion and the camera has to be positioned on something solid, which is next to impossible underwater. 'However, capturing the colours was my second reason to go for studio photography instead of diving.

Mr Stoupin said many representatives of marine life possess fluorescent pigments, which are responsible for their colour, but they don't reflect light similarly to substances that are familiar to us. This fragment of reverse prism favia coral almost appears to glow . Under a normal white torch light most corals like this spiky coral would look brown and colourless but the moment you shine full-spectrum light on them, they light up with an entire rainbow of colours, according to Mr Stoupin . 'For example, grass is green because it reflects green light whereas a fluorescent pigment is capable of transforming blue light from the water into green. 'Thus a coral can be green even when there's no green light to reflect,' he explained.

"He's a brave hero who never turns his back on a fight, and his name is Rocky. Not the boxer famously played by Sylvester Stallone, but this labrador-husky cross, who helped his owner drag a nine-year-old girl to safety after she fell into the fast-flowing waters of Canada's icy North Saskatchewan River. Rocky's owner Adam Shaw told how his dog jumped into the water, allowing Samara Sunshine - who had fallen in with her 10-year-old sister while out tobogganing - to grab on to his lead as he towed her back to the snow-covered riverbank. Scroll down for video . Hero: Rocky, a labrador-husky cross, helped to pull nine-year-old Samara to safety as she was being swept along an icy river in Canada . Danger: Samara, nine, had been tobogganing along the snowy banks of the river with her 10-year-old sister when the girls fell in . Mr Shaw, 27, who was alerted by the sisters' screams while out walking with his dog in Edmonton on Sunday, managed to haul Krymzen to safety, but Samara was swept out of his reach by the current, according to a CNN report. He tried to throw his dog's lead to the girl for her to grab on, but she was already too far away, so Mr Shaw reattached it to Rocky and instructed his dutiful dog to jump in the water. 'He jumped in right beside her,' said Mr Shaw. 'I called him back and he swam toward the ice.' Rescue: Mr Shaw managed to haul  Krymzen, 10 (pictured), to safety, but her sister Samara was swept out of his reach . Rocky managed to tow Samara close enough to the bank for his owner to grab her arm, and his pet, and get them away from the water's edge. The girls' relieved mother, Miranda Wagner, has said she cannot bear to think about what might have happened had Mr Shaw and Rocky not come across the scene. She told CNN affiliate CTV: 'Doctors said two more minutes and Samara would have been gone. 'I just want to give him a big hug and tell him he's my hero. If he wasn't there I wouldn't have my girls.' Scare: When Adam Shaw and his dog Rocky came across the scene, he saw one girl in the water as her sister tried to drag her out . 'Miracle': Mr Shaw dashed to the girls' help with his pet dog Rocky after hearing their cries as he walked across a bridge spanning the river on Sunday . It is thought the ice extending from the riverbank gave way beneath one of the girls' toboggans on Sunday. Mr Shaw, who was walking along a bridge over the river when he heard the girls' cries, said he looked down and saw one girl in the water and another trying to pull her out. By the time he and Rocky and sprinted down to the riverbank, both girls were in the water. He dragged Krymzen back onto the bank, but Samara was already too far away. 'She said she couldn't move her arms, couldn't move her legs,' Mr Shaw explained. As he and his dog tried to get closer to the young girl, the ice gave way beneath them. By the time they were out of the water, Samara had drifted 50 or 60 yards downriver and was struggling to keep her head above water. But Mr Shaw refused to give up, sprinting to the girl again while his dog leaped into the water to help tow her to safety. Fire crews arrived shortly after Samara was pulled on to the riverbank and the sisters were taken for treatment. Hero: Rocky was treated to a gigantic rawhide bone by chiefs at the local fire station as a reward for his efforts . Mr Shaw, who said it was 'a bit of a miracle' that everything had worked out, and his dog were honoured for their efforts at the local fire station on Monday. Fire chief Ken Block, who said the Sunshine sisters were 'very, very fortunate' that Mr Shaw and his pet came along, presented the 27-year-old with a fireman's hat, while Rocky was rewarded with a giant rawhide bone.

"Islamic State terrorists have released a horrific new video showing the execution of a prisoner killed with a pump-action shotgun. This latest graphic and shocking footage has all the militants' trademark slick production effects and features a light-skinned executioner dressed in similar costume to the now infamous 'Jihadi John'. The prisoner, believed to be a Syrian soldier captured by ISIS, is forced to wear the same kind of orange jumpsuit worn by Western hostages before they are savagely beheaded by the terror group. The killer is seen ranting in Arabic behind the doomed prisoner before the HD footage is edited into slow-motion and the militant is seen catching the shotgun, thrown to him by somebody off camera. Seconds later he fires a single round into the back of the victim's head causing horrific injuries far too graphic to publish. The film rewinds and replays the moment of impact in gruesome detail several times, before cutting to a shot of a pool of blood and the prisoner's dead body. Scroll down for video . Brutal: This latest graphic and shocking footage has all the militants' trademark slick production effects and features a light-skinned executioner dressed in similar costume to the now infamous 'Jihadi John'. In the film the unidentified killer wears the now familiar uniform of the Islamic State executioner - a black robe, a black balaclava to mask his identity and a brown leather gunbelt. But in a departure from the terror group's notorious beheading videos, this latest execution is carried out with a pump-action shotgun - a weapon more often associated with gangland killings in the U.S. and Britain than jihadis. The film begins with the captured soldier - understood to be a member of Bashar Al-Assad's Syrian Arab Army - wearing a military combat uniform as he is made to read a statement to the camera. He is then seen having his hands tied behind his back being marched to an area of scrubland behind a stone wall beneath a hill. Islamic music - known as a nasheed - accompanies the video as the prisoner appears resigned to his inevitable grisly fate. Sick: The killer is seen ranting in Arabic behind the doomed prisoner before the HD footage is edited into slow-motion and the militant is seen catching the shotgun, thrown to him by somebody off camera . Killer: When he finally finishes ranting the ISIS executioner raises the shotgun and fires a single round into the back of the man's head, causing him to slump forwards, face-down in the dirt . After being led to the courtyard the prisoner is forced to kneel in front of the executioner while he issues what appears to be be the customary warning to the enemies of the Islamic State. When he finally finishes ranting the killer raises the shotgun and fires a single round into the back of the man's head, causing him to slump forwards, face-down in the dirt. The video finishes with a graphic slow-motion playback of the blasting of the shotgun into the man's head, as well as gruesome close up shots of his dead body. The shotgun method of execution marks a departure from the now familiar beheadings witnessed in previous videos but the impact is no less graphic. Horrific: The most recent video execution, before the film of the 'shotgun' killing was released, was that of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh who was burned to death in a cage (pictured) Anger: Safi al-Kasasbeh (centre in red head scarf), the father of slain Jordanian pilot Moaz, leads anti-ISIS demonstrators in Jordan following his son's brutal murder . The most recent video execution, before the film of the 'shotgun' killing was released, was that of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh who was burned to death in a cage. The release of the video, which may have been filmed some weeks ago, shocked the world and provoked a military response from the King of Jordan who launched a series of air strikes against the extremists' strongholds in northern Syria. ISIS terrorists have killed 2,000 people in Syria during the past six months, the majority of them civilians. Over the past two months, ISIS has also executed 120 of its own members, most of them foreign fighters trying to return home, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ISIS has taken vast parts of Iraq and Syria and last June declared a caliphate in the territory under its control. Since then it has fought the Syrian and Iraqi governments, other insurgent groups, and Kurdish forces.","Gruesome video shows militant killing prisoner with single shotgun round .

"How are you feeling today? Chances are, not that great... Because this morning you woke up on what has come to be known as ‘Blue Monday’ - the day of the year on which most of us feel at our lowest ebb. There is indeed not much going for the third Monday of the year. Feeling blue: The third Monday of the year is the day on which most of us feel at our lowest ebb . If you struggled with travel chaos this chilly morning, that will only have added to the woes that come from feeling poorer after an expensive Christmas and minimal hours of daylight. Added to failed New Year’s resolutions, a general drop in motivation, and the summer far away in the future, you could be forgiven for not wanting to get out of bed at all. On the plus side, we are likely to be in better form tomorrow. But for the 24 hours of Blue Monday we will just have to grit our teeth and have an early night. Miserable: People have got a lot to feel depressed about at this time of year . A report suggests that a major reason for a drop in motivation comes from the continued winter darkness after the brief highlights of Christmas and New year. A survey by Anglian Home Improvements into the impact of reduced daylight over the winter months found that the vast majority of us feel it has a negative impact on our wellbeing. Their report claims 79 per cent of us feel that limited hours of daylight has a negative effect on our mood. A spokesman for the company which quizzed 2,000 respondents said: ‘The survey shows a clear link between natural daylight, mood and motivation. ‘It’s encouraging to learn that little changes, like making sure you sit near a window or somewhere with as much natural light as possible, can make a big difference to how we feel and cope with winter.’ It has been suggested that the concept of ‘Blue Monday’ was based on junk science drummed up by a travel company as a clever ploy to have us booking holidays to sunnier climes. It is thought the date was picked out by psychologist Cliff Arnall after he came up with a scientific formula based on the length of time until next Christmas, holiday debt and the likelihood of giving up New Year’s resolutions. Mr Arnall first wrote about ‘Blue Monday’ seven years ago - in a press release for Sky Travel, a now defunct British TV travel channel. He based the theory on the ‘hibernation’ effect - a time of year when people feel tired, don’t exercise, stay indoors and eat comfort food. He has said previously: ‘It is the combination of factors that make life right now particularly uncertain. ‘There is threat of job redundancy and the cost of food and fuel are going up.’ Since the idea of Blue Monday has become well known Mr Arnall, from Brecon, Wales, has admitted the idea of a single most depressing day was ‘not particularly helpful’ because it became ‘a self-fulfilling prophecy’ and that achieving happiness and being less materialistic was a year-round aim.","Woes include travel chaos, feeling poor after Christmas and lack of daylight .

"A man who says he is seeking a celebrity lifestyle has been given a nose job by the NHS while it  refuses to fund the cancer treatment of a five-year-old girl who lives nearby. Sam Barton, 22, has boasted about how easy it was to get the £5,000 procedure and admits he only wanted it so he could look like ‘the perfect man’. The operation was paid for by NHS Birmingham CrossCity Clinical Commissioning Group. Five-year-old cancer victim Kelli Smith has been told her treatment won’t be paid for. Britain's vainest man: Sam Barton, 22 from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, . was given a £5,000 nose job on the NHS as part of his bid to become 'the . perfect man' She has suffered from neuroblastoma, an aggressive . and often deadly form of childhood cancer, and has already had three . tumours removed after a relapse. She cannot get further treatment on the NHS, so her family are attempting to raise £500,000 so she can have it abroad. Kelli’s . father, Tom Attwater, 31, who has a terminal brain tumour, said last . night it was wrong for the NHS to ‘throw away’ money on cosmetic . procedures. ‘This man and anyone else should pay for themselves, unless they have a serious medical condition,’ he said. ‘I . wake up every day with a terminal illness worrying about how to . fund-raise £500,000 for Kelli’s treatment if she relapses. This is where . NHS funding should go.’ Mr . Barton, who lives close to Kelli’s family in Sutton Coldfield, admits . he secured the cosmetic surgery by pretending to cry in front of his . local GP. Mr Barton had the operation, left, to try and copy the lives of people such as Joey Essex, right, who appeared on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! He said: 'I feel that if I mirror celebrities, like Joey, I will look and feel good' ‘Getting the NHS . to pay was the easiest thing I have ever done,’ he said. ‘If you say it . is ruining your life and you are a good actor it is easy. I can be very . manipulative. ‘I said that . all my friends are celebrities or glamour models and really beautiful . and I am the only ugly one in my group of friends. If you don’t know . what to say, just cry.’ Mr . Barton, who works part-time in a bar and a supermarket, already had his . nose straightened two years ago. He claims he could have had that on the . NHS as well, but having it privately was quicker. He . says he has spent £20,000 for dental work, including full porcelain . veneers, and friends and family have paid for Botox, eyebrow threading, . tanning injections, body waxing and hair extensions. The nose job was paid for by the NHS which has refused to fund treatment for cancer victim Kelli Smith, five . Mr . Barton is also expecting the taxpayer to foot the bill for further . cosmetic surgery, including another nose job, as well as having his ears . pinned back and jaw reshaped. He . said: ‘I understand why people get angry when the NHS pays for people . like me to have nose jobs, but when they make it so easy how can you . blame me?’ He says he is . friends with White Dee, who has gained notoriety after featuring in . Channel 4’s Benefits Street, and says he plans to accompany her when she . goes partying in Magaluf again next month. On . social media there are dozens of photographs of Mr Barton posing with . minor television celebrities. He says he is trying to copy the . lifestyles of people such as Joey Essex, who appeared on I’m A Celebrity . ... Get Me Out Of Here! ‘It . is my ultimate dream – as everyone wants – to look and feel like a . celebrity,’ he said. ‘I’m chasing a lifestyle and I feel that if I . mirror celebrities, like Joey, I will look good and feel good. ‘If . the celebrities are spending all their money on treatments, I want to . too. I will definitely go to the NHS first and try my luck.’ He . said he has to wait 12 months before he can go back again. ‘I will just . say that they had not done what I asked for and that it looks worse . than before and do the whole routine that it is ruining my life and turn . on the waterworks,’ he said. ‘I try to see a different GP every time so that they buy my story.’ Last . year, aspiring glamour model Josie Cunningham, 22, had her breasts . enlarged at a cost of £4,800 on the NHS using a similar tactic – by . claiming her flat chest was ruining her life. Under NHS guidelines, . cosmetic surgery should be funded only in rare circumstances ‘to protect . a person’s health’. Mr Barton’s procedure was paid for by the NHS Birmingham Commissioning Group after he was referred to a consultant by his GP. A . spokesman for the group said: ‘We do not comment on individual cases. All operations and interventions would only be undertaken on medical . grounds and would require the approval of an appropriate clinical . consultant.’ Other families . whose children have been refused life-changing operations on the NHS . last night told the Daily Mail of their anger at the case of Mr Barton. Jake . Foster, 13, was refused an operation that would prolong his life. His . mother Debbie said: ‘It makes me so angry that someone can play the . system like this. Crocodile tears may have worked for him, but we cried . real tears, begged, started a petition and went to our local MP but . nothing worked.’ Oliver . Dockerty, three, was refused an operation that would allow him to walk. His mother Claire said: ‘What I don’t like is when people like this rub . it in your face. People are struggling to get the money for procedures . that could genuinely change someone’s life.’","Sam Barton, 22, wants to 'mirror' Joey Essex so he 'looks and feels good'

A video, uploaded to YouTube by user Lewis Hilsenteger, shows the iPhone 6 Plus bending using just his fingers. It has already been viewed more than 18.5 million times. Today it was revealed that if your iPhone 6 Plus has become bent out of shape, Apple may offer you a replacement. A support employee told The Next Web during a web chat that the decision would be '100 per cent up to the store' in which the device was returned to - and that it would be on a case-by-case basis. But, the employee added that if, following an inspection, the damage met certain guidelines then a free replacement would be covered by the phone's warranty. Apple has not released an official line about the replacements, and is not commenting on reports that the larger handset is vulnerable to being bent. Following . the unveiling of Apple’s smartwatch, internet . jokers rushed to post pictures of their own version of the gadget. These . included a red apple carved into a classic wristwatch design with a . rounded face (pictured), created by Japanese Twitter user Hiromichi . Shoji . Since the iPhone 6 Plus (pictured) launched on Friday, reports have emerged that 'a small but growing number' of owners are claiming the frame bends if the device is left in pockets for an extended period of time. An Apple support employee has since revealed the firm may replace bent devices - but only on a case-by-case basis . The reason for the bend is due to the iPhone 6 Plus being made out of aluminium. Aluminium is a relatively soft metal and is fairly ductile and flexible so, if enough pressure is applied, it will bend and move. According to iMore, no part of either of the new iPhones has more than a quarter of an inch (0.64cm) of aluminium in any spot. This means that, in areas of the phones that are weakest, it’s possible it could be susceptible to bending. This is noticeable in images, with many of the bends occurring near the volume buttons and the SIM card slot. These areas have segments of the shell cut out to make room for the buttons and SIM card, so there is less aluminium - and they are more likely to bend. To stop the phone bending, users need to ensure that they do not put increased pressure on the middle of the phone. For example, do not have it sideways in a pocket, as your pocket will push it against your leg, possibly causing bending. Putting it in your back pocket could also have a similar effect, so storing it in a shirt pocket or bag might be a better option. Another option would be to make sure you have a case for the phone so that it can maintain its rigidity even when pressure is applied. It . has been reported that the thinner design of the 5.5-inch phone and the use of aluminum on . the frame will cause the new iPhone 6 Plus (pictured) to bend if pressure is applied . The bendy feature of the new iPhone (pictured) has been met with wide criticism on social media . While many are creating spoof adverts, other Twitter users flagged up the fact that many handsets will bend under a similar amount of pressure. App developer ‏@drbarnard said: 'It’s actually impressive that the 6 Plus doesn’t break. Seems like that much pressure on any device would do damage.' While TechCrunch co-editor @panzer added: 'Just an anecdote: I carried around the iPhone 6 Plus for 5 days in a pocket at Disneyland on rides & coasters and did not bend it.' Reports in 2012 claimed that the iPhone 5 had similar frame weaknesses. The iPhone 5S release last year was met with similar complaints. And as Apple's bad week continues, the firm was forced to remove its latest software update following reports it broke certain features on the new handset. As its the second major issue to arise with Apple's newest iPhone since it was launched on Friday, many are claiming the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are the most troubled new products since the iPhone 4 and 'antennagate.' Other devices have been released recently that were specifically designed to have a curved frame, including the LG G Flex (pictured).

"Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. This week, Mad Dog has his say on touchline bust-ups, why Alan Pardew should not be blamed for what is going on at Newcastle, and why Arsenal could have been serious contenders if Walcott and Ramsey had been fit for the whole season. STOP THIS TOUCHLINE MADNESS . I may be known as Mad Dog, but this technical area craziness must be stamped out. Over the Bank Holiday weekend we’ve seen more technical area spats and this is now obviously something that has to be addressed in the summer by the Referees’ Association and the League Managers Association. Madness: Chelsea's manager Jose Mourinho holds back assistant coach Rui Faria . Losing his head: Faria was sent to the stands after his confrontation with Mike Dean . At Blackpool on Friday and Spurs on Saturday, coaches of both clubs had flare-ups with their own players. At Stamford Bridge, Jose Mourinho’s assistant Rui Faria totally lost the plot in his reaction to the fourth official and was sent to the stands. This trend seems to be happening more and more. The demand for results, the constant speculation about managers’ jobs, the increase in social media networks and scrutiny from the media makes the the technical area more difficult and high-pressured than it has ever been. Last year, when I was in charge at Gillingham we had zero tolerance to any abuse or dissent towards match officials. Not seeing eye to eye: Danny Rose and Spurs coach Tony Parks have words on the sidelines . Squaring up: Blackpool coach Bob Malcolm pushes substitute Stephen Dobbie . Clash: Sub Stephen Dobbie was preparing to go on when he was confronted by coach Bob Malcolm . More often than not if my players got a yellow card for dissent they were immediately substituted. Something has to be done. DON’T PICK ON PARDEW . I saw Alan Pardew’s Newcastle United play at Upton Park just after Christmas and the team were absolutely outstanding. They moved they ball around the pitch, controlled the game and were always a danger. They were competitive all over the park and each time the Frenchman Yohan Cabaye, playing in the No 10 role, got the ball between the West Ham lines he looked to thread intricate passes through for Loic Remy to get in behind the defence. Making the call: Alan Pardew makes changes from the stands by phone . Money in the bank: Newcastle owner Mike Ashley will benifit from another season in the Premier League . They had pace on the wings and they looked a quality outfit. Cabaye was their quarter-back and Remy was their wide receiver, running on to passes to damage the opposition. Subsequently Cabaye was sold, Remy was injured and their cutting edge had gone. Before then, there was a lot of talk of Newcastle nicking a Champions League fourth spot. But . they brought in no replacement of real quality for Cabaye and the . players and supporters faced four months with no real goal to aim for . and a comfortable mid-table finish assured. The owner, Mike Ashley, is £19million richer and the club is guaranteed another £120m from the Premier League next season. From his point of view as a business it has been a great season. But if those two players had stayed together Alan Pardew would have once against been lauded as a top class manager. Off the field what happened at Hull is obviously inexcusable, whatever the circumstances. But underneath, I’m sure he feels very frustrated as he could have taken that team on to challenge the big boys. The supporters who want him out, should be very, very careful what they wish for. CASHING IN ON STERLING . Raheem Sterling is a banker for Roy Hodgson’s England team. Star turn: Liverpool's Raheem Sterling scores his second goal to put his side 3-1 ahead . Starting young: Sterling was a hot-prospect at QPR . I’ve been lucky enough to watch Liverpool . three times during the last month and without doubt that boy has got to . be in the starting XI when it comes to the first game in the World Cup . against Italy. The 15-year-old boy I saw playing on the wing for QPR’s youth team destroying the Brentford left back has now changed into an attacking midfield player, comfortable at the point of the diamond. He is superb at retaining possession, tracking back to help the midfield players and breaking out on the counter with extreme pace. He’s got courage, self-belief and, most importantly at the top level, pace to get away from people. You could say Andrea Pirlo for Italy is a stroller in front of the back four, but let’s see how he handles the electric Sterling. THE WENGER BOYS . Everyone’s criticising Arsene Wenger and wondering if he will get the sack or be moved on. If all his players had stayed fit, without a shadow of a doubt Arsenal would have maintained their challenge for the Premier League title. Welcome back: Aaron Ramsey has been a big miss for Arsenal this season . I watched Theo Walcott in the second half at Upton Park shortly after Christmas, and he terrorised the West Ham left back Razvan Rat. Walcott had him running up drain pipes, twisting and turning him inside out. And he changed the game with his explosive pace and quality in the final third. Running them ragged: Allen was impressed with Theo Walcott against West Ham this season . Take out Aaron Ramsey, with his ability to break the line and leave people behind, and Jack Wilshere, with his wonderful passing, it is too much for any manager.Wenger goes quietly about his business, without moaning and complaining and with total dignity. The man is class. Last Tuesday, I was on BT Sport’s SportsHUB programme and I have to share this hilarious anecdote with you. As . our show was coming towards the end, presenter Caroline Pearce came on . to introduce what was coming up on ‘UFC: Beyond the Octagon’ which was . on later. I was watching in the studio as this beautiful lady announced the name of the fighter joining her on the show. ‘This is the best farter I have seen this year,’ she said by mistake. I slid under the pundits desk in embarrassment, trying to keep a straight face.The place was in stitches. The weekend marked a special day in the history of the old Dog. A . year ago on Saturday was the day Gillingham drew against AFC Wimbledon . to win League Two and be crowned champions. It was an amazing, surreal . feeling. After a jittery second half we somehow managed to hang on to get the point to take us to the title. It . made it even more special that the team cost nothing to put together . and that during the season we blooded seven young players from the youth . team.","Don't blame Alan Pardew for Newcastle's poor end to the season .

"Breathometer, the firm that makes smartphone-connected breathalysers, is hoping to make it easier for drunk people to get home. The company has teamed up with taxi-service Uber to allow the Breathometer app to call a ride when the user's blood alcohol content is near the legal limit of 0.08 per cent. As well as the 'call Uber option', the app also allows you to call a friend, schedule a cab, find somewhere to get food, or find a place nearby to spend the night. Scroll down for video . As well as the 'call Uber option', the app also allows you to call a friend, find somewhere to get food, or find a place nearby to spend the night. Pictured are various stages the app takes you through to call an Uber . In a recent blog post published, Uber revealed that it integrated with Breathometer nine weeks ago as a case study. The company says more than 54 per cent of Breathometer users who made it to the 'Get Home Safe' screen decided to take an Uber rather than call a friend. 'Having to call a friend or schedule a cab isn't always an easy choice,' said Charles Michael Yim, CEO of Breathometer. The user has to open a Breathometer mobile app on their smartphone, and then power up their gadget using the small button on the bottom of the product. The device should the automatically with the smartphone, and once connected, asks you to confirm it has been 20 minutes since your last drink .

The user is then asked to take a deep breath and blow into the mouth of the gadget for five seconds. Alcohol that a person drinks shows up in the breath because it gets absorbed from the mouth, throat, stomach into the bloodstream. As the blood moves through the lungs, some of the alcohol moves across the membranes of the lung's air sacs into the air. This concentration exhaled by the drinker can be detected by the device, which then uses a simple calculation to find out how much alcohol is in their blood. You no longer have to rely on an honest friend to tell you whether your breath smells unpleasant - now there's an app for that. Breathometer, has created Mint, a new gadget that assesses both the quality and hydration level of your breath. A small device that's placed in the mouth automatically draws an air sample and, seconds later, the Breathometer smartphone app reveals whether you're minty fresh or breathing fire. Users receive a 'mint score' between one and five, letting them know whether they're 'good to go' or 'need a mint'. Mint detects odor by measuring the volatile sulphur compounds in your mouth, which the company says can also indicate gum disease or tooth decay. The gadget also measures the moisture level of your mouth's mucus membrane and lets you know whether you need a glass of water.","Breathalyser is connected to an app that records how drunk you are .

"Stray and abandoned dogs taken from the streets of Spain may have ended up in pet food and farm animal feed, it has emerged. The authorities in Spain have not ruled out the possibility that protein or fats from the carcasses may even have been used in some processed human food. Britain’s Food Standards Agency says it is aware of the investigation and it is liaising with its counterparts in Spain. Stolen: Gangs apparently took dogs from animal sanctuaries and processed them for sale (file picture) Food chain: Stray dogs taken from Spain may have ended up in pet food or farm animal feed (file picture) A spokesman said: ‘We are aware of these reports and are in contact with the Spanish authorities about their investigation. ‘We are currently not testing food for meat from dogs. Our priority is to test beef products for gross contamination with horse meat because that is where the problem clearly is.’ A criminal gang in Spain apparently took the bodies of dogs and other animals from animal sanctuaries, vets, zoos and farms, which should have been incinerated, and then processed them to create protein and fats that could be sold on. Evidence has been found at warehouses and processing plants in Galicia and Salamanca. Last year, police found a warehouse filled with 15 tons of dead stray dogs which they believe were going to be processed into animal feed, in the Galician town of As Neves. Similar grisly discoveries have been found in warehouses elsewhere in the north of Spain. Seprona, the environmental arm of the Guardia Civil, has sent dozens of samples of commercial pet food to the Anfaco-Cecopesca laboratories in Vigo, Galicia, after a judge received reports from an industry whistle-blower. According to laboratory tests . performed in one of the processing plants based in the town of Aldeaseca . de la Frontera, in Salamanca, fat samples destined for animal feed had . DNA traces of both sheep and dog. Cannibalism: Spanish authorities have sent pet food samples for testing after reports from a whistleblower. Tests have already shown fat samples to be used in animal feed had traces of both sheep and dog . A major police investigation has been underway since March 2012, according to a report in Spain’s El Mundo newspaper. The pressure group Viva, which campaigns against meat eating, is writing to UK supermarkets to ask them to test their food for the presence of dog and other species. Its campaigns manager, Justin Kerswell, said: ‘It is a horrifying possibility that dog and rat meat might have entered the human food chain, but given the depth of ineptitude shown and the EU-wide fraud the horse meat scandal has exposed, it seems entirely plausible. ‘It may only be a matter of time before dog, rat and perhaps even cat meat is found in British processed food or farmed animal feed. ‘British supermarkets have been selling horse meat to consumers for years without knowing it, so what else has been on sale? They will have no idea unless they specifically test for it.’ Scottish Labour MEP, Alyn Smith, said: ‘These revelations from Spain indicate just where I fear this may be going.  By the time meat becomes ""protein"" then traceability all but breaks down, especially in the pet and animal feed markets. ‘I'm concerned that given the EU-wide pet food market this contamination could be considerably more widespread. ‘The spectre of forced cannibalism turns this issue into something considerably more serious, and we need reassurance that this is an isolated incident of criminality, albeit it would seem on a pretty significant scale given the reported sourcing of 15 tonnes of dogs must take some organisation.’","Spanish authorities have sent dozens of pet food samples for testing .

"Kevin Pietersen claims he could yet return to international cricket - if ECB chairman Giles Clarke departed the scene. It is a fanciful scenario to suggest Pietersen, sacked by England eight months ago, could resume his career with his adopted country under any circumstances such is the vitriol contained in his autobiography, which went on general sale on Thursday. But he has escalated his grievances to the very top in his latest interview to promote his book, in the Evening Standard. ECB chairman Giles Clarke sits alongside Kevin Pietersen as he is 'reintegrated' in October 2012 . Pietersen's released his autobiography this week giving his version of events in the last few years . TEST MATCHES . Matches: 104 . Innings: 181 . Runs: 8,181 . High score: 227 . Average: 47.28 .

Innings: 36 . Runs: 1,176 . High score: 79 . Average: 37.93 . Half-centuries: 7 . 'What would have to happen for me to be recalled by England?' he asks. 'Clearly, the boss would have to go.' Pietersen, who has already been highly critical of some of his former team-mates and former team director Andy Flower in his book and in earlier promotional interviews, hints he is aware of a possible change of guard. 'Clarke would have to go, and I've been hearing that could happen in the next few months,' he said. 'That's all hearsay, you never know. If there is a change at the top, there is potential, but we will wait and see.' It was Clarke who presided over the South Africa-born batsman's reintegration into the England team at an eerie press conference alongside Pietersen in Colombo in 2012, . That came after a three-month exile imposed on him for sending 'provocative' text messages about his own captain Andrew Strauss to members of the South African opposition during a home Test series. Pietersen is equivocal about where the power lies at ECB. 'Giles pulls a lot of strings,' he added. 'In terms of cricket, I believe Andy Flower pulls a lot of strings too. He has Giles Clarke in his pocket.' An ECB spokesman declined to comment on Pietersen's latest remarks. KP: The Autobiography includes Pietersen's account of a culture of 'bullying' in the dressing room under Flower's regime and orchestrated largely by Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann and Matt Prior. Pietersen signs copies of his new book at Canary Wharf on Thursday . The  batsman has dominated the headlines all week and seemed to be enjoying the limelight on Thursday . One of his grievances is the belief that certain former England team-mates were involved with a Twitter account called 'KP Genius', which sought to poke fun at the batsman. Alec Stewart (above) said on Wednesday night that he had been told three England players had access to a Twitter account parodying Pietersen . Former England captain Alec Stewart revealed on Wednesday night that he was told by the owner of the parody account, Richard Bailey - an acquaintance of Broad's - that Swann, Tim Bresnan and Broad all held the password to it as well. Stewart said he immediately informed the ECB about these allegations. Bresnan responded on Thursday morning, writing on Twitter that he did not have a password and was not involved in anything posted on the account. Swann denied any involvement too earlier this week, and Broad did so in an ECB statement in August 2012 - a fact soon reiterated by a spokesman for the governing body, who said: 'Alec Stewart raised concerns in the best interests of English cricket. 'It was investigated immediately. We dealt with this two years ago.' The matter was brought to a close back then by Broad's statement via his employers, released two days before the final Test of three against South Africa at Lord's. Pietersen was omitted from that match because of the mobile messages he had admitted sending about Strauss. Broad's statement at the time read: 'Following last night's statement by Mr Richard Bailey that he was responsible for creating a parody Twitter account in Kevin Pietersen's name, I would like to confirm that I had no involvement in this whatsoever. 'I met with the managing director, England Cricket, Hugh Morris this morning and assured him that I did not play any role in the creation of this account or provide Mr Bailey with any information regarding Kevin Pietersen or the England team. 'As has been widely reported, Mr Bailey is a friend of mine - but we had no conversations regarding this issue at all, and I am pleased that he has now decided to close the parody account down.' Stewart's conversation with Bailey took place during the first Test at The Oval in July 2012. At the end of Broad's statement on August 14, Morris added: 'Having discussed this matter with Stuart, I am fully satisfied that he acted in a professional manner at all times and did not breach any confidences regarding fellow England players. Stuart Broad (right) has denied that he had anything to do with the tweets mocking Pietersen . 'ECB also accepts the apology Mr Bailey offered last night to the England team via his Twitter account and his reassurances that no professional cricketers were involved in the creation of this site.' Bailey has subsequently reiterated that fact. Pietersen traces many of the controversies of the latter stages of his record-breaking England career to the 'horrendous' breach of trust and loss of respect he felt on being told his own team-mates were behind the parody account. He sets that context of disillusionment against the storm which erupted soon afterwards over the messages he sent about his captain. His reinstatement allowed him to become England's leading runscorer, and to play some of his finest innings. But in February, on his return home after the 2013-14 Ashes debacle, the ECB announced he was no longer part of the national team's plans.","Kevin Pietersen published his book, KP: My Autobiography, this week .

"Regrettable: Lego chief executive, Joergen Vig Knudstorp, said the company ‘should never have become part of Greenpeace’s dispute with Shell’ giant Shell following protests by Green campaigners. The Danish toy maker has announced it will not renew a current deal allowing Shell to hand out Lego sets at its petrol stations in 30 countries, following a viral online campaign. The campaign, which included a video showing an Arctic landscape with a Shell drilling platform made of Lego bricks covered in oil, was orchestrated by Greenpeace. The three month campaign saw more than one million people signing a petition calling on the toy brand to stop promoting Shell’s brand because of the claimed damage that will be caused to the Arctic landscape. Lego chief executive, Joergen Vig Knudstorp, explained the decision by saying the protest against plans by Shell to begin drilling in the Arctic next year ‘may have created misunderstandings among our stakeholders’. He said green campaigners should take up their concerns directly with the oil company, adding that Lego ‘should never have become part of Greenpeace’s dispute with Shell’. Mr Knudstorp said: ‘The long-term co-promotion contract we entered with Shell in 2011 delivers on the objective of bringing Lego bricks into the hands of many children, and we will honour it - as we would with any contract we enter. But he added: ‘We continuously consider many different ways of how to deliver on our promise of bringing creative play to more children. ‘We want to clarify that as things currently stand we will not renew the co-promotion contract with Shell when the present contract ends.’ Lego refused to say when the current contract expires. Greenpeace insisted the toy company was doing the right thing under public pressure and should choose its partners more carefully when it came to the threats facing children from climate change. The environmental group is calling for a sanctuary to be created in the Arctic to protect it from drilling and industrial fishing, and for there to be no oil exploration in Arctic waters as the melting ice cap makes the fragile region more accessible. Scroll down for video . Ian Duff, Arctic campaigner at Greenpeace, said: ‘This is a major blow to Shell. It desperately needs partners like LEGO to help give it respectability and repair the major brand damage it suffered after its last Arctic misadventure. Lego’s withdrawal from a 50 year relationship with Shell clearly shows that strategy will not work.’ Campaign: Greenpeace created a petition that was signed by more than a million people urging Lego to sever their relationship with Shell in response to the company's plans to drill for oil in the Arctic . He added: ‘LEGO’s decision couldn’t have come soon enough. The Arctic, and its incredible wildlife, like polar bears and narwhals, is under threat like never before. ‘Arctic sea ice is melting at an unprecedented rate, but instead of seeing the huge risks, oil companies like Shell are circling like vultures. Only weeks ago Shell gave us the clearest indication yet that it’s planning to go back to the Arctic as soon as next summer.’ Shell originally planned to drill around the Arctic coast of Alaska in 2013 and 2014, however it did not go ahead because of technical problems linked to the extreme weather. End of an era: After 50 years working together, Shell will no longer be allowed to hand out Lego sets at its petrol stations . In August, it filed a revised Arctic offshore drilling plan with US regulators but said it has not decided whether to start in 2015. Shell said: ‘Our latest co-promotion with Lego has been a great success and will continue to be as we roll it out in more countries across the world. We don’t comment on contractual matters. ‘We respect the right of individuals and organisations to engage in a free and frank exchange of views about meeting the world’s growing energy needs. ‘Recognising the right of individuals to express their point of view, we only ask that they do so in a manner that is lawful and does not place their safety or the safety of others at risk.’ The sets involved in the promotion include Lego racing cars and a Shell petrol station.

The LoopPay app securely stores all payment cards including credit, debit, loyalty and gift cards. These can be used to pay for shopping in 90% of shops and banks in the US. Customers simply tell the retailer which card they want to use before tapping the device on a reader. LoopPay's technology allows mobile payments through traditional magnetic credit card readers, so it can theoretically work in a lot more places than Apple Pay, which requires special payment pads to work. Samsung did not say how much it's paying to buy LoopPay. 'Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today announced that it has agreed to acquire LoopPay, the acclaimed mobile wallet solutions provider that turns existing magnetic stripe readers into secure, contactless receivers,' the firm said. LoopPay's technology has the potential to work in approximately 90% of existing point-of-sale (POS) terminals. 'This acquisition accelerates our vision to drive and lead innovation in the world of mobile commerce. Our goal has always been to build the smartest, most secure, user-friendly mobile wallet experience, and we are delighted to welcome LoopPay to take us closer to this goal,' said JK Shin, President and Head of IT and Mobile Division at Samsung Electronics. As part of the acquisition, LoopPay founders and veteran payment industry entrepreneurs Will Graylin and George Wallner will work closely with Samsung's Mobile Division. Samsung has an existing relationship with LoopPay, having first identified the potential for the pioneering technology when it became a strategic investor along with Visa and Synchrony Financial. 'We are excited to take our relationship with LoopPay to the next level, by bringing consumers a mobile wallet solution that is not just safe and reliable, but also widely accepted at more locations than any competing service,' said David Eun, EVP of Samsung's Global Innovation Center. 'LoopPay's outstanding leaders and team have deep-rooted relationships with banks, card networks and merchants that will complement those Samsung has established over the years.' 'LoopPay is focused on delivering a digital wallet solution that is dependable for consumers around the world, one that provides more value from card issuers and the merchants that serve them,' said Will Graylin, CEO of LoopPay. Never one to be outdone by its biggest competitor, Samsung is now looking to launch its own mobile payment service to rival Apple Pay (pictured at its launch with Tim Cook). Sources said the Korean tech giant is in talks with startup LoopPay to let people pay for goods using their phones . Apple Pay launched earlier this year and lets people with an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus pay for goods by tapping their handsets on NFC readers. It works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. 'We are excited to join the Samsung family to continue our goal of making smartphones trusted, secure smart wallets and unlock the limitless possibilities of mobile enabled commerce.' Late last year, sources told Re/code that the South Korean tech giant is in talks with startup LoopPay. Samsung has previously allowed NFC payments on certain networks and with partners including Barclaycard, but if it teamed up with LoopPay, the service would be expanded more widely. LoopPay calls itself a 'wallet solution' that lets customer pay with their phones and tablets 'virtually everywhere'. It consists of an app and a device, which is either a fob or a specially-designed phone case. The sources revealed that Samsung is already in talks with the Massachusetts-based provider, and prototypes have been created, but there is no word on when the service will launch - if at all. The LoopPay app securely stores all payment cards including credit, debit, loyalty and gift cards. These can be used to pay for shopping in 90 per cent of shops and banks in the US. Customers simply tell the retailer which card they want to use before tapping the device on a reader.","LoopPay offers cases and cards that let people pay for goods wirelessly .

"Locked in a tiny cage in a Cypriot dog pound, underfed, his great muscles wasting away, Basil the St Bernard seemed destined for an unhappy ending. But 3,000 miles away in Grimsby, a barmaid had other ideas. Natalie Luckhurst, 21, launched a rescue effort befitting Basil’s courageous breed after seeing a photograph of him posted on Facebook by an animal charity. Tragic: Basil's plight started after he escaped from his home in Cyprus  and was picked up and then trapped by a dog warden at this pound . Convinced she had to save him but without the money to do so, she raised £1,000 for his medical treatment and flight to the UK, persuaded the animal charity on the island to help her – and eventually succeeded with the help of the local mayor. Basil, now two, is believed to have been picked up by a dog warden and put in a pound in the Cypriot capital Nicosia after escaping from his home. Desperate and hungry, Basil was shut up in a 10ft by 3ft cage for eight months after fighting with other dogs. The dog weighed just 49kg - when a . healthy St Bernard should weigh 70kg - and because he wasn’t exercised . he had severe muscle wastage meaning he couldn’t even sit down. At first the manager of the pound refused to give Basil up for adoption. But after a long battle, he was released on the mayor’s orders. The charity nursed him back to health, and two weeks ago he arrived at Manchester Airport to be met by his new owner – Miss Luckhurst. Caged: This was the 3 x 1 metre cage Basil was kept in while at the Nicosia pound in Cyprus. He weighed just 49kg - when a healthy St Bernard should weigh 70kg - and due to severe muscle wastage he couldn't even sit down. New life: Basil's new life in Grimsby with owner Natalie Luckhurst, 21, is a world apart from his old one where he spent eight months in a cage in Nicosia . She said: 'It cost all that money for flights, food, vet fees and his crate but it was worth every penny. 'It only took just over two months from when I first saw him to organise everything and get him over to the UK. After a three-month campaign, she . finally met the dog she had worked so hard to rescue two weeks ago at . Manchester Airport, and says it’s the best money she’s ever spent. 'As far as I can make out, he escaped from home and was picked up and then trapped by a dog warden at this pound.' She said: ‘My mum has St Bernards so I’m used to their size. Basil’s been eating really well and he’s getting to where he should be. I’m just delighted.’ During his early weeks at the pound, . Basil showed signs of aggression and fought with other dogs - and so was . moved into a small cage - his home for eight months. Facebook: Ms Luckhurst found Basil here on the Cyprus Animal Liberation Front (CALF) at which point her campaign to rescue him started . Friends for life: After a three-month campaign to adopt Basil and free him from his life of misery, Ms Luckhurst finally met him at Manchester Airport and he hasn't left her side since . But . his aggression was only because he was hungry and was trying to get . food from other dogs. Natalie says the pound kept Basil isolated and . malnourished, but volunteers tried to give him extra food and monitor . his welfare. His chances of . escape were thwarted because the manager of the pound wanted to keep . Basil as a guard dog, so all offers to adopt him were rejected. But . his plight was noticed by the Cyprus Animal Liberation Front who . started to lobby for his freedom, which is when Natalie noticed him. She . said: “I started my campaign for his freedom in early July submitting . formal offers of adoption, all of which were ignored. I made contact . with a woman from a cat and dog sanctuary in Cyprus. Hand-in-hand: Ms Luckhurst said she was overcome with emotion after seeing Basil in his cramped and cruel conditions in the Cypriot pound and just had to get him to the UK . Home at last: Ms Luckhurst raised over a £1,000  to fly Basil away from his nightmarish ordeal in Cyprus and says it is the best money she has ever spent . He tested positive for Ehrlichia - a . bacteria transmitted by ticks - and was started on his treatment, before . being micro-chipped, lead trained and taken out to get used to crowds . and noises before being flown to the UK. Natalie said: 'It was so strange when I met him at the airport. I wasn’t sure what his behaviour or temperament would be like. 'But I’m so lucky, because he’s the best dog I’ve ever met. He’s so friendly. 'He loves people, and I was worried he would be afraid of them. 'He’s . loving and happy, and he just wants to impress people. He can push the . boundaries a bit but you can tell someone’s hit him before because he . does cower sometimes.' Natalie, . who lives with her boyfriend, 24-year-old steel worker Kyle Suddaby, . said she was now hoping to build Basil into the big strong dog he should . be. Campaign: Ms Luckhurst started her campaign for his freedom in early July submitting formal offers of adoption, all of which were initially ignored . Determined: Ms Luckhurst continued to appeal for Basil's release and adoption, and with the help of the local Nicosian mayor, won the right to have him sent to the UK . A dog's life: 'When I met him at the airport I wasn't sure what his temperament would be like. But I'm so lucky, because he's the best dog I've ever met. He's so friendly', said proud Ms Luckhurst .","Natalie Luckhurst, 21, saw Basil on a Cypriot animal charity's Facebook page and campaigned to have him adopted .

"Striker Olivier Giroud admits a lack of maturity meant Arsenal 'cracked' as the title race started to heat up. The Gunners spent 128 days at the Premier League summit this season but they lost top spot with a 5-1 hammering at Anfield in early February and never regained it. Immature: Olivier Giroud believes Arsenal cracked under the pressure in the Premier League title race . Thumped: Arsenal were top of the Premier League before being thrashed 5-1 by Liverpool at Anfield in February . Arsene Wenger's side eventually finished fourth, although they went on to win the FA Cup, and Giroud believes a number of issues contributed to their league campaign unravelling. 'We were on top for a good half of the season and then we cracked,' he told French newspaper Midi-Libre. 'I believe we lacked maturity and that we had a lot of injuries at an important time. 'Above all we weren't able to adapt to the big teams. 'We have to show progress in these matches, to maybe play less football, but it's difficult because it's our playing philosophy.' Giroud finished his second season in England with 16 league goals and feels comfortable enough to already be looking to extend his current deal with the Gunners. 'I feel at ease in the league. I've had a not bad first season and a second that was mainly good. I hope to do even better,"" he added. 'I'm progressing from year to year, in the image of the team that plays a polished game.

"Volkswagen today announced production of what they claim is the world's most fuel efficient car - capable of a staggering 313 miles per gallon. The radical VW XL1 will be powered by a tiny 800cc diesel engine and a separate electric motor and battery pack. This will give the plug-in hybrid a 0-62mph time of 12.2 seconds and a top speed limited to a modest 99mph. Scroll down for video . The XL1 will be on show at next month's Geneva Motor Show with the first models produced by the end of 2013 . Volkswagen have so far refused to give any indication on how much the two-seater will cost . But the XL1 is not about sporty performance but environmentally-friendly driving - with Volkswagen claiming it will be capable of a record breaking 313mpg. This means when driven in a fuel-conserving fashion the lightweight vehicle would cost around £1.40 to travel 62 miles. It can also cover a distance of up to 31 miles (50km) in all-electric mode where it emits zero carbon dioxide. Overall emissions are a mere 21g/km - less than a quarter of the amount produced by the ultra-green Toyota Prius. Volkswagen plan to produce 50 of the carbon fibre cars by the end of the year . VW claim the car will have a range of up to 31 miles in its all-electric mode . The two engines sit at the rear, with the high-voltage battery that powers the electric motor at the front .

Volkswagen confirmed it will build an initial 50 models at the company's Osnabrueck factory in Germany alongside its Golf Cabriolet and Porsche Boxster. However, the firm refused to give any indication on how much the aerodynamic two-seater will cost. The XL1 will be on show at next month's Geneva Motor Show with the first models produced by the end of 2013. It will appear alongside McLaren's recently announced supercar, the P1 - a 903bhp beast that goes from 0-62mph in under three seconds -but also boasts environmental credentials.

"So this is Christmas. And what have you done? In the case of FIFA, and its damnable task force, they have done as expected. They have come up with a compromise that isn’t and a solution that was never going to be. Everyone knew how this was going to pan out, but seeing the news in black and white makes it suddenly real. Not just for fans, or armchair followers, but those who run football clubs, particularly those living from hand to mouth. Sepp Blatter's FIFA is set to ruin the English tradition of Christmas football during the 2022-23 season . Fans could be deprived of memorable games like Spurs’ 5-3 defeat of Chelsea on New Year’s Day . It is not just the elite programme of fixtures that has been surrendered to accommodate the World Cup in Qatar. Football League clubs will have to plan without the Christmas and New Year schedule in 2022, too. Revenue streams will be disrupted, payment plans reorganised. You know the way your mortgage comes out after payday? It works like that in football, too. Clubs settle debts at times conducive to revenue. The holiday period is a good earner and comes just before the transfer window. Not so perilous at Manchester United but potentially disastrous at Hartlepool United. Not that too many on a big, important FIFA task force will be thinking about them. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore is among those on the World Cup task force . The FIFA task force members, including Richard Scudamore, in discussion on Monday in Doha . The task force, though, are picking up the pieces for the real culprits. Greg Dyke, the chairman of the Football Association, had it right. ‘We would not be doing this if FIFA had done their work properly,’ he said. ‘This is something FIFA brought on itself by not reading the report of the safety inspector. It tells you the technical assessment was not being used as the basis for the decision.’ Tuesday’s news goes to the very heart of FIFA corruption. This would not be necessary if the World Cup had not been awarded to Qatar; and the World Cup would not have been awarded to Qatar if — well, who knows why the World Cup was awarded to Qatar? Who knows why it is still there, considering recent revelations have linked the bid, and the hosts, to bribery and slave labour and established connections to some of the vilest men on the planet? Qatar's delegate party celebrate being awarded the  2022 World Cup back in December 2010 . Who knows why it was ever there when FIFA’s technical inspection team may as well have stamped DANGER in big red letters across Qatar’s bid, due to the extreme summer heat? The idea that the November-December World Cup is the least worst solution only works if we abandon the idea of starting again. This is what should have happened the moment the World Cup FIFA voted for — taking place in a desert in 50 degrees — was deemed unworkable and treacherous. The tournament that replaces it is one that was never discussed and ruins domestic competitions that have been running for longer than FIFA’s jamboree, and with greater integrity. Dyke said the FA would try to preserve all the traditional Christmas and New Year dates but that is a forlorn hope. With the World Cup final slated for December 23, it is unthinkable that English football could return before the FA Cup third round taking place the first weekend in January. Even that may be too soon. UEFA president Michel Platini (right) will be relieved the Champions League won't have to adjust in 2022-23 . The announcement has been coming but, even so, Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore looked genuinely shocked. Maybe he truly thought disruption to the English calendar could be avoided. How quaint. Ultimately, just about every other event has been prioritised: the Winter Olympics, religious festivals, the Superbowl and the Champions League. UEFA, to the surprise of few, ratted out the European leagues by pushing for dates that would least affect their prestige competition. They can rush through the Champions League group stages early, break mid-winter as always, and reconvene with the World Cup a memory. Anything else would have been a huge embarrassment for president Michel Platini, considering he voted for Qatar in the first place. Qatar 2022 World Cup bid chairman Sheik Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani is all smiles (left) Also on his soapbox was Karl-Heinz Rummenigge of Bayern Munich and the European Clubs’ Association (to put his responsibilities in his order of priority). He was talking money — specifically compensation for the European clubs. As someone who received two free Rolex watches worth £84,000 when the ECA held its annual assembly in Qatar in 2013 — the Qatar 2022 organising committee also picked up the £500,000 tab for the event — he will know the hosts are good for it. Christmas has come early, it seems — although not in Hartlepool.","FIFA task force recommend 2022 World Cup starts later in the year .

"A young sperm whale washed up dead on a beach in Scotland this morning. Marine experts are now examining the animal, which was reported to Police Scotland and the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA) at 7.30am. This afternoon, arrangements are being made with Edinburgh City Council to remove the animal from the water at Portobello beach, near the Rockville hotel in Joppa. This sperm whale, pictured with rescue workers, was washed up dead on to a beach near Edinburgh today . A marine expert examines the whale in the Joppa area of Edinburgh after the discovery was made today . Corinne Gordon, from British Divers Marine Life Rescue, said: ‘It is a 45ft male sperm whale, which is not adult. It has possibly been hit by a boat or propellers and that caused the damage. ‘It has been dead for some time and may have been struck out in the deep and then washed inshore.’ The carcass will be winched out of the water by a crane today and taken to the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme facility at Dunbar, East Lothian, where  a post-mortem will be carried out. Sarah Dolman, a manager of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation, helped the recovery of the animal. She said: ‘It looks like it's a sperm whale - probably not an adult - and it's been here since at least 7.30 this morning. ‘I can't see the length of it because it's mostly submerged. They can grow up to 15 metres, but I would say this one is not that big. 'I'm pretty sure it's dead - it's lying on it's side and the blow hole is completely submerged.' Marine experts are examining the animal, which was reported to Police Scotland and the SSPCA at 7.30am . Crowds gathered at the scene today after the sperm whale was discovered early in the morning . This afternoon, arrangements were being made with Edinburgh City Council to remove the animal . She added: ‘There's a post-mortem team from the Scottish Marine Animals Stranding scheme, based in Inverness, and they are coming down to examine the animal. ‘The council will make the decision about how that will work and where it will be taken to. Hopefully we'll be able to find out why it died.’ There was excitement among conservationists last year when a pod of 14 sperm whales was spotted near the Firth of Forth. The creature was found in the water at Portobello beach, near the Rockville hotel, in Joppa, Edinburgh . Sperm whales are more commonly found in deeper waters in northern and western Scotland . The sperm whale can grow to 15 metres in length, although this whale was young and shorter . The animals usually reside in deeper waters off the north and west of Scotland towards the Atlantic, where they hunt squid. A pod of 26 pilot whales washed up in a beaching further up the east coast in Pittenweem, Fife, in 2012. Ten of the pod survived and were re-floated, but rescuers had to winch the carcasses of 13 whales to the top of cliffs at the Fife beach to dispose of them after they died. Sperm whales have bigger brains than any other creature on earth . Sperm whales are carnivorous mammals, which usually grow to the size of a bus, often weighing more than 40 tons. Listed as an endangered species, the animal can grow to as long as around 20 metres. They have the largest brain of any creature on the earth and eat thousands of pounds of fish and squid every day. Sperm whales are normally found in groups, or pods, of around 15 to 20, according to National Geographic. Sightings in Scotland are rare, although last year a pod of 14 were spotted in Firth of Forth. The year before, a pod of 26 pilot whales were washed up in Pittenweem, Fife.","Young animal was discovered on Scottish beach early this morning .

"A pet stingray called Steve Irwin sunk its 3-inch barb into his owner just days after the man bought it. Owner James Hunt, 23, was in hospital for three days after he was attacked by his newly-bought venomous motoro stingray. Mr Hunt was moving the stingray from one tank to another at his flat in Southend, Essex when the usually placid sea creature attacked, leaving Mr Hunt in excruciating pain. 'Felt like I was dying': James Hunt spent three days in hospital after his new pet stingray, ironically named Steve Irwin, attacked him with its 3-inch barb . Ironically, the pet was named after the gregarious Australian wildlife expert Steve Irwin, who was tragically killed by a stingray in 2006. Mr Hunt said: ‘I felt like I was dying. The pain in my arm was excruciating. ‘I was in agony. The intense pain was spreading from my wrist to my elbow, then it started going towards my shoulder. He was rushed to hospital where he doctors treated the painful symptoms from the . stingray’s barbed stinger following the incident on Bank Holiday Monday . in late August. Luckily for . Mr Hunt, his partner Danielle Wright, 22, and his brother Shane, 30 and . his partner Victoria Long, 27, were with him at the time. Usually docile: Mr Hunt was moving his two newly-bought motoro stingrays (pictured) from a temporary tank to a new tank when 'Steve Irwin' lashed out and Mr Hunt was rushed to hospital . He said: ‘I am just thankful I wasn’t on my own. ‘They gave me oxygen and morphine in hospital, but I was still screaming in pain. I must have sounded like I was in labour. ‘I remember asking the doctors to not let me die, but I tried to keep calm because if you panic it makes the venom spread faster.’ Tragic death: The real Steve Irwin, an Australian wildlife expert, was killed by a stingray in 2006 . Steve Irwin was one of two 15-inch stingrays that Mr Hunt had bought for £150 from a private seller on August 25. He was attempting to move the rays to a new 6ft, 1000-litre tank the next day when disaster struck. Mr Hunt said: ‘I had just moved down from Sunderland to Southend with my partner and bought them from someone in Derbyshire on the way down. ‘I picked them up and put them in a tank when we moved into the flat and there was no problem, but I think they must have been a bit tired because of the journey. ‘The next day they had more energy and I got one out of the tank and got half way to the other one when it stung me with its barb.’ The pet owner, who has kept fish for five years, told how his stingrays shared a tank with other tropical species including two oscars, a black belt, a red devil, a pleco and a red tail catfish. And despite a painful start, Mr Hunt intends to keep the stingrays. He said: ‘It was my fault. I knew they could be dangerous and I just took a chance. ‘I was tired from the move and only had three hours sleep. I won’t be doing that again. ‘The swelling has gone down a bit, but my hand is still pretty numb.’ Mr Hunt, who is unemployed, faces several weeks of physiotherapy and is on a course of antibiotics to ensure the wound does not become infected. Steve Irwin was killed in September 2006 after getting stung by a stingray while filming in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The 44-year-old was setting up to shoot ocean reef footage at the time for a programme on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef he was making with his daughter Bindi who was eight at the time. There was no evidence that he provoked the attack. The fatal blow was caught on videotape . and showed Irwin swimming over the top of the ray as the tail came up . and spiked him in the chest. Irwin instinctively pulled the barb out of . his chest and died shortly after. Several stingrays were found dead and . mutilated on Australia's eastern coast in apparent revenge attacks on . the normally docile fish. Since Irwin’s death his family has continued his legacy. His daughter Bindi, now 15, has appeared on television since she was two. Already an accomplished wildlife conservationist, she went on to front her own show: Bindi the Jungle Girl, and has also appeared in movies such as Free Willy: Escape from Pirate’s Cove and Return to Nim’s Island. Wife Terri Irwin now owns the Australia Zoo, the Irwin family reptile and fauna park where Irwin grew up. Born in 1962, Irwin lived in the tropical Queensland state where his parents ran a small reptile and fauna park. He grew up near crocodiles, trapping and removing them from populated areas and releasing them in his parent's park. In 1991 he took over the park and started ‘The Crocodile Hunter’ television programme which received a worldwide audience of 200 million, equivalent to 10 times the population of Australia. He made 46 of the popular documentaries which appeared on cable TV channel Animal Planet, as well as more than 20 episodes of ‘The Crocodile Hunter Diaries’. In 2001, he appeared alongside Eddie Murphy in the Hollywood movie Dr Dolittle 2. Stingrays are usually shy, unobtrusive fish that rummage along the sea bottom for food or burrow into the sand. When stepped on or otherwise frightened, a serrated spine up to 10 inches long in the animal's tail flares up. The spines emit toxins that can kill small creatures and cause excruciating pain in humans. Few people die from the poison, but the spines can badly tear flesh and the wounds are prone to infections, including tetanus.","James Hunt, 23, was attacked as he was moving the 15-inch stingray .

"Attack: Children's football manager Aaron Cooper headbutted a rival coach during a crunch game . The manager of a children's football team attacked a rival coach and headbutted him in a touchline brawl sparked by a 'dodgy decision' from a 15-year-old referee. Aaron Cooper, manager of Poole Town in Dorset, has been given a suspended sentence for assaulting opposite number Shaun Taylor during a match against Grange Athletic. The teenage referee had to lead the 13-year-old footballers off the field in tears while their coaches fought, Bournemouth Crown Court heard. Cooper, 34, and his assistant lost their tempers when the referee awarded a last-minute free kick to Grange Athletic during the crunch game, with the score at 1-1. Mr Braggington pushed Mr Taylor and Cooper joined in, headbutting his opponent so hard the victim needed hospital treatment for a nasty wound to his mouth. The fight forced the teenage referee to abandon the game before leading the players, some of whom were crying, off the pitch in the village of West Moors. Cooper, a father of four, was given a seven-month suspended prison sentence after pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm during the incident last March. Stuart Ellacott, prosecuting, said: 'What seems to have been the catalyst was a free kick awarded just outside the Poole Town area. 'Mr Bragginton accepts he pushed Mr Taylor first, then was pushed as he turned away. These two gentlemen were supposed to be setting an example for the under-13s. 'There was a scuffle with both scrabbling on the floor. The defendant then stepped forward and headbutted the victim leaving him with a mouth injury which needed stitches in hospital.' Mr Braggington and Mr Taylor were also arrested following the fight, but were released without charge. The court heard that Cooper told police that tensions were high because the clash between the two sides had been 'a really vital game' in the Bournemouth Youth Football League. Brawl: The fight took place during an under-13 match on this pitch in West Moors, a village in Dorset . Nicholas Robinson, defending, said Cooper regretted that the fight had been witnessed by children, adding that he now faces a lifetime ban from coaching by the FA. He said: 'I know the court will feel [a ban] is quite right but he is passionate about football and passionate about helping children in the teams he has volunteered with.

Cooper, from Poole, was ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work and pay £400 compensation to Mr Taylor. He will now be subject to a disciplinary procedure from the Dorset FA, and could be banned from football.

"Actually, he didn’t rant or rave. Jose Mourinho made his points lucidly and, for the most part, logically. A little whiny, perhaps. For that alone, there should be no question of further action from the Football Association over his impromptu guest spot on Sunday. Calling a referee a cheat is actionable, but Mourinho took care to be respectful. His belief that Chelsea alone are suffering from official incompetence also does his cause few favours, and his memory is as selective as any manager (he forgot Gary Cahill’s dive against Hull City, for instance). Jose Mourinho asked specifically to be a guest on Sky Sports' show Goals on Sunday to air his grievances . Mourinho was right with his comments, if a little one-eyed, and he spoke lucidly and logically on the show . The studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes infuriated Chelsea star Nemanja Matic and his manager  Mourinho . Click here to read more from Sportsmail's Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel . Yet the crux of the debate — why violent, career-threatening tackles seem to be less of an issue in English football than a dozen or so matters of little consequence, is a debate that needs to take place, and urgently. Our referees are well equipped to spot when a player has celebrated inappropriately, minus shirt. When one has come in late, over the top and with malicious intent, they too often seem baffled, or at least underwhelmed. Nobody is under any illusion about Mourinho’s motives. He did not commandeer television airtime to protest on behalf of Manchester City. We know precisely who will benefit if referees can be pressured into avoiding controversy around Chelsea players. Matic's reaction to Barnes's tackle earned the Serbian a red card - he'll now miss the Capital One Cup final . If Atkinson can not tell that Barnes' tackle was violent, maybe he should take some time away from the game . A refereeing performance in a Southern Mediterranean or South American country like Martin Atkinson's at Stamford Bridge on Saturday would have started accusations of corruption. Here in England thankfully we accept honest incompetence. Click here to read Graham Poll's analysis . There are those who think Mourinho harms the sport with these off-field power plays, and they have a point. But so does he. Ashley Barnes of Burnley should have followed Nemanja Matic down the tunnel on Saturday. Matic’s retaliation merited a red card, but so did Barnes’s tackle. At the very least his behaviour was worthy of two yellows, having already hit Branislav Ivanovic in mid-air in the first half. Referee Martin Atkinson punished neither challenge. His performance was extraordinarily poor. Mourinho is wrong to imply an orchestrated campaign, but entitled to ask questions. His players, fine players, are frequently under siege. Not since Cristiano Ronaldo at Manchester United has a ball-carrying forward been treated as brutally as Eden Hazard this season. Atkinson's refereeing performance was extraordinarily poor for Chelsea's game against Burnley on Saturday . Eden Hazard has been treated brutally by opposition players this season, and Mourinho is right to protect him . Ronaldo, however, was becoming a world star and referees were intimidated by him. He would fall and seize hold of the ball, stopping the game and pre-empting the decision to award a foul in his favour. Hazard plays on. He didn’t even make a fuss when Phil Bardsley of Stoke City committed one of the most spectacularly vicious tackles seen in this campaign. Somehow the defender stayed on. So Mourinho is justified in raising the issue, even if his chosen method is unconventional. Could he have aired the same grievances in private, opened dialogue with Mike Riley, chief of the Professional Game Match Officials Board? Yes — but one presumes he has those conversations all the time. By using a public forum, and an expansive 27 minutes of it, Mourinho broadens discussion. After Mourinho requested to go on Goals on Sunday, planned guest James Beattie had to make way . Mourinho's visit to the Sky Studios could have been made more interesting if he was joined by Mike Riley . It would have been more interesting to invite Riley into the studio, too, but there is no way that happens in the present climate. The days of Clough versus Revie have passed. The default position of the authorities is to scan the news for any sign of controversy and then act. They will study Mourinho’s appearance, have no doubt of it. They prefer silencing dissent rather than questioning its motives; just as Atkinson had the wit to deal with Matic’s obvious transgression, but no clue that Barnes came close to snapping his leg in two. There is no chance Matic will get his red card rescinded, no matter the sense of injustice. He threw a player to the ground and that is a sending-off offence. The Chelsea manager did not look happy as he watched on from the sidelines, and later aired his thoughts . His absence from the Capital One Cup final, as well as league games against West Ham United and Southampton is a big loss for Chelsea. Yet if Atkinson does not know what a violent foul is maybe he needs to take a little time away from the game, too. Any idiot can spot that Matic had to go but a leading official should be able to see cause and effect. Too many violent tackles are waved away these days. Hazard has seriously discussed getting larger shin pads to combat the kicking he receives; that should concern the authorities more than any manager’s well-honed grievance. After Chelsea's game against Burnley, Jose Mourinho listed four minutes; four key incidents that he believed the referee had got wrong. Here, Sportsmail looks at them: . 30 - Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up when he realises no action is being taken. It should have been a free-kick and could have been a yellow card for Barnes. Barnes catches Ivanovic with his right boot during an aerial challenge in the 30th minute . 33 - Ivanovic goes for goal but Michael Kightly diverts it with an outstretched arm, as he turns his back to goal. Martin Atkinson waves play on. It should have been a Chelsea penalty. Ivanovic fires a shot at goal but his effort was blocked by the raised arms of Michael Kightly . 43 - Diego Costa goes to ground after  Jason Shackell leans into him with an oustretched arm. Atkinson waves play on. It could have been a Chelsea penalty but would have been  soft. Diego Costa vents his frustration after being shoved inside the box by Jason Shackell . 69 - Barnes misses the ball and almost snaps Nemanja Matic's left shin with his studs but Atkinson waves play on. An enraged Matic leaps up and pushes Barnes over. Atkinson sends off Matic and books Ivanovic for trying to take red card out of his hand. It was a shocking tackle that merited a red card for Barnes and a Chelsea free-kick.

"From the iridescence of butterfly wings to the intricacies of plankton, studying nature on a nanoscale could help scientists create machines as small as those inside a living cell. Now a new book, the 'Nanoscience: Giants of the Infinitesimal', has selected some of the best images from the field to reveal how nature's hidden beauty could be replicated by humans. The images chart how nanoscience has progressed over the past 50 years showing iconic research such as the smiley faces made from DNA and muscle cells of beef developed from stem cells. A new book, called the 'Nanoscience: Giants of the Infinitesimal', has selected some of the best images from the field of nanotechnology to reveal how nature's hidden beauty could be replicated by humans. Pictured is a nanoscale image of ice crystals . In 1959, Richard Feynman, a physicist at California Institute of Technology, described how scientists would be able to manipulate individual atoms and molecules to make electronic circuits smaller. The authors of Nanoscience, science writer Peter Forbes and artist Tom Grimsey, suggest that copying nanoscale processes in nature could have more significant consequences. From clean harvesting solar energy and finding cost-effective methods to desalinate sea water, nanotechnology, they claim, can revolutionise human processes. For a sense of scale, sheet of paper is about 100,000 nanometers thick while a human hair is about 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers wide. Pictured here are nanoflowers created using carbon. They were created by a Harvard University team who realised the ancient dream of creating complex 3D structures simply by mixing chemicals. These flowers were creating by passing carbon dioxide through barium carbonate and silica microstructures to produce stems, vases, corals and other structures. False colour has been added to the image . In 1959, Richard Feynman, a physicist at California Institute of Technology, described how scientists would be able to manipulate individual atoms and molecules to make electronic circuits smaller. Shown here is a nanoscale view of plankton. These specimens were living between crystals of annual sea ice in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica . The ideas and concepts behind nanoscience started with a talk entitled 'There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom' by physicist Richard Feynman in 1959. He described how scientists would be able to manipulate individual atoms and molecules to make electronic circuits smaller. He also suggested that it should be possible, in principle, to make nanoscale machines that 'arrange the atoms the way we want', and do chemical synthesis by mechanical manipulation. One of the images highlighted in the book are the muscle cells of beef developing from stem cells. Last year, cells such as these were used to create the world's first stem cell burger. It was made of 20,000 small strands of meat grown from a cow's muscle cells and took three months to create. Another image show a pollen grain from the mouse-ear hawkweed magnified 2000 times. Such natural nanostructures have been used to template material such as titanium dioxide that is used in sun cream and food colourings. Chloroplasts inside plant cells are also revealed. These are the photosynthetic factories of plant cells, where the energy of sunlight is converted into energy-rich biomass - a process scientists are emulating to create 'green' energy. The writers claim that nanoscience is about 'bringing us to the point where life starts: the point where precisely nanostructured chemicals take on the properties of life'. By peering into the tiny structures that make up the world around us, the authors believe we could be on the way to establishing a 'nanotechnology revolution.' Paul Rothemund's famous DNA smileys that adorned the cover of Nature magazine in 2006. Rothemund's work led to a boom in DNA nanotechnology. Dr Rothemund  used these smileys to show a simpler way to rearrange DNA. He showed that  long, single strands of DNA can be folded back and forth to form a basic scaffold. The basic structure is then supplemented by around 200 shorter strands, providing a shape that can bear a complex pattern, such as this smiley face . A false-coloured image of a complex nano-structured 'flower' grown from a chemical solution. This image, under the title 'Emeraldine buds and flowers bloom atop a microstructured landscape', was submitted by the Aizenberg Lab as an entry to a 'Science as Art' competition in 2010 .

Butterfly wings don't possess pigmented colour. Instead they create their brilliant displays using a trick of the light. Something known as 'photonic crystals' create geometric patterns at microscopic scales. The paterens are spaced very close to the wavelengths of light in ways that intensify the reflected light of certain colors and absorb others . Shown here are chloroplasts inside plant cells.

"By day, New York City Police Sgt Ralph Sarchie arrested criminals, by in his off-time the veteran cop was moonlighting as a cross-wielding exorcist. Sarchie's accounts as a real-life demonologist in New York detailed in his 2001 book served as basis for the new horror film Deliver Us From Evil, out in theatres July 2. The film starring Eric Bana as Sgt Sarchie already has been described as likely the scariest horror flick of the year. Scroll down for videos . Dangerous hobby: NYPD Sgt Ralph Sarchie has spent years moonlighting as an exorcist in New York City . Art imitating life: Retired Sgt Sarchie's (left) experiences as a real-life demon hunter inspired the horror film Deliver Us From Evil starring Eric Bana (right) as the officer . Based on real events: The film, out July 2, follows Sgt Sarchie as he investigates a series of demonic possession in New York City . According to the film's IMDB page, Deliver Us From Evil, directed by Scott Derrickson and starring Olivia Munn, follows Sarchie as he combats demonic possessions that are terrorizing the city. In a short video excerpt from the upcoming documentary Sarchie, the retired 16-year NYPD veteran reveals that he took part in more than 20 exorcisms, snippets of which are seen in the clip. Sarchie got involved in what he calls 'the work' after reading the 1990 book Satan's Harvest about demonic possessions. The officer from the 46th Precinct in South Bronx teamed up with a renegade Catholic priest, played in the upcoming film by Edgar Ramirez, performing exorcism rituals on people who were believed to be possessed by evil spirits. Chilling footage: Sarchie has taken part in 20 cleansing rituals, one of them seen in an upcoming documentary about the retired cop . Hulk scared: Actor Eric Bana (right) couldn't sleep for three weeks while researching Sarchie's files . All told, the former police sergeant investigated more than 50 paranormal cases, New York Post reported. 'I'm a demonologist, and I'm going head to head with the devil,' Sarchie says in the video. Non-fiction: Deliver Us From Evil is based on a book Sarchie co-wrote in 2001 about his paranormal experiences . Sarchie and . his collaborators used holy water, incense and the power of prayer to . cleanse homes believed to be infested by demons. Most of the cleansing rituals Sarchie assisted in took place in a church. The people suspected of being possessed were restrained, sometimes with a straightjacket. In 2001, Sarchie co-wrote the book Beware the Night about his experiences as a part-time demon hunter in New York. In an interview on the radio show Coast to Coast in 2004, Sarchie detailed some of his chilling encounters with poltergeist, like an 8-year-old girl who spoke fluent Latin and a Long Island housewife who made deep guttural sounds. During a press conference last month about the upcoming film, Bana's co-star Munn, who plays his wife, told reporters that the 45-year-old Australian actor best known for his role as the Hulk could not sleep for three weeks while researching the events described in Sarchie's book. Bana said he was 'coming from a skeptical place' when he agreed to play Sgt Sarchie. '[Director] Scott [Derrickson] scared the bejeezus out of me in pre-production,’ Bana said. ‘He had access to some materials that Ralph Sarchie had.’","Sgt Ralph Sarchie, of the 46th Precinct in South Bronx, retired after 16 years on the force .

"Carl Froch will have to wait for his big Las Vegas farewell against Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr after the world champion injured his elbow in training last week. Almost all the details had been agreed on a March 28 fight that would have brought an end to Froch’s stellar career. But Sportsmail can reveal that an injury three weeks into his training camp has forced Froch to temporarily scrap his plans. His promoter Eddie Hearn is already in talks to rearrange the fight with dates considered in late April and early June. Carl Froch (right) will have to wait for his chance to realise his dream of fighting in Las Vegas . Froch has not fought since he knocked out George Groves in front of 80,000 people at Wembley last year . Hearn said: ‘Carl is devastated but given the scale of the fight and the fact it may be his last, he didn’t want to take any half measures by fighting injured. ‘We were very close to concluding negotiations so as you can imagine it was heartbreaking for Carl to make the call. But we are already looking to reschedule the fight. ‘Everyone knows Carl’s desire to fight in Vegas so we are doing what we can to make it happen. I fully believe it will happen, but he rightly does not want to go into what might be his last fight with an injury.’ Rumours of Froch’s retirement spread on social media on Sunday evening after Froch tweeted a picture of a pair of gloves hanging up. A deal for Froch to fight Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr (right) had been close before he suffered his injury . Chavez has not fought since winning his rematch with Brian Vera in Texas last March . Hearn insisted the WBA and IBF super-middleweight champion’s priority remains one last fight, having last fought in his remarkable Wembley rematch win against George Groves in May. Froch had reiterated his hopes for a Vegas fight earlier this month, saying: ‘Dare I say it, but we’re nearly there with the Chavez fight in Las Vegas which we’ve long talked about.' But he said on Monday: 'I'm disappointed to have to let this opportunity go but at this stage in my career I have to make every fight count. 'I will get some treatment and then we will look to make this fight or another big fight in the early summer.'

"Hundreds of dead animals are washing up along the shores of one of America's most biologically diverse estuary. More than 100 manatees, 300 pelicans and almost 50 dolphins were all found dead along the northern stretches of the Indian River Lagoon in Florida. Biologists are now trying to work out what the problem is, but there is no doubt that it is a serious one. Murder mystery: Two manatees out of 111 that have been found dead in the Indian River Lagoon in Florida . Dead in the water: Day after day, dolphins are floating up dead, emaciated down to their skeletons . Saving wildlife: Rescuers attend to a manatee affected by the unknown mystery killer. The manatees appeared to have abruptly sickened and drowned . The lagoon contains more species than anywhere else in the U.S. and to the towns along its edge — Titusville, Cocoa, Melbourne, Vero Beach and Stuart, it accounts for hundreds of millions in revenue from angling, boating, bird-watching, tourism and other waterfront activities. Its 156 miles of water boast more than 600 species of fish and more than 300 kinds of birds. The barrier island complex stretched across 40 percent of Florida’s coast, around Cape Canaveral, and consists of the Mosquito Lagoon, the Banana River and the Indian River Lagoon. In the past, the lagoon has was constantly polluted by nutrients and fertilizers running off lawns and farms but now it appears some kind of tipping point has been reached. Thousands of dead fish reported in Indian River Lagoon in southern St. Lucie County. Scientists believe it may be due to one or several causes from climate change to changes in water temperature and salt levels . No obvious cause: Florida's Indian River Lagoon is considered one of the most diverse ecosystems in North America . Investigation: Hubbs Sea World Research Institute research assistant Teresa Mazza during the rescue of a distressed dolphin in the Indian River Lagoon system in Florida . Manatees began dying in July 2012, 43 of them in just one month. A total of 111 have died. The mysterious manatee die-off began in the northern part of the lagoon last July, hit its peak around March and now produces another dead manatee about every two weeks. Biologists at a state laboratory in St. Petersburg examine every dead manatee that's found in Florida for a cause of death. They appear to have abruptly fallen sick and drowned. People have reported between 250 and 300 dead pelicans since January. The birds were emaciated. Since January, the number of dead bottlenose dolphins has reached 46 - more than double the average recorded in previous years. The dolphins also look emaciated, similar to the pelicans. Perplexed: So far, biologists are at a loss to explain the cause of the untimely deaths . Tests: Two sub-adult Loggerhead sea turtles, netted from the water, sit in a boat in the Indian River lagoon with damp towels over their heads help to calm them . Recover: Scientists believe it could take up to a decade before the lagoon recovers . So far nobody can name the killer. Biologists have some suspicions but are baffled about any connection among the species' problems. The diets are different: Manatees are vegetarians, while pelicans and dolphins eat fish. The symptoms are different: The manatees' stomachs are stuffed, while the pelicans and dolphins are emaciated. This is not the first time that dolphins have perished in the Indian River Lagoon. Many died in 2001 and 2008 where again the cause of death was undetermined. It is difficult for scientists to work out why the deaths are occurring when there is not an obvious cause. With so much farmland, laws in Florida allow fertilizer to be poured into the coastal waters. This can have effects on acidity, changes in water temperature and salt levels. Some are even suggesting global warming could be to blame. It is ideal for algae which need high levels of nutrients and salinity to survive. That can also have an adverse effect on the ecosystem's food supply for other animals such as the dolphins. There are few positive signs. Although the numbers pelican's dying appear to have stopped, now a new brown tide bloom has been spotted. Locals believe that if the lagoon is to ever recover, it could be close to a decade before things seem back to normal.","Indian River Lagoon of Florida contains more species than anywhere else in the U.S.

"When widowed Jean Bailey moved into a new home, she set about transforming  a boggy wasteland into a pretty garden with a pond, shrubs and flowers. It soon became a haven for wildlife, populated by frogs, newts, birds and insect life. The labour of love took several years and cost the best part of £10,000, but was worth every penny to Mrs Bailey, 74, who looked on it as a memorial to her husband, a keen gardener, who had died of cancer. Devastated: Jean Bailey  breached greenbelt planning regulations when she created her landscape garden . Nature: The garden is home to fish, frogs, newts, birds, insects and a variety of plant life . Determined: The grandmother said she would rather go to prison then lose her 'pride and joy' Now she is facing heartbreak, as . council officials have ordered her to tear up the garden, and return . part of it to the muddy state she found it in. Ironically, their reason is that she has developed part of the garden on greenbelt land. The work was done without planning . permission and, say officials, it ‘erodes the character and quality of . the area’ in Harriseahead, Staffordshire. ‘You must return the land to agricultural use and character, removing all garden paraphernalia,’ they have told her. The retired florist has been warned . that if she does not comply, council workmen will do the work and she . will face a hefty bill. Expense: The pensioner spent around £10,000 creating her 'pride and joy' in Harriseahead, Staffordshire . Extra: The land the garden was built on was bought by Mrs Bailey's daughter along with their house . Threats: The council have told Mrs Bailey she faces legal action unless the land is returned to 'agricultural use' The issue dates back to 2006 when Mrs .

"There's a new game this year called the 'Selfie Olympics' and after three days, it's already become an internet sensation among teenagers and those who are young and careless at heart. Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter users are asked to join in the game of making the most dangerous and outlandish selfie ever and to then post it on social media. Business Insider reports that a facebook page created this morning already has 30,000 likes. There are over 28,000 pictures on Instragram already, and the selfie game is trending on twitter.

"Another day and more disappointment from the effect that poor officiating is having on this Premier league season. Chelsea, Manchester City and West Ham who were all in the top 5 before play started were all victims whilst close rivals Southampton and Arsenal were beneficiaries. Penalties, dives and offsides were called incorrectly as we reached the halfway point of a wholly unsatisfactory season from too many select group officials. Chelsea players, in particular Cesc Fabregas, were rightly upset with Anthony Taylor's decision on Sunday . Alex Song and Andy Carroll complain to referee Neil Swarbrick after Song's strike was disallowed . Joe Hart let's George Boyd's flick slip through his hands, but the Burnley man should have been flagged offside . Craig Pawson inexplicably missed Papiss Cisse's elbow on Seamus Coleman during Newcastle vs Everton . Cisse went on to score Newcastle's first goal, which made it 1-1, but is likely to face a ban for the violence . Whilst the Papiss Cisse incident does not affect the top 6 it was the worst offence of the day for which he will be banned retrospectively by the Football Association for his outrageous elbow. The more times you see what can only be described as an assault by the Senegalese striker the worse it gets but had Pawson seen it, and I wonder how he didn’t, he would have dismissed him and a standard ban applied which is what the FA must apply. The most controversial was the caution for Cesc Fabregas who will have that yellow card against his name which could result in a ban and the football association must be pressed to review this process. Cesc Fabregas is clearly caught by Matt Targett, causing him to go down in the Southampton penalty area . Fabregas cannot believe the decision to deny him a penalty and book him for diving - the FA should overturn it . I have called for referees to be given more training and advice regarding simulation which needs to come from within the game as players and managers understand this offence far better than officials. West Ham’s ‘goal’ from Alex Song provides the best debate for the day. It was a superb strike from Song which Wojciech Szczesny cannot see due to a cluster of players from both teams. There were three West Ham players in offside positions as Song kicked the ball but all three were running out, ‘disassociating themselves from play’ and so not deemed to be interfering with play. Song's strike should have been given as the West Ham players were 'disassociating themselves from play’ Diafra Sakho, who ran over the ball, was clearly not in Wojciech Szczesny's line of sight when Song shot . The ball travels towards the corner of the goal where Diafra Sakho jumps over it and as he is not in the line of sight of the goalkeeper he is not interfering with the ‘keeper. Replays from behind the goal show that Andy Carroll could be in Szczesny’s line of sight hence the assistant’s raised flag but it’s a goal that I would have wanted to stand. So, not a great day for officials although to be fair Phil Dowd was correct with bot dismissals at Hull as was Martin Atkinson in sending off Fabian Delph for an over the top tackle at Villa Park so it wasn’t all bad. Martin Atkinson was right to send off Aston Villa's Fabia Delph for a tackle than went over the ball . Phil Dowd was spot on with both his red cards, dismissing Paul Konchesky and Stephen Quinn . Remember that on Boxing Day QPR were denied a clear penalty (Gibbs on Zamora), Sunderland should have had two penalties for handball against Hull (Bruce and Quinn), Ivanovic should have been cautioned for diving, Newcastle should have had an early penalty when Mata tripped Gouffran and Stoke’s Jon Walters should have been dismissed for pulling Everton’s Leighton Baines when clean through on goal.","Cesc Fabregas booking for diving against Crystal Palace was a travesty .
West Ham were very unlucky to see Alex Song's wonder-strike ruled out .
Papiss Cisse should have see red for his elbow on Seamus Coleman .
Cesc Fabregas was clearly tripped by Matt Targett and should have been awarded a penalty; instead he was cautioned by Anthony Taylor which was a travesty.
Alex Song scored a superb goal which was disallowed by referee Neil Swarbrick under advice from his assistant, Matthew Wilkes.
Manchester City were comfortably 2-0 up when Burnley scored a goal to get themselves back into the game but the scorer, George Boyd was clearly in an offside position.
Everton will rue referee Craig Pawson somehow missing Papiss Cisse clearly and viciously elbow Seamus Coleman whilst waiting for a corner at St James’ Park – Cisse, who was offside in the build up to the next corner, then scored the first goal for Newcastle.
Jon Moss missing Wayne Rooney clearly holding Tottenham’s Harry Kane to prevent him from competing for the ball at a set piece. A clear penalty which could have led to the only goal of the game."
"There are simply no excuses for England not performing on Saturday. This group of players have been together in camp for more than a month and they should be able to recite the patterns and game plan they’re looking to deliver in their sleep. The coaches should have been able to get their message across by now. If they haven’t, there’s a problem. For Stuart Lancaster and his team the time is now, not tomorrow, not next year, not the 2019 World Cup. Now. I have heard far too much talk about this being a young team with one eye on the next World Cup. I’ve heard that players are learning the ropes of international rugby and building on the experience. It’s time to stop talking like that. Stuart Lancaster's England team must deliver against the Wallabies at Twickenham on Saturday . Lancaster has left experienced players such as Saracens winger David Strettle out of his recent plans . Chris Ashton (right) has been in excellent form for Sarries but has been overlooked by Lancaster . Lancaster has placed his faith in the likes Anthony Watson (above) for the current autumn series . This is Lancaster’s team. He selects it, he coaches it. They are his picks and anyone selected for England should be ready to deliver. International rugby is not a training ground. There are experienced players such as David Strettle, Chris Ashton and Danny Cipriani playing very well for their clubs but Lancaster has opted for youth with players such as Jonny May, Anthony Watson and George Ford in the back line and Rob Webber and Matt Mullan up front. You can’t then use that inexperience as an excuse for poor performances and bad results. Indeed, it is these supposedly inexperienced guys who have been the highlights of the autumn to date. Nick Evans feels his Harlequins team-mate Danny Care (right) was made a scapegoat for England's poor form . This is Lancaster’s team and they need to start performing. In many ways I think international rugby has become distracted by World Cups. Yes, it is the biggest, most prestigious prize in the game and winning the World Cup is incredible. It is the ultimate but I cannot overstate just how much I used to love beating the big teams at Twickenham or in their own backyard —none more so than Australia. History shows the best way to prepare for a World Cup is to prove you are the best team in the world. That is only achieved with the attitude of every game being a must-win match. I fear this attitude has been lost. England will have their hands full containing the outstanding Wallabies fullback Israel Folau (above) There will be 82,000 people at Twickenham to watch one of sport’s greatest rivalries. It doesn’t get much bigger than England against Australia. Compare this contest with the lukewarm qualification matches the England football team have to play. Test match rugby is amazing. Of course, everything has been put into perspective by the tragic death of young Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes and when things like that happen it makes everyone sit back and take stock. But I’m sure Hughes, brilliant sportsman that he was, would have wanted his friends in the Wallaby dressing room to put on a great show against an England team who have not shown any real sign of progress so far this autumn. Some observers have pointed to the fact that England have faced the two strongest teams in the world and only been narrowly beaten. George Ford impressed for England against the Samoans in difficult conditions at Twickenham . I hear that, but my problem is with how they have played. It’s their performance that is the real issue: we’ve only seen a couple of flashes of individual brilliance. We need a display that will get the Twickenham crowd — and the watching millions — on their feet. There are two ways England can win this game. The first would be if the Australian scrum doesn’t turn up and we win the game through penalty tries, sin bins and three-pointers. I hope this doesn’t happen, not just for the sake of the Twickenham crowd, but because it will merely paper over the cracks. The second is through great confrontation up front and swift, decisive execution in the backs. This is a massive game for Ford at 10. The fly-half is the general of the side and I want to see him bossing today’s game in precisely the same way he does for Bath. In Owen Farrell, Cipriani and Stephen Myler he is keeping some very good players out of the side but he is absolutely capable of leading this England team. I expect the England pack to be the defining factor and to smash Australia up front, but this in no way diminishes Ford’s influence on the game. England have the forward muscle and the set-piece to strangle a suspect Wallabies pack on Saturday . Ford and Ben Youngs have to take responsibility for setting up dynamic, fast carries, encouraging off-loads and establishing real momentum up front. Where Ford stands apart from the other England 10s is his quick feet and ability to operate in the traffic close to the gain line. He has a superb eye for the break and a beautiful passing game. Look for him to attack the gain line only to drop the ball off to a charging Billy Twelvetrees or, better still, flick the ball behind his centres to his back three running at pace — all within touching distance of Bernard Foley and Matt Toomua. When he finds himself on the move in the outer channels he makes the right decision more often than not. He can get Twickenham rocking. There’s no doubt Farrell has been way below his usual high standards this autumn but he’s a world-class performer and I’m sure, given the chance to get some match fitness away from the glare of international rugby, he’ll rediscover his form. So Ford needs to deliver. It’s also a big game for Youngs. The Leicester scrum-half has not quite delivered on the early promise of his career but he still has time on his side and there’s no doubt he’s a terrific talent. I saw Nick Evans’s comments this week about his Harlequins team-mate Danny Care being made a scapegoat for England’s stuttering displays and, to a certain extent, I agree. Sir Clive feels Brad Barritt (right) may not have the skillset to operate at outside centre for England . Care’s game is based on tempo and quick ball, so replacing him with Youngs is an admission that they’re not looking to play the all-court attacking game that made them so dangerous in last season’s Six Nations. Youngs brings different qualities and it’s essential his box kicking and breakdown marshalling are on the money. I’d have liked to have seen England persist with Farrell at 12 because I think that combination with Ford could still work. But by bringing in Twelvetrees at inside centre, Lancaster and his coaches have stuck to the principle of selecting two playmakers in their inside back division. Toulon's Matt Giteau no longer features for the Wallabies but he remains one of the best in the business . His kicking game will compliment Ford’s but together they must be inch perfect because, in Israel Folau, Australia have a full back capable of doing serious damage from broken field. He is a superb athlete and England just cannot afford to give him space by kicking too deep or failing to chase effectively. It’s an area of England’s game that has been surprisingly poor so far this autumn and it’s critical they get that right. I don’t believe Brad Barritt — for all his many qualities — is the right man to play outside them at 13 but at least with Ford and Twelvetrees on the pitch England have two players who can put width on the ball and create chances. I’ve no doubt England’s forwards will provide plenty of ball. Will their backs have the wit to finish those chances? Their opponents are the masters of threequarter play. In many ways it’s a shame Matt Giteau won’t be here to light up Twickenham because I still believe the Toulon fly-half is the best threequarter in world rugby. But with Foley, Quade Cooper, Kurtley Beale, Folau, Toomua and Nick Phipps on the team sheet we should be as concerned as we are excited to see Australia in action. I’ve been really impressed with Toomua so far on this tour, while Foley and Phipps are an intelligent half-back pairing. Ford and Twelvetrees have been picked primarily for their attacking potential but with Toomua and Foley opposite, both men will have to be on their mettle defensively. Twelvetrees was exposed badly in that department last year when Toomua barrelled straight over him for Australia’s try and he has yet to convince me that physically he is robust enough in that position. England captain Chris Robshaw (left) will face the might of Wallabies openside MIchael Hooper on Saturday . Ford, who coped admirably with everything Samoa threw at him last week, can also expect to be targeted. I’m a huge fan of Michael Cheika as a coach and Australia will be inventive and hard to defend against. Flanker Michael Hooper is also a wonderful player who impresses me at every juncture. His clash with Chris Robshaw will be great viewing. Both sides have lost their two important games this autumn and will be desperate for a win. For England, their next game is on a Friday night against Wales in Cardiff in February. Get it wrong again today and it’s going to be a miserable Christmas for Lancaster and his team. What a great Test match we have in store. The time is now, England.","England face the Wallabies in their final autumn Test on Saturday .

Owen Farrell has been below par but he is world class, and will recover .

"A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist says that the official account of the raid which killed Osama Bin Laden in 2011 is ‘one big lie’. Seymour Hersh, 76, said that ‘not one word’ of the Obama administration’s narrative on what happened is true. In an interview with The Guardian published today, Hersh savages the US media for failing to challenge the White House on a whole host of issues, from NSA spying, to drone attacks, to aggression against Syria. 'Not true': Journalist Seymour Hersh says the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden in 2011 was all a fabrication . Sucking up: Hersh said the American press spends 'so much more time carrying water for Obama than I ever thought they would' 'Lying': Hersh says 'not one word' of the Obama administration's account of the raid that supposedly killed Osama Bin Laden is true. The government has never released pictures of Bin Laden's dead body to the public . The compound: The Pakistan home of the al Qaeda leader was in flames after it was attacked by Navy Seals . He said the Navy Seal raid that supposedly resulted in the death of the Al-Qaeda terror leader, Hersh said, ‘not one word of it is true’. According to Hersh - who first gained worldwide recognition in 1969 for exposing the My Lai Massacre and its cover-up during the Vietnam War, for which he received the 1970 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting - the problem is that the US media is allowing the Obama administration to get away with lying. ‘It’s pathetic. They are more than obsequious, they are afraid to pick on this guy [Obama].’ The White House has refused to publicly release images of Bin Laden’s body, fuelling suspicion they are withholding information. President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and members of the national security team watch the raid live from the White House's Situation Room on May 1, 2011 . Aftermath: Part of a damaged helicopter is seen lying near the compound after US Navy SEAL commandos supposedly killed bin Laden . Destroyed: The grounds of the Bin Laden's compound after the raid . Although the White House said the corpse was immediately ‘buried at sea’ within 24 hours of his death in line with Islamic tradition, it quickly emerged that this was not standard practice. It has also been suggested that the White House has changed its story multiple times, according to infowars.com. They initially claimed that pictures from the ‘situation room’ show Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Hilary Clinton and the rest of the security team watching the raid live, when in fact there was a blackout on the feed. Neighbours close to the Pakistani compound in Abbottabad also said they had never seen Bin Laden in the area. 'Afraid': Hersh claims the US media is too scared of challenging Obama . 'Shut them down': Hersh says the solution is to close ABC and NBC and fire 90 per cent of editors . Hersh said the American press spends ‘so much more time carrying water for Obama than I ever thought they would’. In his opinion, the solution would be to shut down news networks like NBC and ABC and fire 90 per cent of mainstream editors and replace them with ‘real’ journalists who are not afraid to speak truth to power. ‘The republic’s in trouble, we lie about everything, lying has become the staple,’ he said.","The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist says that raid which killed Osama Bin Laden in 2011 is ‘one big lie’

"It is bitterly frustrating that England are heading into another major tournament with an unsettled team and a squad beset by injuries. This has been going on for years, with England seemingly suffering a disproportionately high number of injuries compared with other major rugby nations. The question has to be asked: Why? Is this bad luck or is there something at the root of the problem? I believe it is the latter. Owen Farrell (far left) suffered a knee injury after falling awkwardly following a tackle from Julian Bardy . David Wilson became the latest player to join Stuart Lancaster’s lengthy casualty list . England coach Lancaster is contending with a long injury list due to the amount of rugby being played . There is no doubt player welfare and release periods before internationals have vastly improved compared with when I was coaching England. But the game has also changed dramatically and players are suffering. Differences in professional opinion between myself and senior medical people at the RFU over players playing when not 100 per cent fit - or needing a rest - was at the forefront of why I resigned, just months after winning the 2003 World Cup. More than a decade on, nothing has changed and I still hold this firm view - that, if there’s any doubt over fitness, the England coach should have the final say on when England players play for their clubs. Injury victim Brad Barritt (left) and Billy Vunipola spoke at Pennyhill Park as England trained on Tuesday . Lancaster (left) ad Andy Farrell will have to field an England side that has been patched up somewhat . Unfortunately, there were RFU people who were prepared to accept a compromise where - at best - the England doctor would liaise with the club doctor over when players played. Looks fine on paper, but the game had changed. It was never going to work. It has resulted in the current situation where in every tournament England’s squad is decimated by injuries. Professional sport, especially rugby, is a brutal business and you just do not win by compromising over areas like this. This started in 1995-96 when the sport turned professional. The RFU had the opportunity to sign the best players on central contracts - it’s what the southern hemisphere unions did and what the Irish and Welsh Unions have done. Instead of acting decisively, the RFU allowed clubs to sign players and the opportunity was lost. Kyle Eastmond (right) is still not fully fit as he recovers from a shoulder injury . Owen Farrell (left) and Brad Barritt will miss England's opening Six Nations match owing to injury . I have no problem with club owners or directors of rugby wanting their players to play for their clubs. People like Nigel Wray at Saracens, the Walkinshaw family at Gloucester and Bruce Craig at Bath have pumped vast amounts of personal wealth into the professional game and in many ways are the heroes of the sport, the men who have moved it into the modern era. Club rugby is still so important. I’m also not doubting the integrity of club doctors. They are not sending players out to get injured. Having injured players is not in their interests. But are England and the clubs working together effectively enough to give our players the best chance of staying fit and healthy? I’d say not. Wasps captain James Haskell (left) is in great form for his club and will comfortably slot in at blindside flanker . Despite losing Farrell through injury Bath No 10 George Ford was already a favourite to start . At the moment there’s ‘England time’ and ‘club time’. The players desperately want to play for England, it is the pinnacle of the game and they’ll do anything to nail down their place, especially in a World Cup year. Equally though, they are loyal to their clubs and love playing for them, especially in Europe. That should never change. But players are under pressure from both sides. Once they arrive in England camp, they are aware these chances do not come round often. Then, when they return to their clubs, it’s time to get to work again and they are eager to contribute. Within this tug of war, the medical teams for club and country are under huge pressure to deliver players for selection. My concern is that there’s too much emphasis, in both set-ups, to keep players going, week in, week out. Northampton's Tom Wood has an ankle injury which will rule him out of England's clash with Wales . Barritt walks away during his return to club side Saracens last weekend in a 33-10 victory over Munster . Although players may ‘technically’ pass a fitness test, how often are they still rested to avoid any chance of further injury? Or rested to ensure they’re available for an England camp - especially in a World Cup year? We’ve seen with some of the recent stories on concussion in rugby in Sportsmail’s sister paper, the Mail on Sunday, players do not always feel able to speak up about questionable practices. But it’s vital players are allowed to speak out if they feel they are being asked to play when they are injured. Players like Shontayne Hape and Lewis Moody have been brave on this front and I’d like to see current players do the same. With the best will in the world, this tough game will cause injuries. As England coach, you want your top players in big club games, just as long as they are fit. Wales captain Sam Warburton (left) and England skipper Chris Robshaw (right) with the Six Nations trophy . England head coach Lancaster is having to contend with a host of injury headaches . Some injuries, like Owen Farrell’s, are unavoidable. But a lot of the injuries England’s players are suffering are not one-off unfortunate events. We are seeing cumulative injuries brought about by wear and tear in one of the most physically-demanding sports. It is quite clear too many players are playing on with existing injuries and, in World Cup year, that is not good enough. No country could suffer the number of injuries England are facing and consistently challenge the best in the world. Part of the problem for Stuart Lancaster is that he still hasn’t settled on his first-choice XV and that means none of his players know whether they should be prioritising England. Nobody knows the team. Back in 2003 I was able to speak openly and frankly to the top 20 players in my squad and say, ‘Just look after yourself’. George Ford (left) had to undergo concussion tests after suffering a heavy blow during Bath's win on Sunday . Wood, a regular on England’s blindside of the scrum under Lancaster, limped off injured on Saturday . I made it crystal clear that if I heard any of them were playing for their clubs with injuries, they were risking a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and not only letting themselves down but also the team... in fact, the whole country. At the moment we have only three or four players who are nailed-on starters and some of these are out of form. So what we have is the entire England squad out there smashing seven bells out of each other, desperate to prove their worth. Newcastle tight-head Kieran Brookes has been called into England’s training squad to replace Wilson . Second row Geoff Parling is another player absent after injuring his knee while playing for Leicester . Let’s not forget rugby has changed beyond recognition over the past 20 years. It is now described as a ‘collision’ sport rather than a ‘contact’ sport and the hits players are taking are massive. They are warriors playing a sport vastly different to when I played the game. But without players there is no game and they need to be looked after better. That means not playing when injured and being given more time off between seasons to rest their battered bodies. England’s players deserve better and so do the fans. The Six Nations gets under way next Friday and England's squad has been devastated by injury ahead of their visit to Wales. Here is the lowdown on the walking wounded: . BACKS . BRAD BARRITT (Centre): Knee - doubtful for start of Six Nations . LUTHER BURRELL (Centre): Concussion - doubtful for start of Six Nations . KYLE EASTMOND (Centre): Shoulder - doubtful for start of Six Nations . OWEN FARRELL (Fly-half): Knee - out of Six Nations . BEN FODEN (Full back): Knee - out for season .

BEN MORGAN (No 8): Leg - out for season . GEOFF PARLING (Lock): Knee - out for 3-4 weeks . ED SLATER (Lock): Knee - out of Six Nations . DAVID WILSON (Prop): Neck - uncertain . TOM WOOD (Flanker): Ankle - uncertain .","England are suffering from an injury crisis ahead of the Six Nations .

"For anyone who's ever driven in a large city, red lights quickly become a massive annoyance. However, Audi is developing a system that could spell the end of red lights for drivers. It is testing a system known as 'Traffic Light Assist' that shows drivers exactly how far away their next red is - helping they time their drive to minimise stopping. Audi's latest feature will tell drivers when traffic lights are about to change - and warn if you're about to run a red light. Information from the traffic light systems is transmitted to the car and shown on the dashboard - or eventually on a heads up display. When combined with the motion sensors and speed information from the car, drivers can be told exactly how to avoid stopping at red lights. It shows the driver the speed to select in order to reach the next traffic light during a green phase. Acoustic signals also warn the driver in advance of red lights. The display, in the dashboard in front of drivers, shows a traffic light icon  with a countdown timer that reads the number of seconds before a light changes from red to green. The system, is linked into a city's electronic traffic light network, and can even take into account lane changes. Local data from city councils who install smart traffic lights, and motion sensors in the car are used to to predict exactly how long it'll be until the green light goes red. Audi has been testing the new technology in Ingolstadt and Berlin in Germany, as well as in Verona, Italy, and also set it up in Las Vegas for the CES show. In the traffic light phase assistant project in Frankfurt, 20 traffic light systems in the vicinity of Frankfurt am Main were retrofitted so that the test fleet could communicate with them. Audi also showed off their new Sport Quattro Concept car during the Audi keynote at the International Consumer Electronics Show, which features laser headlights . 'The goal of developers was to achieve the most efficient flow of traffic in metropolitan areas,' said Audi.

"Cleanse, tone and moisturise is a mantra for millions of women, sold by the beauty industry as a sure-fire way to fresh, glowing skin. But while the benefits of cleansing and moisturising are obvious, part of the routine is simply habit for many women - and few question its benefits: toning. Toning is meant to remove the last traces of dirt and grime, leaving skin dewy and pores closed. According to market intelligence firm Mintel, one in five of us uses toners daily - which range in price from £1.32 for Simple's to £110 for Kanebo Cosmetics' Sensai Hydrachange Essence. Toning is meant to remove the last . traces of dirt and grime, leaving skin dewy and pores closed - but the products contain alcohol and parabens which can damage our skin . Astoundingly, this means toners are more popular than anti-ageing serums (used by 13 per cent) and acne products (three per cent). But many women who religiously apply this classic skin care product don't realise toners can include harsh ingredients such as alcohol, which can dry out even the most oily skin, and parabens, which have been shown to induce allergic reactions. 'The alcohol found in toners can be a trigger for rosacea, increase the risk of breakouts in acne-prone skin or exacerbate sensitivity,' reveals cosmetic dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting. This means that regular use of toners could leave the skin irritated, inflamed and vulnerable to environmental damage. Dr Bunting believes that even if your toner doesn't harm your skin, its place in your beauty regime may be redundant. 'Soap used to leave behind residues, but today's cleansers are designed to rinse clean and don't disturb the skin's natural equilibrium in the same way, so there's no need to use a toner.' Toners range in price from Simple's £1.32 product, left, to Kanebo Cosmetics' Sensai Hydrachange Essence, £110, right . In fact, in the Forties the U.S. Food And Drug Administration disallowed many of the claims made for skin toners in America and said no astringent could improve skin elasticity or close pores. But elsewhere, the idea that they 'tightened pores' and 'stimulated circulation' persisted. London-based consultant nurse practitioner of Plastic Surgery Associates UK, Constance Campion, agrees: 'Although toners momentarily appear to make the skin seem cleaner and tighter, for the most part they are an expensive soup of water, colours, preservatives, alcohol and acids. 'Most toners actually do more harm than good because they disrupt the delicate balance of the skin, which can lead to symptoms such as dry, oily and cracked skin. This can  increase the growth of bacteria, risking further breakouts in all skin types.' Two products recommended by doctors are Obagi Nu-Derm Toner (£32, . facethefuture.co.uk), left, and SkinCeuticals Equalizing Toner (£25.18, . effortlessskin.com, right . So is every toner a waste of money? Not necessarily. SkinMedica Purifying Toner (£19.50, effortlessskin.com . 'Some modern toners contain skin-calming . ingredients like plant oils and aloe vera, and can even be made with . salicylic acid, which has a positive impact in skin rejuvenation,' says . cosmetic doctor Dr Dan Dhunna. He recommends SkinMedica Purifying Toner (£19.50, effortlessskin.com), Obagi Nu-Derm Toner (£32, facethefuture.co.uk) and SkinCeuticals Equalizing Toner (£25.18, effortlessskin.com). 'These can also break up the glue between epidermal skin cells, allowing the dead skin cells to be exfoliated off, which brings fresh skin cells to the surface, leading to a brighter complexion.' Campion also advocates the use of new skin care products with toning properties. 'Advanced . alternative solutions known as balancers and skin conditioners contain . far more effective, friendly ingredients such as antioxidants that . promote skin health,' she reveals. Her favourites include Société Conditioning Prep Solution (£35, shopfacialgarden.com) and Osmosis Clear Skin Conditioner. So . if want to rejuvenate your skin with a toner, skip solutions with high . alcohol content and choose calming, balancing lotions with effective . ingredients.

"The mother of Baby P could walk free from prison within days after serving just six years for a crime that horrified a nation. Tracey Connelly, who allowed her infant son Peter to be tortured to death by her boyfriend, may be set free this week as experts believe she poses ‘no danger to the public’. A parole board panel is considering fresh evidence about the 32-year-old after her parole hearing was adjourned in July for further reports. Awful crime: Tracey Connelly (left), 32, of Haringey, north London, was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after admitting doing nothing while her son Baby P (right) was tortured to death by her boyfriend and his paedophile brother . Sources said the panellists had been . conferring over the weekend and a decision is expected within the next . couple of  days, which could see Connelly released from prison the same . day. She was branded ‘manipulative, self-centred and calculating’ during her trial in the Old Bailey. Assessments . by psychologists and probation officers now suggest that she poses no . threat to public safety, even though she was still found to be . manipulative following the expert examinations. It is understood that she has shown remorse for her horrific crimes, which is crucial to her plea for freedom. Let out: Connelly has left Low Newton jail (pictured) in Brasside, County Durham and was released after five years there for allowing her son's death . Connelly . was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing nothing while . her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend Steven Barker and . his paedophile brother Jason Owen. Peter . was just 17 months  old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered . cot at  his mother’s north London flat, after suffering a catalogue of . injuries, including a  broken back. With . her time on remand following her arrest in 2007, Connelly has served . longer than the five-year minimum tariff handed down at the  Old Bailey . by judge Stephen Kramer QC, which means  she could apply to the  Parole . Board. A source said yesterday that the board did not require a further hearing and a decision will be announced soon. Connelly . could be out less than 24 hours after her release is approved, but a . shortage  of suitable bail hostel places may keep her in jail a few . days longer. She is currently being held at Low Newton jail near Durham. News of her possible freedom has been met with horror by Baby Peter’s grandmother Mary O’Connor, 63. Indefinite sentences: Tracey Connelly's boyfriend Steven Barker (left) and his paedophile brother Jason Owen (right) were both convicted of causing or allowing Peter's death . Criticised: Sharon Shoesmith, the former children's services chief in Haringey, waged a long battle to clear herself of any personal responsibility for the tragedy . ‘She . should never come out,’ she said. ‘But even if she does I won’t be . seeing her again, she’s out of my life. She wants me to move to Kent . with her. But I said no.’ Jason Owen was freed on licence in 2011 after serving half his six-year sentence for causing or allowing Peter Connelly to die. But . the 41-year-old was returned to prison in April this year after being . caught in an area from which he had been banned under the conditions of . his parole. Baby P suffered . 50 injuries before he died on August 3, 2007. The attacks took place . while Owen, a convicted arsonist, crack addict and National Front . member, was lodging with Barker and Connelly. The . case provoked a national scandal after it emerged that social workers, . police and doctors missed a series of warning signs that could have . saved the child’s life. Social workers considered his care to be ‘a routine, low-risk case’. Connelly was described as ‘without much conscience’. She denied knowing who injured the 17-month-old but admitted causing or allowing the death of a child. Barker was given an indefinite sentence with a tariff of 10 years after being convicted of causing or allowing Peter’s death. Owen was convicted of the same offence and, after challenging his initial sentence, he was jailed for six years.","Tracey Connelly, 32, of Haringey, north London, jailed indefinitely in 2009 .

"SeaWorld in San Diego is suing Canadian marine park after refusing to return 'loanee' whale Ikaika . Whale's father, Tilikum, killed his trainer at SeaWorld in Florida . A killer whale at the centre of an international custody battle has arrived in California. Ike, a nine year old Orca, was flown to SeaWorld in San Diego after a year long legal battle over ownership between the US theme park and a Canadian marine park. The whale's father is Tilikum the 12,000lb whale that killed his trainer Dawn Brancheau in February 2010 at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida, is demanding the return of Ikaika, pictured swimming in a tank at Marineland in Niagara Falls . Ike was transported from Marineland theme park in Toronto, Canada, by a14 vehicle  police escort. It was flown overnight on a cargo plan fitted with a special water tank to San Diego and released into the theme park’s pools where it will join the other killer whales. Ike had been at Marineland for the last five years after being loaned by SeaWorld as part of a breeding exchange. SeaWorld received four beluga whales while it was hoped Ike would breed and produce a number of calves for the Toronto based theme park. Ikaika, Katina, and Taku (from left) perform in Sea World. Marine parks . in North America are banned from importing wild-caught orcas, but the . law does not apply to those born in captivity . Last year Seaworld demanded the return on Ike - but bosses at Marineland refused saying they were led to believe Ike was on a long term loan. Lawyers for Marineland argued that SeaWorld did not have the authority to cancel the agreement. They also claimed SeaWorld only wanted Ike back as one of their performing killer whales,Sumar, had died last year. SeaWorld insisted they wanted Ike back in their care as they were concerned for his health. Courts in Ontario, Canada, sided with SeaWorld and US courts also backed the decision to return the whale to San Diego. Tilikum continued to perform after killing its trainer Dawn . Brancheau, right, in a tragic poolside accident in February 2010 . Ms Brancheau had been nose-to-nose with the whale when her pony tail floated into the animal's mouth and she was dragged in . A judge in Orlando refused to grant Marinland an injunction preventing the transfer. A spokesman for SeaWorld said the transfer of Ike had been a success. 'He was in the water in San Diego early Sunday morning. Everything went great,' insisted SeaWorld spokesman Fred Jacobs. Since the death of 40-year-old Brancheau, trainers are no longer allowed in the water with the killer whales. The Orlando attraction was fined over $50,000 by health and safety officials following the tragic death which was witnessed by up to a dozen visitors.","SeaWorld in San Diego is suing Canadian marine park after refusing to return 'loanee' whale Ikaika .

"A Berlin-based hacker claims to have found a way to infiltrate communication systems on planes through Wi-Fi and inflight entertainment systems. Ruben Santamarta, a consultant with cyber security firm IOActive, is scheduled to explain his method at this week's Black Hat hacking conference in Las Vegas. If his claim is confirmed, it could prompt a serious review of aircraft security. Exposing threats: Cybersecurity researcher Ruben Santamarta says he has figured out how to hack the satellite communications equipment on passenger jets through their WiFi and inflight entertainment systems . 'These devices are wide open. The goal of this talk is to help change that situation,' Mr Santamarta, 32, told Reuters. The researcher said he discovered the vulnerabilities by 'reverse engineering' - or decoding - highly specialised software known as firmware, used to operate communications equipment. This equipment is made by companies including Cobham Plc, Harris Corp, EchoStar Corp's Hughes Network Systems, Iridium Communications Inc and Japan Radio Co Ltd. In theory, a hacker could use a plane's onboard Wi-Fi signal or inflight entertainment system to hack into its avionics equipment, potentially disrupting or modifying satellite communications. This could interfere with the aircraft's navigation and safety systems, Mr Santamarta said. Risk: In theory, study shows a hacker could use a plane's onboard Wi-Fi signal or inflight entertainment system to hack into its avionics equipment, potentially disrupting or modifying satellite communication . Cyber security experts believe it’s too early to say for certain. Mr Santamarta admits he doesn’t know how practical his hack would be in the real world. He has only been able to create the exploit in a lab setting. But if his method proves successful, the hack could give would criminals access to a plane's navigation system. Manufacturer, Combam - whose Aviation 700 aircraft equipment was the focus of the research - said hackers must have physical access to Cobham's equipment for the hack to be successful. More will be known later this week when Mr Santamarta reveals how he hacked the equipment. Mr Santamarta said he decided to go public to encourage manufacturers to fix what he saw as risky security flaws. He acknowledged that his hacks have only been tested in controlled environments, such as IOActive's Madrid laboratory, and they might be difficult to replicate in the real world. Mr Santamarta said he decided to go public to encourage manufacturers to fix what he saw as risky security flaws. Representatives for Cobham, Harris, Hughes and Iridium said they had reviewed Mr Santamarta's research and confirmed some of his findings, but downplayed the risks. For instance, Cobham, whose Aviation 700 aircraft satellite communications equipment was the focus of Santamarta's research, said it is not possible for hackers to use Wi-Fi signals to interfere with critical systems that rely on satellite communications for navigation and safety. The hackers must have physical access to Cobham's equipment, according to Cobham spokesman Greg Caires. 'In the aviation and maritime markets we serve, there are strict requirements restricting such access to authorised personnel,' said Mr Caires. Forced to re-evaluate: Details are sketchy about how the hack was done. Mr Santamarta has revealed that one vulnerability in equipment from all five manufacturers was the use of 'hardcoded' log-in credentials . Details are still sketchy about how the hack was done. Mr Santamarta, however, has revealed that one vulnerability in equipment from all five manufacturers was the use of 'hardcoded' log-in credentials. These are designed to let service technicians access any piece of equipment with the same login and password. The problem is that hackers can retrieve those passwords by hacking into the firmware, then use the credentials to access sensitive systems, Mr Santamarta said. A Japan Radio Co spokesman declined to comment, saying information on such vulnerabilities was not public. Black Hat, which was founded in 1997, has often been a venue for hackers to present breakthrough research. In 2009, Charlie Miller and Collin Mulliner demonstrated a method for attacking iPhones with malicious text messages, prompting Apple Inc to release a patch. In 2011, Jay Radcliffe demonstrated methods for attacking Medtronic Inc's insulin pumps, which helped prompt an industry review of security. Mr Santamarta published a 25-page research report in April that detailed what he said were multiple bugs in firmware used in satellite communications equipment, including aerospace, military, maritime transportation, energy and communications. The report laid out scenarios by which hackers could launch attacks, though it did not provide the level of technical details that Mr Santamarta said he will disclose at Black Hat. Harris spokesman Jim Burke said the company had reviewed Santamarta's paper. 'We concluded that the risk of compromise is very small,' he said. Fear of flying: Vincenzo Iozzo, a member of Black Hat's board said: 'The type of vulnerabilities he discovered are pretty scary just because they involve very basic security things that vendors should already be aware of' Iridium spokesman Diane Hockenberry said, 'We have determined that the risk to Iridium subscribers is minimal, but we are taking precautionary measures to safeguard our users.' One vulnerability that Santamarta said he found in equipment from all five manufacturers was the use of 'hardcoded' log-in credentials. These are designed to let service technicians access any piece of equipment with the same login and password. The problem is that hackers can retrieve those passwords by hacking into the firmware, then use the credentials to access sensitive systems, Mr Santamarta said. Hughes spokeswoman Judy Blake said hardcoded credentials were 'a necessary' feature for customer service. The worst a hacker could do is to disable the communication link, she said. Mr Santamarta said he will respond to the comments from manufacturers during his presentation, then take questions during an open Q&A session after his talk. Vincenzo Iozzo, a member of Black Hat's review board, said Mr Santamarta's paper marked the first time a researcher had identified potentially devastating vulnerabilities in satellite communications equipment. 'I am not sure we can actually launch an attack from the passenger inflight entertainment system into the cockpit,' he said. 'The core point is the type of vulnerabilities he discovered are pretty scary just because they involve very basic security things that vendors should already be aware of.'

"Who's next on the Arsenal conveyor belt of world-class superstar heroes? In the absence of major trophies, a forceful section of Gooners are taking it upon themselves to thrust forward a certain player as a world-class star who’s better than everyone else on the planet. The tell-tale signs of this condition are as follows: Gooners go on social media to over-praise a certain player, selectively use statistics which support their point, and avoid at all costs a degree of measured judgement. The Arsenal player should be compared favourably with all others, especially if they play for Real Madrid, Barcelona or Chelsea. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger pictured during their FA Cup win over Middlesbrough at the weekend . Mesut Ozil cost £42million and created plenty of hype when he arrived at the Emirates from the Bernabeu . Germany international Ozil left Real Madrid and they won the Champions League as Arsenal won the FA Cup . Manchester City are shovelling money into Stevan Jovetic's bank account for nothing . Tim Sherwood requires a superhuman effort to restore past glories to Aston Villa . West Ham are on the verge  but Big Sam's lack of empathy for fans holds them back . GUIDE TO HOW MUCH YOU HATE MANCHESTER UNITED: Think Wayne Rooney dived?  Obsessed with Radamel Falcao? Think Ander Herrera's goal should not have stood? You hate United . The focus is on whoever’s playing well for Arsenal at the time, and the aim is to convince anyone gullible enough to take this nonsense seriously that Arsenal are still a serious force at the top level of the beautiful game. At the start of last season it was Mesut Ozil. He cost £42million so he must be good, right? That all went a bit quiet when everyone quickly worked out the reasons why Real Madrid were happy to let him go. Without him they won the Champions League, with him Arsenal lifted the FA Cup. You do the maths. Ozil was swiftly shifted into the shade and Aaron Ramsey was paraded as the new world-class star. It seemed like only a few weeks had passed since Arsenal fans were united in their desire for the Wales international to be moved on. Yet Gooners would have us believe he was the best midfielder in Europe, the best Welshman on the planet - his FA Cup final goal was surely better than Gareth Bale’s Copa del Rey final effort, they claimed. No, not really. Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey was hailed as the new world-class star at the Emirates after Ozil . Gooners would have us believe Ramsey was the best midfielder in Europe but he has proved otherwise . This season it was Alexis Sanchez. Then he felt a bit tired, so Francis Coquelin was the next shiny  superstar. Just the kind of player Arsenal needed (probably why he was sent to Charlton until there was an injury crisis). Did I just hear someone compare him to Patrick Vieira? Next they’ll be claiming he’s better than Paul Pogba and Nemanja Matic put together. The over-hype of Coquelin embarrassed a few Gooners who understandably felt the need to inject some realism into the matter. So now the spotlight is on Santi Cazorla. He’s the new Arsenal love-interest. Stats are being passed around showing he’s got more assists that Eden Hazard and David Silva. But how many managers would sign Cazorla over Hazard or Silva? I’d wager very few, although there’s no doubt he’s been playing well. So well that it’s been reported Atletico Madrid are keen to sign him. Francis Coquelin (left) became the next superstar tipped to lead on from Arsenal legend Patrick Vieira . The spotlight is now on Santi Cazorla - billed as the Arsenal hero who will lead them to trophies . Cazorla has become the latest to get Arsenal fans excited with his performances at the Emirates . So who will it be next? There was a brief flurry of love for Hector Bellerin after his goal against Aston Villa. And then his bang average performance in the defeat by Tottenham Hotspur calmed all that down. David Ospina’s clean sheet stat - until that pain at the Lane - had him promoted to David de Gea status among the Emirates faithful for a short time. Per Mertesacker won the 2014 World Cup so he must be world class, right? Unfortunately for the big German, his mate Lukas Podolski, and a whole host of footballers from World Cups past, it doesn’t work like that. Just look at Kleberson. So what’s the big idea? What has made Arsenal fans come out with all this nonsense? Hector Bellerin (centre) recently caused a stir, pictured here with Nacho Monreal (left) and Cazorla . David Ospina (left)  - until that pain at White Hart Lane - had been hailed as up there with David de Gea . It’s this: they don’t win big trophies, so in order to try to keep themselves in the picture towards the top of the table, and keep up the image of a big club still up there with the big boys, they have to over-promote their players on a rotation basis beyond their true abilities. If these players really are as good as Arsenal fans want us to believe, the Gunners would be top of the Premier League table and favourites to win the Champions League. But they’re not.","Mesut Ozil cost £42million and was billed as Arsenal's world-class star .

"This is the gruesome moment that a mindless thug left a cat needing surgery to remove one of its eyes after shooting it in the face with a catapult. Craig Nunn, 28, was caught on CCTV cycling up to the cat and firing a glass marble into its face from point blank range. When police tracked him down and arrested him, he even boasted to officers during an interview that he is a 'very good shot', meanwhile in court his lawyer described him as 'a dog person'. Nunn has been jailed for eight weeks at . Kidderminster Magistrates' Court after admitting causing . unnecessary suffering to an animal. Mindless attack: This is the moment Craig Nunn fired a glass marble into the face of Misty the cat, leaving the 11-year-old needing surgery to remove an eye . The court heard that he had been . shooting rabbits with the catapult when he passed the home of Misty’s . owner Terry Ruff in Stourport-on-Severn, Worcestershire. He was caught on camera firing the . marble at the cat as it sat on a wall from less than four feet away . before casually cycling away. The gruesome injuries Misty incurred  forced it to have surgery to remove its eye . Misty, an 11-year-old tortoiseshell, . had her left eye removed by a vet after the attack which happened . at 4.50am on July 13. West Mercia Police branded the unprovoked attack a 'mindless' act. He was initially charged with causing criminal damage but the charge was later changed. The cat was left with a fractured skull . after being hit by the missile, leaving the owners with a £500 vet’s . bill as they were not insured. Jailing the . father-of-three magistrate Trevor Burgess said Misty would suffer from her injuries for the rest . of her life. He told Nunn: 'The animal has suffered the loss of an eye, the loss of an eye will affect a cat for the rest of its life. 'The offence is so severe that only a custodial sentence can be justified. 'We . also disqualify you from owning, keeping, partaking in the keeping or . having any part in the keeping of a cat for the period of ten years. 'Because . of the custodial sentence we can make no order for compensation, . however this does not restrict the owners right to pursue compensation . through the civil courts.' Injured: Not only did Misty have to have an eye removed following the attack but the 11-year-old cat has also been left with a partially paralysed face . During the hearing, prosecutor Peter . Love told the court: 'He stopped and took out his catapult and a marble . and fired at the cat. He saw the marble hit the animal, it fell off the wall and Nunn cycled away. 'He . admitted that he had been ""stupid’"" in interview, he said he wasn’t . unable to understand his own actions and was able to provide no . explanation for them. 'He admitted his actions were intentional, and said he was a ""very good shot"". Thug: Craig Nunn outside Kidderminster Magistrates Court . 'He said he didn’t like cats, having had a bad incident with a cat when he was younger and this cat looked like the one from his past. Mr Love added: 'Misty does not enjoy being in the cage and the family are distressed by how stressed she is now. 'He said the family have now changed the way they treat their animals, being far less happy to let the, go out at night. 'He said Misty has suffered from paralysis on her face as well as the obvious loss of the eye.' Owner Terry Ruff said the family were left 'disgusted' by Nunn’s actions. But the cruel attacker could not explain why he had decided to inflict injury on the pet. Pc . Marc Ginder, of West Mercia Police, said Nunn was unable to offer any . excuse as to why he had carried out the 'wanton act of cruelty'. 'I haven’t seen anything as mindless as this,' he said. 'When we spoke to him he agreed his actions were stupid but he didn’t really have an excuse for it.' Charles Hobbs, defending Nunn, said: 'The defendant does not like cats, he is a dog person and has two dogs at home. 'He was scratched by a cat when he was young and has disliked them ever since. It was a moment of madness that he regrets.' Nunn, of Stourport, was banned from having cats for 10 years. Mr . Nunn's sentencing came as it emerged that a second cat, a ginger kitten . named Ron, survived after being shot in the head by thugs with an . airgun. Recovering: 11-week-old kitten Ron was left with a pellet embedded in his neck after being shot with an air rifle . The 11-week-old, named after Harry Potter character Ron Weasley, was found injured in a garden in Driffield, East Yorkshire. A centimetre-size pellet had narrowly missed his eye and is still lodged in his neck. He was taken to vets and two weeks on has made a remarkable recovery. Clare Sutton, of Priory Vets, said: 'If it had been a centimetre either way it could have been a lot worse. The pellet could have hit his eye or the soft tissue close to his brain. 'He’s very lucky that it didn’t cause any long-term damage. When he was brought in, he was in a bad way - very thin, because he hadn’t eaten in quite a few days. 'We examined his mouth and found a wound and found the hole next to his eye and worked out that he had been shot. On the mend: Foster carer Julie McManus says that the kitten has made a remarkable recovery in the space of just a couple of weeks . Near miss: The kitten still bears the scars of the shot which narrowly missed his eye . 'We could feel there was a lump under his chin, which is probably the pellet and inflammation, but decided that he was too young to operate on and because it wasn’t causing him any trouble at the moment, we could wait until he was a bit older. 'We syringe-fed him and the next day he was a lot better, even quite playful. He’s a lovely little thing.' Ron is now recuperating with a foster carer in Bridlington until he can be adopted if its owners don't come forward.

"Obviously, it is still just golf. And there’s nothing wrong with that. Except of course, it’s not. The Ryder Cup makes golf feel like so much more than just a game. And you’d be hard pressed to find a more engrossing sporting event with which to fill up a corner of your front room over a long weekend. Which is something Sky Sports clearly decided they were really going to embrace on the Cup’s trip to this side of the Atlantic. They even created a unique channel for the tournament. The European team pose with the Ryder Cup trophy after their 16.5-11.5 triumph over the United States . Rory McIlroy sprays the champagne after Europe's victory is confirmed at Gleneagles . The weekend's spectacle was enjoyed by all in attendance at Gleneagles and million watching on Sky Sports . VIDEO Watch Donaldson hit Ryder Cup winner . Having this much time to play with afforded them time to digress from the action. This certainly came in the shape of the Ryder Cup concert which featured an array of music of which you could at least say, well, Midge Ure, he’s Scottish! But it meant nothing to me, Vienna. Where was the golf theme? I’d have opened with Culture Club, followed by Professor Green. Then Iron Maiden for the finale. ‘Colin Colin Colin Colin, Colin Montgomery, you come and go’. Would have brought the house down, no? There was also the golf equivalent of Sky’s cricket autopsy show, The Verdict. Although, Sara Stirk with David Howell and Nick Dougherty couldn't quite generate that show’s sparks in their re-living of the day’s play. And their attempt to do a little comedy skit about the US uniforms was, shall we say, not really part of their skill set. But these are just a couple of nibbles amongst what was a quite magnificent spread of action. All set off by the real star of the show for me, the Gleneagles course itself. A massive part of making golf so appealing as a TV sport for anyone other than the truly devoted is the backdrop. Sky pundits Butch Harmon (left) and Colin Montgomerie (second right) wave from their studio overlooking the first tee as Darren Clarke (right) looks on . The Ryder Cup concert in Glasgow was spectacular but didn't have a golf theme . The beautiful Gleneagles course attracted thousands of spectators over the three days of competition . The Masters, with its dazzling light and rich array of bright colours, is a prime example. But the sumptuous shades of green - splattered with rainbow-coloured flower beds of fans - that made up Gleneagles’ pallet were just as captivating. That, and the Turner-like skies that the players were frequently launching the ball into. Give Mother Nature her due. When she’s really on her game, she delivers! The Moors, the merrier. So once you’ve been handed a setting on a plate, it is then down to the telly to deliver. This I thought happened in swathes across the weekend. Including - and I know it may be a bit fancy, too ‘techy’ for the purist - the bright graphic ribbon that accompanied so many of the drives. Instructive, and it looked great slicing its way through the sombre array of silvers and greys of the skyline. Having said that, the money shot of the whole weekend, for me, was the aerial view of the 9th tee. Capturing the drive from the side rather than behind, this needed no computer wizardry. All that was required was the ball to fly across the rich tapestry of the Gleneagles course. Spectators on the 16th hole were able to enjoy some spectacular scenery as they watched the action . Europe captain Paul McGinley is shown on the big screen against a spectacular backdrop . Then there was a bunch of fellas playing a few rounds of golf. Their contribution was set up perfectly on the morning of day three from Sky Sports’ excellent fishtank of a studio. Darren Clarke and Monty for the blues, with Butch Harmon and Jack Nicklaus on the red side, were engrossing in their analysis of what had gone, and what was yet to come. And all that with a burgeoning crowd in the background already roused into song. Lest we forget, though, the first couple of days were none too shoddy. Bruce Critchley summed it up beautifully in commentary on Saturday when he spoke of ‘that illusive snake oil: momentum’. This was followed by Monty at his most prophetic, saying he hoped a holed putt by Ian Poulter would ‘get (him) into Ryder Cup mode’. It wasn’t too much later that the chip in on the 15th had Poults celebrating in time honoured style. But perhaps best of all was an intimate moment, captured casually on mic, which gave us a welcome insight into the business end of this tournament. Rory had just launched a beauty from the 9th. And just like your mate might if you were having a sneaky nine on your local course, Poults muttered ‘great drive, that’.

Thomas Bjorn touches a picture of Seve Ballesteros for luck as he walks to the first tee . Day three is a different animal, though. It’s the concept of going 'mano a mano', but with a whole team, indeed continent, behind you. And it had the pictures to match. Not many people are going to forget USA rookie Patrick Reed’s sssshing of the crowd and Michael Van Gerwen impressions. Nor the indomitable Justin Rose, having played his miracle shot from under a tree, turning to the camera and saying ‘a bit of Seve for you’. And of course the maelstrom of pictures that resulted from Jamie Donaldson’s incredible approach on the 15th. But perhaps the most vivid of them all for me went back to the players’ winding walks down to the first tee, when Rose touched fists with the image of Seve. And Sergio Garcia left his fellow countryman a little kiss on the cheek. Sky Ryder Cup succeeded in delivering ‘sport event TV’ at its grandest. But in those couple of intimate moments, we witnessed its true spirit.","Sky devoted a whole channel to their Ryder Cup coverage as Europe defeated the United States 16.5-11.5 at Gleneagles .

"Bank of America is the first bank to issue debit cards in the Unites States with chip technology (EMV cards) to better protect the cardholder's identity and prevent card replication. Bank of America has been offering chips on credit cards since 2012 but after their decision to make it an option on debit cards other financial institutions are likely to follow in their footsteps. The chip acts as the magnetic strip normally on cards and uses a pin number that when verified allows for a transaction to take place. Paving the way: Bank of America is the first bank to put chips on credit cards as oppose to magnetic strips and other financial institutions are likely to follow . Replaces the strip: The chip has as the same data at the magnetic strip but it encrypts and changes card information with each transaction making it difficult for people to replicate the cards . Market Watch reports that each time the card is used the transaction information changes making it difficult to copy the card. The card encrypts transaction information each time the card is used, explains Bizjournals.com. 'The chips are much harder for criminals to replicate than the magnetic strip is,' said John Kiernan, senior analyst at Evolution Finance. The new chip technology is expected to become the security standard for all U.S. credit cards and merchants will have to update their payment terminals to allow for the new technology. Companies like Visa and MasterCard have given merchants and card issuers an October 1015 deadline to allow for the new technology. If merchants don't comply, credit card companies have threatened to pass fraud liability to the stores themselves which can be very expensive. Merchants will have to pay around $1,000 to update their machines to allow for the EMV cards. 'It’s not anything you need to rush out right now and get,' said Kiernan. 'They will be more impactful when merchants get the new terminal.' Fraud doesn't affect consumers or credit card companies as much at it affects stores like target and Home Depot who were the recent victims of mass data breaches. Even though the chip doesn't do much to prevent credit card fraud, it will make it harder for people to duplicate the card. 'Chip technology is an important tool in increasing card security, and we want our customers to have the best possible experience when using their payment cards,; said Titi Cole, retail products and underwriting executive for Bank of America to Bizjournals.com. 'The new chip-enabled debit cards will improve security of customers’ transactions when traveling abroad and at home as more U.S. merchants adopt chip technology,' she added. The Federal Reserve data shows that credit card and debit card fraud impacts around one per cent of all purchases made. That's an estimated $11.27 billion in losses. Benefits: Having chips on cards will prevent fraud during international travel and in the U.S. as soon as merchants adapt their system to allow the cards .","The chip  acts as the magnetic strip normally on cards and uses a pin number that when verified allows for a transaction to take place .

"Western Sydney Wanderers have become the first A-League side to win the Asian Champions League, but the win was dampened by dirty tactics with the Sydney side targeted by spitting, headbutting and lasers. After a scoreless game, Tony Popovic's Sydney side won 0-1 on aggregate in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh in just their third year season of football. Bitter losers Al Hilal reacted badly to their loss at fulltime, instigating a raging fight.

Moments earlier, during the added five minutes of injury time, Al-Shamrani appeared to also deliberately headbutt the Wanderers' defender which was not pulled up by the referee. Throughout the game, Wanderers' goalkeepers Ante Covic had lasers flashed at his eyes in a dirty tactic from fans in the 70,000-person strong crowd. Despite the confrontation, the Wanderers were ecstatic about the victory. 'To come such a long way in the short history of this club and win a title like this ...

'But as I said yesterday, we're an excellent team and we showed over two legs how good we are. 'For me, I am just proud for these players and our club. The first time in the competition, to win it, I think in the future we will really understand how special this run has been and how it was to win this title.

When Antony Golec stretched and found Nawaf Al-Abid rather than the ball, it seemed the roaring crowd would have their penalty. But the decision didn't come, incensing Al-Hilal boss Laurentiu Reghecampf. The referee again kept his whistle quiet on the hour when Covic clearly slid in on Salman Al Faraj. The on-field dramas did not detract from the Wanderers' supporters elation, with around 5000 people crowded into Parramatta's Centenary Square to watch the game and celebrate the club's historic ACL cup win. The square erupted when the Wanderers secured the win, with fans setting off flares– a habit which is proving difficult for Wanderers fans to kick, despite costing the club $5000 each time one is ignited under ACL regulations.

"Three lap dancers and an actress kidnapped a club boss who failed to pay them £42,000 after the premises were closed down during the Cheltenham National Hunt Festival, a court heard yesterday. The women appeared in the dock with two men accused of acting as 'heavies' for them in the kidnapping. Their alleged victim was subjected to violence and threats, and robbed during his ordeal, Martin Steen, prosecuting, told the court. Accused: Mandy Cool, Charlotte Devaney and Rachel Goodchild (left to right) outside Gloucester Crown Court . The dancers, thought to have been . from a well-known club in London, had been hired to perform in the club . during the racing festival. Miss Devaney had been asked to arrange the dancers, waitresses and hostesses for the club by the alleged victim's partner. But police raided and closed down the . club, and the club boss did not pay the dancers. 'We say he was kidnapped and subjected to various forms of violence and threats', Mr Steen told Gloucester Crown Court. 'Items were taken from him in a . robbery. It is not disputed by the Crown that the ladies in question . were owed money by the victim.' Actress Charlotte Devaney, 34, of . London, and dancers Rachel Goodchild, 24, and Mandy-Laura Cool, 29, both of . Southampton, and Stephanie Pye, 30, of Sutton Coldfield, together with . brothers Robert Morris, 26, and Alexander Morris, 22, of Southampton, . are all accused of kidnap on September 3 last year. All but Pye pleaded not guilty to the . charge. Pye's lawyer asked for the charge not to be put to her because . she intends to mount a legal argument asking for it to be dropped. Court: Mandy Cool, left, pleaded not guilty to the kidnap charge, while Stephanie Pye, right, did not enter a plea . Civil action: Charlotte Devaney, left, and Rachel Goodchild, right, are taking civil action to recover the money . The Morris brothers also denied robbing the alleged victim of a £4,650 Breitling watch and £60 in cash on the same date. Alexander Morris further denied . having a Stanley knife in a public place – the Northway Trading Estate . at Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire – where the alleged victim works. Barrister Audrey Archer, representing . Goodchild, said that she is taking civil court action against the club . boss for recovery of the money she claims he still owes her. The other . women were already taking similar court action, she said. It is the prosecution case that the women were recruited to dance in a room at the Embassy Club in . Cheltenham during the four-day National Hunt Festival in March last . year. On the day the club was closed down . the women made a complaint to police that they had not been paid the . £42,000 they said the alleged victim owed them. It is alleged that the women then . decided to get the money out of the boss themselves by recruiting the . two brothers to help them. Defendants: Brothers Robert and Alexander Morris, right, pleaded not guilty to kidnap and robbery charges . Judge William Hart transferred the . case to Bristol Crown Court on a date to be fixed. He made it a . condition of bail that the defendants must not contact the alleged . victim except through solicitors. Charlotte Devaney describes herself as an international DJ, producer, actress and model. She had a part in 2008 film How to Lose Friends and Alienate People, which starred Simon Pegg, and has a single coming out this summer with American rapper Snoop Dogg. A statement released by her publicist said: 'On behalf of myself and the other girls involved in this case, I would like to state categorically that we are not guilty of this charge.

"Rumours are already hinting at the fact Apple’s next handset, dubbed iPhone 6, will have a full HD Retina Display and now new reports suggest this display could be made of sapphire glass. These claims have been made because Apple recently announced plans to open a mineral plant in Arizona with sapphire glass experts GT Advanced Technologies. The facility is expected to employ around 700 people to manufacture sapphire crystal and sapphire glass, and this technology could make its way onto the screens of the next iPhone. Apple has been heavily criticised in the past for its fragile devices. Rumours in November claimed Apple's iPhone 6, artist's impression pictured, would have a screen made from sapphire glass. The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, hard-wearing and scratch resistant . Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures. As . the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced . using diamond-coated saws. These round disks are ground into shape, and . polished, to become glass. The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in . the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera. As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones.

Reports Apple was experimenting with sapphire displays began last year, yet sources claimed at the time Apple found the technology ‘infeasible.’ This was because sapphire glass is more expensive to produce than normal screens. The plans to build the plant could equally . be less about creating sapphire screens, and more about mass producing . the firm's Touch ID technology. Apple recently announced plans to open a mineral plant that uses sapphire-based materials. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its iPhone 5S, pictured, and to protect the cameras on its latest models. Rumours now claim Apple could use the plant to make strong sapphire glass screens . It’s likely any future models of the iPhone and iPad will feature the biometric technology introduced on the iPhone 5S and Apple will need a plant to be able to produce a lot of the material, quickly. In a statement about the announcement, GT Advanced Technologies said: ‘Although the agreement does not guarantee volumes, it does require GT to maintain a minimum level of capacity.’ While an Apple spokesman added: We are proud to expand our domestic manufacturing initiative with a new facility in Arizona, creating more than 2,000 jobs in engineering, manufacturing and construction. ‘This new plant will make components for Apple products and it will run on 100 per cent renewable energy from day one, as a result of the work we are doing with SRP to create green energy sources to power the facility.’","Apple has announced plans to open a mineral plant in Arizona .

"Why are we still discussing whether the Millennium Stadium roof will be open on Friday night? Stuart Lancaster should have gone on the front foot on Monday and said England want it closed, putting huge pressure on the Welsh to comply. If England are serious about winning the World Cup, they’ve got to be able to deal with these cauldron-like environments. They should get the roof shut, crank up the pressure and go out there to silence 80,000 Welshmen. England last played Wales under a roof two years ago, and they were crushed at the Millennium Stadium . But Stuart Lancaster could have sent a message by insisting his side want the roof closed on Friday night . England's record at the Millennium Stadium . I would be talking our team up, not talking about the noise. Nobody has ever lost to an atmosphere — and no crowd has ever won a game, either. We had a similar situation before the 2003 World Cup. After beating New Zealand, we flew to Melbourne and immediately held a press conference. One of the first questions asked, planted by me, was about the roof. The Australians had assumed we would want it open, to quieten the home crowd and bring into play the predicted wet conditions. I said to the journalists, ‘We want it shut . . . why would we want it open?’ We threw it back at them and went out there with an all-court team capable of playing with the ball in their hands — and we smashed them. From a coaching point of view, if you know the conditions are going to be perfect, you can pick a certain team with confidence — a dangerously rapid team in England’s case. Having the roof shut takes the conditions out of the equation and makes your job much easier, so long as your team has an all-court game — which England do possess. It’s like Formula One; you have your wet-weather tyres and your dry-weather tyres. This is an opportunity for Lancaster to come out and say, ‘I want the roof shut and I’m going to pick my fast-track ponies’. This is an opportunity for Lancaster to say: ‘I want the roof shut and I’m going to pick my fast-track ponies' Anthony Watson (left) and Jonny May (right) could expose the Welsh with their pace . England can use the conditions to their advantage. They couldn’t match Wales for pace two years ago, but with the right team we’re now faster and more creative, if we play to our strengths. England can catch Wales cold. All the pressure is on the hosts because they are the favourites and they have a clean bill of health. You have to ask why Wales have far fewer injuries and a lot of it comes down to the fact that the Welsh players know they’re in the team. They do not want to miss the Six Nations, they do not want to miss a World Cup. In contrast, the England guys are all playing for their places and are unwilling to sit out any club rugby for fear of a rival having a good weekend, and it’s eventually caught up with them. That’s where England needed strong leadership, and education over injuries. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, let’s not mess it up. But the injury myth is just a subplot. You can tell when teams are worried because they start doing a lot of talking. I am pretty sure Warren Gatland is worried, despite the confident move to name his team 48 hours ahead of schedule. The probable England team to play Wales at the Millennium Stadium on Friday night . Warren Gatland will be worried about the clash despite naming his side two days early . It’s all part of the theatre. England could have done the same and stopped people talking about them. Now England’s key objective should be to go out there and really attack. To do that, they have to pick the right side. They should stop talking about injuries because, if anything, they have been a blessing in disguise. We have ended up with a team who are clearly suited to the roof being shut and if you asked George Ford or Jonathan Joseph, I’m sure they would rather not be playing in the pouring rain. There has been too much focus on England’s ‘lengthy injury list’ but, if I were picking the team, only two of the unavailable players would make it: Manu Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes. Our bench is still much stronger than the Welsh bench and it comes down to whether the coaches have the experience and bottle to lay down a marker. We have a squad capable of winning the World Cup, let alone beating Wales. These five Six Nations games should be treated like knockout football. In seven months, we will have must-win pool games against Wales and Australia, before a quarter-final, semi-final and a final. George Ford would much rather not handling the ball in the pouring rain in Wales . Manu Tuilagi (left) and Courtney Lawes (right) are the only players out injured who I would pick in my team . The key to knockout football is coming away with points when you get into the opposition’s third of the field. Drop goals are key, while conceding penalties and yellow cards is fatal. The best example is England in the semi-final of the 2003 World Cup against France. We killed them with drop goals. Every time we got into French territory, Jonny Wilkinson dropped a goal and we went back and started again. Out of desperation, France lost two men to the sin-bin, most crucially Serge Betsen. We’ve got to pick a fast pack of forwards to win the ball, alongside real quality at Nos nine, 10 and 12 to get the ball in their third of the field. When you’re in their third of the field, you obviously want to score tries, but if you stall then you take the three points and start again. That is what England must do. The best teams in the world would feed off Friday night’s partisan crowd, so let’s go out there and silence the Welsh. Drop goals are key - Jonny Wilkinson against France in the World Cup semi-final in 2003 is a prime example .","Wales host England in the RBS 6 Nations opener on Friday night .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has confirmed Parliament House in Canberra has been a target for terrorists and security will be beefed up. Australian Federal Police officers will be deployed 'immediately' at the site of Australia's top government building in a bid to bolster security amid reports a terror attack was planned. Speaking on Friday Mr Abbott said a review of security at Parliament House was conducted after the potential threats were identified. According to a senior intelligence source, it would not take much to gain access to the Prime Minister's office . It has been revealed Parliament House may have been a target in a possible terror attack . 'One of the first consequences of the review of security has been moves to put Australian Federal Police back in charge of internal as well as external security,' he said. 'It is happening almost immediately.' Mr Abbott's comments come following conversations which were intercepted by joint-intelligence agencies which intercepted 'chatter' that a terror attack was planned. ASIO  intercepted  information about plans to target  the Prime Minister, other public officials and members of the public. More than 5000 people work in Parliament House when Federal Parliament is in session  and it is a major attraction in for tourists  groups and schoolchildren. Asked if people would be safe, Mr Abbott said: 'it is a safe country (Australia) but we have to be aware there are people ... who would do us harm.' Security will be bolstered at Parliament House for the first time since March when control was downgraded in March. Intelligence agencies uncovered a possible terror plot  similar to the one carried out in 2008 in Mumbai, India. The Mumbai attacks  involved 12 separate incidents combining the use of guns and bombs over four days, and were orchestrated by terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba. Thursday's terror raids netted 15 arrests while two people  were charged . Suburbs across Sydney and Brisbane were targeted in the pre-dawn searches involving State and Federal police . Tony Abbott has revealed that more raids are likely in the wake of  new information about an attack on Parliament House . The move to redeploy high-level security will be  bolstered over the coming days, in the wake of conversations reportedly intercepted by joint intelligence and security agencies. 'The chatter has picked up talk of Parliament House, I can confirm that' an intelligence officer told The Daily Telegraph. It is understood the biggest concern was the threat to people inside that building, including not only staff but MPs and members of the general public who visit on a daily basis. The 'chatter' was reportedly intercepted by joint authorities including police, counter-terrorism, spy, agencies, ­which revealed talk about access to Parliament House. In the wake of the raids it is understood airport level security checks for visitors and barriers are also being considered . From these raids, it was revealed suspected home-grown terrorists were plotting to pick a random person off the street and behead them . It also indicated ASIO was an additional target. A senior intelligence source confirmed it would not be hard to gain access to Parliament House. 'There are a lot of lives in this building. And it is a building that is currently very vulnerable to a random act of violence,' the source told The Daily Telegraph. 'The weakest point is the ministerial wing. You could take out two blokes sitting at a desk and walk straight into the courtyard with a line of sight into the PM's office.' This possible plot has been revealed after Thursday's anti-terror raids that saw 800 police officers carry out 25 search warrants across Sydney's west and Brisbane. Fifteen people were arrested but only two people were charged in Australia's largest operation of its kind. From these raids, it was revealed suspected home-grown terrorists were plotting to pick a random person off the street and behead them while draped in an Islamic State flag on video, similar to the deaths of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines.","Tony Abbott confirmed a terror attack was planned on Parliament House .

"When surfer Trent Sherbourne zipped up his wetsuit, grabbed his board and headed down to the secluded beach he was probably hoping to have the waves to himself. So imagine his surprise when he found himself sharing the surf with a pod of dolphins who jumped out of the water right in front of him. But even more incredible is that the moment was captured back on land by a self-taught photographer who was lining up his last shot of the day while experimenting with a new lens. This stunning picture was capture by Matt Hutton who was just lining up the last shot of the day . Dolphins are known to share waves with humans but it is extremely rare for them to breach the surface and even rarer for the moment to be captured on film . Matt Hutton, 31, had been taking pictures of Trent when the local surfer was completely upstaged by dolphin racing him down the wave, before losing out to the speedy sea-mammal. Amateur snapper Matt was travelling from Perth to his home in Wickham, Western Australia, in order to add pictures to his portfolio when he decided to stop in the small town of Kalbarri. After asking locals for information he was told of a few good spots to go and take pictures of surfers but was advised that dolphin sightings were rare. When he arrived at the beauty spot he found the rumours to be true as a few other photographers lined the shore training their hi-tech lenses on the ocean. Luckily for Matt, he had bought a specialist lens of his own just a few days before and was determined to get some good shots. He said: 'One photographer said that he had been there hundreds of times but only seen dolphins on a few occasions. 'I was getting some great photos of Trent Sherborne surfing this awesome wave, when a pod of dolphins decided to join him. 'On the first occasion I captured two dolphins sharing a wave with him and a few separate photos of just the dolphins by themselves. But when Matt came to line up his last picture a dolphin leaped from the wave just in front of Trent, and after zooming in on his camera's LCD screen to check it was in focus, Matt fired off a frame. Hutton said he was 'so lucky to have been at the right place and right time' as sightings of dolphins at the beach are uncommon . Losing out: Trent's surfing was completely eclipsed by the stunts of the camera-shy dolphins who shared the surf with him that day . What he captured is the incredibly rare moment a dolphin breached the surface while sharing a wave with a surfer. While the intelligent animals are known to swim with humans, surfing with them is rare, and even then they stay underwater most of the time. Matt added: 'It really is a very rare shot and I was so lucky to have been at the right place and right time and in regards to the dolphin and the surfer, Trent said he knew it was him in the photo as it's not everyday you get to eyeball a Dolphin, so it was pretty close!' 'I have had so many people write kind emails, messages, comments etc and it has been a very humbling experience, it is simply the highlight of my small photography career. 'A few people think its photoshopped but I can assure you they're not!' However, one surfer who fell foul of the usually friendly sea creatures was Troy Robinson, 43, whose arm was broken after clashing with a dolphin in July. Robinson found himself surrounded by ten of the animals while paddling out to sea, and it quickly became apparent that there was not enough space for all of them on the same wave. As he ducked and dived through the tangle he was suddenly hit, torpedo-like, by one of the animals which knocked him clean off his board and left him in immense pain. The impact was so hard he had to have a plate inserted into his left forearm and it also punched a hole into his surfboard. However he later joked that it would be a good story to tell his grandchildren, adding that it was 'better than it being a shark.'","Trent Sherborne was catching waves at his local beach in Kalbarri, Western Australia .

"An artist has created a series of hyper realistic finger paintings which look just like choppy seas, and spectacular icy landscapes. Zaria Forman, 31, whose works take up to a month to complete, has created the landscapes to document the ever-changing beauty of regions affected by climate change. Forman, from Brooklyn in New York, USA, led an Arctic expedition to the north west coast of Greenland purposely with the aim of creating art inspired by the dramatic geography. Her mother, Rena Bass Forman, originally came up with the idea but died before her daughter could see it through, and so she promised to carry out the journey in her name. After formal training at Skidmore college Forman now exhibits extensively in galleries and venues throughout the United States and overseas. Forman's drawings that served as the set design for the classic ballet Giselle, and were used in the set design for House of Cards, a Netflix TV series directed by David Fincher and starring Kevin Spacey. The paintings are put on sale on her own personal site, ranging in price from £3,000 ($6,000) to £4,500 (around $9,000). Her main focus is pictures of the ocean, with much of her art taking the form of pictures of sea spray on the shore, or water cascading over rocks or icebergs . Zaria Forman paints waters that are incredibly choppy, and ones that are serenely still, with both giving her a unique challenge in her work as an artist . Zaria Forman, the artist behind the seascape visages. Forman uses layers of paint to make the distinctive shadows and ripples that make her works of art look so real . (Left) Forman's landscapes are an attempt to capture the beauty of randomly formed icy landscapes. (Right) Forman uses a variety of different techniques, from paint to chalk, to create her vistas . In addition to exhibitions, recent projects include a series of drawings that served as the set design for the classic ballet Giselle, which premiered in October 2012 at the Grand Theatre of Geneva, Switzerland. Ten of the drawings were also used in the set design for House of Cards, a Netflix TV series directed by David Fincher and starring Kevin Spacey . Some of Forman's works of art look hyper-realistic, while others are more artistically vivid, but all of them revolve around the same theme . Sometimes the sea takes a backseat in focus to other parts of the picture, like the photo-realistic clouds, and the wind blowing spray into the air . Zaria Forman was formally trained at Skidmore college, and now exhibits extensively in galleries and venues throughout the U.S. and overseas . Each of Forman's pictures are an attempt to capture a unique part of the landscape, where sometimes the icebergs and land masses are the focus, and other times they take a back seat to the ocean . Some of Forman's pictures look so realistic you would be forgiven for thinking that they are simply photographs rather than laborious works of art . The artworks all seem to capture a particular theme; cold, made possible by Forman's extensive use of rich, deep, blue coloured paints . Originally from Brooklyn in New York, Forman, led an Arctic expedition to the north west coast of Greenland purposely with the aim of creating art inspired by the dramatic geography . Some of Forman's works of art have been inspired by standing on the shores of the ocean, while others were inspired by the arctic voyage . Forman's mother, Rena Bass Forman, originally came up with the idea but sadly didn't live to see it through . The finger paintings also seem to capture warmer seas, with this particular image looking more like tropical ocean than arctic ocean . Some of Forman's works have gone on sale for around $9,000 in private sales and auctions, and many are advertised on an artwork selling site . In her paintings, Zaria Forman has not only captured the freezing cold areas, but also the time of day, with many pictures depicting different stages of her voyage to the icy seas . This picture, depicting flowing seas disrupting calmer ones, was perhaps inspired by the view from a boat voyage, of the sea rather than a larger vista . Forman in her studio. The paintings are put created on boards placed and affixed against the wall, before they are transformed into works of art .","After training at Skidmore college Zaria Forman now exhibits extensively in venues throughout the United States .

"Jos Buttler may just be a very English kind of sporting hero. It’s not that we expect our heroes to bash 85 from 83 balls on Test debut, as Buttler did in Southampton on Monday. It’s that we seem to prefer it when they’re humble — no matter how misplaced the humility. Two months ago, after Buttler had thrashed 121 off 74 balls in a one-day international against Sri Lanka at Lord’s, he suggested: ‘I’m probably not ready for Test cricket — that is my honest opinion, and it’s the opinion of others.’ In fairness, his captain Alastair Cook had just ventured the same view. But the effect was profound. Here was the most exciting talent in English cricket playing down his own prospects. Take a bow: Jos Buttler hit 85 runs off 83 balls on his Test debut against India . Double act: England batsmen Ian Bell (l) and Jos Buttler leave the field at tea during day two . If you can whack the ball regularly for six and do it self-deprecatingly, you are — in the eyes of the English sporting public — halfway there. The scene was perfectly set as  Buttler walked out to embark on a Test career that already looks as if it will spell the end for Matt Prior. England were 420 for five and in search of a pick-me-up after losing three for 65 either side of lunch. Ideally, they wanted 550 before declaring — as quickly as possible. Over to Buttler. Having got his head round the fact that he was ‘closer than perhaps I thought’ to being ready for Test cricket, he had prepared for this match by pledging to stick to his natural game. This can also include a certain looseness outside off stump, however, and Buttler was still yet to score when  he prodded Bhuvneshwar Kumar  low down to Ajinkya Rahane at  second slip. Lucky? Jos Buttler escaped several umpire decisions in Southampton . The chance probably carried, but TV umpire Rob Bailey discerned enough doubt. Buttler celebrated his reprieve by bunting Ravindra Jadeja over mid-off for four, then scything his next ball over the covers — a miscue, as it turned out, but a profitable one. After that, a generous Ageas Bowl crowd lapped up all the fun of the fair. There were more missed opportunities as he chanced his arm: Shikhar  Dhawan dropped him at first slip  on 23, while India’s skipper MS Dhoni bungled a decent stumping chance when he was on 59. But in between was an exhilarating taste of the years ahead. After taking 50 balls over his first 26 runs, he decided to bat as if he was masterminding a one-day run-chase for  Lancashire. Jadeja was reverse-swept for four with the kind of power most batsmen summon up for their conventional sweep, then launched back over his head for six. All good things come to and end:  Jos Buttler is eventually bowled out by Jadeja . Soon after, debutant seamer Pankaj Singh was deposited for 20 in five balls, including two leg-side heaves for six. By the time Buttler chopped on against Jadeja, he had thrashed 59 off his last 33 deliveries, and the spring in India’s step had long gone. There are sure to be pitfalls along the way. He may need a bit of luck from time to time, and his wicketkeeping will get better. But, for a dressing room in need of a shot of adrenaline, this was just the ticket. Buttler survived after edging Bhuvneshwar Kumar behind before he had scored a run. Ajinkya Rahane caught the ball low at second slip and India celebrated but the umpires — unsure if the ball had hit the floor first — referred the decision to third umpire Rob Bailey. After several replays, he decided there was enough doubt to give Buttler not out...","Jos Buttler hit 85 from 83 balls in Test debut against India .

"Warren Gatland has warned George North that he must make more of an impact at club and international level if he wants to keep his place in the Wales starting XV. The Kiwi coach yesterday fuelled speculation that North, 22, will be named on the bench for the RBS Six Nations opener against England, suggesting that Scarlets winger Liam Williams could be handed the starting jersey . North burst on to the international scene as a teenager and has since started 47 out of his 48 Tests. However, Gatland has hinted he could stick to the winning formula that beat South Africa in November, when North was sidelined with concussion. Wales boss Warren Gatland has said he wants to see more of Northampton's George North on the ball . The 22-year-old has featured in 47 of 48 Wales Tests but could start on the bench against England . Wales captain Sam Warburton (left) and Warren Gatland pose with the 2015 RBS Six Nations trophy . ‘Northampton have the same issues with George, having spoken to [backs coach] Alex King about touching the ball more,’ said Gatland. ‘We want to see more touches and have the ball in his hands. When he does that, he is dangerous and makes some metres for us. ‘If you are a player who has won against South Africa and started the game, then it’s sometimes difficult for that player to be dropped. We won’t sit down as a coaching team until Monday or Tuesday and start talking about a team. We will see how players front up. It’s a nice position for us to be in and we have options.’ North has been a key component in Wales’s physical style of play – commonly referred to as ‘Warrenball’ – while Williams is a much less powerful athlete. Collisions are getting bigger in the Test arena and Gatland admitted that his side will direct their heavy ball-carriers, especially inside-centre Jamie Roberts, towards fly-half George Ford, who is one of England’s smallest players. ‘People target the 10 channel in modern international rugby,’ said Gatland. ‘Outside-halves are physically one of the smallest players on the field. We are no different to anyone else and it’s part of the game now. Jamie Roberts could make a start for Stuart Lancaster's side after impressing against South Africa . ‘Jamie Roberts was outstanding on the weekend against Northampton. One of the positives about our players in France is they have not played too much rugby, so they are pretty fresh and looking forward to the Six Nations.’ Gatland is ‘hopeful’ that tight-head prop Samson Lee will recover from a neck injury in time for the opening Test at the Millennium Stadium. The 22-year-old has emerged as one of the world’s best young scrummagers, with his fitness becoming increasingly important following the shock retirement of veteran Adam Jones. ‘I was surprised at the timing [of Jones’s announcement],’ said Gatland. ‘I thought he might have waited until the end of the season, because the door wasn’t closed for him. He has made the decision and his contribution to Welsh rugby has been immense. ‘What he has achieved in our game is tremendous and there was a time where he was the first name on the team sheet. He has won three Grand Slams, another Six Nations Championship and a Lions tour.’ Plying his trade in France, the Racing Metro 92 player will be fresh heading into the Six Nations .","Warren Gatland wants to see more of an impact from Saints' George North .

"Toyota has revealed its latest supercar concept - after giving it a virtual test drive in a computer game. The firm used Sony’s Gran turismo game to tweak the design for its latest supercar, called the LT-1 before unveiling the real-life version at the North American International Auto Show. Toyota even used the game to sell the concept car to the car firm’s boss. Scroll down for video . The real-life version of the car unveiled at the 2014 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) - after being test driven and tweaked in the Gran Turismo game . Every aspect of the car can be seen in the virtual version - even down to the lights, and the handling is expected to be identical to the final version of the concept car . Gran Turismo is one of the longest running driving game series, and this year celebrates its 15th anniversary in 2013, having first appeared internationally in 1998. The multi-award-winning franchise has been the most successful ever for PlayStation, and in 2013 more than 70 million copies were sold worldwide. Various version of Gran Turismo have  been created for PlayStation, PlayStation2, PlayStation3 and PSP (PlayStation Portable). ‘We collaborated with the Gran Turismo team to develop a virtual FT-1 and it was used as a tool to pitch the concept to Akio Toyoda,’ said Calty Design Research Studio Chief Designer Alex Shen, who was responsible for the car’s look. ‘Before reviewing the physical model, he drove the FT-1 on Fuji Speedway in GT6. ‘He gave us a thumbs up when he finished his virtual lap faster than his best time in his own LFA in real life.’ The firm also plans to make the car available to all players of the game for free from today. ‘Thanks to the amazing capability of the Gran Turismo game engine, gamers can enjoy a very real simulation piloting the ultra-high performance FT-1 on the tracks it was designed to master,’ said Kevin Hunter, President of Calty Design Research. The car’s interior features a fighter jet inspired heads-up display positioned above the steering wheel and projected out ahead of the driver to keep the eyes focused on the road. 'On the exterior, ‘Function-Sculpting’ was our key term to imagine the FT-1 design,' explained Hunter. 'We wanted it to look as if it was beautifully sculpted by the wind while providing functional cooling to optimize aerodynamic performance…it gets your heart racing just looking at it.' ‘The deeply sculpted intakes and outlets have sexy, curvaceous surfaces and transitions,’ said Hunter. ‘This was our approach in creating ‘beautiful solutions to manage dirty air.’ The FT-1 also has a glass window to showcase the engine. The firm has not yet revealed the specs for the concept car, but says it will be the 'ultimate enthusiast's car'. Polyphony Digital, the firm who created the game, said it was a dream come true to test a real concept car before it was made. ‘It’s always been a dream of ours to have our automotive partners use Gran Turismo in exciting new ways,’ said Kazunori Yamauchi, creator of Gran Turismo and President of Polyphony Digital Inc. a virtual version of Toyota's FT-1 concept car was created in Sony's Gran Turismo computer game so designers could tweak it before deciding on a final version, pictured . a virtual version of Toyota's FT-1 concept car was created in Sony's Gran Turismo computer game so designers could tweak it before deciding on a final version, pictured .

"Scientists have discovered a gene variation that affects the human body clock so profoundly that it even predicts the time of day when an individual is most likely to die. Researchers hope the findings could eventually be used to determine when heart or stroke patients should take medication to make it most effective, or when hospital patients should be monitored most closely. The US team discovered the gene variation by accident when they were investigating the development of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. New research: The findings could eventually be used to determine when heart or stroke patients should take medication to make it most effective, or when hospital patients should be monitored most closely (file picture) They looked at the sleeping patterns of 1,200 healthy 65-year-olds who were also given annual neurological and psychiatric assessments. Differences: Those with the AA or AG genotype died just before 11am on average, but those with the GG genotype tended to die at just before 6pm . They found a single molecule near a gene called ‘Period 1’ that had as its base either adenine (A) or guanine (G). Type A is more common by a ratio of six to four, so because people have two sets of chromosomes, an individual has a 36 per cent chance of having two As, a 16 per cent chance of having two Gs, and a 48 per cent chance of an A and a G. The findings, published in the Annals of Neurology, showed that those with a AA genotype tend naturally to wake up about an hour earlier than those with GG, and the AGs wake up almost exactly in the middle. They also showed that those with the AA or AG genotype died just before 11am on average, but those with the GG genotype tended to die at just before 6pm. The study’s lead author Andrew Lim, from the Department of Neurology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, said: ‘The internal “biological clock” regulates many aspects of human biology and behaviour. It also influences the timing of acute medical events like stroke and heart attack.’ Clifford Saper, chief of neurology at BIDMC, said: ‘So there is really a gene that predicts the time of day that you’ll die. Not the date, fortunately, but the time of day.’","US team investigating development of Parkinson's .

"Praise: Sharon Kaur was praised for her work when she met Prime Minister David Cameron at Downing Street on the 16th April 2012 . An award-winning businesswoman feted by David Cameron and George Osborne at Downing Street faces charges of assaulting her own sister in front of astonished shoppers. Sharon Kaur allegedly attacked her younger sister Kulvinder by grabbing her hair from behind, spitting at her and clawing at her face, in what court papers term ‘a beating’. She will appear before magistrates tomorrow accused of assault. The alleged attack, which left divorcee Kulvinder, 37, battered and bruised, took place outside an O2 mobile phone shop in Ilford, East London, just a few miles from her home. As onlookers gathered round, Ms Kaur is said to have run into the crowd, leaving her sister behind. High-profile entrepreneur Ms Kaur, 46, runs the Sahara Homes care home empire with former West Ham FC chairman Terence Brown. She is managing director of the company she built from scratch, which focuses on people with learning disabilities. Ms Kaur visited Mr Cameron in No10 two years ago, along with other members of the Sikh community. A year earlier, she was pictured with Chancellor George Osborne at another Sikh community gathering. She was named Businesswoman of the Year at the 2007 Asian Women of Achievement Awards, attended by Cherie Blair and presented by Liz Hurley. Ms Kaur is highly respected in the Sikh community for extensive charity work, including a five-day trek in the Sahara, which raised more than £12,000 for a children’s hospice in East London. Of Indian-Punjabi descent, Ms Kaur was born in Huddersfield and was raised in a pub owned by her mother. She . left school at 15, but later studied for a media degree while working . as a dress designer. She went on to appear in an Indian version of The X . Factor for TV’s Sikh Channel.

"PLEASE, MR POSTMAN by Alan Johnson (Bantam £16.99) One day in June 1969, a young couple from London took the train to Slough where they had been offered a council house. Seeing two policemen, they asked if they could direct them to the Britwell estate. ‘We should do, we have to go there often enough,’ replied one. His colleague added he would not live there ‘for all the tea in China.’ When the pair finally found the house, passing huge ‘Keep Britwell White’ grafitti, their two-bedroom property had boarded-up windows and an overgrown garden. The second volume of Labour politician Alan Johnson's memoir follows him from teenage postman married to a single mother four years his senior through to national union official . It was an inauspicious start to married life. But for Alan Johnson, raised in grinding poverty, it was an offer he grasped with gratitude. ‘We would make the Britwell estate our home,’ he writes. ‘Life there was good.’ He recalled how his mother spent her life in barely habitable slums, dreaming of the day she had her own front door — only to be finally offered a council house two weeks after her early death, when he was just 13. The estate provides a backdrop for the second volume of the Labour politician’s memoirs, in which he goes from teenage postman married to a single mother four years his senior through to national union official — and marital separation — two decades later. A young Alan when he was General Secretary of the Communication Workers Union . Like his acclaimed first volume This Boy, this is named after a Beatles song and beautifully written, a series of affectionate anecdotes and vividly observed sketches that conjure up a recent age slipped into the past. This time it is the Seventies and early Eighties, working in a public service barely changed over the previous century. Postmen — and they were all men when he started — wore traditional uniforms, were often ex-forces and central figures in their communities. He and his colleagues fed cats for owners on holiday, delivered magazines after surreptitiously reading them first and ate hearty breakfasts at farms during their round. Meanwhile, they relied heavily on overtime and Spanish practices to boost pay packets. This is another elegiac slice of social history, conjuring up the days when drink driving was rife, postal workers saw the fax machine as a threat to their future and drivers had to ‘double declutch’ their clunky vans. So different were society’s attitudes the young couple gave a false wedding date to their new neighbours since his wife ‘didn’t want anyone to know that she had been pregnant when we married’. Abandoning ambitions of pop stardom after his guitar is stolen, the author educates himself by listening to the radio and reading — including a quality newspaper he hides at work ‘as if it were a pornographic magazine’. For all its easy charm, this is a less compelling saga than Johnson’s story of his tough childhood in post-war London slums. There is too much detail of postal shift patterns and rather dreary union politics. Yet Please, Mr Postman is still a first-class delivery, head and shoulders above most political memoirs with its self-deprecating style. ‘They dressed scruffy but talked posh. We dressed posh but talked scruffy,’ he says on meeting some middle-class militants. Alan aged eight. He writes movingly about being raised in poverty . By far the most moving chapter is about his sister’s husband Mike — ‘the kindest, gentlest, most decent man I’d ever known’ — who was a secret alcoholic, and killed himself in the basement of the shop where he worked. Johnson idolised his brother-in-law, who arrived in his life shortly before his mother’s death. ‘The tears I found it so hard to shed when my mother died have poured down my face a hundred times for Mike and for the awful, tragic end to his short life.’ It is indeed a tragic tale with Mike’s drinking — stashes of vodka hidden in the garage and garden shed — spiralling out of control amid worries over his job. Then Alan’s beloved and big-hearted sister crumbles into delayed depression during a summer holiday in Wales and he is needed to support the sister who for so long supported him. Then there is the subtle way this ‘militant moderate’ handles his political awakening. He admits to having no idea when he became interested in politics, yet his evolution emerges in a series of revelatory vignettes. These begin with a snooker-playing colleague who worked during a strike and was sent to Coventry. ‘In the canteen he would rise from the breakfast table hopefully, snooker cue in hand, but nobody would play against him.’ After five months Johnson left, during which no one ever spoke to this poor man. ‘For all I know his isolation lasted until his retirement,’ he writes. ‘I colluded in trying to break a man’s spirit and it’s something I’ve been ashamed of ever since.’ He watched as Labour politics turned nasty amid the hard-left takeover, saw through the posturing of Tony Benn, rejects the chance to buy his council house and uses a telephone on the desk of his union’s general secretary to symbolise the Thatcherite new order. His predecessor showed him this special white phone and said it was a hotline for ministers and senior civil servants seeking the general secretary’s opinion on crucial affairs of state. But during this beleaguered union baron’s decade at the helm, the phone only rang once. ‘The caller had been a woman asking if this was Sainsbury’s.’ Alan with now leader of the Labour Party Ed Miliband at a press conference in Westminster. Alan writes about having seen through the posturing of certain politicians such as Tony Benn during his long and varied career. The memoir ends with Johnson parting from his wife and driving away from Britwell after 19 years ‘keeping my eyes firmly fixed on the road ahead’.","This is the second volume of Labour politician Alan Johnson's memoir .

"Beauty is usually seen as a blessing. But for some, it would seem, it can be a curse. Laura Fernee says her good looks are so powerful they are ruining her life – and have forced her to quit her job. The 33-year-old science graduate says her slim figure and pretty face attracted unwanted attention from her male colleagues. Scroll down for video . Laura Fernee quit her job saying she is too pretty to work as she receives unwanted attention . She also claims she has been ostracised by other women in the workplace who are jealous of her beauty. Miss Fernee now lives off her wealthy parents after quitting her £30,000 job in scientific research two years ago. She said her appearance meant she was constantly harassed and bullied, and has decided work ‘just isn’t for her’. Yesterday, she said: ‘I’m not lazy and I’m no bimbo. The truth is my good looks have caused massive problems for me when it comes to employment, so I’ve made the decision that employment just isn’t for me at the moment. It’s not my fault … I can’t help the way I look. Laura said she didn't get the acknowledgement she deserved for her scientific achievements as people only paid attention to her looks . ‘Male colleagues were only interested in me for how I looked. I wanted them to recognise my achievements and my  professionalism but all they saw was my face and body.’ She said men left ‘romantic gifts’ on her desk and she was ‘constantly asked out’, which she found ‘sleazy’. ‘Even when I was in a laboratory in scrubs with no make-up they still came on to me because of my natural attractiveness. There was nothing I could do to stop it,’ she added. She now lives off her parents who pay for her £2000-a-month Notting Hill flat . Miss Fernee studied science and medical . research to doctorate level and began working in a laboratory in 2008. But she said she was forced to quit three years later because of the . treatment she received. She said: ‘They [other women] assumed . because I was pretty, I was stupid, so didn’t take me seriously at . first and, because of their own insecurities, were jealous of my looks. ‘Then when they realised I was very good at my job, possibly better than them, they hated me even more.’ Miss . Fernee’s parents – Catherine, 65, and Alan, 70 – inherited money from . Laura’s grandfather, and now pay £2,000 a month in rent and bills for . her flat in Notting Hill, London, as well as picking up her credit card . payments. her parents also pay for her credit cards, and £1,700-per-month for her designer clothes and handbags . She says that despite her reluctance to work, she is not 'lazy' and 'no bimbo' They also shell out £1,500 a month for her designer clothes, shoes and handbags, and £700 on haircuts. Miss Fernee pays £80 a week to work out at the gym and spends £1,000 a month on socialising. She said her critics were ‘underestimating just what a curse good looks can be in the workplace’.","Laura Fernee says her good looks are so powerful they are ruining her life .

"A Satanic cult has been blamed for the sickening death of a pony, which was found horrifically mutilated and laying in the remnants of a ring of fire after full moon. Police are investigating after the young male had its genitals, right ear and tongue sliced off, and eyes gouged out. It is thought the animal may have been alive when the atrocities were committed. Its belly was hacked open and the young pony also had traces of white paint on one of its legs, suggesting it was killed as part of a bizarre ceremony. GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING . Sickening: The body of this two-month-old foal was found horrifically mutilated and there are fears it is the work of Satanists . It was also surrounded by circular patches of burnt moorland, which experts believe were left by a ring of torches or candles. The two-month old pony seemed to have been dragged into a clearing and placed at the foot of a slope to face the previous night’s full moon. It was found on Tuesday morning by a horse rider at Yennadon Down, a remote, area of Devon National Park. Animal welfare officers are investigating and police have appealed to the public to be extra vigilant. Horse carers believe the butchery was part of an evil occult or ceremony by Devil worshippers. Dartmoor’s Livestock Protection Officer . Karla McKechnie said: 'We do get strange things happening from time to time, normally when its a full moon. 'I’ve come across strange circles in the ground, boulders used as altars, that sort of thing, but thankfully animal mutilations are rare. Cult: The foal was found surrounded by patches of burnt grass, suggesting candles had been lit during the ritual. It also had white paint of one of its legs . 'I suspect its witches or devil worshippers but it’s always hard to get to the bottom of it. 'My main concern is how someone has been able to walk up to a foal and kill it in the middle of the night.I’m almost certain more than one person was involved.' South West Equine Protection's Jenny Thornton believed Dartmoor ponies had become so used to being fed by humans they were now easy targets. She said: 'I’ve seen plenty of dead animals but this was horrendous. Clues: Marks on the ground including burnt patches of ground suggest it was the work of Satanists . 'The belly has been sliced open. It’s a boy and its genitals had been cut off. The tongue had been pulled out and his eyes are missing. 'There have always been rumours of animal sacrifices and sheep have been found dead in the past,often around the time of a full moon. 'All we can be absolutely certain of is that someone has caused unnecessary suffering to an animal, possibly severe suffering if it was still alive at the time.' Easy target: Experts believe ponies have become so used to humans they are vulnerable to this sort of attack. Pictured here, the foal's mother . Dartmoor and the surrounding countryside in Devon and Cornwall has been dogged by rumours of Satanic rituals for years. In 2012 a two-year-old horse called Eric belonging to Dawn Jewell, 27, was found mutilated on the day of satanic animal sacrifice. He was found dead in his field in Stithians, near Falmouth, Cornwall, after a full moon with his right eye gouged out, his teeth removed and his genitalia hacked off. Remote: The dead foal was found in Yennadon Down by a rider on Tuesday. An investigation into its grisly end is underway . The horrific attack happened on St Winebald Day, a date in the satanic calendar traditionally celebrated with bloody rituals. In 2006 around 100 sheep animals were found slaughtered with their tongues, eyes and sexual organs removed on Dartmoor. The bodies had been arranged in a Satanic star shape, known as a pentangle, or laid out in a circle with their necks broken. In June of this year police appealed for information after two horses were found with 'gaping' knife wounds in neighbouring fields in the village of Stokeinteignhead, Devon. Locals feared the two thoroughbred were attacked to mark the summer solstice, a key date in the Satanic calender.","Genitals, ear and tongue sliced during what is thought to be a satanic ritual .

"Professor Gennadiji Raivich, 51, who ran a 'one stop shop' insemination service is alleged to have assaulted three women desperate to be mothers . A neuroscientist who claimed to have fathered 58 children while running a 'one stop shop' insemination service preyed on three women desperate to become mothers by sexually assaulting them, a court was told. Professor Gennadij Raivich, 51, a perinatal neuroscientist at University College London, carried out home visits to women across the country - allegedly assaulting three of them during the insemination process. The academic from Holborn, London, told one victim she had to repeatedly perform oral sex on him to obtain the sperm samples, Blackfriars Crown Court heard. Raivich, who sometimes went by the pseudonym Frank Qualman, is also alleged to have told one woman her chances of becoming pregnant were increased if she orgasmed during the insemination process. The man would take a . 'donation kit' containing a DVD player - which he watched pornography . on - rubber gloves, a speculum and pipette to his visits, jurors heard. Raivich is only qualified as a doctor in Germany, has never practiced medicine in the UK and is not . registered with the General Medical Council, the prosecution said. His . service did not conform to the guidelines of the Human Fertilisation . and Embryology Authority, . the court was told. Raivich has pleaded not guilty to . assault by digital penetration in relation to the first victim, one count . of assault by penetration and sexual assault against another, and two counts of assault by penetration and two . counts of sexual assault on  a third. He . also denies two counts of sexual assault against the third woman on . January 31 last year and assault by penetration on the same date. The court heard how all the alleged victims heard about Raivich's service via an internet forum. Prosecutor Tom Wilkins said: 'Each . complainant in this case is a woman who met the defendant through an . internet forum dedicated to sperm donation. 'He provided a one stop shop for women who wanted semen. All were desperate to have a baby.' 'The defendant met these women in order to inseminate them. 'He took advantage of their desperation, his anonymity and informality by committing various types of sexual assaults upon them.' 'On the websites he advertises his . services as a sperm doner and represents himself as a: ‘Medical doctor . based in Central London’ providing a service called Intra-Cervical . Insemination or ICI.' The . first victim saw Raivich on February 27, 2012 when 'wholly gratuitously . and without warning' assaulted her the jury were told. 'Such was her desperation to have a baby she returned ten times to his Russell Square address.' Blackfriars Crown Court heard how Raivich told one alleged victim she had to give him oral sex repeatedly in order to get a sperm sample. He told another she was more likely to get pregnant if she orgasmed during the insemination process, the court heard . He persuaded his second victim to give him oral sex so he could provide the sample - a service that he called: 'Artificial Insemination Plus'. The prosecutor continued: 'She says she was faced with the ultimatum that unless she performed oral sex on him she would not get a donation. She was desperate for a baby and agreed.' Raivich also groped her between her legs during the sessions. Mr Wilkins continued: 'He told her an orgasm would help her conceive. 'She told him three or four times not to touch her there, but he went ahead regardless and now he says he can’t recall stimulating her in this way. 'He was not the altruistic donor, but someone who is sexually-motivated. 'She was desperate for a baby and returned a week later for a donation in return for performing oral sex on him and felt she had to put up with it, she had been trying for a baby for a year.' The third victim was visited by Raivich at her home in Great Yarmouth and on the second occasion sexually assaulted her, jurors heard. 'He lifted up her t-shirt and groped her breasts. He says he checked her breasts to test her fertility.' The trial continues.

"One of Shakespeare's greatest plays has received perhaps its most radical transformation ever after it was adapted into a hip-hop opera - and performed in a jail. The story of Othello has been 'remixed' by the Chicago Shakespeare Theater, who have attempted to update the Elizabeth tale of a valiant Moor deceived by the villainous Iago into believing his wife has been unfaithful. Four actors in denim overalls and baseball caps rap their way through the epic tragedy with lines such as: 'Othello never knew, He was getting schemed on by a member of his crew.' Scroll down for video of the performance . Othello the Remix: A contemporary rapping version of Shakespeare's Othello has been performed to inmates at Cook County Jail, in Chicago . That's how Shakespeare told the story 400 years ago. Othello: The Remix, performed this week for about 450 inmates of Cook County jail - the largest jail in the U.S. - is a rhyming, rapping, poetic homage to the Bard. It has singing and dancing, comic touches, men playing women, sexual talk, references to Eddie Murphy and James Brown, and a throbbing beat, courtesy of an on-stage DJ. And a contemporary plot: MC Othello is a self-made rap star turned music mogul comparable to the likes of Jay-Z who decides to promote Cassio, a middle-of-the-road rapper, by releasing his next album. That infuriates the more edgy MC Iago, who vows revenge. 'This is why I hate the Moor,' he fumes. 'He never lets me get my foot in the door.' Desdemona is not seen, but heard, her ethereal golden pipes occasionally filling the air. The Remix version has already been performed in England, South Korea and Chicago. It was originally commissioned by Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, London . The Othello remix is the brainchild of two Chicago brothers and rappers - GQ and JQ, aka Gregory and Jeffrey Qaiyum. They wrote and directed the show, honing 40 or so drafts over eight months into a 75-minute rhyme-a-thon. It's their third hip-hop translation of Shakespeare, following 'The Bomb-itty of Errors' and 'Funk It Up About Nothin'. This new Othello - originally commissioned by the Globe Theatre - has been performed in England, South Korea and Chicago. Taking the play behind bars, the brothers expected the inmates would apply themes written four centuries ago to their own lives today. 'The story of Othello and the way we paint it is very much of an outsider who kind of never feels like he's at home and I think that will be pretty relatable,' JQ said before the show. '[It] really comes down to choices and repercussions and often times, poor choices. I can't imagine that some people in there are not going to feel that.' Audience participation: Inmates danced in their seats while watching rappers perform the hip hop adaptation of William Shakespeare's Othello . At one point inmate Kristy Montgomery, centre, cheered from her seat while watching the performance . He also pointed to the show's last words: 'In a cold, dark and unforgiving system we struggle with our destiny. When the world is crumbling, emerge from the rubble and your love will surely set you free.' Watching the inmates applaud and laugh in the sweltering gym, Rick Boynton, the show's creative producer, said he quickly knew the play had struck a chord. Othello 'listened to forces outside himself that made him do really unspeakable acts,' he said. 'At the end of the play he says, ""Look what happened and heed my advice."" I think the tension and the resonance of that theme in the room were incredible.' Kristy Montgomery, a 29-year-old inmate, agreed. She came away from the play believing it had an important message:'Be careful of who you affiliate . yourself with because they might not actually be your friends. They . might be somebody who wants to bring you down.' Brothers and rappers JQ and GQ, aka Gregory and Jeffrey Qaium, wrote, directed and acted in their hip hop adaptation . Rapper Postell Pringle, pictured, performed Shakespeare's tragedy to  about 450 inmates with his rapper co-stars . She said she would try and remember the lesson, 'because I befriend the wrong people all the time.' Julian Campbell, 19, who swayed with the beat as Iago danced his way down the aisle, found his own meaning in the story. He said it offered two lessons: 'Be honest. Always think before you do.' And Kevin Fields, a third inmate, also 19, saw the play as a cautionary tale. 'You can't affect what other people do but you can affect what you do,' he said. The show was an eye-opener in another way: 'In hip-hop,' he added, 'I finally found out what Shakespeare really is.' So it is really Shakespeare when Othello briefly dons a blond wig and joins a faux backup girl singing group a la Motown to belt out It's a Man's World? And are lines such as 'Othello wouldn't listen, He had crazy tunnel vision' a true reflection of the Bard's greatness? Absolutely, GQ said. Versatile: The four men took on every role in the play, at times wearing wigs and dresses . Tragedy: The basic storyline of the Shakespeare classic remains the same, a story of love that doesn't end well . 'Shakespeare was a master storyteller who used musical language and poetry,' he said, and the same is true of the best rappers. 'So at the very basic level they're doing the exact same thing. You're using poetic devices like alliteration and repetition and onomatopoeia. They're very similar art forms despite how different they tend to be judged.' The Q brothers say they have chatted with Shakespeare scholars and others who arrive at their shows skeptical and leave impressed. 'We're treating the work with respect and we think he was a genius,' GQ said. 'But our philosophy is you want to live on as an art form 500 years later, you can't do it the same way.' Rapper GQ, aka Gregory Qaiyum (pictured) said there was little difference between their play and the original: ""..at the very basic level they're doing the exact same thing... using poetic devices like alliteration and repetition and onomatopoeia.... They're very similar art forms despite how different they tend to be judged.' After the 70-minute performance the actors, who are all rappers and DJs, took questions from the audience . In fact, GQ says, if Shakespeare were around nowadays, 'I think he'd be doing this. He'd be a rapper.' The Q brothers are now working on a hip-hop version of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol and plan to eventually create hip-hop translations of all of Shakespeare's works, including 'A Mad-Summer Night's Dream.' They not only admire the Bard, they also think their words measure up to his standards. 'Without trying to sound like we're tooting our own horn,' GQ says, 'I would like to think that at our best moments it's like seeing great Shakespeare in his time.'","Othello: The Remix has been performed in rap to Cook County Jail inmates .

"Killed: 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco was allegedly beaten to death by her boyfriend using a baseball bat . A pregnant woman who was beaten to death by her boyfriend who assaulted with a baseball bat has died, but not before giving birth to a baby girl. Police say 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco, who was originally from Mexico, was pronounced dead on Wednesday morning after being violently assaulted at her trailer park home in Delaware. Miss Polanco was found by paramedics and died just hours later from her injuries. Before she died, she gave birth to a baby girl who was born three months premature. The newborn is listed in critical but stable condition at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware. Police were called to the home in the Waterford Trailer Park after paramedics found the woman unconscious inside the home. Investigators claim Paula's injuries were caused  by 24-year-old Fernando Flores who assaulted her. Flores was arrested that same day and charged with assault, although the charges have now been elevated to that of manslaughter. He is now in the Howard R. Young Correctional Institution awaiting trial.

They have set up a page which they also hope will help to raise some funds to help care for her  newborn baby girl which the family will now look after. So far the page has raised $1,095. The fundraising page reads: 'Paola Eden Delagado Polanco was a young thriving girl and full of life, with charming simplicity and humility. 'She died October 29 at her 21 years as a victim of domestic violence. Paola was six months pregnant, and by a miracle the baby survived. God has plans for all of us and Paola is now in the kingdom of heaven with our Heavenly Father. She was beautiful, but her inner beauty was far more radiant than her physical attractiveness. 'We urge support for funeral expenses and to send her body to rest in her home town of Puente de Camotlan Nayarit, Mexico. We also ask for your help in the expenses for her premature baby girl who has a long journey ahead of her.

A man suspected of gunning down three Royal Canadian Mounted Police was caught and charged Friday, ending a 30-hour manhunt that closed schools and forced residents to hide inside their homes of this eastern Canadian city. 'I'm done,' a witness heard him say to police. Police said at a news conference that they received a tip that led them to a wooded residential part of Moncton, New Brunswick, where they found 24-year-old Justin Bourque, suspected in the deadliest attack on Canada's national police force in nearly a decade. Suspect: Justin Bourque, pictured, has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder . Constables David Ross, 32, Fabrice Georges Gevaudan, 45, and Douglas James Larche, 40, were killed in the shooting. Armed with high-powered long firearms, Bourque was spotted three times Thursday as he evaded the manhunt that all but shut down the normally tranquil city about of about 60,000 people east of the Maine border. Nearly 300 police officers searched for Bourque, who was seen going in and out of a wooded area. RCMP Supt. Marlene Snowman said Bourque was arrested at 12:10 a.m. She said he wasn't carrying any weapons, but some were found nearby. Prosecutors and police declined to comment when asked if the guns were acquired legally. Bourque turned himself over without incident. Bearded and shaggy-haired, Bourque made a brief court appearance Friday afternoon, where he was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder. In aqua-colored jail clothes, he stared ahead intently, clearly paying attention but showing little emotion. He nodded when the judge said his name. He will be back in court July 3 as he seeks a lawyer. A court appointed legal aid attorney represented him Friday. Prosecutors say they were not requesting a psychiatric evaluation, seeing no need for one. The defence agreed. There was a high-level security at the appearance, including officers with drawn weapons outside the courtroom. Two other officers - Constables Éric Stéphane Dubois and Marie Darlene Goguen - were injured in the shootings and rushed to a local hospital for surgery but neither condition was life-threatening.","Thousands of mourners attended funerals for three Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers killed last week .

"All she wanted was a city break and a fish supper. But yesterday the dolphin that took a detour to Chester by swimming up the River Dee got a timely lift home – after a spot of unplanned sunbathing. The 6ft short-beaked common dolphin was rescued after her sojourn ended with her stranded on a sandbank in the morning sun. A disorientated dolphin has been given a lift back to sea in a lifeboat after being spotted 30 miles inland . Davina the Dolphin was seen frolicking in the River Dee at Chester where it became a tourist attraction . RNLI lifeboat was called and the crew gently hoisted the friendly mammal into their inflatable and took it out to sea . Rescuers heaved her into a special stretcher aboard an inshore lifeboat and carried her six miles out to sea. There . – with a flick of her tail and to cheers from the crew – she headed off . safely into the distance, presumably in search of the pod she abandoned . for an unscheduled excursion on Monday. The . rescue ended days of excitement along a nine-mile stretch of the Dee as . Dave (as she was inappropriately christened) treated crowds to a . display of leaping and trademark ‘clicking’ sounds rarely encountered so . close to a city centre.

"There is a bar in the labyrinth of alleyways around Las Ramblas that is named in honour of the famous Barcelona youth academy, La Masia. On Friday night, it was packed tight with Barca fans and locals watching Getafe play Espanyol on the old television set fixed high on a wall in a corner. It was bedecked with Barcelona memorabilia, its walls plastered with team posters celebrating the glories of the last decade, pictures from Wembley after the Champions League triumph of 2011 and from Yokohama, later that year, when Barca won the Club World Cup. Luis Suarez buries his head in the netting as Barcelona lose against Malaga without managing to score . Barcelona forward Lionel Messi could not inspire them to win against Malaga on Saturday in La Liga . Malaga's striker Juanmi Jimenez (left) celebrates after scoring the goal that defeat Barca at the Nou Camp . Manuel Pellegrini will have been delighted to see the way that Barcelona struggled on Saturday afternoon . And by the door, there was a drawing of Barack Obama. ‘Crisis?’ he was saying from a speech bubble. ‘Calm down. There’s nothing to see here.’ Until Saturday, it seemed to fit the mood. Barcelona were supposed to be in meltdown around the turn of the year, with rumours of a schism between Lionel Messi and new coach Luis Enrique. But they had recovered spectacularly, winning their last 11 games in succession and scoring 23 times in their previous five league games. Everyone thought the old Barca were back. The general assumption was that Saturday’s match against Malaga at Camp Nou would bring victory as a formality and act as a prelude to crushing Manchester City in the Champions League round of 16 for a second consecutive year. The Catalan newspapers were unanimous about what the match against Malaga would yield: three points to take Barcelona back to the top of La Liga by leap-frogging Real Madrid and a hat-trick from Messi to lift him above Cristiano Ronaldo in the battle to be el pichichi, the league’s leading scorer. But things didn’t go to plan. Barcelona lost 1-0, their first home defeat since a November 1 defeat by Celta Vigo, and the air of confidence that had surrounded their visit to the Etihad Stadium for the first leg of their tie on Tuesday evaporated. So forget the speech bubble in the La Masia bar. Every defeat is a crisis here. And now there is something to see. Now, pleas for calm will go unheard and City and their fans will feel fresh hope that this is, indeed, a Barcelona side incapable of scaling the heights of old.

Barcelona's Messi looks on dejected after Juanmi's goal put visitors Malaga ahead in the first half . Suarez writhes around in agony as his side searched for a response to get back into the game . Gerard Pique (right) is at full stretch in an attempt to keep the ball in play during Saturday's La Liga clash . When the final whistle sounded on Saturday afternoon, the Barcelona players headed straight down the tunnel as the club hymn blared from the loudspeaker system, doing its best to drown out the chorus of whistles from the crowd. By then, there were swathes of empty blue and red seats all around the cavernous bowl of the Nou Camp. All the uncertainties, all the fears that had assailed them earlier in the season had come flooding back. Barcelona were desperately poor. They looked listless, unsettled, agitated and bereft of ideas against Malaga, who had chances to add to the winning goal scored by Juanmi in the seventh minute. Luis Suarez, who has been showing signs of overcoming the disappointing start to his career here since his £70m summer move from Liverpool, was close to anonymous again, noticed only on the multiple occasions he was caught offside. Tuesday’s tie will mark his first return to England since the leaving of Liverpool and he is a figure much reduced. At Anfield, he was larger than life. He was the biggest story in town, the team’s most talented player and the man the fans looked to for inspiration. It is different here. He is in the shadow of another now. Not just Messi but Neymar, too, and he is finding it hard to adapt. Maybe a visit to England will give him a fresh burst of bloody-minded motivation. Suarez was brilliant in England but he looks like a figure much reduced in Spain with his new club . The Suarez that City will face at the Etihad on Tuesday is a different prospect to the one at Liverpool . Neymar struggled, too, and even Messi failed to make an impression. Stuck out wide on the right, he curled in a few sumptuous crosses but they either sailed just too high or were headed clear by Malaga’s massed defence. City will have been encouraged by the defensive vulnerability exhibited by Tuesday’s opponents, too. Juanmi’s goal came courtesy of a shocking defensive error by Dani Alves and, with better finishing, Malaga would have capitalised on several swift counter-attacks. Barcelona may be a different side in Manchester this week but City showed them way too much respect in the first leg at the Etihad last season. Saturday's game provided ample encouragement for them to be more ambitious this time. This is not the Barcelona of old. This is not a team capable of dominating European football as they once did. Their crown has been slipping for some time, as anyone who recalls their Champions League annihilation by Bayern Munich will know. This is a team trapped in the tortures of transition. If Madrid win at Elche today, they will go four points clear of Barcelona at the top of La Liga, adding to the feeling that the energy and the vigour in La Liga resides with them. When Cristiano Ronaldo usurped Messi as the world’s best player by retaining Fifa’s Ballon d’Or award this year, it was another sign of the shift in power. Messi leaves the pitch dejected after a poor showing as he failed to make an impression out wide . Neymar was also off the boil and struggled, which can only be a good thing for the English champions . A fin de siècle feeling seems to be settling over the Nou Camp. It was beautiful while it lasted but the great side moulded by Pep Guardiola is breaking up. Xavi, Barcelona’s great general, turned 35 a few weeks ago. Tiki-taka is passé, superseded by the power and pace of Bayern Munich and Real. The zeitgeist has moved on. Messi is still a magician, of course. Paul Scholes wrote in his newspaper column last week that ‘it is never a bad day when you can watch one of the best footballers ever pull on a pair of boots’ and, of course, he is right. It is still a privilege to watch Messi play. Even on days like Saturday, some of his touches and some of his passing was sublime. But even he looked fretful. Individually, Messi, Neymar and Suarez are three of the best players in the world. As a forward line, though, they look like an awkward fit. While Barcelona were struggling, City were handing out a pasting to Newcastle in the Premier League . David Silva scored twice to add to goals from Sergio Aguero, Samir Nasri and Edin Dzeko at the Etihad . Paul Scholes wrote in his newspaper column this week: ‘It is never a bad day when you can watch one of the best footballers ever pull on a pair of boots’ It is nine years ago on Sunday that Messi first impressed himself on the wider English consciousness when he produced a scintillating performance in a Barcelona Champions League victory against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. The Chelsea left-back, Asier del Horno, was sent off for kicking Messi into the air near the corner flag in the first half, which brought forth accusations of play-acting from Jose Mourinho, still in his first coming as Chelsea manager. Chelsea left back Asier del Horno kicks Messi into the air at Stamford Bridge nine years ago on Sunday . Del Horno was sent off by referee Terje Hauge for the challenge and Messi was labelled a 'dirty dog' But the Argentine produced a scintillating performance, although he did not manage to score . Messi, for the crime of being hacked by opposing defenders, was assailed by the wrath of one newspaper in particular. ‘You Dirty Dog Messi,’ its headline read. Messi has been making headlines ever since. The world has been unable to take its eyes off him as he has become one of the greatest players in the history of the game. The feeling here is that, for all their stars, Barcelona are more dependent upon him than they have ever been. If they are to stave off further decline, if they are to quell fresh talk of crisis, he will have to be at his very best on Tuesday night in Manchester because, after Saturday, City will smell blood. Last season City were knocked out by Barcelona in the Champions League at the last-16 stage . City had players sent off in both legs, here it's Martin Demichelis in the first leg who sees red from the ref . Pablo Zabaleta (not in shot) was then sent of at the Nou Camp as Manchester's sky blue side went out .","Barcelona surprisingly lost 1-0 to Malaga at the Nou Camp on Saturday .

"The world's largest television set, which measures 110 from corner to corner and is four times sharper than a high-definition TV, was today put on sale by Samsung. The company launched the monster screen in South Korea, priced at 160million won, or around £100,000. It achieves achieves its precise picture - which has been compared to looking through a window - through U-HDTV (Ultra-High Definition Television) technology, which packs in four times as many pixels per inch as current high-definition sets. Scroll down for video . Huge: The giant set was put on sale today by Samsung in South Korea . Sharp: The screen, which is as large as a king-sized bed, packs in four times as many pixels per inch as a current high-definition set . The exclusive device, which is 102 inches wide and 70 inches tall, is bigger than a king-sized bed, and will also be sold in China, the Middle East and Europe. Samsung said they have received ten orders from the Middle East already, though Chinese buyers are expected to snap up the largest portion of the sets. The new model dwarfs the size of the former largest Samsung U-HDTV, which measured 85 inches. They replace the previously-touted OLED technology, which Samsung and rivals LG were last year promoting as the future technology. But the specially-treated LED bulbs were deemed to expensive for the huge screens, and both manufacturers have now embraced U-HDTV. Gargantuan: The TV was also put on display in Berlin at a trade show in September . According to NPD DisplaySearch, global sales of ultra-HD TV sets will surge from 1.3 million this year to 23 million in 2017. They predict that more than half of the shipments will be taken by Chinese companies between 2013 and 2017. The Samsung TV was unveiled at a trade fair in Berlin this September. At the event, Michael Zoeller, the company's senior director of European sales and marketing, said the screen is so big that when watching sports, individual players would appear almost life-size to viewers. ‘This looks stunning. The screen in nearly 2.5 metres across,’ he said. Consumer electronics expert Barry Fox also praised the new set. He said: ‘The pictures are mind-blowing, it is like looking through a window.'","The giant screen is larger than a king-sized bed and uses U-HDTV technology .

"Next week a ‘blood moon’ will be visible across large parts of parts of North America. On Wednesday morning at 6:25am Eastern time the moon will pass into Earth’s shadow, making it appear red. The event will last about an hour and, owing to the moon’s position in its orbit, will be 5.3 per cent larger than the previous blood moon on 15 April. A red moon will be visible in parts of the world including the US next week. The event is known as a 'blood moon' (stock image shown) owing to the red colour of the moon. It occurs when the moon passes in to the shadow of Earth called the umbra . The event is the second in a sequence of four blood moons called a tetrad, which occur in six-month intervals. The next will happen on 4 April 2015 and the last on 28 September 2015. For the latest blood moon the moment of greatest eclipse will occur at 6:54am Eastern time, after starting at 6:25am, while the eclipse lasts a total of 59 minutes - ending at 7:53am. A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the Sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it makes it appear red. This gives rise to its ‘blood red’ appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. Owing to the orientation of the moon the southern half will appear much darker than the northern half because it will lie deeper in Earth’s shadow. It will be most visible in the northwestern third of America, where all stages can be witnessed. Farther east in the US, various phases will occur after moonset. None of the eclipse will be visible from Europe, Africa or the Middle East though. It's not often that we get a chance to see our planet's shadow, but a lunar eclipse gives us a brief glimpse. During these rare events, the full Moon rapidly darkens and then glows red . It will be most visible in the northwestern third of America (illustration shown), where all stages can be witnessed. Farther east in the US, various phases will occur after moonset. None of the eclipse will be visible from Europe, Africa or the Middle East though . At the eclipse's peak the moon will enter the Earth's full shadow, the umbra. At this stage, the Earth's atmosphere will scatter the sun's red visible light, the same process that turns the sky red at sunset. As a result, the red light will reflect off the moon's surface, casting a reddish rust hue over it. Although there are four lunar eclipses in fairly close proximity, the event is not that common. On average there are two eclipses a year but some are penumbral - which means the moon only passes through the outer portion of Earth’s shadow - so the effect is much less noticeable. And other eclipses see just a shadow cast on the moon with no red effect. This ‘blood’ appearance comes from the refraction of the sun’s light through Earth’s atmosphere – much like what is seen at a sunset or sunrise. Eclipses do not follow any particular pattern though, so getting four ‘blood moons’ in a row is rare.

"Author RJ Ellory, pictured, has been accused of using pseudonyms to try to remove negative stories on his Wikipedia page . It is not the first time crime writer RJ Ellory has used fake identities to shape his reputation. And now the author has been accused of using pseudonyms to try to remove negative stories on his Wikipedia page. The 47-year-old has been banned from editing on the site after he tried to delete the stories from his biography. Volunteers for the online encyclopedia became suspicious amid accusations that the integrity of the profile had been compromised. Officials declared he had breached its 'self promotion' rules and banned him after finding that he had tried to delete stories as well as links to Telegraph.co.uk. Mr Ellory, whose full name is Roger Jon Ellory, said, as reported by the Daily Telegraph, the coverage of his actions was 'a significant matter of misrepresentation' and that stories had 'blown (it) out of all proportion'. It comes not long after the author, who wrote A Quiet Belief in Angels and A Simple Act of Violence, was exposed for writing fake glowing reviews about his work online, while simultaneously criticising his rivals. He admitted using fake identities to write about his work on Amazon, giving himself five-star ratings. The father-of-one, who won crime . novel of the year in 2010, appeared to have used at least two fake . identities to rave about his writing on the site. Following the revelation he repeatedly apologised to his fans and rivals, saying in a statement that he regretted the 'lapse of judgment'. In the weeks after he was exposed, . Ellory took to his Wikipedia page to amend the wording of a 'controversy . paragraph' and the newspaper links which gave 'completely the wrong . bias on his issue'. When challenged he admitted he had written his biography and said he was confused about the policy and questioned why he was not able to delete 'potentially libellous statements' about his work, which he said were 'grossly unfair, unjust and biased'. In the weeks after he was exposed, Ellory took to his Wikipedia page to amend the wording of a 'controversy paragraph', pictured . He told the Wikipedia moderators, as reported by the Daily Telegraph: 'My intent was merely to see that the information on my page - which is, after all, a representation of me and my life to the wider world, was not biased, inappropriate, incorrect and false.' In September it was revealed that posting as ‘Jelly Bean' on Amazon, he wrote that his novel A Quiet Belief in Angels was ‘one of the most moving books I’ve ever read'. He . continued: ‘It is so beautifully written I felt as though it enabled me . to be a part of that era even though that can never actually happen. 'I would highly recommend this book to anyone who really wants to experience a class read.’ He also appears to have been posting as ‘Nicodemus Jones’, who described the same novel as a ‘modern masterpiece’. Two of R.J. Ellory's crime fictions novels. The author was exposed in September as praising himself on one review,  writing under another name he said:  'R.J. Ellory is one of the most talented authors of today' One of the reviews on Amazon that RJ Ellory has admitted to writing under the name Jelly Bean about his own book A Quiet Belief in Angels . ‘Just buy it, read it, and make up your own mind. Whatever else it might do, it will touch your soul,’ he wrote. But the same reviewer had fewer kind words for crime novel Dark Blood by Scottish writer Stuart MacBride. He wrote: ‘This is the second of this author’s books I have read, and, to tell you the truth, I can’t be bothered any more.’ The reviews dated back at least four years. The Crime Writers’ Association earlier condemned the practice and announced moves to introduce a code of ethics. Yesterday a spokesman for Wikipedia said the author was banned from the site.","RJ Ellory used pseudonyms to try to remove negative stories on Wikipedia .

"Oliver Holt answered your questions in our live Q&A earlier today. The Mail on Sunday's new Chief Sports Writer - who makes his debut in this weekend's newspaper - will also be writing for MailOnline. Scroll down to read the answers to the questions you asked, from the events he is looking forward to covering this year to his opinion on Jose Mourinho and Mario Balotelli. Host commentator . Thanks for all your questions. You can read Oliver's debut column in this week's Mail on Sunday and right here on MailOnline. I admire him greatly as a manager. I’m not sure what I think of him as a man because I’m not sure he ever shows his true face. He’s an accomplished actor as well as an accomplished manager. I find it hard to see how you can’t admire him as a manager, though. He is one of the most successful bosses there has ever been. He has won the Champions League with two teams who were underdogs without the financial might of their opponents and he provokes great loyalty among his players. It’s hard not to admire that. Until recently, I would have said Messi fairly confidently but I’ve begun to change my mind. I like Messi’s unassuming style more and he is a wonderful, beguiling player to watch. But Ronaldo is such an amazing all-round player, powerful in the air, lightning quick, great with the dead-ball, a fantastic dribbler. It is hard to separate them because they are so different but if I had to say now who was more valuable to a team, I’d say Ronaldo. Ronaldo, the Brazilian one. I sometimes feel that we have forgotten too quickly how mesmerizingly brilliant he was. He had that combination of speed, trickery and close control that often made him unplayable. It was always a thrill to watch him play. When Balotelli signed for Liverpool, I thought Brendan Rodgers had got a bargain for £16m, something I've been reminded of every now and again on Twitter as he's struggled to get anywhere near justifying that fee. I always like to think of the Balotelli who played so brilliantly for Italy at Euro 2012. That showed what he's capable of. It showed the extent of his talent. But he has been unable to get close to replicating that kind of form ever since and manager after manager has written him off as more trouble than he is worth. I hope that the winner against Spurs can rescue his career at Anfield because I don't think there's anything malicious about him. He just seems like an immature kid who hasn't quite grown up yet. He has the talent to be a hit at Liverpool but he needs to buy into Rodgers' work ethic to have a real chance of making the move a success and so far there has been scant evidence he is prepared to do that. Instinctively, I want The Open, in particular, to be available to the biggest possible audience but the viewing figures on the BBC weren’t great and no one can deny that Sky do a fantastic job with their coverage of golf. I would like the BBC to devote more time and money to sport in general because I think they usually do a fine job but I suppose that, like many of us, they are in thrall to the fact that everything comes a distant second to football in this country and they have spent most of their budget on retaining the rights to Premier League highlights. I was way too shy and self-conscious ever to consider becoming an actor. I used to go in to the Granada Studios with my mum (who has played Emily Bishop since 1961) now and again when I was a kid but it seemed to involve a lot of waiting around for her to do her scenes. There was one time where I was desperate for her to get away early so we could go and buy tickets for a Manchester City cup match before the ticket office at Maine Road closed. I moaned and moaned about it for so long that even my mum’s patience snapped in the end. The US Masters and the Rugby World Cup. But sometimes the best things are events that are off the radar, jobs that you do on your own in strange places away from the glare. Sometimes, they can demand more of you and bring you more satisfaction. I went to watch Michael Jordan playing baseball once in Birmingham, Alabama and managed to snatch a very quick conversation with him. Those kinds of pieces are often the most enjoyable and satisfying to write. Boxing, tennis and cricket. I am pleased that boxing’s back on mainstream TV. I used to love watching it on Sportsnight in the 1970s and it’s great that the Frampton fight is on. I don’t think I’ll be at the fight this time but I would love to get over to Belfast for a future bout. First of all, if you love it, you’ll be good at it. Because if you love it, you’ll want to work hard. And you’ll need to work hard to be successful. So work hard and be persistent. Don’t take no for an answer and try to get on with people. People don’t want to talk to people they don’t like. He didn’t like me very much but the only time I ever interviewed Sir Alex Ferguson one-on-on, back when Manchester United trained at The Cliff, he was fascinating to listen to. The boxer Bernard Hopkins is probably the most articulate sportsman I’ve ever interviewed. And he can talk and talk and talk. As for disappointments, I loved Zinedine Zidane as a player but the only time I ever interviewed him, he was sullen and almost monosyllabic. I didn’t particularly hold that against him, though. It was towards the end of a day when he had done about 50 interviews and I think by the time I got to him, he was making it plain he just wanted to be somewhere else. Actually, no. We tend to have most of our major rows on screen, which is probably one of the things that makes the programme good. I have been party to – and maybe even involved in – some spectacular rows on various trips to cover sporting events. I remember one, in particular, at a restaurant in Las Vegas where two journalists I have always admired tremendously, Jim Lawton and Jeff Powell, were engaged in a verbal battle that left me in awe of their conviction. I joined The Times as their Motor Racing Correspondent in 1993 after working at the Liverpool Echo and Daily Post for three years. The first job I did was to attend the launch of the new Lotus F1 car at Claridge’s in London. Johnny Herbert was driving for them then and I wrote a piece about him. I felt a bit out of my depth at the time. Some might say I still am. As an addendum, the first trip I did for The Times was to cover the South African Grand Prix at Kyalami. From there, I went to Australia to see Nigel Mansell racing IndyCars on the Gold Coast and from there I went to Brazil to see the second GP of the season. Until then, my idea of a work trip had been going through the Mersey tunnel to cover a game at Prenton Park. I felt like I had hit the jackpot. That’s right. I’m a Stockport fan. My dad’s from the Heaton Chapel area of Stockport and he used to take me to Edgeley Park as a kid(we lived a few miles away from the ground). In those days, County played their home games on a Friday night so I would go and watch either City or United at home on Saturday afternoon. There was a spell when I went home and away with United and I went to plenty of City away games, too. One of the United fanzines called me a Purple once because I’m a mixture of red and blue but Stockport have always been my first team. Muhammad Ali, because he is one of the greatest sportsman who ever lived, because he had political convictions and because he was not afraid to say what he thought. Ayrton Senna because there was a mystery about him as well as the fact that he was a sublimely talented driver. I had been lined up to do an interview with him at the Spanish Grand Prix in 1994 but he was killed a few weeks earlier at Imola. Cathy Freeman, because her gold medal run in Sydney in 2000 is my most vivid Olympic memory and because I admired the way she represented indigenous Australians. Babe Ruth, because I’ve always been fascinated by his legend. Bjorn Borg because he was my idol when I was growing up. Sir Bobby Robson, because I feel like I owe him a lot, I always felt privileged to be in his company and it would be lovely to see him again. That’s one of the toughest questions to ask a sports writer because there are so many great one-off sporting occasions that are a huge thrill to attend and make you feel incredibly lucky to be doing the job. I’d put the Indianapolis 500 up there, although it is somewhat reduced now. The Champions League final always feels highly charged and there is always an adrenaline rush about covering a big world title fight. I was lucky enough to be at the Maracana for the World Cup final last year and covering that match in Brazil was as good as it gets for a football fan. But if I had to plump for one event, I’d say the Wimbledon Men’s Singles Final. I’d choose that because I have always loved tennis and when I was a kid I thought it was an impossible dream that I might one day be able to be on Centre Court to watch the men’s final. It felt like something that was totally out of reach, something inaccessible and exotic that I could never even hope to gain entrance to. So every time I have been to a men’s final, I have felt incredibly fortunate. I still can’t get past the wonder of being at that event. I’ve got a picture on my wall at home of Andy Murray at the moment he won the final in 2013 and I can pick myself out in the crowd in the background. That was right up there with the most memorable sporting events I have ever seen. Good afternoon and welcome to our Q&A with Oliver Holt.

"Shocking pictures show the horrific injuries sustained by a man who was beaten by a gang of yobs when he stepped in to defend a girl being jeered at in the street. Josh Smith was outside his local pub in Smethwick, Birmingham, in the early hours of last Saturday when he says he heard a group of men taunting a girl. The 19-year-old stepped in to defend the girl but was tripped up and punched in the back of the head by the abusive thugs. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Josh Smith was left hospitalised with a burst lip after he challenged a group of men who were abusing a girl . He twice had to step in to halt the gang's abuse and was left hospitalised after he was punched to the ground . After retreating inside the pub, Mr Smith later emerged to hear the same men abusing another group of girls, telling them they should 'kill themselves because they were ugly'. When he again challenged the men, they turned on him and he was punched to the ground, suffering a fractured nose, burst lip and a black eye. Mr Smith said: 'I've never bled so much in my life. When I got to the hospital I looked in the mirror and could see my teeth through the side of my mouth - it made me gag. 'From the damage the punch caused, the doctors told me it wasn't just a fist I was hit with. 'My mates think they saw something in the guy's hand but it all happened so quickly. I have to drink through a straw now and I'm in agony, but it was still the right thing to do. 'Nobody has the right to talk to women that way, especially when they were just minding their own business.' Mr Smith is now hoping police can track down his attackers, who have left him scared to leave his home . The attack happened outside The Old Chapel pub in Smethwick, Birmingham around 2am on Saturday morning . Nearly a week after the attack, Mr Smith's right eye is still swollen and the stitches above his lip are painfully fresh. He has been left scared to leave his home and is now hoping police can track down his attackers. Mr Smith, who works as a singer, said: 'I just hope somebody comes forward and these lads are found. 'Not just for me, but to stop them hurting anybody else in the future. At the moment I just don't want to leave the house and I don't want anybody else to go through that.' A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'We were called by the ambulance service to the Old Chapel Inn, The Uplands, Smethwick just after 2am on Saturday 6 September. 'A 19-year-old man was taken to hospital for treatment. Police are investigating how he came by his injuries.'","Josh Smith was outside his local pub when he heard men abusing girl .
