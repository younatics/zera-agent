Daniel Moran, 37, ripped a spindle from a bannister rail and battered his former  girlfriend’s three-month-old pet to ‘punish’ her, a court heard yesterday. In a drunken rage, he also punched the woman in the face twice, leaving her with serious injuries. Deceased: White Stripe, left, pictured with two other kittens was attacked with a spindle ripped from a banister during a drunken rage . He claimed that the only things she cared about were her three  tiny kittens. The case provoked outrage from animal rights groups yesterday. They said violence against animals was often a precursor to attacks  on people. Moran, an alcoholic, was staying at his ex-girlfriend’s house after being made homeless. On the day of the offence she hosted a barbecue where Moran got into a fight then left to walk his dog, she told Croydon Magistrates’ Court. Daniel Moran, 37, killed his former girlfriend's kitten in the drunken attack . He returned and barged into her bedroom at 4am. She told him to leave, but he flew into a rage and grabbed the kitten, White Stripe, and hit it six times. The woman, who does not want to be identified as she fears for her safety, told the court: ‘He hit me on the bed, then threw me on the floor. He went out of my room, grabbed the bannister rail and pulled a  spindle out. ‘He was going to beat me with the stick but he saw the kitten and said, . “The only thing you care about is them”. I started cowering behind the door. He kept hitting [White Stripe] over and over again and it started convulsing. He grabbed it off the bed and threw it out the back window like a rag. The only word I can use is evil. He was punishing me. The one thing in my life are my little babies.’ He punched her in the face and left the house in Wallington, south London. She called the police. Last week Moran pleaded guilty to assault by beating and to causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. But magistrates said he should serve just 18 weeks for the attack, which will run concurrently with a 23-week prison sentence for assaulting his ex-partner. White Stripe was clubbed to death by Moran in a drunken rage . Moran, who is unemployed, was also banned from keeping an animal as a pet for five years. And he was given a five-year restraining order banning him from contacting his ex-partner. Mark Dakin, defending, said his client had a long-standing alcohol problem and had suffered a head injury in the earlier unrelated fight. A spokesman for Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) said: ‘People like Daniel Moran are utter cowards who take their issues out on the most defenceless beings available. We have seen a drastic increase in cruelty cases in the last few years. History and research shows that thugs rarely stop at animals and that these empathy-impaired individuals often go on to make humans their victims.'","Daniel Moran jailed for 23 weeks after killing three-month-old White Stripe and assaulting girlfriend .

"Second child in a week to kill herself following Facebook reports she was tormented by classmates . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:27 AM on 18th November 2011 . A ten-year-old took her own life in her bedroom after allegedly being bulled at school. Jasmine McClain was found hanged by her mother Samantha West at their home in Chadbourn, North Carolina on Monday evening. Ms West said: 'She was just such a loving child. I just lost it because she took her last breath in my arms.' Tragic waste: Jasmine McClain, ten, hanged herself in her bedroom after being a victim of suspected bullying . Ms West described her young daughter as 'sweet and fun-loving' and said she was unaware that Jasmine was so tormented by bullying at her local elementary school. Ms West told local TV station WRAL-TV: 'It's a shame that kids are that cruel.' Chadbourn Police Chief Steven Shaw ruled the death a suicide but his investigation lead him to Facebook where comments had been posted by Jasmine's classmates that she had been targeted. Chief Shaw said: 'Children started coming forward and making accusations that she was bullied - and bullied bad - in school.' Adorable girl: Jasmine McClain (right) took her own life on Monday at her home in North Carolina . 'A loving child': Police investigating Jasmine's suicide said children from her school have written on Facebook that the ten-year-old was 'badly bullied' The police chief was unable to comment on whether anyone was liable for Jasmine's death but said that the investigation was ongoing. It is believed that Jasmine was tormented at Chadbourn Elementary, where she was picked on her about her clothes and shoes. She didn't attend school for a short while before returning to classes last month. Her mother said she had dreaded going back. Chadburn Elementary, where the flag flew at half-mast following Jasmine's death, said they had conducted their own internal investigation and were working closely with the police. Horrifying discovery: Samantha West talks to a local reporter outside her home in Chadbourn, North Carolina where she found her daughter hanged . Despair: Ms West said she had no idea that her ten-year-old child was so troubled at school . Concerns have been raised after several children committed suicide in recent months following reports of bullying. A ten-year-old girl hanged herself after being the victim of bullying in the town of Ridge Farm, Illinois last week. Ashlynn Connor, an honour-roll student and cheerleader, had begged her mother to be home-schooled. The following day, she was found hanged by one of her siblings. Dread: Jasmine McClain had taken time off from Chadbourn Elementary but had returned to lessons last month . Her mother Stacy said she knew about the bullying, where other children would call Ashlynn 'a slut' and 'ugly', but never thought it would drive her daughter to kill herself. Two months ago, Jamey Rodemeyer, a teenager from Buffalo, New York, was found dead outside his home. Jamey was bullied both at school and online about being gay. Inner pain: On the surface, 10-year-old Ashlynn Connor was a happy-go-lucky girl, but she was constantly harassed by bullies . The 14-year-old was a big fan of Lady Gaga and sent her a message on Twitter saying 'Bye mother monster, thank you for all you have done, paws up forever,' before he killed himself. Moved by his death, the pop star performed her song 'Hair' a few days after Jamey’s death and dedicated it to him. Fan: Jamey loved Lady Gaga and left a thank you to her as one of his last postings before he died .",Second child in a week to kill herself following Facebook reports she was tormented by classmates .
"By . James Slack . Last updated at 4:09 PM on 18th November 2011 . In a damning indictment of community policing, one in four people has never seen a bobby walking the beat. Despite millions of pounds being poured into making the forces of law and order more visible, the streets are still too often devoid of that reassuring presence. Even the ‘Blunkett bobbies’ designed for just that purpose are seen infrequently. Damning indictment of community policing: The revelations will reignite controversy about police efficiency . High visibility: The Home Office spent hundreds of millions of pounds on recruiting and training civilian staff to become PCSOs . The disturbing findings were uncovered in a survey of almost 50,000 by the Home Office. The British Crime Survey discovered that 55 per cent of the public had seen police officers or police community support officers walking the beat at least once a month. But this fell to one in seven, or 14 per cent, when they were asked if they see officers on a daily basis. And 25 per cent said they had not at any stage seen either a fully-fledged police officer or PCSO on the beat. PCSOs, introduced by David Blunkett when he was Home Secretary, are supposed to spend the bulk of their time pounding the streets. The Home Office spent hundreds of millions of pounds on recruiting and training the civilian staff, who do not have proper police powers and cannot make arrests. The revelations will reignite controversy about police efficiency. One . of the most common demands from members of the public is for more . officers on the beat to provide reassurance that they are being . protected from thugs and burglars. But . Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary said recently that fewer . than one in ten uniformed officers in some forces are available to man . the front line at any one time. Police . spending almost doubled, from £7.72billion in 1998/1999 to . £14.55billion a decade later. The number of officers increased from . 124,756 in March 1998, to a peak of around 141,000. Pioneering: David Blunkett introduced PCSOs when he was Home Secretary . But, while officer numbers were increasing dramatically, the proportion of time an officer actually spends on patrol fell, from 15.3 per cent to 13.8 per cent. Police budgets are being cut as part of the Government’s austerity measures – with forces threatening to axe around 16,000 police officers. Last night Roy Rudham, chairman of the UK Neighbourhood Watch Trust, said: ‘It has always been a concern of people that they do not see police officers on the street and with the cuts being implemented the likelihood is they will see even fewer officers. ‘That will especially be the case if crime goes up and police resources are stretched to the absolute limit.’ The Home Office survey also found that only half of the public – 52 per cent – were confident that the authorities were effective at reducing anti-social behaviour. And just 41 per cent felt the authorities were effective in bringing louts to justice. The situation on police visibility has . improved. In 2006, four out of ten people said they had never witnessed . a police officer or PCSO on the streets. But it will be considered poor progress for the massive investment in extra police and PCSOs. The . survey also found that only 4 per cent had used the online crime maps . introduced by the Home Office to give people a greater idea of crime . levels on their street and to increase police accountability. When the maps were launched at the start of this year, the website crashed – apparently due to high demand. In its report, Her Majesty’s . Inspectorate of Constabulary found that there are more officers on duty . on a Monday morning than at any other time of the week – and the fewest . just after midnight on Friday when drunken violence soars. Antiquated shift patterns, court . hearings and training requirements mean that in two forces – . Bedfordshire and Devon and Cornwall – only 9 per cent of officers can . actually tackle crime, it said. The . watchdog found many other forces fared little better, with an average . of 12 per cent of officers available to catch crooks and keep people . safe. Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Denis O’Connor also highlighted how one in three members of the police workforce is not employed in a front-line role. These include staff working in personnel, maintenance and administration. HMIC is predicting the loss of 16,100 officers by 2015, along with up to 1,800 community support  officers and 16,100 civilian staff, because of budget cuts. But it says there is so much waste that £1billion – the equivalent of a 12 per cent cut in government funding – could be axed without any reduction in police availability. This would be achieved by getting police out from behind their desks. Critics say repeated promises by Labour to cut red tape failed to deliver. Police Minister Nick Herbert said: ‘We know the public want their local police to be visible and responsive to their concerns. And the police want to be out in their local communities stopping crime, catching criminals and helping victims. ‘That’s why we have swept away central targets and red tape to free up more officers for the frontline.’","Findings uncovered in Home Office survey of 50,000 .

A student Republican leader has been forced to apologise after saying the assassination of President Barack Obama was a 'tempting' idea. Lauren Pierce, the president of the College Republicans at the University of Texas (UT), faces calls from her own group to resign after posting the comments on Twitter. She said: 'Y'all as tempting as it may be, don't shoot Obama. We need him to go down in history as the WORST president we've EVER had! #2012.' Her tweet, posted yesterday, came hours after Pennsylvania State Police arrested 21-year-old Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez in connection with the alleged gunfire incident at the White House last Friday. Ortega-Hernandez was found by a state trooper at a hotel near Indiana, Pennsylvania, shortly after noon on Wednesday. Just days earlier, bullets from an AK47 peppered the White House with one window close to the President's bedroom being cracked. Police said that Ortega-Hernandez had become 'obsessed' with Obama and that God had given him a personal mission to attack the White House. After the story of Miss Pierce's comment broke in the media, she told ABC News that the message was a 'joke'. 'Joke': Lauren's Pierce's inflammatory Twitter message, which she posted on Wednesday . Regret: Miss Pierce says she has learned valuable lessons since her first posting . She reportedly giggled while saying the attempted assassination would 'only make the situation worse'. But amid growing attention, Miss Pierce removed the post and apologised on the social networking site for her comments.

The unnamed British soldiers were killed when their armoured vehicle struck a makeshift bomb while on patrol. The troops, from the 1st The . Queen's Dragoons Guards, had been providing security in the Yakchal . region of Nahr-e-Saraj when they were caught in the explosion. 'One of those men you can completely rely on when things get tough': How Lance Corporal Peter Eustace was described by his commanding officer . Task Force Helmand spokesman . Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Mackenzie  said: 'It is with great sadness . that I must confirm the deaths of two soldiers from the 1st The Queen's . Dragoon Guards after their vehicle was hit by an IED. 'Our deepest condolences go out to the families and loved ones of both these brave soldiers at this very difficult time.' As news of their deaths emerged, the friends and relatives of Lance Corporal Peter Eustace - killed yesterday by an improvised explosive device - praised him. The 25-year-old, of 2nd Battalion the Rifles, died when he . was hit by an improvised explosive device while on patrol in Nahr-e . Saraj in Helmand Province yesterday. He leaves his mother Carole Ann, his sister Kirsty, his brother Ryan and his girlfriend Aimi. The commanding officer Lance Corporal Eustace described him as 'one of those men you can completely rely on when things get tough'. Battle zone: All three deaths happened in the Helmand Province area of Afghanistan (pictured) Eustace, from Liverpool, known to his friends as 'Eust', worked briefly as a painter and decorator before joining the Army in late 2004. He served hard-fought tours in Basra, southern Iraq, in 2006-07 and in the deadly Sangin district of northern Helmand in 2009. He returned to Afghanistan last month as a mortar fire controller with Delhi Company of 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment. His family said in a statement: 'Peter was very fit and he always wanted to join the Army. He was committed to carrying out a full career there. He will be missed by his family and friends and is loved by all. 'Peter was a loving son and grandson and will be especially missed by his girlfriend, Aimi.

Major Spiro Marcandonatos, officer commanding Delhi Company of 1 Yorks, described Lance Corporal Eustace as an 'upstanding and fiercely loyal individual'. He said: 'A lively character, he served us extremely well from the moment we were first introduced and his experience was vital to the company, hitting the ground running and taking the fight to the Taliban. He will be sorely missed.' Captain Mark Endersby, of 2 Rifles, said it was testament to Lance Corporal Eustace that all around him, including the Afghan soldiers he fought alongside, were 'deeply hurt' by his loss. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'I was hugely saddened to learn of the death of Lance Corporal Eustace. 'The touching tributes I have read show that he was a professional and natural soldier who was held in the highest regard by all those who worked with him. 'He fought bravely in Iraq and Afghanistan prior to this tour where he has paid the ultimate sacrifice for us at home in the UK. My thoughts are with his loved ones.'

"The couple, who have three other children, told police they followed a 'very low cholesterol diet' Mother previously charged with biting elder daughter . By . Associated Press . Last updated at 3:49 AM on 18th November 2011 . Parents starved their baby for months claiming they were afraid she would end up obese, a court has heard. Christopher and Mary Sultze, of Appleton, Wisconsin were both charged earlier this month with a felony count of child neglect. The couple face up to a year in prison and a $25,000 fine if convicted. The infant gained just five pounds in the 14 months after her birth. She needed . to weigh 22 pounds to meet even the minimum growth charts for her age, a doctor told police. History of abuse: Mary Sultze, of Appleton, Wisconsin, appeared in court today accused of starving her baby - she previously admitted to biting her elder daughter . Another doctor noted that the child had no fat on her . body and was essentially starving. Mr Sultze reportedly told doctors during a check-up in August that his daughter would 'get fat' if she stayed at the hospital, even though it was recommended because the child was dangerously underweight. Mr Sultze, 35, appeared at Outagamie County Circuit Court today and was released on bail on the condition he had no contact with the child. His preliminary hearing was scheduled for next week. His wife Mary Sultze, 36, waived the right to a preliminary hearing yesterday in exchange for her release on bail so that she could return to the couple's three other children, according to her attorney Brandt Swardenski. Warped: Christopher Sultze told doctors he was worried about his 14-month-old daughter 'getting fat' despite one physician saying the child was essentially starving . She was also ordered to have no contact with the daughter she's accused of starving. Neither has entered a plea. Mr Swardenski said: 'I have serious reservations about whether there's any criminal activity here or just misguided parenting intentions. 'This is a case where we need to reserve judgment until we learn more details on exactly what occurred.' Mr Sultze's attorney Michael Petersen declined to comment. According to the criminal report, the couple's daughter weighed eight pounds when she was born in July 2010 and weighed just 13 pounds this September. Doctors began tracking the girl's lack of growth and weight gain at her four-month checkup in November 2010, when she weighed just 7 pounds, 9 ounces. Her parents were irritated that doctors were continually concerned about their daughter's weight, the report said. They insisted they were feeding her enough, their other children grew slowly and that they believed the girl would eventually gain weight. Months went by with no significant improvement and tests for potential medical problems came back negative. In August, the family's doctor convinced the couple to bring their daughter to Children's Hospital in Fox Valley for an evaluation. The girl gained 8 ounces in one a day at the hospital. A social worker assigned to the family as part of hospital procedure noted that the girl's parents were upset by recommendations that they needed to feed her more calories. They decided to take their daughter home against the advice of her doctors. Mr Sultze reportedly told a doctor he didn't want to have obese children and kept insisting his daughter would 'get fat' at the hospital. He later told police that his family followed a very low cholesterol diet. Mr Sultze said he underwent bypass surgery for a blocked artery when he was 25 years old. Court records revealed that Mrs Sultze was charged with misdemeanor battery and disorderly conduct for biting her four-year-old daughter on the arm in 2009. At the time, she told police she had bitten her daughter to teach her a lesson after the girl bit her older sister. The mother of four acknowledged that 'it probably wasn't right to do'. She ultimately pleaded no contest to the disorderly conduct charge, which is not an admission of guilt but is treated as such for sentencing purposes. Prosecutors dismissed the battery count.","The couple, who have three other children, told police they followed a 'very low cholesterol diet'

"By . Luke Salkeld . Last updated at 8:46 PM on 17th November 2011 . She had every reason to be a blushing bride. Elizabet Balogh was arrested on her ‘special day’ after accepting  a £400 payment to marry a  complete stranger. But before Pakistani-born Asif Hussain could slip the ring on to her finger, immigration officials had  handcuffs on her wrist and she was led away in her one-shouldered white dress. Blushing bride: Elizabeth Balogh being taken away by an official after being arrested at her sham wedding ceremony . Not so happy couple: Balogh was paid just £400 to marry Asif Hussain so that he could remain in Britain . Yesterday the 33-year-old was jailed, along with her intended husband and their matchmaker. The scam was uncovered after the registrar became suspicious as Balogh and her 25-year-old fiancé exchanged little in the way of conversation ahead of their August wedding. Prosecutor Hywel Hughes told Cardiff Crown Court: ‘It was  apparent that there was very little verbal communication between  the bride and groom'. He said that it struck the registrar as ‘very odd’ that the  couple wanted to get married ‘as quickly as possible’ and had arranged the wedding in a  matter of weeks. Cardiff Crown Court heard that Balogh, who is originally from Hungary but has British citizenship, tried after her arrest to convince police that she really did want to marry Hussain, claiming: ‘It was love at first sight.’ Set-up: Elizabeth Balogh's cousin Valerie Farkas played the role of interpreter at the sham wedding . But the couple soon admitted that their relationship was fake,  and had been set up by Balogh’s cousin Valerie Farkas, 45, who played the role of interpreter. The court heard that Hussain paid Balogh £400 to marry him after his student visa ran out. He had hoped to stay in Cardiff to undertake a master’s degree  in business administration. All three admitted conspiracy  to facilitate a breach of immigration law. Judge Neil Bidder QC yesterday jailed Hussain, of Cardiff, for 12 months. Balogh, a mother of one, and Farkas, a cleaner, both of  Manchester, were jailed for ten months and six months respectively. The judge said: ‘The  registrar became suspicious that this was a fraud and a scam – although it didn’t require her to be very perceptive as Balogh and Hussain were unable to communicate with each other. ‘They didn’t share a common language and Farkas was needed to interpret. Not one of you realised how transparent a sham this was. ‘You all told police a pack of  lies – and Balogh telling them it was love at first sight was an  outrageous lie'. He continued: ‘On the face of it, the person who would gain the most was Hussain, and he initiated this conspiracy. ‘But it is also clear that both women intended to gain financially through this'. Chris Lovejoy, from the UK  Border Agency’s immigration crime team, said: ‘Asif Hussain saw this sham marriage as a shortcut to a life in the UK. ‘Instead, he has earned himself a significant spell behind bars. ‘This case shows how people are prepared to enter into a marriage with someone they barely know to help them cheat the immigration system in exchange for cash. ‘The UK Border Agency is cracking down on sham marriages and those who seek to cheat immigration laws face jail'. The court heard that Balogh and Farkas had not told their families in Hungary that they had been arrested. The judge told the women that the Home Secretary would decide whether they should be deported after their jail terms.",'Groom' wanted to marry so he could stay in Britain .

Two young boys apparently tried to lure a young girl away from her mother in a supermarket, in a chilling echo of the James Bulger abduction. Police have arrested an 11-year-old and a 12-year-old in connection with the incident. They are now trying to trace the girl's mother, who reported the incident to a security guard at a branch of Asda in the Wavertree area of Liverpool - just a few miles away from where two-year-old James was kidnapped and killed by Robert Thompson and Jon Venables in 1993. James's mother, Denise Fergus, said the disturbing echo of her son's case made her blood run cold. 'Hearing of the incident from police sent a chill down my spine, it's so similar to what happened to my James,' said Mrs Fergus. 'It's so important that this mother comes forward to tell the full story of what happened. 'The police must have some real concern about what is shown on the CCTV and it's right they should treat this seriously. They need to get to the bottom of this and she is a vital witness. 'The two who abducted and murdered my son were ten, but they did the worst things imaginable.

Mrs Fergus urged mothers who are likely to be shopping with their children over the festive period to be vigilant when heading into crowded places with their kids. She said that the lesson of history should be a warning sign to mothers who, now more than ever, need to be on their guards. Mrs Fergus said: 'People know how something like this can happen and we all need to be on our guard. 'It only takes a few seconds and a child can be lured away as it did with my James. 'So often you see ""lost children"" in supermarkets and yet people walk past them. I say that should never happen. 'If there is a lost child or anything suspicious it is up to any adult to take an interest and alert the responsible authorities. 'Most of all, it is essential to challenge any children who claim to be left in charge of much younger ones in public. These days that just should not happen.

The One Direction singer has shared a passionate kiss with the 32-year-old star and now it seems the pair enjoyed dinner together on Tuesday night. Styles, 17, believes he's found 'the one' according to his fellow band mate, Louis Tomlinson, but his fans are less fond of her as the star has apparently been receiving death threats. Scroll down to watch a video of Harry talking about Caroline . Out together: Caroline Flack and Harry Styles were spotted enjoying an intimate dinner together at the St Martins Lane hotel on November 15 . Flack took to her Twitter page this morning to deny the rumours saying: 'Hi One Direction fans! To clarify. I'm close friends with . harry.. He's one of the nicest people I know...I don't deserve death . threats. :) x.' Hardcore fans of the boy band, and Styles in particular, have been out in force on the social networking site over the past 24 hours. Many have been making humorous comments . and digs at the news, whilst others have been supporting Flack - . insisting that those who post death threats are giving them a bad name. Speaking out: Flack decided to squash the rumours by taking to her Twitter page early this morning . One fan was obviously so fed up of hearing the rumours that they write: 'I don't even care anymore. If Harry wants to date an oldie let him be.' Other fans joked about the age gap by saying: 'it's okay, I'm close friends with the toddler down my road too.' But others decided to stick up for . the TV star with matty1dir tweeting: 'If you love harry ... You wont . give @carolineflack1 any of this! She said they are friends :) thats it! H wouldnt want you being nasty!' Fed up: Hardcore fans of the boy band member have been tweeting about the rumours of him dating an older woman . The rumours were fueled when The Sun revealed that Flack and Styles were seen sharing desserts at a restaurant in St Martin's Lane Hotel in London and were being very open about being out together. 'They were clearly enjoying being together and didn't seem to care who saw them,' said a source. 'Two other friends joined them while they were eating, but it was clear they only had eyes for each other.' However their night didn't end there, as Styles and Flack were seen getting into the same taxi and leaving together - something else they weren't bothered about hiding.

The Xtra Factor host was first linked to the boy band member last month after it emerged that they had kissed whilst on a night out. But it seemed it was more than just a kiss to Styles as he took to his Twitter page to write: 'Sometimes things happen and you suddenly get a whole new outlook on life.' Things seemed a bit awkward between the pair on last weekend's show as Flack and her co-host, Olly Murs, interviewed One Direction. 'Close friends': Flack was pictured hugging One Direction's Niall Horan after the band's appearance in The X Factor but she stayed away from Styles . And Styles hinted at his love for older women when he was asked which of the current female contestants on the show was his favourite. 'They're all a bit young for me,' he replied, even though they are all the same age of older than the boy bander. Unfortunately though his comments have angered the group's hardcore fans and has forced Flack to deny their close relationship. This is not the first time Flack has been linked to a Harry as she was reported to have had a brief relationship with Prince Harry two years ago, but he is believed to have called time on their romance after he revealed he was still in love with his heiress ex Chelsy Davy. More than just a record deal: Styles may have enjoyed success with One Direction following the X Factor but it seems he may have found 'the one' too .",Flack was was previously linked to Prince Harry .
"By . Rick Dewsbury . Last updated at 11:29 AM on 18th November 2011 . Police believe there is enough evidence to charge John Terry over an alleged racist remark, it was claimed today. Officers have quizzed a string of players about the Chelsea captain’s clash on the pitch with Anton Ferdinand last month. England captain Terry, 30, came under fire after he allegedly called the QPR defender a ‘f****** black c***’ during a heated match. 'Racist' slur? John Terry covers his mouth as he's surrounded by QPR players during the heated game at Loftus Road, West London, last month . Police have now compiled evidence from players and video recordings of the game - which show Terry’s lip movements - and are in the process of sending the file to the Crown Prosecution Service, it is claimed. The CPS will then decide if the evidence is strong enough to secure a conviction in court. They will also have to decide if proceeding with the case is in the public interest. ‘There is a feeling among some officers that John Terry has a case to answer,’ a source told the Daily Mirror. Terry categorically denies making the racist slur during Chelsea’s 1-0 Barclays Premier League defeat at Loftus Road on October 23 and is fighting to clear his name. Speaking after the incident, he said: 'I’ll do whatever it takes to clear my name. I don’t have anything to hide.' Police are understood to have interviewed Terry’s teammate Ashley Cole about the incident. The black defender was on the pitch at the time. He is said to have gone into the QPR dressing room after the dispute to act as a peacemaker between Ferdinand and Terry. Terry could be jailed for up to seven years and lose his position at the head of the national team if he is found guilty. Fifa President Sepp Blatter believes players should settle matters with a handshake after the game. David Cameron, right, criticised the stance . A Met spokesman said today: 'Most investigations hypothetically do give their evidence to the CPS after this length of time. The CPS then make a decision. That would be normal process.' A CPS spokesman said: 'CPS have not received a file and the police investigation is ongoing.' The ongoing case comes as Fifa boss Sepp Blater faced calls to step down after claiming that racism does not exist on the football pitch. Blatter said that players should settle the matter with a handshake at the end of the game. David Cameron yesterday joined the chorus of voices criticising Blatter over his comments. The Prime Minister said: ‘It’s appalling to suggest that racism in any way should be accepted as part of the game. ‘A lot of work has gone into ridding racism from all aspects of our society, including football. As many of our top sports stars have rightly pointed out, now is not the time for complacency.’ In an interview with Fox Soccer, Blatter stuck to his guns and pointed out that FIFA had taken the World Cup to South Africa. He added: ‘But if you also be a little bit in a sporting spirit when there is something happening on the field of play, during a match between two players - I call it foul language. I’m not saying about discrimination, but it’s foul language, it’s a foul play. ‘At the end of the match, if you have foul play (when) the match is over you shake hands... and therefore also forget what has been on the field of play.’ The furore has been heightened by another case of alleged racism on the pitch which has seen Liverpool’s Luis Suarez charged by the FA with racially abusing Patrice Evra.",Ashley Cole 'interviewed as a witness' to alleged slur .
"By . Chris Greenwood and Jack Doyle . Last updated at 10:19 PM on 18th November 2011 . Vile: Asylum seeker William Danga raped a four-year-old girl before heading off to preach as a Jehovah's witness . A convicted sex attacker raped and violently molested two young girls as he fought deportation on human rights grounds. Asylum-seeker William Danga, 39, subjected the children to appalling abuse before and after he was jailed for raping a teenager. One was just four years old when the Congolese national forced himself on her before heading out to preach as a Jehovah’s Witness. Yesterday a judge said it was ‘remarkable’ that the sex attacker was not thrown out of Britain after being jailed for ten years for raping a 16-year-old girl a decade ago. Officials were ordered to deport  Danga at the end of his sentence but he  frustrated their efforts after losing his passport. He was then freed on immigration bail while he challenged the move on the grounds that he had a right to a ‘family life’ because he had children with a young girlfriend. The case is the latest in a string of outrages in which dangerous foreign criminals have used European laws to continue living here. Just two months ago Nigerian rapist Akindoyin Akinshipe, 24, escaped deportation after European judges ruled he had a right to a ‘private life’ in Britain. Like many others, he used Article 8 of the Human Rights Act to claim the right to a ‘family life’. Home Secretary Theresa May wants to scale back the use of the controversial clause in a bid to wrest back more control over our borders. Danga was convicted of  rape and a string of other sexual offences yesterday after a five-day trial at  Croydon Crown Court, and jailed for 15 years. His victims, now aged 14 and 12, were forced to relive their ordeals as they gave evidence to the jury via video link. The elder girl was first abused in 2000, when she was four. Danga repeatedly attacked her before church meetings, but she escaped his clutches when he was sent from South East London to live in an immigration hostel in Portsmouth a year later. It was there that Danga was convicted of violently raping the 16-year-old girl in her bedroom after she tried to end their friendship. He was convicted of rape and jailed for ten years, with the judge ordering him to be deported on his release. But in 2006 he was able to return to South East London after serving half his sentence, and began his legal battle to stay in Britain. He began sexually abusing his first victim again before raping and molesting the second girl, who was just seven. She said Danga wore a smart brown suit and would leave after the attacks to knock on doors and teach people about the Bible. The younger victim told officers Danga would entice her into the bedroom by playing her pop hits including ‘Don’t Cha’ by the Pussycat Dolls on his mobile phone. Describing one attack, she said: ‘I didn’t really like it but I didn’t say anything because of the music. I didn’t want it to happen again.’Asked why she did not tell her parents, she added: ‘It crossed my mind a few times but then it was like, I felt like really bad because I felt it was all my fault.’ Jailed for 15 years: Danga and girlfriend Carla, the mother of his two children . Yesterday Judge Nicholas Ainley jailed Danga of Beckenham, South East London, and ordered that he be deported on his release. He said it was ‘astonishing’ he had been allowed to remain in Britain after being freed the first time in 2006. Unemployed Danga, who has two young children with his girlfriend Carla, whom he met when she was 18, shouted abuse at relatives of the two girls as he was led to the cells. Last year around 200 foreign criminals won the right to stay in this country using Article 8, the right to a ‘private and family life’. They included failed asylum seeker Aso Mohammed Ibrahim, who ran over 12-year-old Amy Houston and left her to ‘die like a dog’. He has fathered two children here. Tory ministers have pledged to replace the Human Rights Act – which enshrines the European Convention on Human Rights into  British law – with a UK Bill of Rights, but they have been opposed by their Lib Dem coalition partners. A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘We will seek to remove this individual as soon as he has finished his sentence. In 2010 we deported 5,235 foreign national prisoners from the UK.’","Asylum-seeker raped four-year-old girl before heading off to preach as a Jehovah's witness .

"By . Claire Ellicott . Last updated at 9:47 PM on 18th November 2011 . It may be little more than a month until Christmas, but it seems winter still hasn’t really got going. Balmy temperatures this weekend will mean Britain is hotter than Jordan. It will be unseasonably mild, according to predictions, with temperatures averaging 14c (57f) across Britain, as the unexpectedly warm November weather continues. Bright: The sun falls across St James's Park as a pelican prepares to fly across the park's lake in central London . Take-off: The pelican sets off on its journey with the rays from the warm sun bouncing off the lake . Last Thursday, temperatures in Gravesend, Kent, reached 16.2c (61f). And today, they are expected to reach 15.5c (60f) there – hotter than Amman, Jordan, where the temperature is 13c (55f). It is  also set to be warmer than Damascus, Syria, where it is 13c   and match Shanghai, China, where it is 15c. The outlook is not entirely positive, though, as some areas will be cloudy and may see showers, according to forecasts. So far, temperatures this month have averaged 9.4c (49f) – 3.5c above the November average of 5.9c (43f). But it could soon be time to finally dig out those woolly jumpers, as the Met Office has warned that the warm spell is unlikely to continue much past this weekend. Spring-like: A mallard at London Wetland Centre has hatched a clutch of 11 ducklings, about six months later than usual . Relaxed: A squirrel takes advantage of the nice weather by sitting in fallen leaves in St James's Park . Sarah Holland, a Met Office forecaster, said: ‘The first part of the month has been very warm. We have been seeing very mild temperatures of around 14-15c during the day which will continue into the weekend.’ The unseasonably warm weather is down to milder southerly winds blowing across from the Continent, according to the forecaster. Normally, Britain would be experiencing cooler westerly winds from across the Atlantic. ‘The warm weather is also down to an area of high pressure over the UK and that brings in the milder conditions,’ she added. Autumnal: A woman walks in the early morning sunshine in St James's Park . Outdoor fun: A man plays baseball among the fallen leaves . 'As we move into next week, we will see temperatures return to normal for November. It will be quite cold, especially compared with the warmer weather we’ve been experiencing.’ Night-time temperatures this month, averaging 6.6C (44f) over the first 15 days, have also been higher than the average of 4-5c (39-41f). And this November has been one of the driest on record, with 25.6mm of rain falling – 22 per cent of the monthly average of 116mm.  But Miss Holland said it would be difficult to predict whether it would be the warmest on record. The current record for November was set in 1994, when temperatures averaged 8.8c (48f). While the warm weather might seem like a blessing to most of us, it has left wildlife confused. Swallows, whose arrival usually marks the beginning of summer, have been spotted on Teesside. Frogs have begun mating and in London, a duck has hatched a clutch of 11 ducklings six months earlier than usual. The ducklings, which would normally be born between April and June, could be seen paddling on the entrance lake at the London Wetland Centre, in Barnes, yesterday. Jamie Wyver, of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, said: ‘Fortunately, the mild weather means there is still a fair bit of greenery out there for the ducklings to nibble on.’ The balmy conditions that Britain has been experiencing look set to continue into next week. It has also left forecasters admitting that - despite being so close to Christmas - there is still no sign of winter. Met Office forecaster Dan Williams . said: 'We’re expecting 15C on Saturday in the south-west, 14C in the . south and 13C in Scotland. 'Saturday . will see sunshine in the east, south-east and central parts, with less . sunshine around on Sunday in cloudier conditions, but still 14C in the . south-west and 12C in Scotland. 'Temperatures will remain mild into the middle of next week.' Forecaster Brian Gaze of The Weather . Outlook added: 'The mild southerly winds causing this unusually-mild . autumn are proving incredibly stable and difficult to shift, with no . imminent arrival of winter ahead.'

Peter Foster, the conman who was at the centre of the Cheriegate saga, was back behind bars last night after a chase through a hospital’s corridors. He was arrested over alleged false claims about a weight loss treatment. Australian police moved in on Foster as he sat at the bedside of his 80-year-old mother, Louise, who had collapsed with an apparent stroke shortly after announcing that she was suing News International for allegedly hacking into her phone in 2002. Foster, 49, jumped up from his bedside chair and was chased through the corridors of the Pindara Private Hospital in Benowa on Queensland’s Gold Coast. His mother yelled at officers to leave him alone, saying he had done nothing wrong. Police have arrested Foster amid claims he was involved in ‘misleading and deceptive conduct’ and made ‘false claims’ about a weight loss spray. Following previous fraud convictions, he was prevented from being involved in any companies in Australia. Couple: Foster with Cherie Blair's lifestyle adviser Carole Caplin . Controversial: The Sensaslim diet spray . But it is alleged that he failed to disclose that he was behind the Sensaslim ‘spray on, lose weight’ business.

A prostitute told how Dominique Strauss-Kahn joined her at 11 orgies over six years, it was revealed in France today. The 30-year-old vice girl named Florence described in lurid detail how the disgraced economist enjoyed having sex with 'every girl in the room' during the debauched sessions. She said the 62-year-old had 'exceptional energy', and always preferred the newcomers to the older women at the sex parties. Florence is one of three hookers . being quizzed by French police over an illegal prostitution racket . operating out of hotels in Lille, northern France. Her revelations are the latest in a tide of sleazy allegations to engulf the man once tipped to be the next French president. Strauss-Kahn . was forced to quit as boss of the International Monetary Fund after . accusations he tried to rape a New York hotel chambermaid in May. He returned to France after the . charges were dropped, and then escaped more accusations of trying to . rape a young writer in Paris eight years ago. He has now been named as a client of the sprawling vice network, though there is no suggestion he had sex with underage girls. But during the investigation it also . emerged that he flew hookers to Washington DC and even took one girl to . his office at the IMF headquarters. Accused: Dominique Strauss-Kahn, right, and his wife Anne Sinclair, left, arriving at the Manhattan Supreme Court in New York in August where he walked free following sexual assault allegations . Another girl told police she met Strauss-Kahn at a Paris hotel. She told detectives: 'He did not rape me, but you got the feeling that he liked rough sex'. Texts sent to pimps by Strauss-Kahn, . in which he ordered girls and planned orgies, were uncovered in France . last week, meaning he now risks being arrested for 'encouragement of . pimping'. In the latest . damning allegations, the hooker Florence has told police how she had . sex with Strauss-Kahn at 11 orgies over six years. She said: 'He was a very active member of the group. 'I also understood there were other sessions to which I was not invited. 'I concluded that this meant he liked a regular supply of different girls'. On one occasion, Florence and another hooker named Mounia, 38, were paid £2,000 to spend three days in Washington DC with Strauss-Kahn, and another £1,300 for orgies in Lille and Paris. She added: 'At these evenings, DSK had sex with every girl. 'He was always more interested in the new girls, and less fixated with the older ones'. Following the swathe of claims against Strauss-Kahn, he has admitted to friends that he is 'ill' and needs treatment for sex addiction. Other friends have told how he has plunged into a spiral of depression over the flood of allegations against him. One friend told France's Journal du Dimanche newspaper: 'Now he sits alone at home, biting his fingernails until they bleed. 'He is a shadow of his former self. In the last few days he has said that he needs to seek treatment. He admitted he was ill'. French news website Le Post said: 'If this confession happened, they would be the first real recognition by this former politician of the sex addiction he has been suffering from for years'. Detectives have said there is no suggestion Strauss-Kahn had sex with underage girls or committed any offence by sleeping with prostitutes - which is legal in France if the girls are over 18. Mr Strauss-Kahn has branded the claims he had orgies as 'dangerous and malicious insinuations' and insisted he will be able to clear his name.","Disgraced economist allegedly enjoyed having sex with 'every girl in the room'

This is the face of a suspect thief who has allegedly been trawling hospital wards to steal the house keys of elderly patients - and then burgling their homes. Police say that the middle-aged woman travelled 40 miles and visited three hospitals in just one day to collect a haul of keys which she then used to ransack her unsuspecting victims' unattended homes. In these shocking CCTV images, she appears to be counting the money from a purse she had snatched from a 98-year-old moments earlier. Heartless: The middle-aged woman wanted by police is seen leaving a hospital having allegedly stolen elderly patients' keys before burgling their homes . The first pensioner's door key was taken from her handbag while she was being treated on a ward in St George's hospital in Tooting, south London. At 3pm, witnesses described seeing a woman burgle her flat in Horsham, West Sussex. Wanted: The woman is described by witnesses as having a cockney accent and tanned or dark skin . At 4.25pm, the same woman was first captured on CCTV at Crawley Hospital where she struck up a conversation with her second elderly victim. It was only after the woman left that the patient noticed her bag was missing from her bedside. At 5pm, neighbours confronted a woman leaving the victim's unoccupied home in Furnace Green, using a set of keys. At 6pm that day, she was also filmed leaving a ward at the East Surrey Hospital at Redhill, after the theft of a purse from a 98-year-old patient. The woman is said to be 5ft 7in to 5ft 8in and of stocky build. She is believed to be in her late 30s to early 40s. She spoke with a cockney accent, according to witnesses. Some of them described her as mixed race although it could be that she has dark or tanned skin. Detective Constable Paul Voigt, from West Sussex CID, said: 'This is a despicable series of thefts and burglaries, following a trail which has obviously been carefully planned. 'In the pictures we have from the East Surrey Hospital, she can clearly be seen counting the money in the purse. 'We need to identify and speak to her, before she strikes again. 'If you recognise her or have any information about the incidents, please call Sussex Police.' The first pensioner's door key was stolen from St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London. Later that day, the same woman, in her 30s or 40s, was caught on CCTV at Crawley Hospital (centre), where another elderly patient's bag went missing.

An epileptic who ‘played Russian roulette’ with other people’s lives had a fit at the wheel and caused a crash that killed a grandmother. Philip Chapman, 56, suffered  regular blackouts but told the DVLA they had stopped to avoid losing his driving licence. The self-employed electrician was in his van in Southend, Essex, when he had a fit, shunting the car in front of him into the path of another vehicle. A 'ticking timebomb': Philip Chapman killed Linda Brooks after suffering a fit behind the wheel . The driver of that car, Linda  Brooks, 68, from Hockley, Essex, suffered massive injuries and died a fortnight later in hospital. Her two-year-old grandson, Alfie, had a serious head injury and still suffers from psychological problems. Chapman, of Rayleigh, Essex, was jailed for six years for causing death by dangerous driving and grievous bodily harm. He was banned from driving for life. Fatal stretch of road: Philip Chapman said he 'blacked out' just before the smash in Sutton Road, Southend . After the hearing, Mrs Brooks’s husband, Michael, 71, a retired company manager, said: ‘It is murder when you go out driving when you shouldn’t. He will be out on licence in three years and can carry on with his life.’ Chapman was sentenced at Basildon Crown Court on Thursday after admitting the charges at a previous hearing. The court heard he had suffered fits since childhood but was not diagnosed with epilepsy until a car crash in 1999. His licence was revoked but he successfully applied for it to be returned in 2003. In 2006 he declared he had not had any fits, when in fact he had had three, including one while driving. The fatal crash happened in September last year.Inspector Damon Bainbridge, of Essex Police, said Chapman felt he ‘needed’ to drive because he was self-employed. ‘He was in fact playing Russian  roulette as he could have become ill at any time,’ he said. Judge Christopher Mitchell said: 'You knew something was wrong with you and you deliberately chose to ignore the warning. You did not go back to your GP you did not consider stopping driving completely. This was criminally irresponsible.'",Electrician Philip Chapman jailed for six years for killing grandmother Linda Brooks .

A brave cancer sufferer who filmed herself asking Hollywood star Joseph Gordon-Levitt out on a date has become an internet sensation. Pretty brunette Lindsey Miller, who suffers from pancreatic neuroendcrine cancer, decided to solve her dating crisis by asking the Inception star out for a coffee in a YouTube video. Despite saying she finds it hard to explain her cancerous tumour to potential dates, the 26-year-old plucked up the courage to ask out long-term crush Joseph in a video which has become an unlikely web hit. Scroll down for video . Request: Cancer sufferer Lindsey Miller asked out Hollywood star Joseph Gordon-Levitt, right, in a YouTube video which has received over 250,000 hits . The YouTube video, entitled 'Will Joseph Gordon-Levitt Have Coffee With Me?' of Lindsey asking out the 30-year-old star has now been viewed over 250,000 times. Lindsey decided to ask Joseph for a date after watching his latest film '50/50', in which Gordon-Levitt plays a 27-year-old who is suddenly diagnosed with cancer. The story is based on the personal struggles with the disease by the movie's writer Will Reiser. In the 38-second video, she says: 'I think I identify with your character more than most people because I'm 26 and I have cancer. Empathy: Lindsey Miller said she could identify with Joseph Gordon-Levitt in 'cancer comedy' '50/50', where he plays a man diagnosed with the disease . 'Even though I look healthy, dating has been a little difficult because I'm not sure how to explain what I have been going through. 'But after a year of living with this I have decided to get back on the dating scene, and I would like my first date to be with you. 'Maybe you can call it my 'make a wish', but let's not be over dramatic. 'Just a cup of coffee with you would make me happy.' Lindsey was diagnosed with cancer last year, she had surgery in December 2010 to remove half of her pancreas and liver, her spleen and gallbladder and she is currently on an oral chemotherapy medication. Lindsey said of the video: 'After seeing Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance and seeing and reading some of his subsequent interviews about the film I thought 'this guy gets it'. 'And I thought 'he's cute, I wonder if I could ever run into him somewhere'. But even though I live in LA, it seemed impossible to find him.' Best-known: The 30-year-old actor is widely recognised for his role alongside Leonardo Di Caprio in Inception .

Russian gay rights activists have condemned a St Petersburg law fining anyone who 'promotes homosexuality' as a way of 'keeping gay people off the streets'. A bill has been passed in Russia's second largest city declaring that anyone who committed 'public acts' promoting homosexuality, bisexuality, or transgender issues could be fined up to 3,000 roubles (£61 approx). However, the bill has given no clear definition of what a public act is, leading equality activists to claim the law is an an attempt to crack down and permanently ban gay pride events. Targets: Despite homosexuality being decriminalised in Russia in 1993, gay rights groups are still targeted by right-wing protesters . Gay rights groups described the bill tentatively passed by St Petersburg lawmakers as a 'disgrace'. The bill was passed by the dominant United Russia party with a majority of 27 to 1 on Wednesday. The law could also see companies who 'promote homosexuality' fined between 10,000 and 50,000 roubles (around £1,000), according to technorati.com. Nikolai Alexeyev of the GayRussia.ru group said the bill could become 'the main legal reason to deny any public actions by the LGBT community.' He said: 'It theoretically allows the ban of anything anywhere where kids could be present.' Homosexuality was decriminalized in Russia in 1993 and gay clubs operate in most big cities, but discrimination is still widespread. Gay rights lawyer Nikolai Alexeyev described the St Petersburg bill as a 'disgrace' Most attempts by Alexeyev's group to hold rallies have been thwarted by riot police and activists with Russia's dominant Orthodox Church and pro-Kremlin youth movements. Gay rights demonstrations are not permitted in Moscow, whose mayor has called homosexuality 'satanic.' In May 2007, former politician Peter Tatchell and pop singer Richard Fairbrass were punched and kicked by right-wing thugs while attempting to take part in a gay rights protest in Moscow. Mr Fairbrass, 53, the Right Said Fred singer, was being interviewed on TV during the Moscow march when an anti-gay activist, dressed all in black, surged forward and began raining blows on his head and punched him full in the face. Thugs: Right Said Fred singer Richard Fairbrass was attacked by right-wing marchers while supporting a gay rights protest in Moscow in 2007 . Ex-politician Peter Tatchell was also attacked by homophobic Russian thugs while supporting gay rights . The attack left him with blood dripping from cuts around his eyes and nose. Mr Tatchell, 55, was repeatedly beaten and kicked before being taken away by two riot policemen. In August 2009, a lesbian couple kissed in protest outside a court in Russia, after a legal battle to decide whether they should be allowed to marry was postponed.","Russian gay rights protesters to be given same fine in St Petersburg as speeding and parking fines in Britain .

An Oxford University student was mistaken for a suicide bomber as he jogged around the city's streets - wearing a weighted vest. Armed police stopped the Iranian man after reports of a suicide bomber, only to discover he was a jogger wearing an exercise vest. The suspect was ordered to stop running, put his hands in the air and drop everything as officers approached him. Shocked: Iranian student Goudarz Karimi said he could not believe the police response even after they realised he was not a suicide bomber . The officers carefully took off the heavily padded vest and searched it, looking for explosives and a detonator. However, they found the Oxford University PhD student was wearing a training vest loaded with weights for added resistance when running. Used by the likes of Prince Harry for his Armed Forces trek to the Arctic, the weight vest is becoming a popular exercise accessory. Mr Karimi's vest was similar to the one used by Prince Harry to train for his Armed Forces trek to the Arctic . Iranian student Goudarz Karimi said he was shocked by the police response even after they realised he was not a suicide bomber. He said he had gone out for a jog on Monday afternoon and was confronted by the armed response team in Southfield Road, East Oxford. Mr Karimi said: 'They told me ""Stop! Stop! Put your hands in the air. Drop everything you have"". 'The police removed my weight vest and examined it. They started asking questions: ""What are you doing?"" 'They said they had a report of someone walking in a bomb suit. There were police cars and the street was blocked.' The 25-year-old was then made to remove the 30kg vest so officers could check it for explosives. He said that when they realised it was an exercise vest they advised him to remove it to prevent any another call from a terrified member of the public. 'They told me I'd have to take my vest off, I didn't want to provoke anything else and that's why I put my jacket over it.' Mr Karimi said he feared his ethnic origin had sparked the concerns. 'I am 100 per cent sure that if I was blond with Caucasian skin type, nobody would have noticed and said anything about it. 'But I'm of dark skin complexion and from Iran and I'm sure that's related to it,' he said. He said officers advised him not to wear it in the street in future but Thames Valley Police dispute this. Mr Karimi, who is studying for a PhD in physiology, anatomy and genetics at Oxford University, said: 'I felt a bit like my rights were violated. The police told me to take my vest off and to go home and I don't see why I should. Mr Karimi, 25, was told to remove the 30kg vest so officers could check it for explosives in Southfield Road, East Oxford, pictured . 'The point is the first time they stopped me, they asked me not to walk there anymore. They said ""maybe it's better somewhere else, like in a park"". 'Then later, when I wanted to do another round of the block and I was walking near the police car, the police officer said ""You've got to stop"". 'I said ""I've not finished my work-out"" and he explicitly said ""Take off your vest"".' Mr Karimi said that was when he covered the vest with his coat. Superintendent Amanda Pearson, of Thames Valley Police, said: 'Police received a call from a member of the public who was concerned about a man walking in Southfield Road, with what he thought was a vest which may have contained explosives. 'Officers attended and spoke to the man, who explained he was wearing a weight vest for personal training reasons. 'The vest was checked and officers confirmed this was the case and there was no need for public alarm. 'While I appreciate that in this case being stopped and checked by the officers may have been unsettling to the gentlemen concerned, the officers were responding to a call from a member of the public who had a genuine concern and police are duty bound to investigate any calls of this nature to ensure public safety. 'In order to stop any further calls from members of the public, the gentleman was asked to put his coat on, which he agreed to do. 'There was no legal requirement for the gentleman to put on his jacket and he did not have to do so.' She added: 'The officers have to weigh up a number of factors to determine if a stop and search is proportionate, and justified, and the decision to stop and search would not be made on ethnicity alone and wasn't in this case.'","Police ordered Goudarz Karimi to put his hands in the air and drop everything .

"By . Mail Foreign Service . Last updated at 6:00 PM on 18th November 2011 . The wife of former Polish president Lech Walesa has told of the huge price she paid for her husband's struggle against communism. She revealed her loneliness and jealousy as her husband led his shipyard workers in a revolt which eventually toppled the country's authoritarian regime. He would go on to win a Nobel peace prize, but 62-year-old Denuta Walesa felt neglected as she raised their eight children. Couple: Danuta Walesa and her husband Lech attend a ceremony in 2008 marking 25 years since he was awarded the Nobel peace prize . Now in a candid 550-page autobiography, Dreams and Secrets, which is  out next week, she.expresses hurt that she was excluded from her husband's strategic decisions that gave rise to Solidarity. Some of the revelations from the book shatter the long-held view of a happy and deeply united former president and first lady - not least because of their shared Roman Catholic faith. 'There was no formal divorce, but there were two separate worlds in our family,' Walesa writes in a copy of the book obtained by Associated Press. She says family life was generally peaceful in the early years of their 42-year marriage. But things took a turn for the worse when her husband rose to prominence during historic strikes in August 1980, when workers demanded greater freedoms. The way they were: Danuta and Lech Walesa say goodbye to each other as she leaves the country to pick up his Nobel peace prize in Oslo in 1983 . Victory: Solidarity leader Lech Walesa is hailed by workers at the Gdansk shipyard after it was announced he had won the Nobel prize . 'In August everything was smashed,' she writes. 'Our nest was torn apart.' It was then that Lech Walesa, who had been fired from his job as a shipyard electrician for his political agitation, jumped over the yard's fence to lead a wage strike against the regime. Danuta Walesa recalls how, on Aug. 14, 1980, her husband left home promising to register the birth of their sixth child, two-week-old Ania, at the city hall in Gdansk. Instead he headed straight to the shipyard. Hours later she learned that her husband had become the strike's leader. 'When Solidarity was born, not immediately, but in a short time, the father and the husband was gone,' she writes. 'And later, in the 1980s, with that bloody politics, he was less and less involved at home, with the children, with me, with the family.' The family's loss was Poland's gain. Under Walesa, Solidarity showed the communist authorities that they were no longer welcome, and in 1989, having weathered a martial law crackdown and massive arrests, it peacefully ushered in democracy and a free market economy. Walesa became Poland's first popularly elected president, serving from 1990-95. Danuta acknowledges that those years of hardship also brought rewards. When word spread in August 1980 that the wife of the national hero was home alone with six children, strangers came offering food, money and other help. 'The amount of kindness that came my way at the time could not be compared to anything at any other time in my life,' she says. Audience: Pope John Paul 11 greets Walesa at the Vatican in St Peter's Square in 2000 . Leaders: Former Polish President Walesa and former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev attending the 10th world summit of Nobel peace prize Laureates in Berlin in 2009 . But the small family apartment also became the pilgrimage site for hordes of Solidarity activists, international journalists and people seeking counsel. Danuta, still nursing Ania and with five other children, felt obliged to cater to them, but at some point broke down under the stress. 'One day, in the presence of all these people, I started yelling at my husband. My husband rose and left, without one word. All the others left with him,' Danuta remembers. A few hours later Lech Walesa returned with a decision: 'If you wish, we will put up a sign on the front door: typhoid fever. No admission to strangers.' Peace returned to the home. Danuta faced more sadness in January 1982, when she gave birth to their seventh child, Maria Wiktoria, while Walesa was imprisoned during martial law. The baby's christening drew crowds, but Walesa's absence was painfully felt by his wife. Jealousy also came into play. She complains that her husband used the same term of affection - 'little frog' - with other women, just as with her. She is also rueful that despite all of Poland's sacrifices, and its leading role in triggering change in the revolutionary year of 1989, many people today think mostly of the fall of the Berlin Wall as the watershed moment. 'Unfortunately, it is not the flower-decorated Gate 2 of the Gdansk Shipyard in 1980, but the crumbling Berlin Wall in 1989 that has become the symbol of the freedom and unity of Europe,' she writes. Danuta Walesa was briefly in the international spotlight on Dec. 10, 1983, when she traveled to Oslo to receive the Nobel peace prize on her husband's behalf. He was recognised for his fight against communism but feared that if he left the country, the communist authorities wouldn't let him back in. She complains that he essentially ordered her to go without first asking her how she felt about doing so. Now she is glad she went. 'It was a lesson in life for me, a wonderful lesson. I shed my complexes, my fear that I am not capable of doing something, that I cannot cope,' she says. 'I am very grateful to my husband for that.' Guests: The former Polish presidents, Walesa and Aleksander Kwasniewski watch from the balcony during the first session of the new Polish Parliament in Warsaw this year . Lech Walesa has defended himself against some of her accusations by arguing that he could not consult with her during the Solidarity years because the secret police had bugged their home. He also felt home life had to be sacrificed for a higher calling. 'I needed to have my hands free for the country,' he said in an interview this week in the daily newspaper Fakt. Danuta Walesa, born Danuta Golos in 1949 in Krypy, a hamlet in central Poland, was the second of nine children of poor farmers. From her earliest years she dreamed of seeing more of the world and in 1968 moved to Gdansk, where she found work as a florist. Walesa walked into her shop one day that same year. Though she says she wasn't particularly impressed with him at first, he courted her persistently and they were married a year later. After Walesa served his single term as president, he has kept busy traveling the world giving lectures on his unique role in Poland's history, though they still live together in a house in Gdansk and celebrate his birthday together every year with a crowd of visitors. He now devotes a lot of time to his love of computers. 'Some eight or 10 years ago ... my husband traded me in for a computer, which he sometimes admits himself,' Danuta writes. Lech Walesa insists that he always loved his wife, though he admits 'it is not the same as it was' early on. Danuta Walesa dedicated the book to her children.","Denuta, 62, felt neglected as she raised their eight children .

"By . Tom Kelly . Last updated at 2:13 AM on 19th November 2011 . Shackled and sombre, Adrian Prout finally leads detectives to the grave of the wife he murdered. The former businessman was driven from prison to the £1.6million country estate he shared with retired teacher Kate Prout during their seven-year marriage. The 49-year-old had always denied harming his wife, claiming that she stormed out  on Bonfire Night in 2007 to ‘wind him up’ following a series of rows. Prout (pictured right getting out of the van) arrived at the farm in handcuffs late this morning. He is expected to direct officers to the precise spot where he buried his wife's body . Police today focused on an area of woodland where Prout guided them during a 25 minute visit to the 276-acre farm . Wedding day: The Prouts in 2000. The shock admission came four years after Mrs Prout, a retired schoolteacher mysteriously vanished . But although her body was never found, a jury convicted him of murder last year. Yesterday Prout was taken in a . Mercedes Viano people carrier from Garth prison, near Blackpool, to his . former home at Redhill Farm, Redmarley, Gloucestershire. At the gates of the 276-acre estate . he was transferred to a marked police car and driven down a track . towards woodland to identify the spot where he is believed to have . hidden his wife’s body. Prout’s girlfriend, Debbie  Garlick, 40, who has a young daughter with the killer, lived  at Redhill Farm until two  weeks ago. She relentlessly campaigned for his . release and even offered £10,000 of her own money as a reward for . information which would prove his innocence. A sheet is erected close to a spot where police believe the body of Kate Prout will be . A large cordon has been formed around the area where Kate Prout's body is believed to have been buried . Police stood guard outside the house as other officers started digging in woodland close to the farm . But in a tearful confession this . week, Prout told Miss Garlick he had strangled his 55-year-old wife . before burying her. Last night she told ITV: ‘Myself and my family are . obviously devastated.’ She said she had not made any firm plans for the future. Prout admitted the murder three . months after failing a lie detector test which his family and Miss . Garlick had begged him to take in the hope that it would exonerate him. Don Cargill, chairman of the British . and European Polygraphy Association, who conducted the test, said . Prout’s heart rate, blood pressure, sweat and breathing patterns were . monitored as he was asked if he killed his wife. Mr Cargill said after failing, Prout gave a wry smile and admitted that the findings  were correct. ‘I told him that according to my . tests, he was clearly a murderer. But he only smiled again in what was . one of the most surreal and chilling experiences of my life.’ It is hoped that Mrs Prout's body will be found soon so that her grieving family can finally lay her to rest . This aerial image shows the specialist equipment drafted in by police as they prepare to dig up an area of woodland within the 276-acre estate . Dozens of police vehicles were today dotted around the farm including diggers and 4x4s.

And if Australia's prime minister Julia Gillard was half-hearted when she welcomed the Queen to her country last month, she certainly did not hold back with Barack Obama. The pair exchanged a warm embrace on the tarmac at Canberra airport as the president flew in for a whirlwind visit before heading on to Indonesia.

Reception: Mr Obama was also greeted by Australian Governor General Quentin Bryce (right) and US Ambassador to Australia Jeffrey Bleich (second from left) They later held a joint press conference in which they unveiled . plans to deepen the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific, with . 2,500 U.S. marines operating out of a de facto base in northern . Australia. U.S. troops and aircraft will operate . out of the tropical city of Darwin, only 820 kms from Indonesia, able . to respond quickly to any humanitarian and security issues in Southeast . Asia, where disputes over sovereignty of the South China Sea are causing . rising tensions. 'With my visit to the region, I am . making it clear that the United States is stepping up its commitment to . the entire Asia-Pacific region,' Mr Obama said. 'It is appropriate for us to make . sure...that the security architecture for the region is updated for the . 21st century and this initiative is going to allow us to do that.' Biggest fan: Mrs Gillard smiles up at Mr Obama during a press conference in Canberra . Partnership: Mr Obama revealed that U.S. troops are to be stationed in Australia for the first time since World War Two . Light touch: The pair exit the stage after holding the press conference . Mr Obama said he was deeply concerned about the euro zone crisis and warned that market turmoil would continue until Europe has a concrete plan to deal with its sovereign debt worries. His comments came as equity markets fell in response to a sell-off in euro zone bond markets. 'Until we put in place a concrete plan and structure that sends a clear signal to the markets that Europe is standing behind the euro and will do what it takes, we are going to continue to see the kinds of market turmoil we saw,' he said. He added that while there had been progress in putting together unity governments in Italy and Greece, Europe still faced a 'problem of political will' rather than a technical problem. 'We're going to continue to advise European leaders on what options we think would meet the threshold where markets would settle down. It is going to require some tough decisions on their part. 'Ultimately, what they are going to need is a firewall that sends a clear signal - we stand behind the European project, we stand behind the euro.' The U.S. deployment to Australia is . likely to add to China's concerns that Washington is trying to encircle . it with bases in Japan and South Korea and now troops in Australia. But Mr Obama stressed that China was not being isolated. 'The notion that we fear China is . mistaken. The notion that we are looking to exclude China is mistaken,' he said, adding China was not being excluded from the planned . Trans-Pacific Partnership (TTP) on trade. 'We welcome a rising, peaceful . China,' he added before saying that the country's rising power means it . must take on greater responsibilities to ensure free trade and security . in the region. 'It's important for them to play by . the rules of the road and, in fact, help underwrite the rules that have . allowed so much remarkable economic progress,' he said. The U.S. deployment to Australia, the . largest since World War Two, will start next year with a company of . 200-250 marines in Darwin, the 'Pearl Harbour of Australia', Mrs Gillard . said. More bombs were dropped on Darwin during a surprise Japanese raid than on Pearl Harbour, Hawaii. A total of 2,500 U.S. troops would . eventually rotate through the port city. The United States will bring in . ships, aircraft and vehicles, as well as increase military training. China has already expressed concern about the plan. An . editorial in The Global Times, a government-controlled paper, warned . that Australia could be 'caught in the crossfire' if it allowed the U.S. to use its military bases to harm Chinese interests.

Pledge: Mrs Gillard watches as Mr Obama sings the U.S. national anthem . Dinner: President Barack Obama and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard walk to their table at Parliament House . Mr Obama landed in Australia amid a security alert after it emerged documents indicating possible locations he could visit were left in view. Documents detailing places that U.S. secret service agents had visited in order to check out possible locations the the Commander in Chief could visit while in the city were left on the front seat of an unmanned old van - visible to anyone who peered in. There could have been major security problems if the papers had been viewed by terrorists who could have targeted the buildings should they have been chosen as places to visit by the President. A team of local drivers employed by the U.S. secret service was asked to drop their time sheets, detailing schools and others buildings they had taken agents to, through the window of the van which was parked at the rear of a hotel. One local driver claimed he was sacked for refusing to send timesheets - showing where a U.S. agent from the U.S Department of Homeland Security had been - unaccompanied in a taxi to the hotel car park where the papers were to be dropped through the van's window. That particular time sheet detailed suburbs and buildings that the agent had visited last week, Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported. The driver said the papers revealed various places the agent had visited to check them out on behalf of the President. China stands for 'peaceful . development and cooperation'. Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said . when asked about the proposed deepening of military cooperation. 'We also believe that the external . policies of countries in the region should develop along these lines,' Liu told a regular news briefing in Beijing. Some Asian nations are likely to . welcome the U.S. move as a counterbalance to China's growing military . power, especially its expanding maritime operations, and a reassurance . that Washington will not scale back its engagement in the region due to a . stretched U.S. military budget. 'The United States hopes to . militarily strengthen alliance relations with Japan in the north and . with Australia in the south, with the clear intention of . counter-balancing China,' Su Hao, the director of the Asia-Pacific . Researcher Centre at the Foreign Affairs University in Beijing, told the . Global Times, a popular Chinese newspaper. The winding down of wars in . Afghanistan and Iraq has opened the door to greater U.S. attention to . simmering tension over the South China Sea, a shipping lane for more . than $5 trillion in annual trade that the United States wants to keep . open. Obama plans to raise maritime . security in the South China Sea at a regional summit on Bali this week, . defying China's desire to keep the sensitive topic off the agenda. China claims the entire maritime . region, a vital commercial shipping route rich in oil, minerals and . fishery resources. It insists that any disputes be resolved through . bilateral talks and says Washington has no business getting involved. Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, . Malaysia and Brunei hold rivals claims to at least parts of the sea and . tension occasionally flares up into maritime stand-offs. Obama will make an 'anchor speech' outlining the U.S. vision for the Asia-Pacific to the Australian . parliament on Thursday before a whistle stop in Darwin.

The secret to beating Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, could be as simple as a potent vaccine, scientists have discovered. But the injection would need to be given at the earliest stages of the disease, before any of the symptoms of Alzheimer's are evident. By preventing the disease from taking hold in the first place, researchers hope to pave the way to completely eradication. Early treatment: U.S. scientists have found that any vaccine for Alzheimer's would have to be given at the very earliest stages of the disease . However U.S. scientists still need to develop the vaccine, and to fine tune early detection of the disease. Alzheimer's is a progressive, physical disease which affects the brain by destroying links between the cells. Initial signs include forgetfulness, but it can lead to sufferers undergoing a complete personality change and being unable to talk or walk. Researchers at Georgetown University, in Washington DC, found that an . antibody for Alzheimer’s disease is more likely to trigger inflammation . in the brain the later it is given. The study adds to evidence that early intervention with any new antibody treatment is therefore likely to be important. Researchers tested an antibody called PFA1 on mice that had been bred with Alzheimer’s symptoms. Debilitating: Alzheimer's is a progressive, physical disease which affects the brain by destroying links between the cells . The antibody was designed to clear . amyloid, a protein that builds in the brains of people with the . disease. Although PFA1 reduced the amount of . amyloid in the brain, mice that had more amyloid in their brains at the . start of the study were more likely to show signs of inflammation after treatment. Those . with lower levels of amyloid - imitating humans in the early stages of . the disease - did not experience the same level of swelling and showed a . significant benefit from the vaccine. The scientists presented their findings at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience. The research is significant both . because it suggests that those in the early stages of the disease - . with lower levels of amyloid - will benefit most from the vaccine. It also give clues as to why inflammation happens. The study’s lead investigator, Dr R Scott Turner, said that patients often show no symptoms of inflammation. Dr Turner said: 'Excessive inflammation is counter-productive because it will limit the benefits of the vaccine treatment, and in a few cases, will cause new problems.' He added: 'We may find that in the future, we will have to tailor immunisation therapies based on amyloid burden in individual patients.' Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: 'This study adds to increasing evidence suggesting that an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease will need to be given early to have a positive effect. 'The value of a vaccine is dependent on the ability to identify people who are in the very early stages of the condition' 'Although this particular drug was not . designed for use in people, we would need to see large-scale clinical . trials before we can know whether any new drugs could benefit people . with Alzheimer’s, and we’ll need to test them early. 'We are still hamstrung by a lack of accurate early detection for Alzheimer’s, a major obstruction to trialling new treatments effectively. 'Research into diagnosis is crucial if potential new treatments are to have the best chance of success. 'We already know that inflammation may play a role in Alzheimer’s disease, and it will be important to follow this up. 'If we can understand what happens in the brain as Alzheimer’s progresses, we stand a better chance of being able to intervene.' Dr Anne Corbett, of the Alzheimer’s Society, also welcomed the research, but warned that early detection of the disease was still very difficult. She said: 'Finding a vaccine would be an exciting and life changing matter for people living with Alzheimer’s. 'However the value of a vaccine is dependent on the ability to identify people who are in the very early stages of the condition which alone is a challenge. 'This is very early research and we don’t yet know if this vaccine could actually improve symptoms in humans.' Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, which is a group of symptoms associated with a decline in mental abilities, such as memory and reasoning. The disease attacks nerves, brain cells and neurotransmitters (chemicals that carry messages to and from the brain). Early symptoms include: . These symptoms change as Alzheimer’s, which is progressive, develops, and it may lead to: . Alzheimer's disease is most common in people over 65 years of age, and affects slightly more women than men. The Alzheimer’s Society estimates that, in people over 65 years of age, 1 in 14 is affected by Alzheimer’s disease. The risk increases with age, and people who are over 80 years of age are thought to have a one in six chance of developing the condition.

A woman blighted by a severe food intolerance which restricted her to a rice-only diet is preparing for her first Christmas dinner in over a decade. Former caterer Micaela Stafford, 53, lost 3st as her body started violently reacting to foods that included dairy, gluten, wheat, sugars, oils and fats. She used to enjoy fried breakfasts, curries and roast dinners but was limited to bowls of boiled rice following physical reactions to nearly everything she ate. No pain with grain: Micaela Stafford, 53, used to survive on a daily diet of rice because she was allergic to almost all other foods . Her unusual condition had left dieticians, . gastroenterologists and even neurologists baffled. With no solution she was forced to give up her . job and became housebound as her condition took control, leaving her husband Philip increasingly concerned. For the past twelve Christmases she had to watch as her family tucked into their roast dinners while she sat with a portion of bland rice. She told MailOnline: 'Every year my condition got worse. The first year it was Christmas pudding that I couldn't handle and last Christmas I could only manage one sprout.' Mrs Stafford is preparing for her first Christmas dinner in over a decade following a nutritionist's recommendation . But in a dramatic turnaround the mother-of-two, from Normanton on Soar, Leicestershire  has overcome her debilitating illness which began in 1999. After her story gained publicity earlier this year clinical nutritionist Diana Earnshaw got in touch via Facebook and suggested she should try slowly introducing new foods into her diet, and now Mrs Stafford is able to tolerate 40 different foods. Mrs Stafford said: ‘When Diana got in touch, I thought it was worth a try, I'd tried everything else.’ Mrs Stafford is now on the hunt for a suitable stuffing recipe . Following the new diet plan she started by consuming nothing but clear meat broth, made from boiled chicken carcasses which contained only 10 to 14 calories per dish. Eventually she was able to introduce stand-alone dishes, such as omelets and lamb chops, as her body built up resistance. Now miraculously she is busy gearing up for her Christmas dinner which she will spend with her husband Philip and eldest son Michael, 34. She said: 'I didn't believe this would ever be able to happen, I'm really looking for to people coming around and enjoying food again. 'We are planning on having turkey, sprouts, carrots, green beans, parsnips and potatoes, which will be cooked in goose grease, as this is an oil I can tolerate. 'Unfortunately there will be no mince pies or Christmas pudding but I might be able to manage some banana and coconut milk.' She is also on the hunt for a stuffing recipe that will adhere to her dietary needs. 'There is a local organic farm nearby and I'm hoping they can make me up a special recipe. 'They have gluten free sausage meat and I'm hoping they can combine it with chestnuts.' Prolonged migraines, sickness, diarrhoea and joint pains were all symptoms caused by the allergy that remains undiagnosed. A number of surveys have found that 20 to 30 per cent of people in the UK now claim to have a food allergy. Mrs Stafford added: 'I really didn't think I would be eating Christmas dinner, but now it's mid November it really seems like a reality. But I still have a long way to go.'","Woman lost 3st as her body violently reacted to nearly all foods .

"By . Lucy Buckland . Last updated at 3:22 PM on 18th November 2011 . Former soldier Shaun Clark has turned himself into a living memorial to pay his respects to service personnel killed in Afghanistan. Mr Clark has 383 names of those killed in the line of duty tattooed onto his chest, his back and even one of his legs. The 45-year-old, who started the practice in 2009, has the new names added each Remembrance Day, beginning at exactly 11am. This year, there were 40 names, which were tattoed onto his leg. Lest we forget: Shaun Clark has the name of every soldier killed in Afghanistan tattooed on his body . Sadly the list already needs updating - the latest deaths in the conflict will be added next Remembrance Day. Mr Clark went under the needle last week at Doncaster's Fantasy Studio where artist Kevin Kent worked for two hours adding the names. The former soldier, now a court security officer, served with the 8th Battalion Light Infantry Regiment from 1989 to 1996. He began having the tattoos on . Remembrance Day in 2009 when more than 300 names were inked onto his torso. Ever year since then, at the 11th hour on Remembrance Day, he has added the dead from the previous twelve months. In the process he has managed to raise more than £4,500 for the Help for Heroes charity through sponsorship. Roll of honour: Shaun Clark has 40 more names added this Remembrance Day, starting at 11am . 'Sadly the number keeps going up': But former soldier Shaun Clark said his son Peter will take over when he has run out of space . Good cause: Shaun Clark has raised more than £4,500 for the Help for Heroes charity . Mr Clark, who lives with his wife . Mandy, 44, and  two sons Peter, 22, and 19-year-old Robert in Rossington, . Doncaster, admits his family thought he was mad when he started having . the tattoos. He said: 'I have a lot of friends who have served in Afghanistan and some who are over there now. 'I wanted to do something to keep what is . going on over there in people's minds rather than just a sponsored walk . or parachute jump or something like that. 'I had more than 300 names tattooed on my body in 2009. 'It took more than five hours and it was painful but it was worth it. 'I added more names the following Remembrance Day and this year another 40 were tattooed on my leg. 'Sadly, the number just keeps going up and so I know I will be having more names added on November 11, 2012. 'I have made contingency plans in case I run out of space on my body. 'If the deaths keep rising my son Peter will take over from me.' But Shaun said there is a downside to being well-known. 'The only problem is I keep having to take off my shirt to show my tattoos to people. 'Word has spread over the years and I am asked almost every day to show someone the names,' he said. 'Solicitors at court ask to see them and the other day a judge asked me if he could take a look.'","Names of the dead are added each Remembrance Day .

"By . Lauren Paxman . Last updated at 5:41 PM on 16th November 2011 . Casualty departments are being given a 'calming' overhaul in a bid to stop patients losing their temper with staff. From clearer information on waiting times and treatment to a refurbishment of waiting rooms, measures are being put in place to reduce anxiety in a hospital's busiest department. It comes after figures show attacks on Health Service workers have risen to record levels, with almost 60,000 assaults on NHS staff in England reported during 2010-11. Under attack: Designers, . psychologists and healthcare experts were commissioned to come up with . innovative ways to keep people calm in waiting rooms and protect NHS workers . New features are likely to include bus stop-style screens with live updates to keep people up to date with waiting times. A Department of Health spokeswoman said that designers, . psychologists and healthcare experts were commissioned to come up with . innovative ways to keep people calm in waiting rooms. The year-long project, which was run . by the Design Council, discovered ways to ease patients' frustration and . anxiety and to help them understand why they might have to wait, the . spokeswoman said. Patients are likely to see screens . giving live updates about the number and types of cases that staff are . dealing with. Waiting rooms will also display clear signs and maps . explaining the different stages of treatment. A new approach should be taken to how patients are greeted in the units, it was suggested. For managers planning refurbishments, there is specific advice about lighting, decor and seating. The suggestions will now be tested in . three NHS Foundation Trusts - Chesterfield Royal Hospital, University . Hospital Southampton and Guy's and St Thomas' in London. Attacks on NHS staff are thought to cost at least £69 million a year, the spokeswoman said. Calming measures: Three NHS Foundation Trusts, Chesterfield Royal . Hospital, University Hospital Southampton and Guy's and St Thomas' in . London (pictured), will trial new ideas . Figures published last week showed there were 57,830 assaults on doctors, . nurses, paramedics and ambulance crews in England during 2010/11 – up . 1,112 compared with the year before. Almost 70 per cent of the attacks . involved patients not responsible for their actions because of  medical . conditions, an adverse reaction to  treatment, mental health problems or . severe  learning difficulties. Fewer than one in 40 attacks ended in a prosecution. Health Minister Simon Burns said any violence and aggression towards staff is 'totally unacceptable'. 'NHS staff work hard to save lives . every day and they should be able to carry out their work without fear . of assault, be it verbal or physical,' he said. 'We want to safeguard staff and . patients and that is why we asked the Design Council to look at helping A . and E departments become calmer and safer environments. Concerns: Dr Peter Carter said that one attack on a NHS staff member was too much . 'These are practical solutions to help . support and reduce the pressure on busy staff - ways in which hospitals . can easily redesign the environment according to their budget and how . difficult situations can be diffused by simply giving patients more . information.' Design Council chief executive officer . David Kester added: 'For not much more than £60,000 hospitals can now . quickly and easily install this system which could significantly reduce . the burden of aggression from patients.' Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and . general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, last week raised the . concern that attacks could increase further if NHS budget cutbacks . affect services. He said ‘I am appalled by the fact that nearly 58,000 physical assaults . have taken place in England against our hard working NHS staff this . year. ‘Quite frankly one is too many. No one goes to work expecting to be . assaulted and this is all the more upsetting when we consider that some . members of the public are attacking the very people trying to help them. ‘Assaults on staff are never justified, but the worry is that if . pressures increase and people wait longer, the levels of frustration . will rise. 'It is somewhat reassuring that sanctions have increased and I hope that . this will go some way towards acting as a deterrent. Everything must be . done to prevent members of the public from carrying out threatening or . violent acts, and those that choose to do so should be made to face the . consequences. ‘It is high time Trusts step up and look to invest more in prevention . and protecting their staff from assaults in the first place.’ Christina McAnea, the Unison union’s head of health, said: ‘The increase in violence is a national disgrace. It is no good saying some of these assaults were the result of patients’ medical conditions. ‘It is clear that urgent action is needed to look after staff.’","Patients to get more information on waiting times and treatment .

Jade Lucas, 20, almost died when a huge cyst in her brain filled with fluid - and burst when surgeons drilled open her skull to operate. The fluid began to pour from Jade's brain during the operation, but doctors carried on with the surgery and saved her life. Jade has had an arachnoid cyst and excess fluid in her brain since she was born. She has undergone brain surgery 15 . times at Great Ormond Street Hospital - but has now been told by doctors . she is unlikely to need any more major surgery for years. The . college student, from Horley, Surrey, said: 'I couldn't believe it when . I was told what had happened during my surgery - I don't think the . doctors had ever had to dodge brain fluid during an operation before. 'I'm . told I was lucky to survive after such high pressure in my brain. I . can't thank the doctors and nurses who saved my life enough.' Despite . making a full recovery, Jade still relies on a shunt inserted into her . brain to keep her alive - which drains fluid directly into her heart - . to prevent it collecting in her skull. Her condition is so severe that doctors spotted a dark mass on her brain before she was even born - on an ultrasound scan. Just months after she was born, Jade's mum noticed one side of her head growing faster than the other - and a brain scan revealed she was suffering from an arachnoid cyst. The cyst was already too big to remove, and surgeons inserted the shunt into Jade's brain to drain the fluid. Jade said: 'I've known about my condition all my life, so I've been used to going in and out of hospital for operations. 'I went for a routine check up the day before I started college, and doctors noticed a lot of pressure behind my eye - and discovered my optic nerve had been bleeding. Jade is still suffering, she said: 'One day I'll feel perfectly normal, but the next I might not be able to get out of bed due to blinding headaches' 'I'd already had a shunt implanted in . my head as a child that was supposed to drain fluid away - but it had . somehow broken, and fluid was building up fast. 'They told me I needed an emergency operation for surgeons to release the pressure, as the cyst was growing bigger and bigger. 'If it got any bigger, it could have caused brain damage. 'If my shunt stops draining, I have four hours to get treated before things get very dangerous. 'I've since found out there was so much fluid under pressure in my head it had literally exploded when surgeons opened up my skull. Recovery process: Jade has undergone brain surgery 15 times at Great Ormond Street Hospital, but still manages to stay upbeat . A shunt is a delicate piece of equipment that's prone to malfunction, usually through blockage or infection. It's estimated that up to 4 out of 10 shunts will malfunction in the first year after surgery. Sometimes a scan carried out after the operation shows that the shunt isn't in the best position, and that further surgery may be needed to reposition it.If a baby or child has a shunt fitted, the shunt may become too small as your child grows, and it will need to be replaced. As most people need to have a shunt for the rest of their life, more than one replacement may be needed.It's estimated that most children with hydrocephalus may have an average of two procedures for shunt problems before they're 10 years old.A shunt blockage can be very serious because it can lead to an excess build-up of fluid on the brain, which can cause brain damage. Shunt infection is also a relatively common complication. The risk of infection can be around 3-15% and is more likely to occur during the first few months after surgery. Source: NHS . 'When I'd recovered, a nurse told me . the minute the surgeon had drilled into my skull, the fluid came . spurting out - and he had to jump out of the way.' Jade slipped into a coma following the operation, and doctors told her terrified mum she might not survive. Over the next week, she had four further operations on her brain, but amazingly, managed to pull through. Surgeons were eventually able to fit another brain shunt. And after a further 15 months of operations and hospital appointments, she was finally able to start a college course. Jade said: 'I try to just get on with things, but the condition does affect my day-to-day life quite a lot. 'One day I'll feel perfectly normal, but the next I might not be able to get out of bed due to blinding headaches and pressure behind my eyes making it painful to see anything bright - even daylight. 'Sometimes I wake up with a headache and feel well enough to go to college, but within a few hours I have such a crippling pain in my head it feels like it is going to burst. 'However, my new shunt has now been problem-free for two years, which is a good sign, as 50 per cent of shunts fail within 24 months. 'I hope now I'll be one of the lucky ones - and my shunt could last me a good 25 years before I'll need another operation.'","Jade Lucas has had an arachnoid cyst and excess fluid in her brain since birth which has been operated on 15 times .

Researchers say the Pill has soared in popularity over the past 40 years, and at the same time prostate cancer has become the most common form of the disease in men. There is a statistical relationship between the two trends, possibly driven by men’s greater exposure to the oestrogen hormone contained in the Pill. Long-term effects: Regions where use of the Pill is commonplace have higher incidents of prostate cancer,  a study has found . Widespread use of the Pill has led to . more of the hormone finding its way into the water supply and food . chain, with implications for human health, says a study in BMJ Open. Using data from 87 countries, . researchers found that where the proportion of women using the . contraceptive pill is higher, rates of prostate cancer are higher. Several recent studies have suggested that oestrogen exposure may boost the risk of prostate cancer (pictured) Other contraceptives such as . intrauterine devices or condoms were not linked to a higher incidence of . prostate cancer. A team of researchers from Canada used two sets of . data to pinpoint rates of prostate cancer and associated deaths and the . proportion of women using common methods of contraception for 2007. Use of the contraceptive pill was . significantly associated with the number of new cases of prostate cancer . around the world, in findings which were not affected by a nation’s . wealth and therefore probably not influenced by better detection through . screening and health services. The research is speculative and . definitive conclusions cannot be drawn, said research leader Dr David . Margel, of the Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto University. But excess exposure to oestrogen is . known to cause cancer and the study suggests that widespread use of the . Pill has resulted in by-products called endocrine disruptors being . deposited in the environment. These do not break down easily in the . body so can be passed into urine and end up in the water supply or the . food chain, thus exposing the general population. Dr Kate Holmes, of The Prostate Cancer . Charity, said: ‘This study does not present a strong evidence case for . an association between the use of the contraceptive pill and prostate . cancer, nor does it intend to. ‘It is intended to explore the . possibility that release of endocrine disruptive chemicals (EDCs) into . the environment, a process which is not unique to the Pill, might impact . on the incidence of the disease. ‘However, for all of the 87 countries . in the study, there is no information on the level of these chemicals in . the environment, with the focus on the contraceptive pill as the sole . source, which we know is not the case.’","Excess exposure linked to cancer, and it is thought that widespread use of the Pill may have led to more oestrogen entering water supply and food chain ."

Manchester United and England star Wayne Rooney has been rocked by the news his father and uncle are among nine people arrested by police investigating a football betting scam. The officers swooped at dawn on . the £450,000 home of Wayne Snr while his son was in Montenegro with the national team as they bid to secure a place in Euro 2012. Manager Fabio . Capello insisted Rooney had not been upset by his father's arrest. Coleen, Wayne and Wayne Rooney Snr . Looking relaxed: England's Wayne Rooney during a training session at the City Stadium in Podgorica, Montenegro, today . 'I found him relaxed and calm,' Capello said. 'There is no problem for the game, he will play against . Montenegro. He told me there are no problems.' The police are probing a rash of suspicious bets placed on a . sending-off in a SPL match last year. The investigation centres on the red card given to Motherwell's Steve Jennings in a match against Hearts 10 months ago. The former Tranmere Rovers player, who hails from Kirkby, near Liverpool, was arrested at his home in Scotland. The investigation comes at a bad time . for Rooney, who has been working to clean up his image following . damaging revelations about his private life. It emerged that the £180,000-a-week Manchester United star had slept with prostitutes while his wife, Coleen, was pregnant. On duty: Wayne Rooney (centre) trained today with Phil Jones and Danny Welbeck (left) while his father was questioned . Steve Jennings was arrested after allegedly getting himself sent off deliberately during a match . But Rooney's estranged cousin Stephen, 27, a homosexual and cross dresser, said the arrests were 'embarrassing'. 'It's hysterical, but I'm quite . surprised it's just the two,' he said. 'And they have the cheek to tell . me that putting a dress on is embarrassing for the family.' A spokesman for Merseyside Police . confirmed nine men, aged between 22 and 68, had been arrested in . Liverpool and Glasgow on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud as part of a . joint operation with the Gambling Commission into suspicious betting. Wayne Rooney Snr, footballer Wayne's father, is one of the nine people being questioned over an alleged betting scam . There was no sign yesterday of . unemployed Wayne Snr, a 48-year-old former boxer, at the home he shares . with Rooney's mother, Jeanette, in West Derby, Liverpool. Anthony Barnfather, the lawyer . representing him, said: 'Mr Rooney vigorously denies all of these . allegations. We are co-operating fully with the investigation. No . further comment will be made at this time.' Neighbours at 54-year-old Richie . Rooney's home, in Croxteth, Liverpool, confirmed a police car had been . parked outside the modest semi in the early hours. He refused to comment . when he returned home on bail yesterday afternoon. Members of the Press soon arrived outside the house of Wayne Rooney snr this afternoon . He spent 20 minutes inside before . being driven off in a Ford Focus by his daughter, Claire. One visitor, . who described himself as a member of the family, said: 'He doesn't know . anything about all this.' England captain John Terry, who has . experienced media attention on his own family, also backed Rooney. 'Wayne is focused on the game tomorrow,' Terry said. 'We all realise the importance of . that. It's important for him to go out there and play his football, . which he loves doing. He'll always be fully focused on the pitch.' Police were alerted after the . Association of British Bookmarkers raised concerns about a number of . irregular bets, ranging from £200 to £500, on Jennings being red-carded. Some of the activity is understood to have taken place via a new account opened in Liverpool – Rooney's home town. One bet of £500, placed at odds of 10/1, netted £5,000. Jennings had already been booked by referee Stevie O'Reilly when he was shown a straight red card seven minutes from time. The 26-year-old reportedly asked the referee when he was going to 'stop cheating' Motherwell. Speaking in the wake of the incident, . Jennings said: 'I want to make it clear I had no involvement whatsoever . in any betting scam. 'I want to clear my name as quickly as possible.' It is understood Jennings became friends with the Rooney family after striking up a friendship with Richie's son, Thomas, 26. By last night all nine men had been released on bail.","Seizures relate to SPL clash last year between Motherwell and Hearts .

A teenage cancer sufferer had part of his leg removed and treated at a hospital three miles away before it was put back in while he was still on the operating table. Matthew Willey, 15, had a foot-long piece of shin bone taken out for radiotherapy treatment in a 10-hour operation to save his leg after he was diagnosed with bone cancer. The schoolboy went to his GP in January with pain in his leg, and was referred to Leeds General Infirmary where he was warned by doctors he could lose the limb. He was sent to the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham and was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, after numerous tests. His mother Julie, 51, said: 'Matthew's reaction was, '""t can take my leg but it's not having my life"". 'We just went to bits.' The . brave teenager had intensive chemotherapy before undergoing the . operation where his tibia was removed and taken by the surgeon to Queen . Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham where it was irradiated to tackle the cancer and then re-implanted. The bone had to be taken to Queen Elizabeth because the paediatric ward Matthew was being operated in did not have the right equipment. His . father William, 42, said: 'We were relieved they were going to save his . leg because the feedback at first was that he was going to lose it. 'It's better to have your own bone in there with a metal pin, and it will knit back together.' After ten days in hospital, Matthew returned home and restarted chemotherapy at Leeds General Infirmary. X-ray: Matthew's leg is now held together by a metal pin after his shin bone was removed and replaced . Source: NHS . He is due to finish at Christmas but . will carry on being treated with new bone cancer drug mifamurtide, for . which doctors had to get specialist funding. The drug, which cuts the risk of death by nearly a third, has now been given the green light by NHS bosses. A metal frame has been inserted to hold Matthew's leg together and he has also had a skin graft. Matthew's parents, who are foster carers, said their son has been an inspiration and praised the care he has received. Julie said: 'It's been an awful ten months but he has never once given in. He's been as brave as anything.' Dr Simone Wilkins, Matthew's consultant at Leeds General Infirmary, said: 'In Matthew's case, surgeons used his own bone which was removed, treated with radiotherapy and replaced, which is a technique which has been used for the last couple of years to try to avoid amputation.' Surgeons were unsure whether Matthew's unusual operation had worked until they removed the cast from his left leg two weeks ago following the operation on July 6 this year. William said: 'Matthew had to have a full cast from his groin downwards, completely covering his left leg and it was only when they took it off they said the operation had been a success. 'The surgeon was so dedicated, he took the bone out then took it himself to the other hospital to make sure everything was fine. 'The bone was out of his body for about three or four hours.' He added: 'They had quite a few options before the surgery - they could have amputated, which obviously nobody wanted - or they could have put a titanium piece in the leg to replace the bone, but there is a greater chance of infection then. 'Matthew has been incredibly brave throughout this, we're really proud of him. He's still having chemotherapy, which we hope will finish on Christmas Eve.'",'It can take my leg but it's not having my life': 15-year-old Matthew Willey refused to succumb to bone cancer .

A young cage fighter who died after being crushed by a cow's carcass in an abattoir was named as Ally McCrae. The fit 23-year-old mixed martial artist suffered terrible head injuries after becoming trapped underneath the heavy carcass which fell on him in the slaughterhouse in Paisley, Renfrewshire. It's believed he was washing his hands when the carcass fell from a hook and hit him on the head, triggering a fatal heart attack. He was rushed to hospital but surgeons were unable to save him. Mr McCrae's headtrainer John . Nicolson, who works at D-unit gym in Dumbarton, said: 'Ally was such a . joker and when I heard the bizarre circumstances of the accident . yesterday, I thought for a second that he might be playing a really . silly joke. 'It's such a . tragedy, none of us at the gym can quite believe what has happened. I . can honestly say he was very talented and was a promising mixed martial . artist. 'He was always at . the gym after work and, knowing what happened, it's going to be very . difficult not having him around. Ally was such a colourful character, he . will be terribly missed.' Mr McCrae, originally from Kilmarnock, moved to Dumbarton six months ago to be closer to the gym. The . budding sportsman had been working at the abattoir to fund his training . in mixed martial arts (MMA) but his friends said he dreamt of one day . having a full-time career from the sport. The Sandyford abattoir in Paisley was also the scene of a shooting last month . The horror accident happened at the Sandyford abattoir in Paisley, Renfrewshire, just after 1pm on Thursday. The . gates at the busy abattoir, which sits underneath the M8 motorway a . mile down the road from Glasgow Airport, remained shut today. Police and Health and Safety Executive . (HSE) officials have launched an investigation at the abattoir in . Paisley, Renfrewshire, the scene of an accidental shooting last month. An HSE spokesman confirmed that an investigation into the  death was under way. She . said the inquiry was being led by Strathclyde Police under the . ‘work-related death protocol’ and that HSE inspectors had attended the . abattoir. A Strathclyde . Police spokesman said: ‘A 23-year-old man sustained serious injuries . after being crushed by the carcass of a cow at Sandyford abattoir in . Paisley at around 1.05pm. 'He was taken to the Royal Alexandria Hospital, where he died a short time later. ‘Inquiries into the incident are continuing, the HSE has been informed and is in attendance.’ McCrae was killed when the heavy carcass fell from a hook (file picture) Last month, a 42-year-old Polish man was shot in the leg when an airgun was fired by accident during a ‘bit of horseplay’ at the abattoir. At the time, one witness said: ‘It seems the shooting was an accident. Two workers were mucking about and the gun went off.’ The abattoir, on the town’s Sandyford Road, slaughters cattle and sheep for on-site meat wholesalers and individual butchers. It also kills animals in the halal tradition for Muslim butchers and shops. A spokesman for the company refused to comment. Labour MP for Paisley Jim Sheridan said: 'It is a very sad thing that has happened. 'There was clearly something wrong with the health and safety at the abattoir and I urge the Health and Safety Executive to conduct a full investigation to make sure this doesn't happen again.' MSP for West of Scotland Neil Bibby said: 'This is a tragic incident and I would fully support it being fully investigated.'",Trainer leads tributes to promising fighter named as Ally McCrae .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:24 AM on 5th October 2011 . The future of animated TV comedy 'The Simpsons' was up in the air on Tuesday after 20th Century Fox Television said it could no longer afford to produce the show without a huge pay cut for its cast. Fox Television, a unit of News Corp, issued a tough statement after a report that it had threatened to end the subversive series unless the voice actors take a 45 per cent pay cut. 'We believe this brilliant series can and should continue, but we cannot produce future seasons under its current financial model,' Fox said. 'The Simpsons': Characters from the animated series - the longest running U.S. television comedy - from left, Maggie, Marge, Lisa, Homer and Bart Simpson . 'We are hopeful that we can reach an agreement with the voice cast that allows ""The Simpsons"" to go on entertaining audiences with original episodes for many years to come,' the statement added. 'The Simpsons' is the longest-running comedy series on U.S. television and is currently in its 23rd season on Fox. The show also generates billions of dollars through global syndication, as well as DVD and merchandise sales. The Fox statement followed a report on news website The Daily Beast that the principal voice cast members - including the voices for Homer (Dan Castellaneta), Marge (Julie Kavner), Bart (Nancy Cartwright) and Lisa (Yeardley Smith) - were having difficulty renegotiating contracts that currently see them earning around $8million each per season. The Daily Beast, quoting an unnamed insider, said the cast had tried unsuccessfully to negotiate a 30 per cent pay cut in return for a portion of the show's profits. Stars of the show: Actors Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner earn a reported $8million per season - each . Fox did not dispute the Daily Beast report. 'The Simpsons' is broadcast in more than 100 countries and 50 languages and has become a staple of American culture, with the family earning a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. TV industry sources said producers have enough episodes to keep the comedy on the air until the end of the 2011-12 TV season in May. But the sources said the dispute would need to be settled by December 2011, so that writers would be able to work on either the season finale, or the series finale, depending on the outcome of contract talks. Other members of the cast and crew are also being asked to take pay cuts, according to the sources. News Corp executives have said in recent weeks they are looking at ways to make more money from the show in the future, both in syndication rights and other areas. News Corp COO Case Carey told an investors conference on September 14 that executives had had a number of meetings in the past six months 'to look at opportunities from A to Z.' 'But I think you can imagine, whether it's channel, digital, ourselves, third parties, it's a series unique in television, with a volume to it that is unprecedented,' Mr Carey said, declining to give details. Mr Carey later jokingly brushed off a suggestion that a Simpson TV Channel might be underway. '(It) is a franchise that you can do a lot of things with. And I think we'll continue to evaluate what those are. But - and I wouldn't say we have in the drawing plans a Simpson Channel, although there's a lot of Simpson fans out there,' Mr Carey told financial analysts on September 21.","Longest-running U.S. television comedy in its 23rd season .

A cellist who had his memory almost completely wiped out by a serious brain infection stunned doctors because he is still able to remember music. The German, who played for a famous orchestra, was barely able to recall anything about his life before 2005. But despite being struck down by the condition which affects just one in half a million people, he was able to recognise the scale and rhythm of music he was played. Brain virus: The German, known only as PM, suffered from herpesviral encephaliti and had his memory almost completely wiped . In tests his musical memory was classified as 'normal' - even though the rest of his brain was so badly affected he could not remember the layout of his flat, the Guardian reported. The 71-year-old - known only as PM - has continued to play his cello in his own home. He suffered from an infection called herpesviral encephalitis which is extremely difficult to treat. The virus travels along nerves before getting into the brain. Neurologist Carsten Finke, based at Charite University Hospital, Berlin, said the case is significant as it could give doctors a new insight into how memories are stored. The case is similar to that of Clive Wearing, a conductor who was also hit by the virus. He is still able to play music despite remembering very little before he suffered from the rare condition in 1985. Neurologist Mr Finke told the Guardian that PM had effectively lost everything apart from his knowledge of music. 'He can hardly remember a thing. He has no memory of any personal or professional events,' he said. 'He is living in the moment, more or less. He has lost his whole life.' PM's brother and care worker were the only people he could recognise. The medial temporal lobes, used to remember important information, were very badly damaged by the virus. Mr Finke, speaking at a Society for Neuroscience event in Washington, said the case suggests that music is stored in a different part of the brain to other memories. Doctors played PM music he was familiar with before he was struck down by the virus in 2005. They then played him more recent work. Asked which he knew better, the cellist said said 93 per cent of the time it was the older music. However, when the newer music was later replayed to PM he said he was 'familiar' with it in 77 per cent of cases. Doctors are hopeful that they will be able to harness the cellist's ability to recall music as he recovers from the virus. It is thought it may be possible to use music to get him to perform certain tasks - such as taking his medication.","German musician was only able to recognise his brother and carer after being hit by rare virus .

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 6:10 PM on 17th November 2011 . After making an embarrassing blunder over foreign policy earlier this week, Herman Cain must have thought his geographical woes were behind him. But the presidential candidate outdid himself on the campaign trail yesterday after sampling local delicacies in Miami's Cuban community before asking: 'How do you say delicious in Cuban?' The GOP White House contender may have later realised that the national language of Cuba is in fact Spanish. Scroll down for video . Gaffe: Herman Cain had been sampling local delicacies in Little Havana, Miami, when he made the embarrassing blunder . Cain's latest linguistic blunder has capped a testing week for the presidential candidate . The gaffe did not seem to be too badly received by the assembled locals in Little Havana, where Cain had stopped for a scheduled visit. After sampling Cuban coffee and 'croquetas' of fried cheese and asking, 'How do you say delicious in Cuban?' an audience member humoured the presidential hopeful by answering, 'Delicioso'. Cain had stopped in South Florida yesterday to court voters in the state's Cuban-American and Jewish communities. The same day, Cain managed to blunder again when he misstated the year of one of his own political party's finest moments. In a speech at a rally at the Palm Beach County Convention Center, he said Republicans won back the House of Representatives from the Democrats in 2008, when in fact it happened last year. Memory lapse: Herman Cain hesitated when asked if he agreed with Obama's decision to back Libyan rebels in overthrowing Gaddafi in a video interview earlier this week . Uncomfortable: Cain fidgeted in his chair and crossed his legs as he struggled for words . He said: 'When the American people begin to ignite that American spirit, they make things happen, just like they made things happen in 2008 when the Republicans took back control of the House.' It has been a testing week for Cain on the campaign trail, as earlier this week he had fumbled when quizzed on foreign policy in Libya. The 65-year-old suffered his own Rick Perry 'Oops' moment when quizzed on his stance on Libya. He seemed to be at a loss for words when the editorial board of a Wisconsin newspaper asked if he supported President Obama's handling of the Libyan uprising. Video footage of the interview shows Cain squirming in his chair and not offering any kind of substantial answer for over a minute. When asked about his Wisconsin meltdown yesterday, Cain didn't exactly make his stance clear. Support: Gloria Cain spoke during a Fox News interview, saying her husband has 'too much respect for women' for the sexual harassment claims to be true . Happier times: Gloria Cain accompanies her husband Herman in May as he announces his run as a Republican candidate for President. She has spoken out in his defence as he battles sexual harassment allegations . He said: 'I get criticised, ""Well he doesn’t have extensive foreign policy experience,""’ Cain said, before then saying in reference to Obama: 'And the guy there now does?' Cain's number in the polls have dipped of late, especially with female voters following allegations of sexual harassment made against him. However, the presidential candidate and former boss of the National Restaurant Association has denied any wrongdoing. He has also been supported by his wife, who said in a Fox News interview that her husband 'has too much respect for women for any of the allegations to be true'.","Linguistic goof caps testing week for candidate .

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 7:46 PM on 17th November 2011 . A convicted sex offender who snatched a seven-year-old girl before raping and strangling her begged for forgiveness minutes before he was put to death. Guadalupe Esparza, 46, was sentenced to lethal injection for the brutal killing in San Antonio, Texas of Alyssa Maria Vasquez, who was murdered just after finishing the first grade in 1999. The child killer was administered with lethal drugs in Texas last night, but not before he had pleaded for forgiveness from Alyssa's family. Executed: Guadalupe Esparza begged for forgiveness minutes before he was given a lethal injection after being convicted of the murder of seven-year-old Alyssa Maria Vasquez . Relatives of the seven-year-old, including her mother Diana Berlanga, watched through a window as Esparza was strapped to a gurney in the death chamber with needles in his arms. Seconds before he was injected, the killer told Alyssa's family: 'I hope you will find peace in your heart. 'My sympathy goes out to you. I hope you find it in your heart to forgive me. I don't know why all of this happened.' Minutes earlier the girl's mother had entered the death chamber, seen Esparza on the gurney with needles in his arms and said, 'He's going to get what he deserves.' As the drugs took effect, Esparza appeared to go to sleep, taking several breaths before all movement stopped. He was pronounced dead at 6:21 p.m. CST — 11 minutes after the drugs were administered. Grieving mother: Diana Berlanga holds a photograph of her seven-year-old daughter Alyssa Vasquez, who became Guadalupe Esparza's victim in 1999 . Appeals were exhausted and no late legal maneuvers were made to keep Esparza from becoming the 13th Texas inmate to be put to death by the state this year. Alyssa's battered body was found in weeds behind a convenience store near her home hours after she was reported missing in June 1999. A baby sitter who discovered her gone identified Esparza as having visited the residence earlier that night. Berlanga, the girl's mother, told authorities at the time that she met Esparza at a bar and he'd been calling her even though she'd given him the brushoff. Police went to Esparza's apartment about two miles away and found some blood-spotted clothing of his in a trash bin. Semen on the slain girl's body was linked to him through DNA testing, and Esparza was charged with capital murder. 'He tried to blame it on somebody else,' Terry McDonald, one of his trial lawyers, said. 'He was not a very repentant individual ... just a constant denial that it wasn't him, the facts to the contrary.' A judge who authorized a review of DNA in the case was told last week the findings were consistent with the evidence during Esparza's 2001 trial, where his attorneys had challenged the validity of the results. His victim: Alyssa Vasquez (pictured) was raped and strangled to death, this is the shrine her mother created in her living room as a memory . Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review claims he was mentally impaired and ineligible for execution. Last month, the Texas Court of . Criminal Appeals rejected an attempt to renew that claim and others . questioning whether he had effective legal help at his trial. Investigators determined that blood on Esparza's clothing retrieved from the trash was his and not the slain girl's. But . a Bexar County Jail inmate testified Esparza told him he got rid of the . clothing because he didn't want detectives to think the blood came from . the child. Put to death: The family of Alyssa Maria Vasquez had watched through a window as Guadalupe Esparza was given a lethal injection at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (file picture) The Court of Criminal Appeals, in a 2003 ruling upholding his conviction and death sentence, said the discarded clothing provided some evidence of his awareness of guilt and the timing of his action showed knowledge of the crime. Esparza, against the advice of his lawyers, twice took the stand at his five-day murder trial, defiantly responding to prosecutors' questions and accusing them of coaching witnesses. 'He had a very inflated opinion of his abilities to con people,' McDonald said. Esparza had been convicted in the past for assault, sexual assault and cocaine possession. His execution is likely the last one this year in Texas, the nation's most active capital punishment state. The 13 executions this year are the lowest number the state has seen in 15 years. But the state already has at least five prisoners scheduled for lethal injection early next year.","Guadalupe Esparza killed schoolgirl in 1999 .

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is set to see the disappearance of his constituency Sheffield Hallam but he may have the last laugh as the net result could be two new Liberal Democrat seats in the city . Liberal Democrats yesterday threatened to vote down plans to reduce the number of MPs, as it was revealed the changes could mean several of the party's highest-profile ministers  lose their seats. Around a quarter of Lib Dems are affected by the redrawn constituency borders revealed by the Boundary Commission yesterday, compared with one in ten Labour MPs and a handful of Tories. Lib Dem party president Tim Farron, Transport Minister Norman Baker and Energy Secretary Chris Huhne will all see their seats carved up or merged with others. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable – whose seat is also at risk in the shake-up – took aim at the proposals yesterday, even though his party had vowed to  support them as part of the Coalition deal. Lord Tyler, the party’s constitutional affairs spokesman in the Lords, has indicated that Lib Dems will try to vote down the plans when they come to Parliament in 2013 following a two-year consultation. The Government wants to cut the number of MPs from 650 to 600 and ensure constituencies have a similar number of voters – around 76,000 – so that everyone’s vote counts equally. Despite Tory backing for the moves, David Cameron also faces a serious rebellion in his ranks from MPs who think the changes have been deliberately botched by the Boundary Commission to punish them for demanding such a radical shake-up. MPs inundated their whips with complaints yesterday, warning they too may vote down the proposals. Meanwhile Labour sources vowed to capitalise on the Lib Dem discontent and deliver a defeat to the Government. Senior party figures including Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, his wife, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, and Olympics spokesman Tessa Jowell will all see their seats disappear. Sources close to Nick Clegg made clear that the Deputy Prime Minister expects his Lib Dem MPs to vote for the changes, pointing out that the party’s election manifesto called for a reduction of 150 MPs in the Commons. The source said: ‘There will be MPs of all sides who do not like  the Boundary Commission’s conclusions. They have two years to make their case to the Boundary Commission. But these plans are in the Coalition agreement. ‘We have more to lose than the Tories if we go around suggesting that things in the Coalition agreement are negotiable.’ But Dr Cable took a markedly different line yesterday, saying: ‘In order to get the right size of constituency, no account has been taken not just of borough boundaries, but any sense of identity. That will cause a lot of concern.’ The plans will see Dr Cable’s Twickenham seat making way for a new Richmond and Twickenham constituency spanning the Thames.That could force him into a  face-off for the new seat with  high-profile Tory Zac Goldsmith, the MP for Richmond. Senior Tories reacted with fury to the Lib Dem complaints, pointing out that the party vowed to support the plans in exchange for holding last May’s referendum on the Alternative Vote. Mr . Clegg, as forecast could see his Sheffield Hallam seat (current . boundaries above) abolished and replaced with a new seat, Sheffield West . and Peniston (below) Losers: . The most prominent Tory casualty is Tatton in Cheshire, represented by . Chancellor George Osborne, left, and in the Labour ranks, shadow . chancellor Ed Balls will see his Morley and Outwood seat condemned. Other senior figures facing serious disruption or disappearance of their . seats are Cabinet ministers Ken Clarke, far right, and Chris Huhne, . second right. Iain Duncan Smith and Vince Cable will also be affected . BIGGEST ELECTORATES 1. Isle of Wight (Con) - 109,902 2. East Ham (Lab) - 90,674 3. Manchester Central (Lab) - 90,110 4.

'The legislation that set up this completely independent process was voted through Parliament. 'It would be eccentric indeed to reject the results.’ Justice Secretary Ken Clarke, whose Nottingham seat will disappear, backed the plans. He said: ‘At the moment your vote is far more important if you live in one of those places with small constituencies rather than one of those with big constituencies. 'It’s not really democratic.’ The Prime Minister’s official spokesman added: ‘It is for the boundary commissioners to decide where the constituency boundaries are drawn.’ But one Labour official said: ‘It’s just a series of ludicrous lines on a map. 'If Labour votes against these measures you would only need around 30 Lib Dems and a dozen Tories to rebel and the Government has a problem.’ A boundary change which would 'move' historic Gloucester Cathedral into the rural Forest of Dean Parliamentary constituency was condemned as 'madness' today. The Boundary Commission wants to take the Westgate ward of Gloucester out of the city constituency and include it in the Forest of Dean to balance up the electorate when the number of MPs is reduced. It would mean not just the 900-year-old cathedral but also Gloucester docks - the UK's most inland port -becoming part of the Forest constituency. Gloucester's Tory MP Richard Graham said today: 'It's absolutely barking. To remove the Westgate ward from the city of Gloucester would be like Hamlet without the Prince. It's not Gloucester.' Tony .

Eaglescliffe and Inglby, as well as Yarm . 1. Why is the review being carried out? The Government wants to make sure all constituencies have the same number of voters. At the moment people's votes can carry more or less weight depending on where they live . 2. How are the boundaries worked out? First . the electoral quota is calculated. This is the number of registered . electors in the UK divided by the number of constituencies. The current . electoral quota is 76,641. Every constituency in England – except two . covering the Isle of Wight – must have a number of registered electors . within 5 per cent of this figure. Using this quota, the Boundary Commission allocates the specified number of constituencies among the nine regions of England . 3. Can you comment on the proposals? Yes. All responses will be considered before the Boundary Commission decides . whether to publish revised proposals later in 2012, before making final . recommendations to the Secretary of State by 1 October 2013. 4. Will my MP or constituency be affected by the boundary changes? The . new rules mean that there must be 600 constituencies in the UK, as . opposed to 650 previously. This means the number of constituencies in . England will be reduced by 31, from 533 to 502. Both of these factors mean that there will be some changes to the majority of the existing constituencies. 5. Will the boundary changes have an impact on my council tax, local services or insurance premiums? No. The boundary changes only relate to Parliamentary constituencies.","Government wants to even out number of voters in each constituency .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Last updated at 12:59 PM on 5th October 2011 . A new face is joining the Sesame Street gang, this time with a sombre message. Lily, a pink-faced seven-year-old muppet with red hair, will be introduced to children across the globe as a part of a special hour-long episode on Sunday that deals with the issue of hunger. The show's producers felt that the topic should be covered as the number of children in the U.S. who are 'food insecure', meaning that access to food is uncertain, is now more than 17 million. Of those children, 9.6 million are under the age of six. Lily the pink: The new muppet will appear in Sunday's special episode dealing with the issue of hunger . Lily won't be the only guest in the special episode, as country singer Brad Paisley and his actress wife Kimberly Williams-Paisley will be hosting the show. 'Food insecurity is a growing and difficult issue for adults to discuss, much less children,' the Paisleys said in a statement. The non-profit organisation Sesame Workshop produces the children's show, and it decided to give the topic airtime. In the special episode, titled Growing Hope Against Hunger, Lily will visit a community garden with characters like Elmo, Bert and Grover. Additionally, Sesame Workshop launched the 'Food for Thought: Eating Well on a Budget' initiative to coincide with the episode. Caring: The Paisleys have two children and felt it was important to take part in the special episode . Sunday's show is sponsored by food giant Walmart, which is one of the top two largest employers in the world. The episode will highlight things that communities can do - like build gardens or organise food drives - to help those in need. Firm favourites: Sesame Street has been going for 42 years . Given the delicate nature of 'food insecurity', producers gave a great deal of thought to Lily's backstory. Jeanette Betancourt, a senior vice president at Sesame Workshop, said: 'We thought long and hard about how do we really represent this from a child's point of view?' As a result, viewers will see that even minor mannerisms were addressed, including the way that Lily looks down at her feet rather than looking in the eyes of other characters. 'She wants to talk about this topic . because she knows it will help many other families and children, but it . isn't an easy topic to talk about in the first place,' Ms Betancourt told The New York Times. Sesame Street, now in its 42nd season, is well-known for dedicating episodes to talk about sensitive subjects. Previous topics include children with parents in the military and economic insecurity. In keeping with the nutrition theme, First Lady Michelle Obama has appeared on the show in 2009 and helped the Muppets plant a vegetable garden.

Jurors found Findlay, originally from Blairgowrie, Perthshire, guilty of attempted second degree murder following a two-and-a-half-day trial . A Scottish university lecturer faces 50 years in a U.S. jail for trying to murder her husband after finding his child porn. Joanna Findlay, 41, blasted Gary Trogdon in the chest at their home in Hollywood, Maryland, but failed to kill him. Mr Trogdon, a 55-year-old former U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel, then took the gun and killed himself. Jurors at St Mary's County Circuit Court found Findlay, originally from Blairgowrie, Perthshire, guilty of attempted second degree murder following a two-and-a-half-day trial. Findlay was also found guilty of the statutory firearms offence of using a handgun in the commission of a felony. State attorney Richard Fritz said Findlay now faces a potential 30 years in jail for attempted second degree murder, and potentially another 20 years on top for the firearms offence. Mr Fritz said: 'The jury found that she tried to murder him before he shot himself. They decided there was not enough evidence as to whether he committed suicide or she murdered him. 'The jury maybe thought that he committed suicide, but found that she had tried to murder him as well.' Findlay, who was an English lecturer at Maryland University, insisted throughout that Mr Trogdon had in fact shot himself over the embarrassment at his child porn cache. Former USAF lieutenant colonel Gary Trogdon turned gun on himself after being shot by his wife . Facing jail: Findlay was found guilty of attempted second degree murder after shooting her husband . Joanna Findlay, who studied at Aberdeen . University and Dundee College, moved to the US 15 years ago on a student . exchange programme. She married Trogdon 11 years ago. Her parents, Freda and scrap merchant . Thomas Findlay, of Blairgowrie, Perthshire, are understood to have flown . out to support her. Freda said last year: 'Joanna is one of the most caring, good-natured people you could meet.' But Alex Wahlberg, one of Findlay's . pupils, recalled that Findlay would frequently stop lessons to talk . about her love of weaponry. He said: 'A class period didn't go by . that she didn't talk about gun laws or the number of guns she has. She . would talk about how her house was ""a well-armoured home"". 'She owned tons of them.' The trial heard that Mr Trogdon had . gone to a local support group the morning before he died, after his wife . insisted he seek help for his obsession with child pornography. Later that day, on October 30 last . year, the couple were seen in good spirits and had gone to a Mexican . restaurant in California, Maryland, for dinner with a neighbour after . helping work on their chicken coop. However the court heard there was a . rapid deterioration in their behaviour and later that night Findlay . tried to overdose on drugs but her husband took them off her. She claimed in court that he later assaulted her after she again brought up the child pornography. She said: 'He pushed me down on the bed and he laid on top of me... He wouldn't let me up.' After more struggling, Findlay said . she eventually freed herself and took a .22-calibre pistol from a coffee . table drawer in the living room. She said she shot the gun into the floor to scare him away and then called police. Mr Fritz, prosecuting, said her . husband took the gun off her but she then got hold of another pistol, . this time a .38 calibre weapon, and then shot her husband at close . range. Her lawyer, John Ray, said that . police seized several computers that have thousands of images of child . porn from a computer owned by Mr Trogdon, who lectured in military . history. Officers found 10 guns in total in . their home, but local medical examiner Dr Ana Rubio said it was . difficult to say how Mr Trogdon had died. She said: 'The wound itself allows to be any of those three possibilities - homicide, suicide or accidental.' Another medical expert, physician Dr Jonathan Arden, concluded that the death was a suicide. 'You could put it in a textbook as an example of a suicidal gunshot wound,' he said. Findlay had originally faced a charge . of murder in the first degree. If she been found guilty of that, she . could have become the sixth person to have been executed in Maryland . since the death penalty was reinstated in the U.S. in 1976.","She then got hold of ANOTHER gun which he also took off her before killing himself .

Fears that Germany’s grip on the eurozone is tightening increased last night after it emerged that details of Ireland’s budget plans were leaked to German politicians. A document circulated in the German Bundestag revealed Dublin’s proposals to save the debt-ridden country £3.25billion. The details were for next year’s budget, which have not yet been approved by the Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny. Control: German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Fears that the country's grip on the eurozone is tightening have increased . Discussions: Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny with Angela Merkel and David Cameron at an EU summit last month. Mr Kenny also met the German Chancellor in Berlin earlier this week . He was forced into an embarrassing denial that his plans were being inspected in Berlin. Any suggestion that Ireland is running its austerity cuts past Europe’s economic powerhouse for approval will fuel concern that Germany is using its wealth as a lever to amass power over the 17-nation single currency bloc. Mr Kenny met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin earlier this week. Asked how such sensitive information ended up in the hands of a foreign power – just a day after their meeting – Mr Kenny said he had ‘no idea’. He said his government had made no decision on the content of the budget, due to be presented on December 6. Measures that Ireland will take as a . condition of its bailout from the European Union and International . Monetary Fund have already been made public. They include a property levy aimed at collecting £137million, while £92million is to be raised from a new carbon tax. The government will also raise £573million by hiking VAT from 21 per cent to 23 per cent. Ireland’s Department of Finance said it had no explanation for why the document – which was not signed by finance minister Michael Noonan – had ended up in German hands. Ireland was forced to accept a £73billion bailout package last year from the EU and IMF after the economy once dubbed the ‘Celtic Tiger’ rapidly turned into one of Europe’s basket cases. Concerns: Earlier this week, Berlin declared that Europe is 'speaking German and Britain must be less selfish' towards the EU . The rescue deal saw Prime Minister David Cameron commit to helping Britain’s ‘neighbour and friend’, because the two economies are so closely linked. Britain’s contribution to the Irish bailout via the EU saw taxpayers fork out some £7billion to prop up the Irish economy, as its banking system teetered on the brink of collapse. Dublin is aiming to slash around £10billion from spending plans over the next four years in an austerity drive aimed at forging a lasting economic recovery. Earlier this week, Berlin declared that Europe is ‘speaking German and Britain must be less selfish’ towards the EU. The UK has a duty to help the eurozone despite being outside the single currency, according to one of Mrs Merkel’s closest allies. Even more provocatively, Volker Kauder, leader of Germany’s CDU parliamentary party, warned Britain could not block a financial tax that would cost the City billions.","Document circulates revealing next year's budget not yet approved by Irish PM .

Hundreds of jubilant Namibians turned out to welcome home 20 skulls which had been taken to Germany to prove theories of white racial superiority more than a century ago. The fragile skulls, consisting of four females and 16 males, including a young boy of about three, had been kept at Berlin's Charite University. Namibian Prime Minister Nahas Angula told the crowd at the country's Windhoek airport that the skulls were a 'testimony to the horrors of colonialism and German cruelty against our people.' He added: 'The Namibian nation accepts these mortal remains as a symbolic closure of a tragic chapter. German Ambassador Egon Kochanke said he welcomed home the skulls and added it was time for the two countries to move forward. The . skulls arrived in Berlin sometime between 1909 and 1914 having been . removed from their bodies and preserved in formaldehyde intact with . faces, skin and hair. They . were used by scientists as they tried to prove the 'racial superiority' of white Europeans over black Africans by analysing the facial features . of the heads. Sometime during the 1920s, the heads were further dissected until only the skulls remained. Repatriation: Namibians rush to greet the plane carrying the skulls as it arrives at Windhoek airport . The skulls were draped with Namibian flags as they were taken from the plane to be placed on public display . Researchers say the skulls do not show any sign of violence, and it is not clear how the people died, though they were possibly victims of German forces in Namibia at the time, or died in a German-run concentration camp. Some members of the country's Herero and Nama tribes waved banners demanding reparations from Germany for what some historians call the first genocide of the 20th century. Historians say German troops killed and starved to death 60,000 of the 85,000 Herero people from 1904-07. Herero warriors in military uniform chanted 'We are ready for battle! We are going to fight!' as a leader, chest covered in animal skins, led a cleansing ceremony watched by tribal chiefs in red and yellow hats. Ancestors: The fragile skulls, consisting of four females and 16 males, including a young boy of about three, had been kept at Berlin's Charite University . Anger: Members of the country's Herero and Nama tribes wave banners demanding reparations from Germany for the atrocities of the colonial era . Inspection: A Namibian delegation was sent to Berlin to check the skulls before they were flown back . Hundreds of people in ceremonial dress were at the airport - Nama women in white dresses with gathered skirts, Herero women in scarlet and emerald green Victorian robes topped by head-dresses shaped like the horns of cows that are the traditional source of wealth. They sang hymns and traditional praise songs. Two of the 20 fragile skulls are to be unveiled later at another ceremony at Parliament Gardens in downtown Windhoek. It is not known how many hundreds more skulls may remain in Germany. Years of acrimonious negotiations led to the return. Nama chief David Fredericks said his people still want all the skulls sent to Germany returned, and they demand to know the names of the people whose skulls have come home. 'I am happy that the skulls have been . returned, but we know some have been deliberately made to disappear ... the skulls of chiefs,' he said. Germany . only apologised for the massacres in 2004, during ceremonies marking . the centenary of the start of the Herero uprising against German . colonisers. Intrigue: Namibians wearing traditional tribal dress welcome the arrival of the skulls at Windhoek airport . The skulls had been kept at Berlin's Charite University where they were used to test racial theories . But the German government does not acknowledge that there was a genocide of the Herero in what it then called German South West Africa.

A top designer has been forced to cancel his much-anticipated European press day after his entire spring/ summer collection was stolen from a train bound for London. The 46-look range was due to go on show in the capital today - giving British fashion editors the chance to sample next year's trendsetters. But in an e-mail circulated to the media yesterday, the company said it could no longer go ahead because of the theft.

Personal passion: Bright colours, zip-up tops and angular collars add a sporty twist to the ensemble . It said: 'Our press day tomorrow in . the Marc Jacobs store is cancelled due to the theft of the spring/ . summer 2012 collections during its transfer from Paris.' There's no indication as yet on who . was behind the heist or how such a daring raid could have been pulled . off given the logistics required to lift the collection from a train. Setback: Fashion designer Marc Jacobs lost his entire spring/ summer collection in the train heist . As the pieces are effectively . worthless because they are not yet in production, it has led to fears . that counterfeiters may be involved. The collection, which consisted of drop-waist skirts, cellophane cocktail dresses and translucent and tinsel fabrics, attempted to give the 'feel of a Southern dance hall', Jacobs said of his show in September. Now editors won't be able to see the designs, which could mean fewer editorial placements for the brand in European publications. When the collection debuted during New York Fashion Week, it was described by Newsweek/The Daily Beast’s Robin Givhan as 'a refreshing collection because it went its own way.' He added: 'The designer was unwilling to fall under the spell of fuchsia, cobalt blue, and bright orange. This was a personal passion.' The suspected theft is further embarrassment for Marc Jacobs after an advert for his perfume Oh, Lola was banned because it appeared to 'sexualise a child'. It featured 17-year-old actress Dakota Fanning, but she looked younger in the magazine advert, where she was sitting on the floor with the perfume bottle between her thighs.",Spring/summer UK press day in London has to be cancelled .
"By . Michael Seamark and Colin Fernandez . Last updated at 8:50 AM on 15th November 2011 . Phone-hacking at the News of the World became so widespread it was tantamount to a ‘thriving cottage industry’, the Leveson Inquiry into press standards was told yesterday. At least 28 journalists at the News International media group employed private detective Glenn Mulcaire to carry out more than 2,200 illegal voicemail taps during seven years of eavesdropping on public figures. One journalist alone – referred to only as ‘A’ – made 1,453 requests, said Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, chaired by Lord Justice Leveson. An astonishing 300million News International emails are being examined by police for evidence of phone hacking. Hacked: Murder victim Milly Dowler's mother Sally (front right), sister Gemma (front left) and father Bob on a visit to Downing Street . Victim: Murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler . Almost 700 tape recordings of celebrities’ voicemails were recovered during a police raid on Mulcaire’s offices five years ago. In his 11,000 pages of notes, detectives found the names and other details of more than 5,000 public figures. It was clear, Mr Jay said, that bosses . at the paper condoned, or turned a ‘Nelsonian blind eye’ to what had . become a ‘systemic or cultural problem’. The revelations blow apart . previous claims by News International that hacking was the work of . Mulcaire and just one ‘rogue reporter’ – jailed royal editor Clive . Goodman. Journalists from the Sun and Daily . Mirror were also implicated in the scandal as the inquiry heard that . Mulcaire’s notebooks contained references to work done for the two . tabloid papers. On the first day of formal hearings into press standards . at the High Court: . ■ Lord Leveson stressed that the . freedom of the press was ‘fundamental’ to the UK’s democracy and way of . life but warned editors against targeting witnesses who speak out . against intrusion by journalists. ■ News International records showed . that ‘Alexander’ – a pseudonym for Mulcaire – was paid between November . 2005 and August 2006 for information relating to ‘Fergie’, ‘SAS’, . ‘Wills’ and ‘Harry and Chelsy’. ■ It emerged that police believe the . News of the World hacking operations continued until at least 2009. David Cameron set up the Leveson Inquiry in July after it was revealed . that the News of the World hacked the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly . Dowler after she went missing in 2002. Milly’s father Bob was at the Royal Courts of Justice to hear details of the scale of phone-hacking by the News of the World. Mulcaire’s book-keeping system was explained to the hearing by Mr Jay. He said the private investigator wrote . first names down in the top left-hand corner of his notes  recording . details of every telephone voicemail he illegally intercepted. Mr Jay said: ‘It’s clear that Goodman wasn’t a rogue reporter. We have at least 27 other News International employees. Controversial: News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch, left, has faced pressure over the hacking scandal. Senior executive Rebekah Brooks, right, resigned . References to Max Clifford, left, and Elle Macpherson were found in Mulcaire's notepad, the inquiry was told . ‘This fact alone suggests wide-ranging illegal activity within the organisation at the relevant time.’ He added: ‘I suggest that it would not . be unfair to comment that it was at the very least a thriving cottage . industry. Either News International senior management knew what was . going on at the time and therefore, at the very least, condoned this . illegal activity. ‘Or they didn’t and News . International’s systems failed to the  extent that there was failure in . supervision, failure of oversight with possible failures of training and . corporate ethos and checking of expenses claims.’ ■ Former Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner John Yates was cleared of any wrongdoing . yesterday, months after being forced to quit over the phone hacking . scandal. The decision could pave the way for him to make a legal claim against the Metropolitan Police Association. The . former Information Commissioner Richard Thomas will be  questioned at . the inquiry over his handling of an investigation eight years ago into a . private investigator who obtained information for journalists. Police searched an office of inquiry agent Steve Whittamore in Hampshire in 2003 during ‘Operation Motorman’. The raid revealed he and three  others had been paid to obtain information for newspapers and other organisations. Some of the searches breached the Data Protection Act, but others were a lawful way of  finding out information that was already in the public domain quickly, said Mr Jay. He said that in three years, 305 journalists had asked Whittamore for 13,343 different items of information. These journalists worked for a total of 21 newspapers and 11 magazines, although some worked for more than one publication. Some 952 requests were from the Daily Mail, with 58 journalists involved. The Sunday People had made 802 transactions from 50 staff, and the Daily Mirror had 802 transactions from 45 writers. The Mail on Sunday made 681  transactions with 33 journalists, and the News of the World made 228 transactions from 23 journalists. Other newspapers involved included the Sunday Times and Times. Mr Thomas had not supplied  the identities of the journalists, Mr Jay said. He added that it was ‘not immediately obvious’ why legal proceedings were not taken against them, but  said the former commissioner  had previously declared he could  not be completely confident that there would not be a public interest defence. Mr Jay said he ‘will be inviting  Mr Thomas’ to expand on his  reasons why. ‘That said, one appreciates that the Whittamore raid took place in March 2003, and some might say that all of this is water under the bridge.’ By COLIN FERNANDEZ and MICHAEL SEAMARK . Warning: Lord Leveson, who is leading the phone-hacking inquiry . Freedom of the press is ‘fundamental’ to protecting democracy, Lord Justice Leveson declared yesterday. Formally opening his inquiry, he said there was ‘a great deal to applaud in the British press’ – and he would not be limited to finding fault with the media’s work. ‘From the very start I made it clear that I fully consider the freedom of expression and freedom of the press to be fundamental to our democracy and fundamental to our way of life,’ he said. ‘But that freedom must be exercised with others in mind.’ On the subject of regulation, Lord Justice Leveson said the work of the inquiry – which is expected to report its initial findings in September 2012 – could be summed up in one simple question: ‘Who guards the guardians?’ – an apparent reference to who oversees the work of the press. He said he had encouraged newspaper editors to meet and discuss these issues outside his hearings and submit ideas about how the press could be better regulated. Any regulation ‘must reflect the fundamental freedoms to which I have referred’, added Lord Justice Leveson. ‘But it must also recognise that “guard the guardians” is not an optional add-on. ‘Neither is it good enough if it does not take account of the legitimate public concern, not only about phone hacking, but also other unethical behaviour not justified by what is truly in the public interest.’ The first part of the inquiry is looking at the culture, practices and ethics of the press in general. The second part, examining the extent of unlawful activities by journalists, will not begin until detectives have completed their work and any prosecutions have concluded. Robert Jay, counsel to the inquiry, said it will be ‘concerned with the developing law of privacy’. He said a ‘privacy law has begun to emerge’ from an ‘admittedly limited number of cases’ over the past ten years. ‘There will be calls for a statutory privacy law. Such a law could go further than the rights already protected by Article 8 [the right to respect for privacy and family life] of the Convention (on human rights). At the very least, this inquiry will need to address those calls in deciding whether to make any relevant recommendations.’ Mr Jay added: ‘The press holds the powerful to account and is therefore an important curb on potential abuse of executive and corporate power. At its best, the press espouses unpopular causes and gets to the bottom of scandals which would otherwise be left uninvestigated. It is essential in a functioning democracy that the press be permitted to discharge these vital functions.’ Record: Notes made by Glenn Mulcaire aroused suspicions . Suspicion that the Sun and Mirror might also be involved in phone hacking was aroused by notes in the corners of private investigator Glenn Mulcaire’s notebooks. Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, said it was ‘beginning to receive evidence that phone hacking was not limited to that organisation’. Referring to Mulcaire’s method of carefully recording every job undertaken, the barrister said actor Jude Law had brought a claim against the Sun for allegedly hacking his phone. Part of the evidence in support of his case, said Mr Jay, ‘is a name in the Mulcaire notebook which simply states “the Sun” without specifying the individual working there. ‘There is also documentary evidence which we have seen of another name relating to the Mirror.’ The Sun, Britain’s biggest-selling paper since the closure of its News International stablemate the News of the World, formed the bedrock of Rupert Murdoch’s global media empire. But while being questioned by MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee last week, Murdoch’s son James refused to rule out shutting down the Sun if it was involved in phone hacking. Responding to the suggestion that Mulcaire hacked phones for the Mirror, a Trinity Mirror spokesman said last night: ‘It was not made clear to the inquiry which newspaper he was referring to nor did he elaborate on the nature of the “evidence” or how it “relates” to the Mirror. ‘The company has no knowledge of ever using Glenn Mulcaire.’","One journalist made 1,453 requests for voicemail taps, inquiry hears .

Clinton was in the Philippines for a commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defence Treaty. As part of that treaty, she signed the Manila Declaration binding the countries to work together on a variety of mutual interests. She also revealed she would provide a second warship to the ill-equipped Philippine military as it confronts China in increasingly tense territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Clinton's two-day stay in Manila, which culminated yesterday evening, also saw her holding a bilateral meeting with Filipino President Aquino III. She participated in a social media interview on live television at the city's National Museum, and meeting with the staff of the U.S. Embassy.

While in Thailand, she pledged $10 million in aid and the assistance of a U.S. naval ship for flood ravaged Thailand. She announced the assistance after talks with the Thai PM, saying that the USS Lassen had docked at a Thai port with crew and helicopters to assist in recovery efforts and assess ways to restore the country's infrastructure.

Clinton also visited an evacuation centre for Thai flood victims. She played with a toddler and asked a little girl if she was missing school, after exchanging the traditional Thai greeting known as 'wai'. She bowed deeply while pressing her palms together near the face – with some of the 1,400 evacuees currently living in the Ratchamangala National Stadium complex.

Demonstrators claimed a vacant lot and adjacent public park five blocks from Frank Ogawa Plaza as their new encampment Saturday, but were forced to clear out after an early morning police raid. Police cleared both areas out, non-violently and without incident. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Clearing out: Police evicted Occupy Oakland protesters a day after they claimed a vacant lot as their own . According to Oakland police spokeswoman Johnna Watson, there were no arrests or injuries. Demonstrators said police gave them a 20-minute warning to take their tents and leave, and began moving in around 8:40am. Ms Watson described the protesters as ‘very cooperative.’ After the new camp was cleared out, around 150 people lingered at the site, Mercury News reported. Some yelled at police officers while others merely looked on. Evicted: Campers carried their tents and signs from the vacant lot, which is five blocks north of the original encampment . Mayor Jean Quan said Sunday morning . justified the raid, saying the continued Occupy movement was straining . the city’s already overwrought budget and law enforcement resources. ‘We will not tolerate lodging on public property, whether in parks or open space; it is illegal,’ Ms Quan said. Though the protesters were compliant today, they recently announced plans to shut down all West Coast ports on December 12 in coordination with like-minded protesters in Los Angeles. Time to leave: An officer in riot gear ushers a protestor out of the new encampment. No injuries or arrests were reported . Saturday night, those in the Occupy Oakland protest . broke through a chain link and jumped up and down on no-trespassing . signs to the sound of cheers and beating drums. They also pitched tents, . with the hope of holding their ground overnight. Next move: An Occupy Oakland protester signals to other demonstrators where to regroup following the police raid . Last . Monday, police forcibly cleared out the first camp in Frank Ogawa plaza . after a fatal shooting prompted them to act. For weeks, tensions had . been rising in an already strained environment. Demonstrators pulled down a chain link fence in Oakland as they claimed a vacant lot as their new camp in defiance of the mayor . A clash in October between Oakland police and protestors injured a former US Marine and sparked national attention to Occupy Oakland, as well as an outpouring of support for the Occupy Wall Street movement. Oakland police and Ms Quan said they would not allow another camp, but did not immediately intervene. Defiance: Mayor Jean Quan said protesters were not allowed to camp overnight, but that didn't stop protestors from pitching tents . Instead, the police said they have a ‘non-confrontational strategy’ for preventing the campsite. Ms Watson said in a written statement that peaceful protest is acceptable, including ‘peaceful forms of expression and freedom of speech. ‘Acts of violence, property destruction, and overnight lodging will not be tolerated,’ she wrote. New digs: The lot is in the middle of a residential neighbourhood. Many residents aren't happy with the movement's newest home . She said that police were surrounding buildings around the reclaimed lot, and streets had been closed. No one was arrested Saturday night, police said. Some local residents were upset with the new camp, which is five blocks north of Frank Ogawa plaza, and in a gentrifying area of the city. March: Protestors marched five blocks north of Frank Ogawa Plaza to the new lot on Saturday afternoon . Ours: Demonstrators took to the streets and marched from the old camp, brandishing signs, flags, and banners. Police did not take immediate action in evicting them from the lot . Mass exodus: There were around 1,000 people marching throughout downtown Oakland Saturday . Oakland resident Sherbeam Wright, who lives in a nearby building, told the San Francisco Chronicle: ‘We want people to know the people who live here care about what’s going on.’ He said schoolchildren from the nearby Oakland School for the Arts often eat lunch in the park the Occupy Oakland movement now calls home base. Message for the mayor: Occupy Oakland protesters had a message for Mayor Quan, who said the plaza is still for public use, but banned camping . ‘This is not an empty space, this is a community,’ Mr Wright said. Marylou Beba, 70, who marched from old camp to new, agreed. ‘I think we should all occupy our homes, and the Occupy movement should occupy banks, civic centres, places like that,’ she told the Oakland Tribune.","Demonstrators marched to a vacant lot Saturday afternoon, kicking down a fence and pitching tents .

Geared up: NHS paramedics are being issued with bullet-proof jackets like this one in case they have to respond with a Mumbai-style attack in Britain . Paramedics will be issued with bullet-proof jackets and trained to respond to a Mumbai-style terror attack, it emerged today. NHS volunteers are being trained to deal with the aftermath of a 'marauding terrorist gun attack' like the one which left 164 dead in the Indian city in 2008. Most will be trained to treat battlefield casualties over the next four years. However, body armour and initial guidance has already been given to small teams of ambulance and fire crews in key areas. The policy was mooted in a Home Office paper in the summer and confirmed for the first time by the Department of Health this weekend. 'The government has to prepare for the worst and we also need to be certain that lessons are learnt from previous terrorist attacks at home and abroad,' the department told The Sunday Times. 'Where specialist ambulance crews may be asked to respond to incidents involving firearms, it is necessary that they receive proper training and are provided with appropriate personal protective equipment.' The move, which according to one military source was designed to replicate protection given to the army, was applauded by former terrorism czar Lord Carlile as a 'very sensible precaution'. Worst-case scenario: A victim of a gun attack lies on a hospital bed at the St George's hospital in Mumbai, India, in November 2008. Indian medics had to treat the dying and injured in perilous conditions . Disaster zone: A policeman stands guard after shootings at a railway station in Mumbai. The response to the atrocities was far more like going into battle . It harks back to the days of the Troubles in Northern Ireland when bullet-proof jackets were used by ambulance staff at the height of the conflict. However, this is the first time the equipment has been given to medics on the mainland. The atrocities, which had been planned for a long time in advance, involved 10 co-ordinated bombing and shooting assaults by Islamists on hotels and restaurants in the country's largest city. Scotland Yard has been warning hotels, restaurants and financial companies about the possibility of copycat attacks in Britain. On the front line: Paramedics are afforded a reasonable amount of protection when dealing with dangerous incidents, but the government believes this should go a step further amid terror threats to Britain .","NHS volunteers to be trained to deal with 'marauding gun rampage'

Billionaire Chelsea soccer owner Roman Abramovich has held high-level talks about moving the Premier League club to Battersea. He had a meeting earlier this year with financial backers of the debt-laden Battersea Power station about taking control of the site. Mr Abramovich, said to be worth £7.2 billion, met the lenders to explore the opportunities of a shopping complex next to a new stadium at the iconic power station, it is believed. Among the projects discussed was an aerial cable car system similar to the . one planned in east London, which would be used to bring tens of . thousands of fans from west London to its new home . south of the river. The lenders are led by Ireland’s . government-owned National Asset Management Agency (Nama), which manages a . £60 billion property portfolio as a result of the country’s banking . crisis. Owners Real Estate Opportunities (REO), are reportedly close to announcing a deal with an overseas investor who could buy the debt connected to the £500m site. But Nama and Lloyds Banking Group, the . other main lender, have to approve any new investor because . the £300 million loan matured on August 31 without being repaid . by REO. Chelsea football club's new home? The iconic Battersea power station . It is understood they prefer the Russian oligarch's plans because his wealth would bring . financial stability and a new use for the historic site. A Chelsea spokesman told the Sunday Telegraph: “We have talked to various people with interests in Battersea Power Station, but we haven’t had any substantive discussions with anyone with regards to that particular site for several months.” Club chiefs are believed to be have concerns about the challenges of converting the site. There is planning approval for 3,400 homes, 10 million sq ft of offices and retail space at the landmark site which has lain dormant since 1983 when the power station was shut. REO director Rob Tincknell, said Chelsea FC did not fit on the power station site and claimed the demolition of the Grade II-listed building  would lead to a 10-year planning battle. Currently Stamford Bridge, the club’s home for 106 years, holds 42,000 fans, some 34,000 fewer than Premier League rivals Manchester United. Chelsea has looked at a number of locations across west London for a new home, including Earls Court and White City. But any move will depend on the backing of the supporters group Chelsea Pitch Owners which owns the freehold to Stamford Bridge and naming rights to the football club.",Billionaire Russian owner met backers of historic site .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:23 AM on 21st November 2011 . Killer Adrian Prout has begged his partner to stand by him after his shock murder confession as police teams prepare to dig up his wife's body tomorrow. The millionaire, 47, made a tearful phone call to devastated fiancée Debbie Garlick, 41, after he finally owned up to killing wife Kate, 55, and dumping her in a woodland grave. Shackled and sombre, Prout lead detectives on Friday to the spot where he buried the corpse of the former school teacher - more than a year after he was jailed for her murder and four years after she went missing. Prout (pictured right getting out of the van) arrived at the farm in handcuffs late this morning. He is expected to direct officers to the precise spot where he buried his wife's body . Police today focused on an area of woodland where Prout guided them during a 25 minute visit to the 276-acre farm . Wedding day: The Prouts in 2000. The shock admission came four years after Mrs Prout, a retired schoolteacher mysteriously vanished . The former businessman was driven . from prison to the £1.3 million country estate in Gloucestershire he . shared with Kate. He . had always denied harming his wife, claiming that she stormed out  on . Bonfire Night in 2007 to ‘wind him up’ following a series of rows. But although her body was never found, a jury convicted him of murder last year. Now he is trying to win back new girlfriend Debbie, who had relentlessly campaigned for his release from prison, insisting he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice. Yesterday she revealed he had phoned her from prison and pleaded with her to stand by him - but claimed she felt 'betrayed'. A sheet is erected close to a spot where police believe the body of Kate Prout will be . A large cordon has been formed around the area where Kate Prout's body is believed to have been buried . Police stood guard outside the house as other officers started digging in woodland close to the farm . Debbie, who has 21-month-old child . Evie with Prout, said: 'Adrian is in a terrible state and I don't want . anything bad happening to him. 'I'm not worried about myself. I feel . badly betrayed but my main concern is for Kate's family. Their peace of . mind is more important.' Debbie lived at  the couple's former Redhill Farm home, in Redmarley, until two weeks ago. She had campaigned for his . release and even offered £10,000 of her own money as a reward for . information which would prove his innocence. On Friday Prout was taken in a . Mercedes Viano people carrier from Garth prison, near Blackpool, to his . former home at Redhill Farm, Redmarley, Gloucestershire. At the gates of the 276-acre estate . he was transferred to a marked police car and driven down a track . towards woodland to identify the spot where he is believed to have . hidden his wife’s body. It is hoped that Mrs Prout's body will be found soon so that her grieving family can finally lay her to rest . This aerial image shows the specialist equipment drafted in by police as they prepare to dig up an area of woodland within the 276-acre estate . Dozens of police vehicles were today dotted around the farm including diggers and 4x4s. He is thought to have strangled his wife and then used his expertise as a professional pipe-layer to bury her body on the farmland . Prout admitted the murder three . months after failing a lie detector test which his family and Miss . Garlick had begged him to take in the hope that it would exonerate him. Don Cargill, chairman of the British . and European Polygraphy Association, who conducted the test, said . Prout’s heart rate, blood pressure, sweat and breathing patterns were . monitored as he was asked if he killed his wife. Mr Cargill said after failing, Prout gave a wry smile and admitted that the findings  were correct. ‘I told him that according to my . tests, he was clearly a murderer. But he only smiled again in what was . one of the most surreal and chilling experiences of my life.’ Police will begin digging in woodland . next to the couple's former home. Detectives revealed they had drafted in specialist equipment and extra manpower to start the operation to retrieve Kate's body. She could have been next: Prout with fiancee Debbie Garlick shortly before his conviction . Inspector Les Pritchard, from . Gloucestershire Police, explained the two-day delay between Prout . identifying her gruesome grave and the body's recovery. He said: 'We have to do things properly and this means it will take a little time.' Yesterday campaigners fighting to free killer Adrian Prout from prison shut down their website after his confession. Justice For Adrian Prout, which featured news articles and information on how to lobby for his release, was pulled after Prout admitting murdering his wife. A message posted on the online blog, hosted by the Wrongly Accused Person Organisation, said it was ceasing all activities and expressed sympathy with Kate's family. During Prout’s trial at Bristol Crown . Court, the jury heard about the couple’s disintegrating marriage. By . 2006, Mrs Prout would often stay  with friends after arguing with her . husband. The following year she demanded an £800,000 divorce settlement, £200,000 more  than her husband wanted to give her. When she disappeared soon afterwards, he insisted that she had probably left for good. Prout, who organised commercial shoots and ran a pipe-laying firm, was convicted of murder by a 10-1 majority in February 2010.","'I feel badly betrayed but my main concern is for her family,' says fiancée .

"Ended with an AVO from Australian police for Neville following violent incident during 2008 marriage . By . Andrea Magrath . Last updated at 8:21 PM on 20th November 2011 . The expected flirtation between Mark Wright and Emily Scott on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here is well under way. Since Miss Scott's sudden arrival in the jungle, interest in the relatively unknown Australian model has been rife. And while the pretty blonde is certainly getting along famously with Wright, he's certainly not the first English celebrity who's eye she has caught. Pop star marriage: I'm A Celebrity contestant Emily Scott was married to Ritchie Neville of 5ive in 2008 . The 28-year-old dated David Walliams in 2006, but something that has been kept very well under the radar is her marriage to former pop star Ritchie Neville. Miss Scott wed the singer, of boy band 5ive, in 2008 after the pair met on Sky One show Cirque de Celebrité the year before. The married in secret in Henley-On-Thames in October 2008 and moved to Sydney, where Neville still resides. Flirtation: Emily, who arrived in the jungle on Friday, has already caught the eye of Mark Wright . 'We are both quite private people,' Scott told Sydney's The Sunday Telegraph in 2009. 'We wanted to have a lot of time to ourselves and I guess we didn't really want the attention. 'It was a beautiful wedding, a stunning wedding in the countryside in England. We were planning on settling in Australia for the rest of our lives. It was a whirlwind.' The marriage ended just four months later, after Scott claimed her husband cut her with glass during an argument at their home on Sydney's Northern Beaches, leaving her with a scar on her head. Reality show pro: Emily (in red) met Neville (behind her in picture) in 2007 on Sky One's Cirque de Celebrite . Temptress: Miss Scott was a popular lads' magazines model and appeared on Love Island in 2007 . 'It was a hard break-up, a sudden one as well,' she told The Sunday Telegraph. 'There's an interim AVO out against him that the police took out and I am a witness in that case.' NSW police took out the AVO (Aggravated Violence order) against Neville, but the case was dismissed when Scott failed to show up to court. So far, Neville has not acknowledged . his ex-wife's presence on the reality show and her flirtation with . Wright on his Twitter page. The 32-year-old dated Billie Piper at the height of 5ive's fame. Famous relationship: Emily also dated David Walliams in 2006 . Nineties fame: Ritchie dated Billie Piper at the height of 5ive's fame . On Saturday night's episode of I'm A Celebrity, TOWIE star Mark admitted that he had lusted after Emily during her modelling days for lads' magazines. 'I know Emily Scott,' he told her. 'I used to fancy you back in the day when I was young.  You used to do magazines right,  Zoo, FHM?  They were my perving years when I used to buy all those magazines when I was about 19.' Later in the Bush Telegraph Wright added: 'She seems like a lovely girl.  She’s obviously a pretty girl.  There’s no denying that but today I was in the pond and I asked her surname and she said 'Scott' and I just thought, ""no way.” Boy band: 5ive were launched in the Nineties as the male equivalent of the Spice Girls . “When I was about 18 she used to be one of my favourites.  It’s really weird for me.  She used to be on my wall.  Mmm.  Interesting.' Later on, Pat grilled Mark on the subject. 'Emily, Mark?  What do you reckon eh?  Used to be your pin up?' he asked. 'I can’t believe that.  I can’t believe that’s her,' Mark told Pat and Dougie.  'When you get out, Google her and see how hot she used to be.  Like Carmen Electra hot.  She had exactly the same kind of look.' When Pat pointed out that Emily still is 'hot,' Mark insisted: 'Yes, she’s stunning but she was in a different league before.",Ended with an AVO from Australian police for Neville following violent incident during 2008 marriage .
"But Met Office has warned warm spell unlikely to continue into next week . By . Claire Ellicott . Last updated at 7:16 PM on 19th November 2011 . While leaves on the line is often used as an excuse for train delays, the unseasonably warm weather is now being blamed by operators who are cancelling services due to the wrong type of soil. Network Rail has cancelled First Capital Connect services between Ely, Cambridge, Downham Market and Norfolk because dry soil has caused the rails to shift. Passengers expecting to use the services tomorrow and next Sunday will be forced to use replacement buses while repairs to the tracks are carried out. Cancelled: Some First Capital Connect services have had to be cancelled as dry soil has caused the rails to shift . A spokesman for Network Rail said: 'The closures are necessary because the ground on this stretch of track is drying out owing to a lack of rainfall in the area. 'As a result of the dry weather, ground movement has caused the tracks to become out of direct alignment with the overhead lines used to power trains. 'Services have been running at a reduced speed to minimise the chances of any disruption and remedial work has been carried out. 'It is absolutely essential that we carry out this work to keep the railway running efficiently and safely.' The mild temperatures are set to continue throughout the weekend and will mean Britain is hotter than Jordan. It will be unseasonably mild, according to predictions, with temperatures averaging 14c (57f) across Britain, as the unexpectedly warm November weather continues. Last Thursday, temperatures in . Gravesend, Kent, reached 16.2c (61f). And today, they are expected to . reach 15.5c (60f) there – hotter than Amman, Jordan, where the . temperature is 13c (55f). It . is also set to be warmer than Damascus, Syria, where it is 13c and . match Shanghai, China, where it is 15c. The outlook is not entirely . positive, though, as some areas will be cloudy and may see showers, . according to forecasts. Illuminated: The iconic Angel of the North stands against a golden backdrop as the sun sets over the northern edge of rural County Durham . So far, temperatures this month have averaged 9.4c (49f) – 3.5c above the November average of 5.9c (43f). But it could soon be time to finally dig out those woolly jumpers, as the Met Office has warned that the warm spell is unlikely to continue much past this weekend. Sarah Holland, a Met Office . forecaster, said: ‘The first part of the month has been very warm. We . have been seeing very mild temperatures of around 14-15c during the day . which will continue into the weekend.’ The unseasonably warm weather is down to milder southerly winds blowing across from the Continent, according to the forecaster. Bright: The sun falls across St James's Park as a pelican prepares to fly across the park's lake in central London . Take-off: The pelican sets off on its journey with the rays from the warm sun bouncing off the lake . Normally, Britain would be experiencing cooler westerly winds from across the Atlantic. ‘The warm weather is also down to an area of high pressure over the UK and that brings in the milder conditions,’ she added. 'As we move into next week, we will . see temperatures return to normal for November. It will be quite cold, . especially compared with the warmer weather we’ve been experiencing.’ Night-time . temperatures this month, averaging 6.6C (44f) over the first 15 days, . have also been higher than the average of 4-5c (39-41f). Spring-like: A mallard at London Wetland Centre has hatched a clutch of 11 ducklings, about six months later than usual . And this November has been one of the . driest on record, with 25.6mm of rain falling – 22 per cent of the . monthly average of 116mm.  But Miss Holland said it would be difficult . to predict whether it would be the warmest on record. The current record for November was set in 1994, when temperatures averaged 8.8c (48f). TOMORROW: Dry and cloudy with sunny spells across the bulk of England, Wales and northern Scotland, although morning mist and fog will be slow to clear. Elsewhere, mainly cloudy, with occasional rain or showers. North - High: 14c (57f) Low: 9 (48ft) South: High: 16c (61ft) Low: 8c (46ft) MONDAY: Rain in many places lingering in the east on Tuesday.North - High: 12c (54ft) Low: 8c (46ft)South: High: 12c (54ft) Low: 10c (50ft) TUESDAY: Brighter conditions push into the west but won't last long resulting in a chilly to start to Wednesday.North- high: 11c (52 ft Low: 10c (50 ft)South - High: 13 (55ft) Low: 11c (52ft) While the warm weather might seem like a blessing to most of us, it has left wildlife confused. Swallows, whose arrival usually marks the beginning of summer, have been spotted on Teesside. Frogs have begun mating and in London, a duck has hatched a clutch of 11 ducklings six months earlier than usual. The ducklings, which would normally be born between April and June, could be seen paddling on the entrance lake at the London Wetland Centre, in Barnes, yesterday. Jamie Wyver, of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, said: ‘Fortunately, the mild weather means there is still a fair bit of greenery out there for the ducklings to nibble on.’ The balmy conditions that Britain has been experiencing look set to continue into next week. It has also left forecasters admitting that - despite being so close to Christmas - there is still no sign of winter. Forecaster Brian Gaze of The Weather .

Banging drums and blaring musical instruments the protestors got about half a block away from Mayor Bloomberg's east-side New York townhouse near Central Park Sunday. A live-streaming video from one of the protestors shows about a dozen people gathered on a street reveling and dancing. Some held signs others waved American flags. Noisy: Protestors showed their anger at Mayor Michael Bloomberg by staging a drum circle near his New York townhouse . Uniformed New York police officers stood by, watching them from barricades they had erected. It was unknown whether Mayor Bloomberg was home at the time. Meanwhile, cops arrested five people at Zuccatti park over the weekend, including a man who had a handgun and a protestor who tried to pack in sleeping gear. Cops said Joshua Fellows, 32, faces criminal possession of a weapon after they found a .45-caliber handgun and 32 rounds of ammunition in a truck he rented in North Carolina. Officers originally arrested Fellows Thursday after seeing about 40 people jumping in and out of a Budget rental truck.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:27 PM on 21st November 2011 . The mother of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler today told the Leveson Inquiry of the moment she was given false hope her daughter was alive after a News of the World phone hacker deleted some of her voicemails. Sally Dowler described her euphoria after calling the schoolgirl's number and being patched through to her answer phone. The mail box had previously been so full that she would only get an automated message. 'I rang her phone,' she said. 'It clicked through onto her voicemail, so I heard her voice.' Mrs Dowler described shrieking at her husband: ''She's picked up her voicemails Bob! She's alive!' Despair: Sally Dowler holds her head in her hand as she gives evidence at the Leveson Inquiry at London's High Court today . Target: Mrs Dowler sat alongside her husband as she described the way in which she found out her missing daughter's phone had been hacked by a News of the World investigator . But she was only able to access her . daughter's voicemail because News of the World investigator Glenn . Mulcaire had hacked into the phone and deleted some messages to make . room for more recordings. Mrs Dowler was not to discover the . truth until July this year after police reopened the investigation into . the News of the World hacking scandal. They confirmed that Milly's phone had been targeted. Mrs Dowler told Lord . Leveson that she did not sleep for three nights after being told what . had happened. She said the revelation was 'terribly difficult to . process.' 'You  replay everything in your mind . and just think, ""oh, that makes sense now, that makes sense,""' she said. Witnesses: Mr and Mrs Dowler arrive with their solicitor Mark Lewis (behind in orange coat) Ordeal: The couple talked about their experience during the investigation into the disappearance and murder of her daughter . High Court hearing: The hacking of Milly Dowler's phone was one of the most high profile incidents in the scandal . Murdered: Milly Dowler was 13 when she was abducted on her way home from school in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey . Milly went missing in . Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002 as she walked home from school. She was abducted and murdered by car clamper Levi Bellfield, her body . only found six months later on Yateley Heath, in Hampshire. In the aftermath of her . disappearance, her parents underwent intense press scrutiny. The . discovery that her phone had been hacked by Mulcaire was the catalyst . for the Leveson inquiry into press standards. The Dowlers were the first witnesses . to take the stand where they were asked to outline their experiences . during the hunt for their daughter. Giving an example of press . intrusion, Mrs Dowler described how she and her husband were . photographed on a private walk to retrace their daughter's steps seven . weeks after Milly disappeared. Three days later a picture of Mrs Dowler touching a 'Missing' poster appeared in the News of the World. 'We quietly retraced her steps and no-one was around,' she said. 'We had put out 'Missing' leaflets and I was checking to see if the right poster was up. Conduct: Hugh Grant (right) is also giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry today . Arrivals: Mr Grant (front, left) faces photographers as he arrives at the High Court . A writer whose phone was hacked after she had a relationship with an MP said press regulation was not 'adequate' and recommended a more 'complex' approach. Joan Smith, a journalist and novelist who described herself as a 'very minor public figure', told the inquiry that tabloid newspapers seemed to live in a '1950s world'. Ms Smith, former partner of MP Denis MacShane, said Britain's tabloid culture was 'remorseless' and 'almost infantile'. She said the system of regulation needed to change. She said she did not think the Press Complaints Commission - and its predecessor the Press Council - were 'adequate'. 'I don't think they're adequate bodies to deal with this kind of problem,' she told the inquiry. 'I think it needs to be much more complex.' Ms Smith (pictured) said tabloid journalists had forgotten that they dealt with people. 'The people involved have lost all sense that they are dealing with human beings.' 'I think we have a tabloid press which is almost infantile in its attitude towards sex and private life.' She added: 'My impression is that tabloid hacks go around like children who have just discovered that their parents have sex and they cannot resist taking a peek around the door.' Ms Smith said she was Mr MacShane's partner between 2003 and 2010.Police told her that her voicemail had been accessed by Glenn Mulcaire in April. She said hacking had started six weeks after Mr MacShane's 24-year-old daughter, Clare, died - in a skydiving accident in Australia - in 2004. Ms Smith said she thought she had been hacked because of her relationship with Mr MacShane - a former Labour Foreign Office minister and MP for Rotheram - and was 'collateral damage'. She told the judge: 'I was amazed by how shocked I was.' 'That was on the Thursday, and the following Sunday that photo appeared . in the News of the World. We did not see anyone - they must have taken . the photo using a telephoto lens. 'How on earth did they know we were doing that walk on that day? It felt . like such an intrusion into a really private grief moment.' Counsel . to the inquiry Robert Jay QC suggested that the press was a . 'double-edged sword' for the Dowlers because they needed publicity to . help the search for their daughter. Mrs Dowler agreed, telling the hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in . London: 'You have to remember we were really, really desperate for some . information about Milly. 'So the press were in a position to be able to help us, and they did get . the message out that she was missing, and lots of information came into . the police headquarters. 'But on the other hand, (there is) the persistent being asked questions . and being doorstepped and everything else that's associated with it - . all the letters that you get requesting books, films, interviews.' Mr Dowler said the couple became nervous about leaving their house because of the constant attention from journalists. 'You really are afraid to open your front door because you are faced with a question,' he said. News Corporation chairman and chief executive Rupert Murdoch apologised . in person to the Dowlers for the 'totally unacceptable' hacking of . Milly's phone, the inquiry heard. 'It was a very tense meeting... He was very sincere,' Mrs Dowler said. The couple were asked what they hoped would be the outcome of the inquiry into the hacking scandal. Mr Dowler said: 'We would sincerely hope that News International . and other media organisations would look very carefully how they . procure, how they obtain information about stories. Obviously, the . ramifications are far greater than what appears in the press.' Inquiry chairman Lord Justice Leveson thanked the couple for agreeing to give evidence. He told them: 'I am very conscious that it is a strain. I can only . sympathise with both of you for the appalling losses that you have . suffered and for the traumas that you have undergone over many years.' Mulcaire was jailed along with the News of the World's former royal . editor, Clive Goodman, in January 2007 after they admitted intercepting . voicemail messages left on phones belonging to royal aides.","Sally Dowler: I didn't sleep for three nights after hearing phone was hacked .

"By . Tamara Cohen . Last updated at 1:04 PM on 21st November 2011 . Dozens of flights were cancelled in central England today after a thick fog descended on much of the country. The Met Office issued a severe weather warning this morning for regions including London and the South-East, the East and West Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber and the east of England. And there are even reports that the UK could be facing snow later this week as the spell of unseasonably warm weather comes to an end. Tricky: As this photo shows, Heathrow Airport was shrouded in thick fog this morning . Grounded: Fog reduced visibility to dangerously low levels across much of Britain last night. Pictured here is a beach-front in Saltburn in Cleveland. Chaos: The cancellation of flights caused long queues at Heathrow's Terminal 5 early this morning . By 8.30am a total of 24 flights from Heathrow were already cancelled, according to a spokesman. The destinations affected included Manchester, Glasgow, Amsterdam, Brussels, Stockholm, Cologne and Nice. Ten flights due to depart from London . City had also been cancelled, with services to Dublin, Rotterdam and . Paris among those hit.

Information accurate as of 12.30pm . One flight scheduled to depart Leeds . Bradford Airport earlier today has also been cancelled. The 6.20am KLM service had . been due to fly to Amsterdam, which has also been affected by fog. Hundreds of passengers had their journeys disrupted last night as fog grounded flights at London airports. At Heathrow, 132 flights, most of them short-haul, were cancelled and many others delayed. Officials warned that the poor visibility could continue for the first half of today. London City Airport said 44 flights . were suspended and dozens delayed or diverted due to the poor weather, . though all restrictions had been lifted by late last night. There were also severe delays at Gatwick, but officials said there were only a handful of cancellations. The severe weather warning issued by the Met Office for this morning was lifted around ten o'clock and is no longer in place. Yesterday saw winter finally start to . bite, but temperatures will remain mild until Thursday when frosts and . gale force winds of up to 60mph will set in, forecasters said. And snow will hit the UK by the end of the week, according to the Met Office, who forecast that the Scottish Highlands are likely to see snow on Thursday or Friday. Atmospheric: The City of London was clouded in fog this morning as flights across the country were cancelled . Chilly: A couple cycles through the sports fields of Dulwich College in south London yesterday . Grey day: A pedestrian emerges from the fog as he makes his way across Hammersmith Bridge in West London yesterday . Warning: A Met Office severe weather warning for much of England was issued this morning . Heavy fog delayed or cancelled around 58 inbound and 74 outbound flights at Heathrow, the worst affected airport. All stranded passengers had been re-booked and would be put up in hotel accommodation overnight if necessary, said a spokesman. Some domestic passengers were being taken to their destination by coach. The airport was still open, and most . flights did manage to take off and land, but air traffic controllers . were restricting numbers for safety reasons, she said. Clearing: Fog blows off the Houses of Parliament yesterday morning . Fog at the time: The capital's landmarks, including the London Eye, the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben rise out of the mist yesterday morning as the country woke to a chilly start to the day . No visibility: St Paul's Cathedral did a disappearing act as thick fog shrouded the capital. Many flights were grounded because of the bad weather . Dog in the fog: A man stops to address his dog on a walk through Victoria Park in Leicester yesterday . On the roads, visibility was said to be less than 100 yards in some areas. A man of 20 was killed after his car struck a garden wall in thick fog in Strood, Kent. Two passengers were treated for minor . injuries. The M25 was reduced to a 30mph zone as drivers struggled to . get home. The Met Office last night issued weather warnings for dense . fog for Yorkshire and Humberside,  the East and West Midlands,  the East . of England and the  South-East. The next two or three days will be mild, up at 12c or even 14c, though cloud and some blustery showers are expected. There was sunshine for many on . Saturday as temperatures hit 15.9c in Otterbourne, Hampshire – warmer . than June’s average peak temperatures of 15.4c. Five weeks from Christmas, pub beer . gardens had a busy weekend, shoppers in sunglasses hit high streets . wearing light jumpers,  walkers enjoyed picnics amid glorious autumnal . colours and families were even seen picking blackberries. The weekend probably marks the end of an extraordinary six weeks of above-average temperatures. From Thursday, they will dip to around . 8c (46f) across the country, and close to zero at night, although there . is no sign yet of the heavy snow experienced last winter. Met Office forecaster Steven Keates . said: ‘Towards the end of the week it will definitely feel colder, . particularly in the North. ‘Temperatures will be back to normal for this time of year.’ However forecasters said another freezing winter – which would be the third in a row – was unlikely. Making a splash: Youngster forget it's almost December as they frolic in the waves at Southsea, Portsmouth, yesterday . Misty-eyed: Big Ben is invisible from this view of central London looking beyond Lambeth Bridge .

The ducklings, which should have made . an appearance sometime between April and June, have been enjoying the . winter sunshine. amid temperatures as high as 16C in some places. The . latest that mallard ducklings would normally hatch is August, but that . tends to happen when a clutch has failed and the adults try for a second . brood.

"Says he and Bleakley were promised they would leave 'with their dignity intact' By . Paul Revoir and Andrea Magrath . Last updated at 4:35 PM on 20th November 2011 . It appears that yesterday's headlines revealing Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley's sudden axeing from Daybreak came as just as much a surprise to the hosts as it did to everybody else. First Bleakley, 32, wrote a sarcastic tweet, posting: 'What a lovely headline to wake up to.' And now her co-host Chiles, 44, has angrily lashed out at their ITV bosses saying he is 'angry, upset and acutely embarrassed'. Furious: Adrian Chiles has slammed his bosses at ITV for his sudden axeing from Daybreak . Speaking to the Sunday People newspaper, the presenter reveals that he and Bleakley were informed that their run on the breakfast show would end in the New Year but that 'we were assured we could go with our dignity intact.' 'That’s obviously not happened,' he told the paper. 'We were enjoying the show and we thought things were going well. We didn’t want to go.' Chiles was pictured looking grim as he watched the Bromwich Albion and Bolton Wanderers game yesterday at The Hawthorns in West Bromwich. 'What a nice surprise': Christine Bleakley tweeted about the news this morning . 'It was a bolt out of the blue and has come as a big blow to our careers that we’ve been dumped at this time,' Chiles added. 'Dark forces have leaked it for their own ends and I am mightily unhappy about it.' His equally miffed co-host Christine wrote on her Twitter page this morning: 'Morning, what a lovely headline to wake up to. My sarcasm comes across in this tweet I hope.' But the Northern Irish presenter, who is engaged to Chelsea footballer Frank Lampard, at least knows where her next pay cheque is coming from. She was confirmed to be replacing Holly Willoughby as co-host of Dancing on Ice. Sour mood: Chiles looked grim as he watched the Bromwich Albion and Bolton Wanderers game yesterday at The Hawthorns in West Bromwich . Bleakley followed her tweet up with: 'Aside from that, thank you so much for all your Dancing On Ice good luck messages. 'Holly is a legend and she's a tough act to try and follow so feeling really nervous but incredibly excited.' Bleakley and Chiles, who were heralded as the stars of morning TV when they defected from the BBC last year on £1million-a-year deals, are set to leave ‘within weeks’, it is understood. Their appearance on Daybreak has failed to capture the public’s imagination. Surpirse: It emerged this morning that Bleakley and Chiles are to leave Daybreak in a matter of weeks . The programme has struggled to get ratings beyond 700,000 viewers – fewer than its predecessor GMTV. The move comes after the show recently appointed a new editor and as channel bosses plan for a major revamp in the new year. It is understood that both Bleakley and Chiles have been told of the decision. Last night ITV refused to deny the claims that the pair would be leaving the show, which had a £15million launch last September. A senior source at the commercial broadcaster said: 'Do we want to be running a show where we are happy being No 2? No, we don’t.' Moving on: Christine will replace Holly Willoughby as co-host of Dancing on Ice while Adrian will continue to present ITV's football coverage . Daybreak gets about half the number of viewers as its rival, BBC Breakfast. Another source said: 'They ran out of time. The advertising numbers had fallen off a cliff because Adrian and Christine were such a turn-off. In today’s climate, that was unacceptable.' It is not known whether ITV will opt for big names or unknowns as replacement presenters. Axed: It is understood the presenting pair have been informed of the decision they would both be leaving the show . According to the report, Chiles, who is . also the broadcaster’s main presenter for its football coverage, had . accepted that he had been dropped from the show. But co-host Miss Bleakley, whose WAG lifestyle was said to have been a turn-off for viewers, is reportedly asking for it to be presented as if she is leaving for new projects. It is hoped a new role for Miss . Bleakley will give her a chance to reinvent herself and prove she is a . valuable member of ITV’s stable of talent. ITV . bosses have hired former BBC Breakfast editor David Kermode to be the . show’s new editor, and it is expected other staff will lose their jobs. Bleakley, seen here with footballer fiancee Frank Lampard, will replace Holly Willoughby as presenter of Dancing On Ice in January .",Says he and Bleakley were promised they would leave 'with their dignity intact'
"By . Christopher Leake . Last updated at 1:35 PM on 20th November 2011 . Snipers on board military helicopters will patrol the skies over  London during next summer’s Olympic Games. Sources say the military crackshots – dubbed ‘heli-snipers’ by defence chiefs – will fly above the capital  in case terrorists attempt an atrocity at the prestigious event. The RAF snipers are understood to have been training recently at the restricted Lydd military live-firing range near the Kent coast to sharpen their skills. Taking aim: RAF snipers will be deployed in London to target potential threats to the 2012 Olympic Games . Death from above: The snipers will hover above Olympic sites in Lynx MK7 helicopters, like this one, which have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan . One source told The Mail on Sunday . that the training had been designed specifically to prepare for an . Olympic Games deployment to protect stadium sites in East London and . elsewhere. Flying in Merlin . or Lynx helicopters, the snipers are capable of killing an attacker at a . range of more than a mile using a Barrett ‘Light Fifty’ rifle, which . fires a powerful .50-calibre half-inch bullet at 2,799 feet per second. Even . at night, the flying snipers can kill an enemy 1,000 yards away using . night sights and infra-red lasers for target-marking as they keep in . touch with commanders on the ground using encrypted military radio . frequencies. Their . rifles have the power to destroy engine blocks and fire through . concrete from long range, making it difficult for a terrorist to take . cover. Bird's eye view: The snipers will be able to kill suspected terrorists from up to a mile away - even at night . The airborne sharpshooters were deployed in Iraq, where they were . described by the Ministry of Defence as a ‘special weapon’ against the . insurgent threat. In Iraq, . the snipers were on standby around the clock to provide protection from . the air and carried out sniping and surveillance duties on the ground. Now, . they could find themselves on operational duty in the UK for the first . time, helping to protect prime venues such as the 80,000-seat Olympic . Stadium and the Aquatic Centre. Airborne threats: Surface-to-air missiles may also be part of the armoury available to Olympics security forces . Last week, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond revealed in the Commons after a question from his predecessor, Dr Liam Fox, that ground-to-air missiles were part of the armoury that may be used during the Olympics if required. Mr Hammond’s statement was interpreted as an attempt to show how seriously the UK is taking the terror threat after it was revealed that the US is preparing to send 1,000 armed agents, including 500 from the FBI, to protect its competitors. High security: Left, police officers take part in a search exercise at the Olympic Stadium. Right, Mail cartoonist Pugh imagines the scene at the start of an event . A Ministry of Defence spokesman said last night: ‘The MoD has been fully involved in Olympic security planning work and it is anticipated that the Armed Forces, at the request of the civilian authorities, will provide some specialist support including the use of assets where appropriate. However, this will be a police-led operation and any military involvement will be in a supporting role. ‘It is too early to talk about the numbers of personnel who may be involved or further details around precisely what support the MoD might provide – but ongoing  planning to meet a range of contingencies is sensible.’ The spokesman added: ‘This work is not in response to any specific threat but, as the Defence Secretary said in Parliament, all necessary measures to ensure the security and safety of the London Olympic Games will be taken.’",RAF snipers will be armed with high calibre rifles that can penetrate concrete and destroy engine blocks .
"Former lads' mag model dated David Walliams and was married to Ritchie Neville of 5ive . By . Andrea Magrath . Last updated at 12:02 AM on 20th November 2011 . With the only female under 50 in the camp engaged, Essex playboy Mark Wright was undoubtedly becoming a little restless in the Australian jungle. So the helpful I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! producers came up with a plan to raise temperatures and create a little romance around the campfire. Australian model and DJ Emily Scott arrived in the jungle last night as the newest 'celebrity' recruit. New recruit: Australian model Emily Scott joined the celebrities in the jungle tonight . Flirtation: It wasn't long before Mark Wright was making his move on the model . The 28-year-old arrived at the camp at nightfall, greeting her new camp mates with 'Knock, knock! Hi, I'm Emily, I'll be joining you.' Mark's delight was clear to see as he took in the new recruit, and he later admitted: 'I heard someone say ""hello,"" and I turned around and first I saw blonde hair, then I saw a treasure chest.' Dougie was equally impressed, but given his taken status, he preferred to estimate how long it would take for Mark to make his move. Eye candy: The boys were pleased to meet their new camp mate . Reality show pro: Emily has already competed on Love Island 2007, Cirque de Celebrité 2007 and Australia's Dancing with the Stars 2009 . Are you watching the new series of I'm A Celeb? Within a few minutes Mark and Emily were making plans to go out in the Gold Coast once their time in the jungle was up. Pat teased Mark about moving in on Emily so quickly, calling him a 'a little tinker.' Pat pointed out that Emily’s skin was very fair. 'Makes a change from an Essex girl' retorted Mark. Even Jessica-Jane welcomed Emily with open arms. 'It's a nice change to have another younger girl,' she said. 'I have a new playmate!' Temptress: Miss Scott was voted Australia's Sexiest Woman in 2007 by FHM readers . Makeunder: The 28-year-old is almost unrecognisable from former television appearances . 'I thought she was a kiss-o-gram,' admitted Chrissy. Miss Scott is best known in the UK for appearing on ITV's Love Island in 2006, and briefly dating David Walliams in 2007. She was voted Australia's Sexiest Woman by FHM readers that same year and has appeared in a number of other celebrity competitions including Australia's Dancing with the Stars in 2009 and Sky One's Cirque de Celebrité in 2007.

She met her former husband Ritchie Neville of Nineties boy band 5ive on the latter: the pair married in 2008 and moved to Sydney, but split four months later. Their marriage was largely out of the public eye until June 2009 when Neville was given an AVO following allegations of domestic abuse. Scott alleges that a scar on her face is the result of Neville cutting her with glass. But the club DJ is rather unrecognisable from her modelling days in the lads' mags - she is now sporting a short, candy pink bob.

"By . Deborah Arthurs . Last updated at 5:52 PM on 18th November 2011 . Hordes of shoppers besieged H&M stores across the globe as Versace's collection for the high street shop went on sale today. With many shoppers having spent the night queuing on the pavements outside, there were scenes of hysteria at 9am as the eager crowds were finally let in to fill their arms with brightly printed garments from the shelves. In Dubai and Beijing . where 9am had come and gone, shoppers reported H&M stores selling . out of the entire collection in under 30 minutes - with many pieces . arriving on eBay moments later. Success: Donatella Versace arrives at the H&M store on London's Regent St this morning to celebrate the launch of her collection for H&M . Glamorous: Donatella wore a £129.99 pink satin dress and a £199.99 leather trench coat, both from the collection . Fail: H&M's website crashed under the large number of users trying to buy the collection . Sorry: H&M took to Twitter to apologise for their technical issues . Donatella Versace herself made an appearance at London's Regent St store to welcome her fans, stepping out of her chauffeur-driven car onto a pink carpet, clad in a nipped-in version of Versace x H&M pink leather dress and a studded leather coat from the range. In the store, sales assistants dressed in top-to-toe Versace designs attempted to corral the high-spirited shoppers into a second waiting zone, where they would be held until their ten minute shopping slot came round. Online, H&M's website crashed under the demand as thousands tried to log on simultaneously. A spokesperson for the store took to Twitter to apologise for 'technical problems', saying they were 'working hard to solve them.' In the melée, rogue shoppers who had jumped the queue attempted to grab items from over the fence, but dozens of extra security guards and shop assistants made sure no attempt at queue-jumping was successful. The first shoppers through the door frantically tore clothes from shelves and rails, loading their arms with dresses, jackets and accessories while security guards counted down the minutes - in some stores, blowing a whistle to let shoppers know their time slot was up. But many - especially male shoppers - were left disappointed when they found much of the men's collection that had been previewed was not to be found in the store. Nightwatch: Shoppers queued in the early hours to ensure they didn't miss out . Pleased: Shoppers at Manchester's Trafford Centre show off their purchases . ...where moments after the doors had opened, the shelves were bare . Shopped out: An entire new Versace wardrobe for Gemma Rose Breger, fashion stylist and blogger at wearsitfrom.blogspot.com . Stylish: Neco, left, attended the launch, while Caleen Heslop, right, leaves H&M with her coveted Versace purchases . One London student, Alan Murrell, 21, was first in line at the Kensington branch of H&M, having arrived with girlfriend Laura Scott, 21, at 10pm last night. But he was not able to buy the pieces he had earmarked online ahead of the opening day. 'There were none of the suits that showed on the catwalk, and very few jackets,' he said this morning. 'I got a few T-shirts, but that was all.' Genuine Versace fans in the queue also reported their dismay at the number of those waiting already making plans to sell their booty on auction site eBay. Many in the queue brought along laptops and were charting the prices of the Versace for H&M collection on eBay. Rules were in place to prevent a reoccurrence of the issues experienced on previous celebrity collaboration opening days, where fights broke out in the hysterical crush and opportunistic eBay sellers arrived in their droves to empty entire racks of identical items into huge laundry bags that they sold at vastly inflated prices that same day. Devoted: From left, Stephanie O'Reilly, 22, Alan Murrell and Laura Scott, both 21, were first in line, having queued since 10pm the previous night . Big spenders: From left, at the Newcastle launch, Sheridan Henderson, Fern Hughgill and Celine Roels spent over £1,200 on the collection . Triumphant: Three ladies carry their booty home after filling their bags during their allotted 10 minutes . Worthwhile trip: Jamie Diamond and Kelly Little . travelled from Bournemouth to queue at the Kensington store - their . nearest. 'Next time they should launch the collection in more stores . outside of London, like Southhampton, for instance' they said, although . both agreed the trip was a success . Hordes: Security guards attempted to keep the ever-growing queues under control as more and more shoppers joined the line . Frantic: Shoppers load up their arms with pieces from the collection. Right, a man buys numerous boxes containing jewellery, shoes and accessories . Authentic: The shoppers snapped up the vibrant pieces, which were said to be 'very Versace' Time's up! A Manchester store assistant blows a whistle to let shoppers know their ten minutes is up . Line up: These Versace bags won't stay empty for long . Choices, choices: Shoppers could only buy one of each size in every garment . This time around, H&M in the UK . made sure everything was well organised, with wristbands allowing . pre-allotted 10 minute time slots and limits on the number of items each . shopper could buy, with only one item in each size permitted to each . shopper. The same rules . did not apply elsewhere, however, and shoppers in Dubai and Beijing . reported queuing for nearly 24 hours ahead of the collection's release . but still being disappointed when the first few through the doors . cleaned the shelves. A . disappointed shopper who had queued outside the Dubai store told . MailOnline that a ten minute, invite-only VIP preview meant that by the . time regular shoppers were allowed in, most of the best items were gone. With no limits in . place, the rest of the items were cleared from the rails in multiples by . the first swathe of shoppers - many of which were clearly to be sold on . later - leaving the shelves bare in under an hour. It . is the latest in a long line of collaborations that has seen H&M . partner with Lanvin, Madonna and Jimmy Choo, and has been heavily . promoted since it was announced this autumn. The . collection, which starts at £19.99 for jewellery going up to £199.99 . for a leather jacket, was launched in a glittering fashion show held in . New York's Meatpacking District last week, and saw Lady Gaga, Blake . Lively, Jessica Alba and Prince attend, all clad in items from the label. Shoppers pictured in the early hours of the morning camping outside H&M in High Street Kensington as Versace's cut-price collection hits the high street today .

'For the collaboration we've brought . back from the archives, as well as from more recent collections, some of . the icons of Versace, such as the bright prints, the Greek key and . daring cuts. 'I can't wait to see how H&M's wide audience will make these pieces their own.' The Swedish fashion outlet has high hopes for this collection, with H&M's Creative Advisor Margareta van den Bosch saying: 'Versace’s collection for H&M is a moment in fashion. 'It is full of strong pieces that stand out, with colours, prints and cuts that are clean and precise. 'The women’s collection is flattering and full of dresses, while the men’s collection is very sophisticated. 'When I think about Versace I think of iconic items.

Showing off the collection: Donatella Versace in the studded dress which will go on sale at H&M . Donatella Versace has yet again proven her business credentials by designing a Versace collection for H&M, immediately raising the profile of the family firm. The 56-year-old took over as chief designer of the Italian fashion label when her brother, Gianni, was killed on the doorstep of his Florida home in 1997. The company is one of the last truly family-owned fashion houses. Donatella is Vice President of the Versace group and owns 20 per cent of the entire stock market assets of Versace. Her brother, Santo Versace, owns 30 percent and Donatella's daughter Allegra Versace inherited 50 per cent of the company stock after the death of her uncle, Gianni. Allegra inherited $700 million on her eighteenth birthday and was also given Gianni's villa on Lake Como, and a large townhouse in Manhattan. While the family firm's reputation is no longer what it was at its peak in the Nineties, Donatella and Co. will hope that this collaboration will boost their reputation... and their revenue.","Donatella arrives to greet eager fans who had queued overnight to be first in line .

"By . Martin Robinson . Last updated at 2:49 PM on 7th October 2011 . An assassination attempt on Afghan President Hamid Karzai by a group including one of his own bodyguards has been foiled, it was claimed today. As well as Karzai's protection officer, college students and a professor all with links to al-Qaida and the country's violent Haqqani militant group have been arrested in capital Kabul. Intelligence service spokesman Latifullah Mashal said today that the group was recruited by two Arab nationals in neighbouring Pakistan. Plot: Afghan security spokesman Lutfullah Mashal reveals the plot aimed at president Hamid Karzai at a press conference today . Afghan officials have been increasingly vocal in publicly accusing the country and its spy agency of supporting militants. Yesterday they claimed that Pakistani officials had advance knowledge of the September 20 assassination of former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani. Pakistan has vehemently denied any of the claims. Abroad: Hamid Karzai, left, is currently in India where he met the country's prime minister Manmohan Singh in New Delhi yesterday . A senior commander of an insurgent group which is linked to the Taliban has been killed following an air strike by Nato-led forces fighting in Afghanistan. Dilawar, who was only known by one name, was a member of the Haqqani network and was killed along with two of his associates in eastern Khost province, near the Pakistan border. His death is 'another significant loss for the insurgent group,' the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said in a statement today. Tense: An Afghan policeman body checks a man in Khost, Afghanistan. Security measures are tight after the death of senior Haqqani commander, Dilawar, and the recent capture of Haji Mali Khan, a senior leader of the insurgent group. He was a 'principal subordinate' to Haji Mali Khan, who Nato captured last week and said at the time was the top Haqqani commander for Afghanistan. According to ISAF, Dilawar's responsibilities included coordinating attacks on Afghan forces and arranging weapons deliveries. Nato also said that Dilawar helped foreign militants move into Afghanistan and had links with both Al Qaeda and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. Border zone: Dilawar was killed by Nato along with two associates in eastern Khost province, near the Pakistan border . The Afghan and coalition force has conducted more than 530 operations to disrupt Haqqani network activities in eastern Afghanistan so far this year. Strong claims: The outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen has said previously that the Haqqani network has links to Pakistan's spy agency . Around 1,400 suspected Haqqani . insurgents had been captured, 100 since the start of October alone, and . 20 network leaders killed. The Haqqani network is one of three Taliban-allied insurgent factions fighting in Afghanistan. Perhaps the most feared, it is thought to . have introduced suicide bombing to the country and be behind many . high-profile attacks. It has sworn allegiance to the Taliban, but has long been suspected of also having ties to Pakistan's spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) directorate. The outgoing chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, testified before the U.S. Senate after an attack on the U.S. embassy and Nato headquarters in Kabul, believed to be the work of the group, that the Haqqani network was a 'veritable arm' of the ISI. Sirajuddin Haqqani, who heads the group, says it no longer needs sanctuaries in Pakistan and it feels safe operating in Afghanistan.","Karzai is unharmed and currently on a visit to India .

"By . Gavin Allen . Last updated at 3:12 PM on 21st November 2011 . A football referee who tried to commit suicide in his hotel room hours before a top-flight match owes his life to his three assistants, said the head of the German Football Association. Babak Rafati, 41, tried to take his own life ahead of the Bundesliga game between Cologne and Mainz, which was called off 40 minutes before kick-off with fans already filling the Mungersdorfer Stadion. Rafati, a former banker of Iranian descent, was today released from hospital and his father said he had apologised to the family. Stable condition: Referee Babak Rafati (left) attempted to commit suicide on Saturday just hours before he was due to take charge of a top flight match . 'He said he loved me. He wanted to apologise. I am very happy that he is ok,' said Djalal Rafati. Rafati was discovered in the bath of his Cologne hotel room two hours before kick off on Saturday. He was found by his assistants - . Holger Henschel, Frank Willenborg and Patrick Ittrich - who received no . answer when they knocked on his door after he failed to show up for a . meeting. Dr Theo Zwanziger, President of the German FA (DFB), described the pressure on referees as 'immense' and said that Rafati was only alive thanks top the actions of his colleagues. 'I have got to say that these three have saved his life,' he said. 'When they discovered him, they ensured that he could survive with quick emergency measures. Postponed: The message informing fans at Cologne's Mungersdorfer Stadion that the match was called off . 'They have explained everything to me and to the police. All I can say is compliments to them. 'They took immediate measures and kept their cool. 'It definitely took a lot to stabilise him and to contribute to him being able to remain alive.' It took less than 15 minutes for . Rafati's assistants to realise that something was amiss when the . normally punctual referee failed to show up for a meeting in their . hotel. Attempts to call the Hanover-based . official proved futile while the referee did not respond when they . knocked on his hotel door either. With the aid of a hotel worker, they . gained access to Rafati's room, where they were confronted with a . horrific discovery in the bath tub. 'They saved his life': Theo Zwanziger, president of the German football federation, paid tribute to Rafati's team of officials . 'Naturally, all three of them are distraught,' added Dr Zwanziger. 'They were sat with him the night before and did not notice anything amiss. 'Only at 1.30pm when he did not appear, did they start to worry and they reacted quickly. 'It is certainly a burden for them . when a close friend, with whom they have worked together for a long time . and officiated over important games, takes such a step. More than 45,000 fans attended the funeral of Germany goalkeeper Robert Enke, whose suicide stunned the world of football. Enke was 32 when he stepped in front of a train near his Hanover home on November 10, 2009. The highly-rated player had been suffering from depression for around six years but had not wanted the news to be public knowledge, his wife Theresa said after his death. The player was afraid the couple's adopted eight-month-old daughter would be taken away from them if his illness was known. In a country where football is so important, Enke's death prompted a debate about whether players receive sufficient psychological support, and struck a chord throughout the game. 'I think it still hasn't sunk in. I . was pleased that they looked so composed, but I think that will change . over the coming days.' The three officials were provided with psychological care and Dr Zwanziger . has promised that the German will 'provide them with all of the help . that the DFB can offer' to come to terms with the experience. But he expects them to be strong, given the nature of their job. 'You have got to be very tough to be able to cope with everything in this sport,' he said. 'Of course refereeing has become a very difficult job and there are a lot of demands placed on referees nowadays. 'It is not so easy to describe when . you hear how people who play such an important role in top-level sport . suddenly arrive in a situation where they feel there is no way out, . which means they see no alternative in life. 'That is quite terrible.' It is the second time in just over . two years that German football has been rocked by suicide, following . the death of the national team's goalkeeper Robert Enke on November 10, . 2009. When the announcement was made at the . ground on Saturday that the game was to be called off there were boos . from fans, but DFB official Dr Reinhard Rauball insists there was no . other choice. 'I am deeply shocked and I believe that everybody connected with the Bundesliga feels the same way,' he said. 'Something like this has never happened before and it has deeply shocked people. 'If there was anything to be learned . from the death of Robert Enke, then it was that football is not . everything in life, as Theo Zwanziger said at the time. 'Calling off this game was the right decision, there is no doubt about that.' Although Rafati was voted the worst . referee three times in the last four years in a poll of Bundesliga . players conducted by Kicker magazine, he nevertheless earned his place . on the FIFA refereeing register in 2008. And given the reaction of two Bundesliga coaches, he is a well-liked personality. 'It is shocking,' said Hanover coach Mirko Slomka. 'Babak Rafati is a good friend in our club and in our team so we are particularly interested in knowing how he is.' Wolfsburg coach Felix Magath added: . 'Babak Rafati is one of the referees I like the most and I hope that we . see him again soon in the Bundesliga.' Rafati has been a referee since 1997 . and a Bundesliga referee for six years, with his first ever match having . also been between Cologne and Mainz. He has officiated 84 top-flight . German league games. He had been a FIFA referee since 2008, but was not nominated by the DFB to referee this year at international level.","Babak Rafati, 41, found in bath at Cologne hotel room .

"By . Sara Nelson . Last updated at 4:46 PM on 21st November 2011 . Stabbed to death: Stephen Lawrence was killed in April 1993 . Officers collecting evidence at the scene of Stephen Lawrence’s death had no written instructions on how to deal with exhibits and relied on their own awareness and experience, the Old Bailey heard today. Items taken from Stephen after his death and then subsequently from different inquiry ‘scenes’ were stored in a disused cell at Eltham police station. Exhibits officer DC Robert Crane, a serving officer since 1974, said there were no designated exhibit rooms within police stations at that time. ‘What were the anti-contamination procedures in a police station in 1993?’ asked Timothy Roberts QC, for Gary Dobson. ‘Gloves,’ said DC Crane. ‘There were, if you were in a contained crime scene, you would have over shoes available. ‘But you didn’t have the white suits at that time unless you had a specific examination by a scientist who had come out of a laboratory.’ He told the court police officers worked on ‘awareness’. Asked if there was an ‘exhibit handling manual’, he said: ‘I don’t think there was one.’ Mr Roberts asked: ‘Nothing written down on how to deal with exhibits?’ ‘No,’ said DC Crane. ‘No signs in the exhibit room saying “make sure everything is sealed”,’ said the barrister. ‘We didn’t have identified exhibit rooms,’ the officer replied. Despite the lack of specific instructions, he added: ‘Everyone had awareness of cross-contamination.’ He said it was the exhibit officer’s duty to check areas where exhibits were removed from their sealed brown paper bags and photographed. ‘Were any steps taken not to get fibres or flakes on your own clothing when handling exhibits,’ asked Mr Roberts. ‘Not at that time, no,’ said DC Crane. Gary Dobson, 36, left, and David Norris, 35, right, both deny murder . The barrister added: ‘What . anti-contamination procedures were in place to ensure that, as officers . wrapped packages with tape did not pick up other contaminants from the . surface, perhaps where things were photographed or from their own . clothing. ‘Were there any specific instructions issued?’ ‘Not that I am aware of,’ replied DC Crane. He told the court the ‘significance’ of this as a source of contamination had not been fully appreciated at the time. ‘If it was microscopic you wouldn’t know it was there,’ he said. He said police used ‘common sense’ when dealing with exhibits. DC Crane told jurors he used a disused cell at Eltham for the Lawrence case. He said: ‘I had Lawrence exhibits on . one side of the cell. I just marginalised areas within the cell.’ DC Cooke, pictured leaving the Old Bailey today, described Dobson as 'nervous' as he spoke to him on the doorstep of his family home three days after the killing . Alison . Morgan, junior prosecutor, asked: ‘Different scenes were getting . different areas?’ ‘Yes,’ said the officer. DC Stephen Pye told the court he had seized Stephen’s clothing in two hospital sacks at 3am on April 24 and wore rubber gloves. He said the police exhibit bags he . placed the items in were not sealed because the clothing was . bloodstained and they were still wet. Earlier Gary Dobson, who is suspected . of taking part in the killing looked ‘nervous’ as he denied taking part . in the fatal attack, the jury heard. Dobson, then aged 17, spoke to a police officer on the doorstep of his family home three days after Stephen’s death. The teenager, who was studying at an . IT college in Covent Garden, told DC Graham Cooke he had been at home . studying with his parents on the night of the stabbing. Described as spotty and clean-shaven . with dark brown hair cut over his ears, Dobson was questioned in the . presence of his father for about five minutes, jurors were told. DC Cooke, now retired, called at the . Dobson family home in Eltham, around 6pm on April 25 during a round of . house to house inquiries. He said Dobson was 5ft 9in tall, and of slim to medium build. ‘I asked him where he was on the . night of April 22, 1993 and was he at the scene of the Stephen Lawrence . murder in Well Hall Road at 10.30pm,’ said DC Cooke. ‘He said “no” he was at home all night.’ Dobson said he had been studying, . having returned from college shortly after 5.30pm and his mother and . father had been in at the time. ‘He stated he didn’t know the victim and he had heard about the incident in the papers,’ said DC Cooke. Dobson told the officer he had last been in Well Hall Road, Eltham, at 5.30pm on April 22. Asked by prosecutor Mark Ellison QC . if he had made any further observations, DC Cooke said: ‘In my opinion . he was nervous at the time.’ Dobson had answered the door in a green shirt and army-style trousers, it was said. Some 20 minutes later DC Cooke saw Dobson walking in nearby Appleton Road with his girlfriend, this time wearing blue jeans. They were seen to enter the home of his friends Jamie and Neil Acourt, where they stayed for five minutes. Dobson was then observed walking in to a nearby McDonald’s. The court has heard Dobson later . changed his story about his whereabouts on the evening of Stephen’s . murder and told police he had left home at 11.45pm to visit the Acourts . to collect a CD and returned home about 30 minutes later. Stephen, 18, was stabbed to death by a . group of white youths who attacked him and friend Duwayne Brooks as . they waited for a bus in Well Hall Road at 10.30pm. Tragic scene: The spot in Well Hall Road, Eltham, where Stephen lay dying . Dobson, now 36, and David Norris, 35, . are now on trial accused of being part of that group which forced the . A-level student to the ground and stabbed him twice. Both men were charged after a . forensic breakthrough in 2008 when scientists launched a cold case . review of exhibits seized when the pair were arrested during the . original investigation in 1993, the jury heard. A speck of Stephen’s blood was found . on Dobson’s grey jacket and scientists also found 16 fibres from the . clothes Stephen was wearing on Dobson’s clothing or in the evidence bag . it was kept in, it is said. It is also claimed that a bag used to . store a pair of jeans from Norris contained two of Stephen’s hairs, . while fibres which could have come from the victim’s trousers and polo . shirt were found on a sweatshirt that was seized. Defence lawyers claim neither man was . at the scene at the time of the killing and will argue that forensic . evidence has been contaminated during the course of the investigation. At the time of the murder Norris lived in Chislehurst, while Dobson lived in Eltham. Dobson and Norris both deny murder. The trial continues. Paul Peters is accused of smashing a bottle on the memorial plaque, which is in Well Hall Road, where Stephen was fatally stabbed . A man accused of smashing a glass bottle on the Stephen Lawrence memorial has denied it was a racist act of vandalism. Paul Peters, 33, is accused of smashing a bottle on the memorial plaque, which is in the road where the teen was fatally stabbed, in October. But Peters, of Kidbrooke, claims he dropped the bottle while having a drunken argument with his girlfriend. Appearing at Bexley Magistrates Court Today, Peters’ defence team indicated that he would plead not guilty to charges of racially aggravated criminal damage and criminal damage when the case goes up for trial. Michael Freeman, defending, claimed that Peters, who was arguing with his girlfriend at the time, dropped the bottle without realising he was in the vicinity of the plaque. He said: 'He was walking home drunkenly carrying a bottle in his hands. Neither of the witnesses said there was anything deliberate or reckless in the dropping of the bottle. 'Both witnesses describe him as drunk. There’s no suggestion for that part that he did anything intentional.' He added: 'He was having an argument with his girlfriend. They had to get off the bus as she was feeling unwell. They got off before their due stop. 'They began bickering and he dropped the bottle in a drunken state at that particular unfortunate point.' He also questioned whether the bottle had been dropped on the plaque itself, saying: 'It was dropped on the pavement. 'There’s no evidence that the bottle went on the memorial.' Asked whether the plaque had been damaged by the bottle, Mr Freeman said: 'I think that will only be whether there was any discolouration from what was in the bottle.' Adjourning the case until December 19, District Judge Roger Ede said: 'The allegation is that he was walking past the Stephen Lawrence memorial plaque, dropped a glass bottle and glass shattered all over the pathway. 'I am going to adjourn this case until December 19 when the trial will take place.'","Gloves were the only anti-contamination procedure in place .

Murdered: Jesse Saldivar, 48, killed Sabrina Saldivar, 3, (left), and her 30-year-old mother Veronica Erazo-Alderado (right), in Las Vegas, police said .

"By . Abul Taher . Last updated at 3:47 PM on 20th November 2011 . Accused: Nurse Roger Dean is given oxygen after the blaze . A nurse who claimed to have rescued patients from a nursing home fire has been charged with murder after five people died and 13 were critically injured. Roger Dean is accused of four counts of murder and is expected to be charged with a fifth. Four people died yesterday when fire raged through the nursing home in Sydney’s Quakers Hill suburb. The fifth, a 97-year-old woman, died in hospital earlier today. On Friday, Dean told journalists that he had braved dense smoke to rescue the helpless patients in his care. ‘I just quickly did what I could to get everyone out,’ Dean said. Det Supt Michael Willing said Dean had been helping with inquiries before he was charged. The dramatic breakthrough came after . homicide squad detectives and forensic investigators announced that the . fire at the nursing home in Quakers Hill had been deliberately lit. Wearing a black sports sweater, he said nothing as the case was heard at Sydney's Parramatta Local Court. Dean, who had short spiky black hair . with a bright red fringe, did not apply for bail and it was formally . refused. He will appear in court again next Thursday. He is believed to . have only worked in the home for a short while. Care: An elderly resident from the home is strapped to a trolly and gently put into an ambulance . Shell-shocked: Many of the elderly were covered in soot and sveveral had to be treated for burns and smoke inhalation . Police said it was expected to take . some time to establish exactly what was behind the lighting of two fires . that broke out in separate wings of the Principal nursing home in the . early hours of yesterday morning. A total of 32 people were taken to various hospitals, with 15 admitted to intensive care units. Helpless: A frail nursing home resident is rescued from the blaze in her own bed . As the media gathered at the scene of the blaze, where soot-blackened, confused and tearful residents lay in their beds that had been dragged onto the pavement, Dean talked to a television network. He said it had been important to get the people out of there as quickly as possible . The fires forced 88 residents to be evacuated, many covered in . soot. There are still grave fears for almost a dozen of the victims who are suffering from severe smoke inhalation. Elderly and infirm who could not flee the fire were pulled, still in their beds onto the footpath amid chaotic scenes. The beds lined the footpath as the frightened and confused old people were looked after by . ambulance officers and police. Firemen even hosed down some of the soot-covered residents as they lay outside in their beds. Gentle hands: Emergency workers help to safety one of the residents after her terrifying fire ordeal at the home . Probe: Police officers outside the nursing home are investigating the fire which broke out in two different parts of the building . Difficult rescue: Around 100 resident were evacuated, many frightened, confused or physically injured . 'The prognosis for the frail and elderly in an intensive care situation is pretty poor,' said Dr Nick Brennan, a geriatrician at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital. NSW Fire Commissioner Greg Mullins . described the scene as 'chaotic' and 'tragic' as more than 100 fire . crews, police and ambulance officers arrived at the home on Hambledon . Road,  just after 5am. 'This . is a firefighter's worst nightmare,' Mr Mullins said. 'Turning up to a . nursing home with elderly people who can't get themselves out of harm's . way. 'Firefighters could not see their hands . in front of their faces in the thick smoke so you can imagine what it . was like for the elderly trying to escape.' He said that firefighters had crawled . into the building through the thick smoke, reaching up to feel into . beds to establish if there was anyone there who they could rescue. 'Getting them out was like a military operation,' he said. Emergency: Paramedics help one of the blaze victims as firefighters cope with the aftermath of the tragedy . Nightmare situation: At least 15 fire engines attended the scene and police are investigating using footage shot by a freelance cameraman . The wards at the back of the home, which is described on its website as providing a 'secure, friendly and home-style environment.'  were completely gutted. Relatives . of the residents - some of whom are believed to be British-born - . arrived at the scene, praying that their loved ones were among those . rescued. NSW fire Superintendent Rick Parkes said three of the victims were found in a six-room ward at the  back of the building. A fourth died later in hospital. It was separated from the other parts of the single-storey home when a fire door came down to stop the blaze from spreading. There was no sprinkler system in the nursing home as they are not required under state laws. Rescue service: One of fire brigade vehicles which attended the blaze at the Quakers Hill nursing home . Freelance cameraman Adrian Munn, . choking back tears at what he had witnessed, said: 'I saw only smoke . when I arrived, billowing everywhere. One of the police officers grabbed . me and asked me to get all the footage I could.' 'They wanted to get as much as they could for an ongoing investigation.' He added: 'It's quite a thing down . here. It is very, very, sad, seeing elderly people gasping for breath, . moaning and crying for help. It was a heartrending scene.' Firefighters . reported flames shooting through the roof at one end of the building . while another blaze was believed to have started in a bedroom. NSW assistant police commissioner Robert Redfern earlier confirmed the fire was being treated as 'suspicious' and revealed that homicide and arson squads had joined fire investigators and forensic officers at the scene.' But he stressed that 'all fires such as this' were considered suspicious. Traumatised: Elderly residents were evacuated to the nearby church where they were cared for by local residents and counsellors . The Reverend Dave Hilliard, the senior state police chaplain, praised two young police officers who were among the first to enter the burning building and rescue residents. 'They're young and being asked to do some extraordinary things beyond their years,' he said. 'I'm blown away by them.' Families of victims were being cared for in the nearby Quakers Hill Anglican Church by counsellors and chaplains from emergency services. The fire is Sydney's worst since 16 residents died in a nursing home blaze in suburban Sylvania Heights in 1981.","Nurse Roger Dean, 35, charged over deaths .

"By . Nadia Gilani . Last updated at 2:48 PM on 21st November 2011 . The music mogul decided to make the donation to end a legal battle with the charity over an all-girl act which appeared on the X-Factor. Mr Cowell - the show's executive producer was involved in a dispute with the charity Rhythmix after one of the girl groups on the show took the same name. The Brighton-based charity, which has been operating in Kent, Surrey and Sussex for 10 years, helps disabled and vulnerable young people through music. Re-branded: The X Factor contestants, pictured, have been named Little Mix following the dispute . The charity had protested when its name was copied by the all-girl group on the ITV programme. The actual sum of the donation remains a secret but it is understood that it will be more than the £20,000 legal costs the charity has incurred in a legal fight to protect its trademark according to the Independent on Sunday. The charity took legal action against Mr Cowell's company, SyCo after he made an attempt to trademark the name for the group. A host of celebrities including Stephen Fry, Armando Iannucci and Alistair McGowan backed the charity's cause. SyCo withdrew the application to trademark the name earlier this month but the charity was still faced with huge legal costs. The agreement was reached on Friday between Rhythmix's chief executive, Mark Davyd, and Cowell's company SyCo, through the PR agent Max Clifford. Charitable: Simon Cowell agreed to pay a sum that is believed to be more than the amount needed to cover the charity's legal costs . The girl group was also renamed Little Mix. The charity's chief executive Mark Davyd told The Independent on Sunday: 'We are very pleased this has been brought to an amicable conclusion. 'These are difficult times for charities, and we are very pleased that we have been able to reach an agreement with SyCo to put this matter behind us.' Fry praised the deal on Twitter yesterday, saying: 'Hurrah. Simon Cowell's company did the decent thing and came to a satisfactory arrangement with the charity Rhythmix about their name.' The charity is now preparing to go into an other battle - this time with the Education Secretary over plans for music provision in schools. The Independent on Sunday reported that publication of the Government's national music plan has been delayed amid a row over ring-fencing funding. Campaigners want music education to remain protected and are pressing for greater support for children with special educational needs and those described as gifted. Mr Davyd said that ministers must acknowledge the link between this summer's riots and the closure of youth centres when planning music provision.","Rhythmix helps disabled and .

"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . Last updated at 9:38 AM on 17th November 2011 . Speech: David Cameron delivers his address at the Lord Mayor's banquet last night, . where he said the EU debt crisis was a chance to claw back powers from . the EU . David Cameron last night said the EU was ‘in peril’ and described the debt crisis as an ‘opportunity’ to claw back  powers for Britain. After being rocked by a Tory MP rebellion over Britain’s future in the EU, the Prime Minister cast himself as a ‘sceptic’, attacking ‘grand plans and utopian visions’ and vowing to ‘refashion the EU so it better serves this nation’s interests’. He accused the EU of being out of touch and attacked its ‘pointless interference, rules and regulations’. His remarks are diametrically at odds with those of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who called yesterday for the EU to focus on building a ‘political union’ as she warned the continent faced its biggest crisis since the Second World War. She said: ‘The task of our generation is to complete economic and monetary union, and build political union in Europe, step by step. That does not mean less Europe, it means more Europe. If the euro fails, then Europe will fail.’ But as Mr Cameron prepared to start a whistlestop tour of European capitals, he said EU countries had ‘indulged in debt and overspending and looked uncertain or worse when confronted with the consequences’. Addressing the annual Lord Mayor’s Banquet in London, the Prime Minister insisted leaving the EU would not be in Britain’s interest, with European countries accounting for half of our trade. But he said he wanted an organisation ‘with the flexibility of a network, not the rigidity of a bloc’. Despite the installation of EU-approved technocratic governments in Greece and Italy, economic turmoil is continuing to ravage Europe. Attacks: Mr Cameron cast himself as a 'sceptic' of the EU in his speech last night, . and vowed to 'refashion the Union so it better served British . interests' Simple: Samantha Cameron chose a black full-length skirt and top for the occasion . Classic look: Samantha Cameron looks elegant as she arrives at the Great Hall for the banquet in her simple black dress and necklace . Kiss good luck: Mrs Cameron's pecks her husband on the cheek at a drinks reception ahead of the banquet . Italy was forced to pay an effective . interest rate of 6.29 per cent as it sold government bonds yesterday to . fund its vast national debt of £1.6trillion. The yield on Spain’s . government bonds crept above 6 per cent – almost three times that of the . UK, which is increasingly being seen as a safe haven by international . investors. Mrs Merkel – who is refusing to allow . the European Central Bank to do more to prop up the euro because it . would mean German taxpayers underwriting Italian and Greek debt – . insisted changes to EU treaties were needed. ‘It is time for a . breakthrough to a new Europe,’ she said in Leipzig. Mrs Merkel said the EU did need a . ‘rescue fund’ to hold the euro together, but suggested it was more . important to enable ‘better budgetary control throughout the eurozone’. Mr Cameron, who has been under . pressure from his party to set out a timetable for repatriating powers . from Brussels and seeking approval for a looser relationship in a . referendum, suggested that instead less should be done at a European . level.

Praise: Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams used his speech to praise the integrity of the clergy at St Paul's Cathedral during the recent protests . ‘The EU’s achievements are . dramatically overshadowed by its problems,’ he said. ‘It’s not just the . crisis in the eurozone – urgent and all-consuming though that is. ‘It’s how out of touch the EU has . become when its institutions are demanding budget increases while . Europe’s citizens tighten their belts. It’s the pointless interference, . rules and regulations that stifle growth, not unleash it.’ His remarks will be seen as an attempt to appease his party’s eurosceptics. London Mayor Boris Johnson yesterday . became the most senior Tory to question the Government’s willingness to . boost the resources of the International Monetary Fund, which acts as . the world’s global economic emergency service. ‘British taxpayers are . going to be shelling out ever more in bailout dosh, much of which will . ultimately go to banks and bankers’ bonuses,’ he protested.

Arrival: The Lord Mayor of London David Wotton and his wife Liz enter the Guildhall in the City of London, for the annual banquet in his honour . At odds: Mr Cameron's remarks were the opposite of Angela Merkel, who yesterday called on the EU to focus on a 'political union' Suggesting he would use treaty . negotiations to try to repatriate powers for the UK, Mr Cameron added: . ‘Change brings opportunities, an opportunity to begin to refashion the . EU so it better serves this nation’s interests and the interests of its . other 26 nations too. ‘An opportunity, in Britain’s case, . for powers to ebb back instead of flow away, and for the European Union . to focus on what really matters. ‘That is the kind of fundamental reform I yearn for, and I am determined to do everything possible to deliver it.’ George Osborne last night hit out at . European plans for a financial transaction tax, describing them as a . ‘bullet aimed at the heart of London’. The Chancellor said it would be . ‘economic suicide’, doing massive damage to the City of London – . Europe’s financial centre – and allowing competitors in the U.S. and . China to undercut British firms. Brussels wants the tax to help pay for . a eurozone bailout, saying it could raise £35billion, but Mr Osborne . said: ‘Europe shouldn’t be creating new burdens. Proposals for a . Europe-only transactions tax are a bullet aimed at the heart of London.’ He added: ‘Even the European Commission admits that it would cost . hundreds of thousands of jobs.’","Vows to refashion EU to best serve nation's interests .

But in reality the Rhode Island native was posing as an extremist in a violent world and trying to help the FBI prevent far right terror attacks. Former informer: John Matthews, 59, told Newsweek he appeared as a troubled and paranoid Vietnam veteran who could not hold down a job, flat or marriage . Mr Matthews, who always kept a backpack with provisions by his bedroom door, revealed all to his family when he developed a fatal lung condition. ‘These people are just plain crazy,’ he told Newsweek. ‘If they don’t like you, they (would) take you out to have you shot.

Scientists say Britain's only poisonous snake is in more urgent need of help than any other reptile or amphibian species in the UK. A conference of conservationists met at the Greenwich University campus in Chatham, Kent, at the weekend to discuss ways of saving the once common snake. Endangered: A black adder, Vipera berus, in Sussex. Snakes like this are now extinct in a number of British counties . It backed a plan to create a website for a survey project in which volunteers monitor snake numbers at their local sites. Adders are rapidly declining in numbers and the species is already extinct in some counties, including Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire. One of the biggest threats is damage to hibernation sites, such as rabbit holes and tree roots. Herpetologist Dr Chris Gleed-Owen told the Daily Telegraph: 'The adder is an enigmatic snake, steeped in history and folklore, from the druids to Shakespeare and Arthurian legend. An adder being tested as government conservation agency Natural England, the Zoological Society of London and Oxford University carry out health checks on wild snakes earlier this year . 'It would be tragic to see it disappear.' Despite the drop in numbers, there is anecdotal evidence among vets of an increase in people and pets being bitten by adders this year. In July, two dogs died in Essex after being bitten by poisonous adders that were out in unusually large numbers because of the hot weather. There have been 14 known fatalities among humans in Britain since 1876. The last was a five-year-old child who died in 1975. Several . anti-venoms are now available which limit the effects to nausea and . drowsiness, followed by severe bruising and swelling around the bite. Dogs . and other pets are more susceptible to the venom because they are . smaller than humans. And treatment is often delayed because owners often . don't realise what is wrong at first.","Snake is extinct in Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire .

"By . Katherine Faulkner . Last updated at 8:45 AM on 22nd November 2011 . Axe murderer: Intars Pless was allowed to move to Britain in 2010 without anyone knowing about his criminal past . Police had ‘no idea’ an Eastern European axe murderer was living in the country until he killed an innocent woman while drink-driving. Latvian Intars Pless, 34, came to Britain last year after serving six years for murdering a friend. But the authorities were unaware of  his criminal past until February this  year when he ran his car straight into Valentina Planciunene. He then drove away from the scene – leaving the 37-year-old moped rider from Belarus to die on the road in Boston, Lincolnshire. After Pless was convicted on Friday of causing death by dangerous driving, prosecutor Stuart Lody said: ‘The court may be astonished to know the British authorities had no way of knowing if a foreign national convicted of murder is in the country until that person is charged under an English law and they can do a check. ‘Lincolnshire Police had no idea a man such as this was living among the good people of Boston.’ But Judge Sean  Morris replied: ‘I am not surprised.’ Turning to the jury at Lincoln Crown Court, he said: ‘Members of the jury, welcome to our world.’ Miss Planciunene left for work on her . moped in the early hours of February 15 after celebrating Valentine’s . Day with her British partner of two years, Darien Long. The court heard that Miss Planciunene . took safety very seriously and had been wearing a white helmet and a . fluorescent yellow coat. She was knocked into an oncoming . people carrier by Pless, who was driving while two-and-a-half times over . the limit after drinking whisky all night. Victim: Valentina Planciunene, 37, was on her way to work on Valentine's Day when she was killed by Pless while he was driving at more than twice the legal limit . A year earlier, Pless had been released . from a Latvian prison after serving time for his murderous attack on a . drinking companion. He slashed the man with an axe, fatally slicing through his jugular . vein, then tried to destroy the evidence by setting fire to the house . where the crime was committed. Previously, he had been sentenced to three years’ jail for a serious . theft in Latvia. But despite these offences, as an EU national he was . able to come to the UK with only minimal checks. The jury heard Miss Planciunene, who . came to the UK from Belarus four years ago, was riding her 125cc bike to . her job at a local food processing factory when Pless's car knocked her . into . the path of an oncoming people carrier. ‘The driver had no time to take avoiding . action.’ Although Pless stopped his car a short distance from the crash . he then drove off after his passenger got out. 'When we first saw each other, . I suppose you could say it was love at first sight. 'She was my life, not a day goes by without me thinking of her and missing her' DRINK-DRIVE VICTIM'S BRITISH PARTNER . When Pless was arrested, he  denied he had been driving. Police had to send officers to Latvia to eliminate as a suspect the man he claimed was behind the wheel. Miss Planciunene had come to the UK from Belarus four years ago. She lived in Boston and worked long hours in a food processing plant. After Pless was found guilty on Friday, Mr Long, 44, said: ‘She was my life. Not a day goes by without me thinking of her and missing her.’ Pless, who faces up to 14 years in prison, will be sentenced at a later date. After remanding him in  custody, Judge Morris said: ‘I will be recommending the deportation of this man.’ The ‘free movement’ directive means it is virtually impossible to stop EU citizens with criminal convictions from entering Britain. The policy – which was agreed by Labour in 2004 – means that anyone from the EU has the freedom to travel to the UK without the same stringent tests applied those from other countries. A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘The onus for flagging someone’s criminal history lies with the police in their home country. We would then use this information to decide whether they should be allowed into the UK.’","Used axe to 'garrot' drinking partner in Latvia before setting fire to house to hide evidence .

A teenager climbed scaffolding while high on meow meow and plunged to his death, an inquest heard. Aidan McSweeney, 18, sustained multiple injuries when he fell from the rooftop after taking drug mephedrone. The clever teenager had recently moved out of the family village home in Towcester, Northamptonshire, after his A-levels to live with friends in town. His distraught mother Lynne Bucinikas, 54, described her son as a ‘sensitive’ boy who became a victim of peer pressure. Away from home he lived in an environment where drugs like mephedrone were readily available which he took to ‘fit in’. Lynne, who runs a landscape gardening business, yesterday sent a stark warning to other parents. She said: ‘I think it's appalling that so many youngsters died before it was made illegal. Even now you can find it and other manufactured drugs like it online. ‘It's become socially acceptable to take at parties and I want parents to realise how freely available these drugs are to young people. ‘My son was a sensitive and intelligent boy but he wanted to fit in, you wouldn't realise the danger if everyone is doing it. ‘He moved out to live with his friends. We live in a quiet village so it allowed him to go out, I was happy for him to enjoy himself. ‘I think he took the drugs to feel accepted by his peers, he always wanted to be the entertainer at parties. ‘Before he died we heard that he had not slept for three days on this drug. We were told that other times he woke up in unfamiliar places with no idea how he got there.’ Aidan moved out of his family home in Towcester, which he shared with his mother and sister Catlin, 17, to a flat in Northampton. Grieving family: Lynne Bucinkas and her 17 year old daughter Caitlyn from Paulerspury, near Northampton, say Aidan became the victim of peer pressure . He had finished his A-Levels and was deciding whether to take a year out or accept his place at Coventry University to read politics. Aidan died in hospital just eight hours after he plunged to the pavement near his flat at 2.25am, on July 19, last year. He had climbed up onto scaffolding and fell from the roof in what Lynne believes was a drug-fuelled prank. Traces of mephedrone, which was made illegal just three months earlier in April 2010, were found in his system. The heartbroken mother spoke out after a coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death at his inquest at Northampton Coroners Court. Lynne blasted a young man who was known to hold drug fuelled parties at the time of her son’s death and was later convicted of dealing. She said: ‘We know that Aidan was seen going to this dealers house about four hours before he died but he denied selling Aidan drugs. ‘He was the same age as Aidan and held parties for youngsters where drugs were available. ‘He made so much money from selling to impressionable kids. He avoided police detection because he wasn't your typical drug dealer. ‘He was geeky looking, from an affluent family and drove a nice car. ‘Aidan saw this dealer as a friend but he was just an evil predator who got kids hooked on drugs. ‘We know Aidan took mephedrone before his death and I am convinced that if he hadn't he would be here now.’","Aidan McSweeney had not slept for three days before his death, while on the drug, his mother said .

Two young activists wanted to make sure Tim Pawlenty remembers what San Francisco is known for: Harvey Milk, gay rights, direct action... and glitter. Nancy Mancias and Chelsea Byers from the anti-war and liberal group Code Pink approached the Republican presidential hopeful at a book signing in the California city yesterday, where they shouted at him and showered him with pink glitter and confetti. Ms Mancias shouted at the former governor of Minnesota: 'Where's your courage to stand for gay rights and women's reproductive rights? Where's your courage?' The word 'courage' is a reference to Mr Pawlenty's new book title, 'Courage to Stand'. He was at the Moscone Center yesterday to sign copies during the American Health Insurance Plans conference. The former governor has campaigned on his opposition to Barack Obama's healthcare reform. In January, Mr Pawlenty said that he would support reinstating the controversial 'don't ask, don't tell' policy, which had prevented gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military, and which Congress repealed last year, in part because of pressure from the Obama administration. In a video made of yesterday's Code Pink protest, which was posted on YouTube, the two activists can be seen effortlessly walking up to Mr Pawlenty's table, which seems essentially free. Mr Pawlenty can be seen sitting at the table, surrounded by several other men in suits. Approach: Tim Pawlenty, left, signs books at a health insurance conference in San Francisco yesterday.

A man in a police uniform quickly approaches the two women and drives them away from the table. Ms Mancias turns back toward the table several times, while repeating her original question. She also shouts, 'Welcome to San Francisco, home of gay hero Harvey Milk. Where's your courage to stand?' Mr Pawlenty quickly escapes, while his associates try to dust off the glitter. Police escort the women out . Ms Mancias shouts, 'Welcome to San Francisco, home of gay hero Harvey Milk. Where's your courage to stand?' Ms Mancias, who is a Code Pink campaign organizer, told The Bay Citizen afterwards that their protest seemed to catch the candidate off-guard. She said: 'He sort of looked at us and had this look of ""Oh, no"". I don't think anyone expected what was coming' Ms Mancias said they got the idea for the 'glitter bomb' from another protester, Nick Espinosa, who did the same thing to Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich during a book signing in Minneapolis in May. In the widely circulated video of that protest, Mr Espinosa told Mr Gingrich to 'stop the hate, stop the anti-gay politics'. Ms Mancias told The Bay Citizen: 'We were inspired by Nick Espinosa and did the same to Tim Pawlenty. Some of these people are so hard to reach, we have to use this to get our message out, confronting them in this fashion'. Showing a pragmatic side, Ms Mancias admitted that her action is unlikely to change Mr Pawlenty's stance on the issues. But she said she hopes it will focus the public's attention on where he stands. About throwing glitter, Ms Mancias said: 'It's nonviolent and it looks great. It's just disarming. How can you be mad at anybody who throws glitter?'

Allowed out: Gary Kays has fathered a child while on temporary release from prison during his seven-year term for his role in the shooting of Rhys Jones . One of the gang convicted over the murder of 11-year-old Rhys Jones fathered a child while serving his seven-year sentence in prison, it has emerged. Gary Kays, who helped cover up the youngster's shooting in 2007, was allowed to meet up with his girlfriend after being granted temporary release by prison bosses earlier this year. Kays, 28, was at her bedside when she gave birth to his second child, a baby boy, last month, it was reported in The Liverpool Echo. He was freed from jail on licence five days later after serving half the sentence handed down to him for his role in Rhys's killing in Liverpool. The Prison Service has defended Kay's temporary release, saying it followed standard practices. But the fact he was able to have a sexual relationship while serving a prison sentence will add further despair for Rhys's family. His parents have repeatedly spoken of their anger as those jailed over his killing have been set free early from prison. The youngster was shot in the car park of a pub, in Croxteth, Liverpool, in August 2007 after innocently being caught up in a turf war between rival gangs. Kays had made the phone call to Rhys's killer, Sean Mercer, 18, to confront rival gang members who'd been spotted at the pub. Tragedy: Rhys Jones, 11, was shot dead in a pub car park in Liverpool in 2007, the innocent victim of a gang war . And he was with fellow Croxteth Crew gang member Melvin Coy when they picked up the gunman after Rhys's murder and helped him dispose of evidence. Kays was later convicted of assisting an offender but his release from prison leaves only Mercer and another member of the gang, James Yates, in jail. The Prison Service would not confirm how often Kays was granted temporary release during his time behind bars. But it's understood he was allowed to meet up with his girlfriend on several occasions and even kept in touch with her via Facebook from his prison cell. Anger: The revelation that Kays has been allowed to have a sexual relationship during his prison term is sure to bring further anguish on Rhys's parents, Melanie and Stephen Jones (pictured) A Prison Service spokesperson said: 'We do not comment on individual prisoners. 'Prisoners can be released on temporary licence after being thoroughly risk-assessed and subject to conditions of that licence. 'This . allows prisoners to resettle back into the community by giving them the . opportunity to find work, re-establish family ties and ensure housing . needs are met. 'These are essential components for successful resettlement and an important factor in protecting the public.' Cover-up: Shooter Sean Mercer (left) was helped by Kays and fellow Croxteth Crew member Melvin Coy (right) to dispose of evidence after the killing . On hearing that Kays and Coy were due to be released from prison, Rhys's father Steve said last month: 'That only leaves Sean Mercer and James Yates now inside. That does not seem right.' He added: 'Kays and Coy can get on with their lives and do what they want to do. At the time, the prison sentences seem like a good whack, but when they are released it does not seem fair. 'We know they cannot be jailed for the rest of their lives, but we as a family still suffer.'

A disabled 92-year-old was battered to death by her own granddaughter after the pensioner found out she was stealing her life savings. Daisy Myring was found crying on her bedroom floor after Sheila Jones had attacked her with a stool. The widow died hours later. Yesterday Jones, 36, stood impassively in the dock as she was jailed for life after admitting murder. Murder: Sheila Jones, left, killed her 92-year-old grandmother Daisy Myring after stealing over £7,000 from her . The mother of two – who wore a . crucifix in court – had launched the attack hours before Mrs Myring was . due to visit her building society over suspicions Jones had been raiding . her account. The pensioner, who was registered . blind and had a heart condition, had four visits a day from professional . carers, but Jones helped to look after her at her home in Brownhills, . West Midlands. Prosecutor Gareth Walters said Jones was entrusted with . access to Mrs Myring’s building society account. She ‘frittered’ away £7,200 of the widow’s money on a TV, a holiday and gifts for her two children. By the time of her death in May, a year after the thefts started, Mrs Myring had just £48 to her name. Mr Walters said Jones had gone to her grandmother’s house during the night with a torch and a pillow, intending to smother her. ‘She was hoping to put it down to . Daisy’s poor heart’, he said. But ‘something went wrong,’ and when the . pensioner resisted, Jones picked up the plastic stool. Home: Jones's house in Norton Canes, Staffordshire. She has been sentenced to life imprisonment . In a ‘frenzied and ferocious’ attack, . Jones smashed the chair over Mrs Myring’s head, punched and kicked her . and attempted to strangle her. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard that . Mrs Myring, who relied on a pacemaker, was found conscious by a carer . the morning after she was attacked, but was so dazed she could not . identify her attacker. She was severely injured, with five . large cuts to her head, a bruise the size of a fist on her face, a . broken collarbone, a dislocated shoulder, fractured rib and extensive . bruising on her neck. She died later in hospital. Mr Walters said Jones was arrested in the aftermath of the attack but claimed her grandmother had loaned her £6,000. She was released on bail due to a lack . of evidence but was rearrested when, ‘by chance’, a police patrol car . saw her walking in a country lane carrying two bin liners. The black sacks contained the broken stool and clothing and a pillow spattered with her victim’s blood. The bags had been left on open ground, . but Jones, from Norton Canes, Staffordshire, had gone to retrieve them . after becoming ‘frightened’ by reports police were due to search the . area. Sentencing, Judge Phillip Parker QC told Jones: ‘You killed the . person you were entrusted with looking after. ‘Taking her savings was callous and cruel but taking her life was unforgivable. ‘You deprived her of a peaceful end to her life and you deprived her of leaving her precious savings to those she wished.’ He gave Jones a life sentence and ordered that she serve a minimum term of 22-and-a-half years. Detective Inspector Simon Astle from West Midlands Police said the motive for the crime was simple greed. David Worrall, the victim’s grandson and Jones’s brother, said his family was ‘delighted’ by the sentence.","Sheila Jones frittered away £7,200 of widower Daisy Myring's savings .

Yule tide: Many say that online shopping is more convenient and less stressful . A spokesperson at Kelkoo, said: 'With £424 million being spent on just one day, . Monday will be a hugely significant day for online retailers. 'Overall, the six weeks in the run-up . to Christmas will be a time for e-tailers to really boost their sales . figures at the end of a challenging trading year.' The estimated figures are a considerable increase from last year. Gifts 33.7 per cent . Christmas travel 24.5 per cent . Decorations 20.6 per cent . Food and drink 6.7 per cent . According to Centre for Retail Research . According to a study commissioned by online consultancy Tealeaf, shoppers only spent £2.8bn online over the same period in 2010. Popular purchases included Apple gadgets such as the iPad and iPod Touch, televisions, video games, . Lego toys and the children's Mini Micro scooter. Lunch time was the busiest time as millions of office workers logged on at their work computers. The peak minute was at 1.15pm  where e-tailers collectively took £832,000. Last year’s online Christmas sales were up 44 per cent on the previous year, and this year it is believed technological advances will further boost sales. The Centre for Retail Research forecasts that some 12 per cent, or £1.64bn worth of shopping will be done via mobile phone. A spokesperson from Kelkoo added: 'In particular, we were interested to see that this year, shopping on mobile phones is set to increase significantly, opening up more opportunities for retailers to sell any place, any time.' With a quarter of the UK public now doing Christmas shopping online, retailers are being urged to prepare their web-based store fronts for surges in demand, especially if they are offering attractive deals. It is believed 33.7 per cent of online spending will be on gifts, 24.5 per cent on Christmas travel, 20.6 per cent on decorations and 6.7 per cent on food and drink. People revealed convenience, reduced stress and cheaper prices as reasons for buying gifts on the internet. According to sales website Showroomprive.co.uk a fifth of Brits find high street shopping more stressful than commuting while others said they would prefer a trip to the dentist .","'Mega Monday' spending boom comes early after last year's snow meant many missed out .

The lives of Sarah, 6, and Ethan, 10, were torn apart this year when their 12-year-old brother stabbed them and shot dead their parents. Now the siblings are trying to build a new life in Missouri with their uncle and aunt after leaving Burlington, Colorado, where the tragedy struck. Wally and Sylvia Long adopted the two after they miraculously survived the attack at their home that saw their brother jailed for seven years. Scroll down for video . Recovering: The lives of Sarah, 6, and Ethan, 10, were flipped on their heads this year when their 12-year-old brother stabbed them and killed their parents . The unidentified devout Christian boy went on the rampage in March, shooting Ethan twice and stabbing him six times, reported 9 News. He also cut Sarah’s throat and stabbed her several times. The children survived, but he shot dead his parents Charles, 50, and Marilyn Long, 51. ‘My brother killed them,’ Sarah Long told 9 News. ‘He also hurt me and Ethan. I don't know why he did that. Now he's in prison.’ She said she is pleased he is in prison ‘because he won't touch us ever again’, and likes calling her adoptive parents ‘Uncle Dad' and 'Uncle Mom’. New parents: Wally and Sylvia Long adopted the two after they miraculously survived in the terror attack that saw their brother jailed for seven years . ‘I think the only reason I remember is . because it hurt,’ Ethan Long told 9 News, adding he hit his pain . medication button ‘as much as I could’. 'My brother killed them. He also hurt me and Ethan. I don't know why he did that. Now he's in prison' Sarah Long . Wally and Sylvia home-school the . children after prayers and breakfast and said they had prayed about . adopting more children in the past. ‘We're just overwhelmed that they . survived,’ Mrs Long told 9 News. ‘We have the privilege of raising them . for their mom and daddy.’ Her husband said they are getting . used to a six-year-old running around the house and a 10-year-old asking . questions about everything they do. No explanation: Devout churchgoers Charles and Marilyn Long were shot dead at their home. A relative said 'their children were their life' The scene: Charles Long and Marilyn Long were found dead after their son called to report that shots were fired at their home . Mr Long added that they still do not know why the jailed brother went on his crazy rampage, but perhaps ‘something just broke in his mind’. 'I think the only reason I remember is because it hurt' Ethan Long . The killings shocked the Burlington community, which remembered the killer as a ‘well-socialised’ boy, who greeted visitors at Sunday church services. The children often ask their adoptive parents ‘Will you keep us safe?’ Now Sarah wants to use all her savings on a surprise family present. Mr Long told 9 News he wanted to thank people across the U.S. who have been praying for the family. ‘It means a lot,’ he said.

"By . Lucy Buckland . Last updated at 9:17 AM on 16th November 2011 . Cab drivers and their passengers are to be spied on during journeys in what has been denounced as a ‘a staggering invasion of privacy’. CCTV cameras are to be fitted in 650 taxis – costing the taxpayer £260,000 – to monitor drivers throughout their shift and record the conversations of passengers. The cameras will begin recording sound and vision from the moment the ignition is turned on and remain on for 30 minutes after the engine has stopped running. Big Brother is listening to you: Every taxi in Oxford will have a CCTV camera . The footage gathered will be kept for . 28 days on a CCTV hard-drive in case it is needed following, for . example, an attack on the driver. It will cost Oxford City Council . taxpayers £400 to fit each of the 107 black cabs and 545 private hire . vehicles in the city with the CCTV system. The fact that recordings will be . encrypted and only accessible in the event of a police investigation are . added safeguards, a council spokesman insisted. Civil liberties campaigners attacked the measure. Nick Pickles, the campaign group's director, said: ‘This is a staggering invasion of privacy, being done with no evidence, no consultation and a total disregard for civil liberties. ‘Big Brother now has big ears, and they are eavesdropping on your conversations with absolutely no justification.’ He added: ‘Given that one rail route to Witney [David Cameron's constituency] is through Oxford, we'll be letting the Prime Minister know that his staff might want to avoid using Oxford cabs.’ A . spokeswoman for Oxford City Council said video and audio would run all the time in the cabs but officials will only be allowed to view the material if there has been a complaint. Complaints: Oxford City Council said it acted after an increase in complaints where it was one person's word against another . The authority said complaints against both taxi drivers and passengers had increased year on year and without CCTV the allegations 'amount to one persons word against the other'. Complaints included overcharging, sexual assaults and attacks on drivers. The spokeswoman added: ‘Oxford City Council considers that so long as clear notices are provided in vehicles which inform passengers that video and audio recording may be taking place, the risk of intrusion is acceptable compared to the public safety benefits. ‘In any event, the level of privacy reasonably to be expected in a licensed vehicle is far lower than that expected in the privacy of one’s home or own car.’ She added that the footage will not be routinely viewed, but will be kept for 28 days on a CCTV hard-drive in case it is needed following a specific incident. CCTV: Oxford City Council said as long as clear notices appear in all taxis the 'risk of intrusion is acceptable' A spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner's Office said it is not normally justified to use CCTV to record conversations between members of the public as 'it is highly intrusive'. But she added that council applications to install cameras in cabs are likely to be acceptable because of the number of crimes being committed in taxis. An ICO spokeswoman said: ‘Licensing authorities must take account of people's right to privacy when deciding whether to impose CCTV as a licence condition for taxi drivers. ‘As well as assessing the impact on privacy, we have accepted they [councils] can take into account factors such as the likelihood of crimes being committed against drivers and passengers; the vulnerable one-to-one situation; the fact that taxis are travelling all over the area at different times of day; and CCTV can protect both the driver and passengers.’ All taxis licensed for the first time by Oxford City Council must have the equipment installed from April 6 next year. Cabs which are already registered will have until April 2015 to get the camera fitted, the council said.","All cabs in Oxford will have at least one CCTV camera .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:08 PM on 23rd November 2011 . A Connecticut man convicted of killing a mother and her two daughters in a 2007 home invasion said the crime got out of control and that he felt so remorseful he was suicidal, a psychiatrist testified today during the sentencing phase. Dr Richard Dudley Jr testified that Joshua Komisarjevsky told him the situation became increasingly out of control but he didn’t know what to do. 'He explained that the victims certainly didn’t have to die,' Dr Dudley said. 'He talked about how bad he felt about that. And he talked about how at the end of it all how suicidal he was.' Guilty: The jury convicted Joshua Komisarjevsky last month on all 17 counts in the home invasion - including capital felony, murder and sexual assault . Prosecutors have questioned Komisarjevsky’s remorse, noting he blamed the sole survivor, Dr William Petit, for not doing more to help his family even though he was beaten with a bat and tied up. In his taped confession to police, Komisarjevsky spoke matter-of-factly and laughed occasionally. Dr Dudley said he did not believe Komisarjevsky’s views about Petit were inconsistent with remorse. He said those feelings were more related to believing he was not protected as a child from sexual abuse he suffered by his foster brother. The jury will decide whether Komisarjevsky gets the death penalty or life in prison. The jury was shown this image of Komisarjevsky with his mother from a happier time before the horror home invasion . Komisarjevsky and co-defendant Steven Hayes were convicted of capital felony, murder and sexual assault in the killings of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters at their Cheshire home. Hayes is on death row after he was convicted last year of raping and strangling Hawke-Petit and killing her daughters, who died of smoke inhalation after they were tied to their beds and left to die in a fire. Komisarjevsky portrayed himself as reluctant to commit the burglary with Hayes because in the past he always acted alone and didn’t know Hayes well. But he also described the thrill he got from home invasions, Dr Dudley said. Victims: Dr William Petit Jr (left) with his daughters Michaela (front) Hayley, (centre rear) and his wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit . Prosecutor Michael Dearington reminded jurors that Komisarjevsky targeted the Petit house and sexually abused Petit’s 11-year-old daughter. He pressed Dr Dudley on whether the crime was motivated not only by money but also by sexual assault. 'I think the possibilities are open,' Dr Dudley said. Komisarjevsky’s nine-year-old daughter is scheduled to testify by videotape on Wednesday as the defence tries to convince the jury to spare him the death penalty. The girl was interviewed earlier by a child psychologist and the defence is expected to play about 20 minutes of her nearly hour-long interview. Dr Dudley testified that Komisarjevsky is 'extremely attached' to his daughter. 'He saw her response to him as just kind of unconditional acceptance,' Dr Dudley said. Under cross examination, Dr Dudley said Komisarjevsky only spent weeks with his daughter before he was charged with the home invasion. He had been in prison earlier for a string of residential burglaries. Family: Joshua Komisarjevsky's mother, Jude, who testified again today, holds him in her arms as a baby shortly after his 1981 birth. He was adopted at two-weeks-old . Happier times: Joshua Komisarjevsky dances with his mother in this undated photo . Dr Dudley testified on Monday that Komisarjevsky has suffered from a mood disorder since he was a child that includes periods of profound depression. He also said Komisarjevsky, who was adopted, has a family history of mental illness. Mr Dearington pressed Dr Dudley on why he relied on an anonymous letter about the family’s history. Dr Dudley said his diagnosis was based on his own evaluation of Komisarjevsky and that the letter was consistent with his findings. At least 10 per cent of the population suffers from mood disorders, Dr Dudley said. He concluded that Komisarjevsky's judgement was impaired by his mental condition, but that it was not a direct cause of the crime. Meanwhile, Komisarjevsky's tearful mother, Jude Komisarjevsky, told the jury today her son is shocked at his role in the crime and she blames it on sexual abuse he suffered as a child. 'He was just in shock that he was involved in something like this,' she told the court. 'He was asking how did this happen, how did I get to this point? He eventually got to the point, I can't retrace the steps. So he's just trying to see what he can salvage for himself.' Charred: The house was set alight with the girls still inside, tied up with pillowcases over their heads . Horror: An image shown to the court shows the charred bedroom of Hayley Petit after the attack . The defence says Komisarjevsky was sexually abused between the ages of four to six by a foster teen his family had taken into the home. 'I think we basically feel that we wished we had said no to being foster parents, because we don't think we'd be here today,' Jude Komisarjevsky said, crying. Jude Komisarjevsky, who testified at the beginning of the sentencing phase, was called to take the stand again today, and testified about bringing her granddaughter to see Komisarjevsky in prison when he was sentenced for earlier home burglaries. The defence showed jurors a photo of Komisarjevsky with his daughter during one visit as his mother described how she would sit on his lap as he read her stories. Jurors also saw photos of Komisarjevsky with his arm around his daughter opening a Christmas present. One daughter smiled as she viewed the photos. Jude Komisarjevsky recalled her son putting his daughter to bed the night of the crime. 'He talked about her, how sweet and precious she was,' his mother said. 'I had a sense he felt things were not good and this was like a goodbye.' The defence is expected to rest next Tuesday. The sentencing phase began October 25.","Psychiatrist testifies Joshua Komisarjevsky has remorse about 2007 triple murder .

"By . Jessica Satherley . Last updated at 8:31 PM on 16th November 2011 . Desperate refugees trying to cross the Sinai Desert are having their organs snatched while they are still alive by ruthless doctors, it has emerged. Medics travel from Cairo to camps in the heart of the vast sands to harvest kidneys, livers, corneas and corneas from the helpless donors. They then transport the organs back to Egypt in mobile refrigeration units where patients are waiting to receive them. Lawless: Tens of thousands of refugees from African try to flee across the Sinai desert to enter Israel . Thousands of refugees are believed to have died as a result of the operations, their bodies bearing tell-tale scars which show where the organs have been removed. The illegal trade – believed to be the second most lucrative in the region behind weapons smuggling – has been exposed in a CNN documentary. Death In The Desert, part of the network’s Freedom Project, reveals the plight of refugees from Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea crossing the Sinai in an attempt to reach Israel. Grim: This man's body appears to show scars after his organs had been removed . Tribe crime: Members of the Bedouin tribes are apparently responsible for the organ-snatching (stock image of three bedouin tribesmen) According to the report, refugees also face rape, extortion and slavery and are frequently held in labour camps in the lawless desert. The Sinai Peninsula is under the control of Bedouin tribes, and police rarely ever venture into the area. Smuggling and contraband is the main economy and when refugees put their trust into smugglers to get them across the border, they are instead being sold to the Bedouins and taken to labour camps. On assignment: Journalist Fred Pleitgen uncovers the claims of organ harvesting in the CNN documentary: 'Death In The Desert' Organ trafficking: Journalist Fred Pleitgen (right) interviews The Head of the New Generation Foundation for Human Rights about organ harvesting (left) Instead of making it to the Israeli border, they are held by the tribes – including the Sawarka - who try to extort huge sums of money from relatives they might have overseas. If no ransom is received, the women are frequently raped while the men are tortured. Both sexes are usually enslaved and may have to work on marijuana plantations in the depths of the desert.They also face the terrible prospect of having their organs harvested. ‘Doctors from Cairo call me and say they have a private case and they need this or that,’ one Bedouin chief told CNN journalist Fred Pleitgen. ‘It’s like spare parts for a car. The doctors come with some sort of mobile fridge where the organs can be stored for six to eight hours and resold in Cairo or elsewhere. ‘They deal directly with the Sawarka tribe and they buy the organs for anything from 1,000 to 20,000 dollars’ The documentary crew was shown photographs of dead bodies laced with the scars from surgery by Hamdy Al Azazy, the head of the New Generation for Human Rights. ‘A few years ago I heard from one of the Bedouins about spare parts,’ he said. Photographic evidence: The documentary reveals shocking photographs of refugees sold to the Bedouins by smugglers . ‘But I couldn’t accept at that time, whether it is true or not. It is not logical for me because the spare body parts need high technology and special clinics. ‘But I didn’t know the technology has become very easy now because of mobile clinics.’ A forensic doctor who later examined the pictures said that the nature of the scars suggested the bodies were operated on while still alive. He had no doubt that the organs were taken while the person was still alive. Pleitgen said that the extent of the trade that the team had uncovered was staggering. ‘We’d actually gone to Sinai to do a completely different report,’ he said. ‘And then we were told that organ trafficking was going on. The trade is run by the tribes and the doctors are based in Cairo.’ The team attended a burial carried out by human rights workers while they were in Egypt. The bodies had simply been dumped with no clue to their identity. ‘The two guys were completely unknown,’ he said. ‘The cemetery was bleak, next to a garbage dump. Dogs have dug bodies up in the past.’ The documentary is part of the network’s Freedom Project, which was launched in March. It is part of a global news initiative to expose and raise awareness of sex trafficking and slavery around the world. Death In The Desert is one of more than 200 stories of human trafficking found by CNN, which spans five continents. The documentary will be broadcast on November 19, 20 and 21st.

Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney has been branded 'dishonest and deceitful' for turning President Barack Obama's own words against him in the first television ad of his 2012 White House bid. The Republican candidate's commercial is set to start airing in New Hampshire later today, hours before the president visits the state. It compares Obama's 2008 promises as a candidate - to turn around the economy, stem foreclosures and rescue the middle-class - with economic statistics that suggest the incumbent president has come up short. Scroll down for video . 'Dishonest and deceitful': Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has been criticised for turning Barack Obama's own words against him in the first television ad of his 2012 White House bid . Romney then pledges a new direction, turning to his biography as a successful businessman. 'I'm going to do something to government,' he says in the ad, using footage taken during a recent stop in Dubuque, Iowa. He then promises to repeal Democrats' health care overhaul that he says is 'killing jobs'. 'It's high time to bring those principles of fiscal responsibility to Washington, D.C.' The 60-second ad features clips of an Obama campaign stop in Londonderry, New Hampshire, in October 2008 and fresh footage from Romney events from recent days. But the Obama re-election team is unhappy with what they describe as a 'deceitful' ad. Campaign spokesman Ben Labolt told the Huffington Post: 'While the president brought us back from the brink of another . depression and is fighting everyday to restore economic security for the . middle class, Mitt Romney opposes the president's plan to create two . million jobs and instead proposes a return to the same economic policies . that led to the recession.' The commercial is slated to run until the end of this coming Thanksgiving weekend at a cost of $134,000 (£85,000). Barack Obama on the campaign trail in 2008. A spokesman for his 2012 re-election campaign today defended the president's economic track record . On the up: Romney speaks on the steps of City Hall in Nashua, New Hampshire, on Sunday after receiving the endorsement of Senator Kelly Ayotte (left) Romney told Fox News last night: 'The . contrast between what he said and what he did is so stark, people will . recognise we really do need to have someone new lead this country.' Romney, . who is at the top of state polls and is sitting on a mound of campaign . cash, has kept his focus on Obama over the past year and largely has . shied from criticising his GOP rivals. He said: 'I want people to remember . that when he was candidate Obama, that he said he was going to get this . economy going, he was going to bring people together, be a real leader . for change in America,"" Romney said. Obama is set to arrive in New . Hampshire today to deliver an economic speech. For months, Romney has . given interviews to local reporters in states Obama had on his schedule, . either pre-empting the president's message or rebutting it. Romney . hopes to later today use one-time rival Tim Pawlenty and Senator Kelly . Ayotte of New Hampshire to make the case for Romney as a superior . choice. Both have backed Romney's presidential bid. Yet Romney elected to use his first paid television ad not to promote himself or criticise his rivals but to take on the man he hopes to face in November 2012. He said: 'Clearly, the president can't run on his track record. His track record is miserable. 'So what he'll do is try and assassinate, on a character basis, his opponents and/or his opposition. I'm hoping that's me, but I'm not looking forward to those attacks.' Even in a softer interview with People magazine, Romney kept his criticism on point. Asked by the celebrity magazine to say something nice about his potential rival, Romney praised Obama's merit pay for teachers and said Obama was 'a good example of a husband and father'. Then he went back to his familiar refrain. 'But the plusses are far exceeded by the places where I'd give him a minus,' Romney said. The interview included some non-political questions about his Mormon faith. 'Never had drinks or tobacco,' Romney told the magazine when asked if he's ever had a beer. 'It's a religious thing. I tasted a beer and tried a cigarette once, as a wayward teenager, and never did it again.' Sarah Palin: Really a grandmother? Reports of dirty tricks reached unprecedented levels during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin faced rumours suggesting she was really the grandmother of her youngest son. Internet sites were buzzing with unproven claims that Mrs Palin's daughter Bristol, then 17, was the real mother of her four-month-old son Trig. Elsewhere, complaints surfaced in predominantly African-American neighbourhoods of Philadelphia where fliers circulated warning voters they could be arrested at the polls if they had unpaid parking tickets or a criminal conviction. In Virginia, bogus fliers with an authentic-looking seal said fears of high voter turnout had prompted election officials to hold two elections - one on Tuesday for Republicans, the correct day, and another on Wednesday for Democrats, which would have been a day late. In Nevada, Latino voters said they had received calls from people describing themselves as Obama volunteers, urging them to cast their ballot over the phone. In Pennsylvania, emails appeared linking Democrat Barack Obama to the Holocaust. 'Jewish Americans cannot afford to make the wrong decision on Tuesday, Nov. 4,' said the electronic message, paid for by an entity calling itself the Republican Federal Committee. 'Many of our ancestors ignored the warning signs in the 1930s and 1940s and made a tragic mistake.' Laughlin McDonald, who then led the American Civil Liberties Union's Voting Rights Project, said he has never seen 'an election where there was more interest and more voter turnout, and more efforts to suppress registration and turnout. And that has a real impact on minorities.' Watch the Romney campaign's first TV ad here: .","Commercial airs in New Hampshire on same day president visits the state .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:24 PM on 22nd November 2011 . An unholy row has erupted after the Church of England was accused of 'ruthlessly' putting 'profit before communities' by snapping up green belt land which had already been earmarked for development. The church purchased 180 hectares of green belt land around the area of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, in August, and could rake in a whopping £116m if housing and business developments go ahead. The Church Commissioners confirmed they had bought the land - known as Windsor Park - from UK Coal along with four other sites for a combined total of £12.5m. Not happy: Rod Lilley is leading a protest group against housing and business developments on land owned by the Church of England . A property expert said the agricultural value of the land would have been around £2m. But the church could now net a windfall as the 86 acres put forward as a possible business site are worth around £100,000 per acre. The remaining 358 acres could be worth £300,000 per acre if used for residential purposes. Simon Reevell, MP for Dewsbury, urged the church to 'practice what it preaches'. He said: 'They want to ""maximise the income from their investment portfolio"". They say that they have to do this because it is their ""legal duty"". Protesting: Action group leader Rod Lilley has accused the church of seeking to profit at the expense of locals . 'That would be the same ""legal duty"" that obliges FT100 companies to maximise profits for their shareholders but whose behaviour prompted the Archbishop of York to warn that such behaviour can ""weaken community life"". 'Our Church leaders are perfectly entitled to argue that the worst excesses of capitalism should be curbed. 'Pursuing profit before anything else takes us back to the worst excess of a by-gone age and senior members of the clergy may well want to speak out against it. 'But shouldn't they start a little closer to home? As far as the land at Chidswell is concerned, the Church Commissioners that I have referred to are in a remarkably strong position should they wish to practice what they preach. 'I suspect my constituents in Chidswell will struggle to reconcile an attitude of profit before communities with the Archbishop of York's invitation to strive for a ""change of ethics to the accumulation of wealth"".' Rod Lilley, 51, is spearheading the Chidswell Action Group, who oppose the plans - which will be implemented if a Local Development Framework put forward by council officers is accepted by members. Now, he has accused the church of seeking to profit at the expense of locals and has revealed he is so 'disillusioned' that he has turned his back on the church he loves. Mr Lilley, managing director of a haulage company, said: 'I've been going to church for years but not now. 'It's a sad moment for me. But I have to stand up for what I believe in. 'Here I am year in, year out looking for money for Christian Aid, but by buying the land they are getting rid of farmers who produce barley, corn and other products, and turning it into a concrete city. 'This is the last bit of green belt land to separate Leeds, Kirklees and Dewsbury. 'They are just making money for themselves. Why should I dig deep to help the third world when the church is just profiting for itself? Similar: Vicar Amanda Barraclough said the situations in Dewsbury and outside St Paul's Cathedral resonate because society is asking questions about how we measure success . 'What the church really should be doing is giving money to run-down churches instead of sending us out begging for money. 'I've cancelled my direct debit to the church and have no plans to return. 'We have to stop the plan before it gets the go-ahead. If the council gets what it wants, the land will be brown belt and they can develop on it.' Even Amanda Barraclough, the vicar of St Mary's Church in Woodkirk, attended a protest meeting along with over 600 other locals, insisting that there is a difference between local parishes and the church 'head office'. Reverend Barraclough, 50, said: 'I have strong sympathies with where the action group are coming from. 'I hope people can see the difference between local church communities and the ""head office"" which is rather detached from life on the ground. 'The situations in Dewsbury and outside St Paul's Cathedral resonate because our society is clearly asking big questions about how we measure success - is it an accumulation of wealth and status?' A spokesman for the Church Commissioners said: 'It is for the democratically-elected local planning authority to assess the best balance for its area of employment, housing, and other amenities. 'We have been liaising with various representatives of the local community since buying this land in August. Should those responsible decide to allocate the land in the long-term for use as a business park and for housing, we would support that.' The local authority's plans, to go before the council tomorrow, state that they need 25,400 homes in Kirklees by 2028 including the Chidswell site. Jacqui Gedman, Kirklees Council's acting director of place, said: 'The use of green belt land is, as we would expect, a contentious issue. 'But, surprisingly, many people are unaware that 70 per cent of land in Kirklees falls within the green belt. 'This means that virtually all homes, offices, factories, shops, schools and parks are concentrated in the remaining 30 per cent. 'This proposal requires no more than one per cent of the green belt to be released for potential future development.' John Denham, from Campaign for Rural England West Yorkshire said: 'We were very shocked by these proposals. 'We think there is sufficient brown belt land in the area so the council should not have to build on green belt land. 'We will continue the fight against this development. Green belt land is precious.'","Church could rake in £116m if plans go ahead .

Police investigating a murderous rampage by a jilted lover who shot her former boyfriend and five other people sensationally revealed chilling details last night of the 911 call made by his wife. Jennifer Lamb, whose husband Randall Lamb, 40, was blasted in the shoulder by Mary Ann Holder after he ended their tryst, admitted to emergency operators that her spouse had been having an affair. Mrs Lamb, who had reportedly filed a . restraining order against her love rival in February after alleging that Holder would . call, text and send nude photos of herself to Mr Lamb, told operators: 'I . don't know exactly what happened, but my husband has been shot. 'He’s on . his way... He's getting ready to - umm... he just called me and said he . was on the highway and that he had been shot. 'He was at - I don’t know . for sure... I think he was at his work. 'And this woman who he had had an . affair with... she was there when he got there and she shot him.' Holder went on to shoot her sons Robert Dylan Smith 17, and Zachary . Smith, 14, in the head, instantly killing the eldest, before firing at Robert's girlfriend, Makayla Woods, 15, and killing her niece, Hannaleigh Suttles, eight. She also injured her her 17-year-old nephew, Richard Suttles during the rampage on Sunday. And in a final twist to her murder spree, the 36-year-old turned the gun on herself and committed suicide. ‘We’ve . got death. We’ve got drama. We’ve got a situation basically no one . could ever imagine,’ Guilford County Sheriff BJ Barnes said yesterday. He added that it was 'one of the worst . situations I've seen in my 30 years in law enforcement'. The . gunwoman left behind two notes taking responsibility for the shootings. Mr Barnes said she apologised for the pain she caused but also that she felt 'wronged'. The . tragedy unfolded shortly before 9am on Sunday when Holder met her . one-time boyfriend Randall Lamb in the parking lot of the Guilford . Technical Community College Aviation Centre in Greensboro, North Carolina. They spoke briefly before Holder shot at him multiple times, before a bullet struck him in the shoulder, investigators said. He is in stable condition. Authorities said Mary Ann Holder shot both of her sons - 17-year-old Robert Smith, left, and 14-year-old Zachary Smith, right - in the head. Robert was killed, while Zachary is clinging to life . A parent and students console each other over during a prayer meeting to remember the victims of Mary Ann Holder's shooting spree in Guilford County, North Carolina . Mr Lamb phoned his wife from the car after the violent confrontation - and she then called 911, saying her husband had been shot, prompting deputies to begin a search for Holder. They went to Holder's one-level brick residence on nearby Cocoa Drive in Pleasant Garden around 9:30am. Officers were stationed outside her home, but a deputy spotted her car driving down the street about an hour later. The deputy said he saw a 'puff of . smoke' in the car and found Holder dead and her son Zachary  shot in the head. He remains in critical condition. Deputies recovered two handguns inside the vehicle, one in Holder's lap, the sheriff said. The officers then went into Holder’s home and discovered her son Robert dead. Inside they found Robert’s . injured girlfriend, Makayla Woods, along with Holder’s niece, Hannaleigh Suttles, eight, and her 17-year-old nephew, . Richard Suttles. Holder reportedly had custody of her nephew and niece after their mother died. Hannaleigh died on Monday of her injuries. The other two remain in critical condition. Youngest victim: Hannaleigh Suttles, 8, who was shot and killed by Mary Ann Holder, had gone to live with her aunt after her mother's death . Neighbour Joe Scott told WRAL.com: 'It's beyond my imagination that a mother would - good children such as they were - that she would do any harm to precious children.' Mr Scott's wife Teresa said: Holder's decision to take in her dead sister's children appeared to add to the pressures of what appeared to be a life in turmoil. 'Why would you take them children, keep them children, when your life's rocky, up and down?' Mrs Scott said Holder began renting the home across the street about four years ago. Holder's children were kind towards the elderly couple across the road, Mrs Scott added. They volunteered to help with yard maintenance and enquired about the health of her husband Joe, who has had recent health problems. In the past, Lamb also appeared to like Holder's children, Mrs Scott said. 'They'd pack up things and go places together,' she said. But it was also clear the affair between Holder and Lamb had soured, according to Mrs Scott. Robert Smith posted no-trespassing signs on trees in the front yard this year in response to the rising level of tension between Holder and Lamb, Scott said. Mr Lamb’s wife also filed an . alienation of affection claim, which in North Carolina allows someone . who is cheated on to sue the person their spouse had an affair with. Investigators were trying to unravel the violent chain of events and understand why Holder took out her rage on the children. Holder left notes taking responsibility for the shootings and apologizing for the pain she was causing, Sheriff Barnes said. The notes also indicate Holder was angry about how her relationship with Lamb came to an end. The deadly shooting spree, in which two were left dead and four injured, started in the car park of the Guilford Technical Community College .

The result is the same. We may never know exactly what her thoughts were and why' Authorities yesterday said they were still . trying to determine when the victims in Holder’s home were shot and . whether it happened before or after she met with Lamb.

"By . Beth Stebner . Last updated at 8:56 PM on 23rd November 2011 . Telemarketers have found an ingenious way around caller ID, and are using fake identities to get those on the other line to pick up. The service, which people can use to screen unwanted calls, is backfiring as ‘caller ID spoofing’ is becoming spreads throughout the country. Telemarketers route a call through the Internet and back to public telephone networks, erasing the call's origin. Likewise, they use software and other inexpensive services to make fake names pop up on caller IDs. Stop calling: Caller ID spoofing tricks people into picking up their phones by using local numbers and even businesses . Government officials have banned . telemarketers from hiding their identity, but now the Federal . Communications Commission may look into new rules to keep up with . technology. Sandy Chalmers, a division manager for the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection in Wisconsin issued a warning to those reaching to answer the phone. ‘Do not trust your caller ID,’ she told The New York Times. ‘And if you pick up the phone and someone asks for your personal information, hang up.’ One debt collection agency showed up on a Chicago woman’s caller ID as a string of zeros, a nameless local number, and even ‘Humane Soc.’ ‘They want you to pick up that phone . because you think it’s somebody else or an important call that you’re . expecting,’ 46-year-old Chicago homemaker Julia Schultz told the Times. She was called no less than 30 times a week by the agency, cloaked as other organisations. Don't pick up: Even recognised numbers could be from telemarketers . Robo-bothered: Robocalling can blast thousands of customers a minute with prerecorded messages . So how exactly do telemarketers spoof unknowing people into taking their calls? Officials say technology makes it easier than ever to mask a call’s origin by routing a call through the Internet and then back through public telephone networks. The Mobile Information Act of 2011, sponsored by U.S. Rep Lee Terry, would effectively revoke a 1991 consumer protection act that prohibits telemarketer calls to cell phones. It would allow companies to robocall any of the 83 per cent of Americans who now use cell phones. New York Senator Chuck Schumer said he’d do everything in his power to block the proposed bill in the senate. Companies argue the bill would allow businesses to call customers for ‘informational purposes.’ It would also revoke the FCC’s National Do-Not-Call List. While many companies use that method to legitimately identify themselves, the technology makes it ripe for telemarketers to create aliases. Robocalls – where an automated computer allows a telemarketer place thousands of pre-recorded calls a second – has also been on the rise. The Federal Trade Commission reported they received 140,000 complaints of robocalls in September, up from 61,000 the previous year. And the technology just keeps getting more sophisticated. Sometimes, a number will pop up from a legitimate local business, but when the consumer picks up, a telemarketer goes off with a sales pitch. Consumers have also complained of automated recordings offering to put them on a ‘do not call’ list – but only if they enter their phone number first. Privacy, please: Sen Chuck Schumer (right) is against the Mobile Information Call Act, which would allow bill collectors and telemarketers to call cell phones . Marguerite Sweeney, who is the head of telephone privacy for the Indiana attorney general, said a scheme like that was probably meant to collect numbers for future telemarketing calls. Proposed legislation could bring robocalls and spoofing to more and more cell phones, consumer advocates worry, though for now, the problem mostly exists with landlines. ‘Do not trust your caller ID. And if you pick up the phone and someone asks for your personal information, hang up.’ -Wisconsin Department of Consumer Protection manager Sandy Chalmers . New legislation would open the floodgates to mobile phone robocalls, New York Senator Chuck Schumer warned Sunday. He said that the Mobile Information Call Act would allow bill collectors and telemarketers to ‘call you on your cell phone during breakfast, lunch, dinner, no matter if you’re at home, at school, at the office.’ Currently, there are laws banning telemarketers from calling cell phones unless the customer gave prior consent.","Telemarketers' calls can be wired through the Internet and patched back to public telephone networks .

The best friend of The Only Way Is Essex sisters Sam and Billie Faiers is suffering from skin cancer after using sun beds three times a week. Jerri Turko started using sunbeds when she was 15 and would even increase their potency by applying tan booster creams. The 21-year-old hairdresser, who was diagnosed with melanoma in June, has had the cancerous mole from her leg removed, but the disease had already spread to her lymph nodes. Jerri now faces another operation . next month to remove the infected lymph nodes in her groin before having to take a . course of anti-cancer drugs. In an interview with Closer magazine, Jerri said: ‘Tanning is a way of life for girls in Essex – but now I feel so stupid for risking my life. ‘When doctors told me I had cancer, I burst into tears – what a price to pay for vanity.’ She was diagnosed this summer after returning from a holiday with the Faiers sisters in Marbella. Jerri became friends with Billie and Sam, who are now stars of TOWIE, when she was 14. She reveals how she was desperate to tan using sunbeds, despite also going on four holidays a year to sun-drenched locations. Jerri says that at the age of 15 she would pretend to be 16 to gain access to sunbeds in salons and was soon going twice a week for 10-minute sessions. By the time she was 18, she was going to the salon three times a week for 14-minute sessions and admits she was addicted. Essex pals: Jerri is best friends with The Only Way Is Essex reality TV stars Billie (left) and Sam Faiers (right) She tells the magazine: 'Being brown made me feel slimmer. I’d . go to parties after a sunbed session and I’d still be red and tingling, . but I didn’t care.' But when Jerri was 19, in 2009, she noticed that a freckle on her leg had grown substantially and decided to consult her GP. The doctor told her she was too young to get cancer and reassured her not to worry. Two years later the growth had become bigger and darker in colour and transformed into a mole, causing her family to become concerned. But Jerri procrastinated in getting it removed because she ‘didn’t want a scar’. Tanning in Marbella: Jerri (third from right) on holiday with the TOWIE cast including Amy Childs (fourth from right) and Sam Faiers (left) Read the full interview in this week's Closer magazine, out now . She continued using sunbeds regularly . and went to Marbella this May with the cast of TOWIE to top up her tan . further, despite the mole becoming agitated and itchy. After celebrating her 21st birthday in June, her family convinced her to go back to the GP, which was when she was diagnosed with cancer. Surgeons cut out the mole in September and administered a skin graft to cover the 4cm scar, but the cancer had already spread to lymph nodes in her groin. She can now no longer expose her skin to the sun and has been told to always wear SPF30 and never use a sunbed again. Jerri revealed that both Sam and Billie have stopped using sunbeds too since her diagnosis.

The father of Britain's youngest . rioter took the 12-year-old out to steal fruit machines two months after . the child was arrested for looting, a court heard. The boy, who was just 11 when he . stole a £50 bin in the riots, was helping his heroin addict father get . money for a fix to stop him being violent, the court heard. He had been spared jail for stealing the bin but six days later on September 6 he stole a bottle of Coke from a supermarket. Burglary: The boy and his father stole three fruit machines containing £2,500 from the pub (pictured) in Romford . And Redbridge Youth Court heard yesterday that after being released on bail for that offence the boy was caught on CCTV stealing three fruit machines containing £2,500 from a pub in Romford on November 16, accompanied by his father. Prosecutor Alex Mattic said the images show the boy handing rocks to his father, who uses them to smash the windows of Yates' Wine Lodge in South Street, Romford. 'CCTV shows him handing rocks to his father who throws them through the windows,' he told the court. 'The burglary takes place. They are seen wheeling out fruit machines, which are then taken away on a van.' The boy, who pleaded guilty to the burglary on November 19, was arrested at home and taken into secure custody for the first time. 'His father is a heroin addict and . continuing to use heroin. His father gets violent towards him. For him, . the best way to help his father is to get him some money to get a fix' He had been given an 18-month youth rehabilitation order after taking part in the riots, and was already under a previous 'referral order' for offences of arson, criminal damage and carrying a pointed instrument. Vicky Thompson, defending, said the boy had had a 'wake-up call' after being taken into custody.  The court heard he idolises his dad, who is on remand. 'He is by no means perfect but there is a lot going on in his life. It was his father who took the 12-year-old out to commit this burglary. 'His father is a heroin addict and continuing to use heroin. His father gets violent towards him. For him, the best way to help his father is to get him some money to get a fix. 'He idolises his father for all the wrong reasons. All of his offences have happened during a time when he is in contact with his dad. 'The burglary was when he was on his way home from his father's house. The arson was also when he was on his way back from his father's house. 'He can't deal with the emotions of this difficult relationship.  'His father is a man who has been in and out of trouble for a number of years but hasn't had any real custodial sentence. In [the boy's] mind, he hasn't had any real appreciation of what the impact of the court can be. 'He has had a real wake-up call these last couple of days.' The court heard the boys mother has been trying to get a High Court order to prevent his father from contacting him. The case was adjourned until December 7 for pre-sentence reports to be prepared. His bail conditions ban him from seeing his father. Addressing the 12-year-old, chair of the bench John Dring said: 'You've been in a place you don't like. You know what to do. 'At 12 years old you shouldn't be hard. The bench can see you're not a hard boy and it says that's good. Look at your family behind you.' The boy said: 'I'm really sorry for what I've done. I know I'm making my family really upset.' Granting him bail, Mr Dring added: ""If you commit another offence you will go straight into secure accommodation. Your future depends on this, the love between you and your mother depends on this. You have a lot to do.'","Three fruit machines stolen, containing £2,500 .

Toes in Salzburg are tapping to a new beat as the city finally plays host to a show of the Hollywood blockbuster that put it on the map nearly 50 years ago. The Sound of Music has made its debut at the Salzburg State Theatre, more used to hosting opera and operettas. The musical has already had a surprisingly positive reaction in Salzburg, commonly seen as a last bulwark of resistance to the iconic show. No problem for Maria: Wietske van Tongeren, pictured in dress rehearsal for the show, has become the first actress to play Maria on stage in Salzburg itself . Captain Georg von Trapp is played by Uwe Kroeger, pictured here in the scene when he introduces Maria to his children . The musical, based on a true story, was immortalised in the award-winning 1965 film starring Julie Andrews as the governess of seven children who charms - then weds - their widowed father Baron von Trapp, before the family flee the Nazis. The city's culture is a far cry from Hollywood meaning that most locals are likely to prefer the sounds of native composers Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms than they are to be familiar with the musical's song lyrics. While residents earn millions each year from the tourists who come for sing-a-long tours of sites featured in the film, they are known for viewing the visitors with disdain. Campaigners of the neighbourhood where the von Trapp home is located tried - and failed - to block attempts to turn it into a hotel, fearing fans would cause havoc. Our favourite things: The citizens of Salzburg have finally relented to having the Sound of Music performed on stage in the city . The staging of the Sound of Music is a rare break from the opera more commonly performed in the Austrian city . A home is still being sought for a museum dedicated to the film after more than 600 residents in another neighborhood objected three years ago. They told the city council they feared that surrounding streets would be jammed with tour buses. Peter Proetzner, who guides daily coaches of tourists on pilgrimages to the sites made famous in the film, cited a poll showing the Sound of Music as the city's second biggest draw - right after the dozens of classical music events held in the city every night. 'The Sound of Music is better known than Mozart worldwide,' he insisted. Debut: The much-loved musical is being shown in Salzburg (pictured) for the first time . The story ends with the Von Trapp family fleeing from the Nazis as the Second world War looms . Tourist Dianne Cole, from Australia, admits she knows 'absolutely nothing' about Austria and will probably return home still ignorant of the country's cultural and scenic delights. 'But this is why I came to Austria,' she told the Boston Globe, 'The sole reason is to do this tour'. Austria has worked hard to shed perceived associations with the Nazis. Millions of euros have reportedly been donated to Holocaust victims and their descendants, and schoolbooks now deal in depth with the nation's complicity in the crimes of Adolf Hitler, born just 30 miles north of Salzburg. Andreas Gergen, who directed the German-language production said: 'I think that this is truly the right moment in time, when Austrians are actually ready to deal with their past.'

Fugitive: Businessman Andrew Paterson was on the run from British justice for 25 years before police caught up with him - at his funeral . A fugitive millionaire on the run from British justice for 25 years was finally caught - because his dying wish was to be buried back home. Solicitor Andrew Paterson created an amazing double life which was only discovered when his body was flown back to a tiny village in Wales. Paterson, 58, fled abroad after being accused of fraud in 1987 and became a wealthy property developer under the fake identity of Mark Attwood. But his last request was to be buried under the green, green grass of home in the Welsh village where he grew up. Police were tipped off at the last minute that the funeral was for their man. They allowed the service to go ahead but halted the burial so they could fingerprint the body. Funeral director Stewart Treharne said: 'I've never come across a situation like this. It was an incredible end to a very dramatic life. 'Whatever his history, he was a man who was loved as a husband, father and respected colleague.' Paterson was working as a solicitor in Guildford, Surrey, when he fled the country after police issued a warrant for his arrest on charges relating to a £17,200 imported car scam. He adopted a new identity as Mark Attwood, 51, and travelled the world, setting up a series of successful luxury holiday resorts and marrying three times. He died in the beach resort of Goa in India from a sudden heart attack. His third wife carried out his last wish, that his body be laid to rest in . the graveyard of St Mary's Church in his childhood village of Begelly, Pembrokeshire, west Wales. Family . and colleagues had travelled from far and wide to pay their last respects when police were tipped off that the funeral was for their wanted man. Final resting place: Mr Paterson's grave, right, at St Marys Church in Begelly, Pembrokeshire, South Wales . They allowed the service to go ahead - . but stopped the actual burial so they could take the body away for . fingerprinting and make sure the man in the coffin was Paterson. After . confirmation of their suspicions, the fugitive was finally interred in a . grave marked 'Andrew Paterson also known as Mark Attwood'. 'This . little village must have made quite an impression on him because after . going all around the world he really wanted to come back here' FUNERAL DIRECTOR . Funeral director Mr Treharne said: 'I really feel for his family. 'He . had some wonderful tributes paid to him at the funeral, and was . evidently held in high esteem with people travelling from all over the . world to attend. 'Because of the inquiries being made by police, it was not possible to bury his body immediately. 'But we ensured his dignity has been respected by caring for him in our chapel of rest. 'This . little village must have made quite an impression on him because after . going all around the world he really wanted to come back here. 'Other . members of his family were buried here and it clearly held a place in . his heart. He must have wanted to get back to his roots, to the place . were he grew up.' One of businessman Andrew Paterson's holiday developments. The company ran a collection of luxury villa resorts, located in Bali, Thailand, Indonesia and Greece . Paterson, as . exile Attwood, co-founded the Karma Royal group, which . expanded to become Asia-Pacific's largest timeshare resort development. The company run a collection of luxury villa resorts in Bali, Thailand, . Indonesia and Greece. His personal life was dramatic as well - he married three different woman and fathered six children. He . eventually made a home in the beach paradise of Goa and was living with . latest wife Chatchanok when he died suddenly from a heart attack.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:46 PM on 21st November 2011 . A boy with a rare cardiac condition has been banned from laughing in case his chuckles trigger a fatal heart attack. Bradley Burhouse has a dangerously high heart rate and is on doctors' orders to keep calm to ensure his ticker doesn't beat any faster. The brave seven-year-old has stopped exercising and his mother has been told to make sure he doesn't laugh too hard in case his heart develops a severely abnormal heart rhythm, which can cause sudden death. Bradley, pictured with his mother Toni, is not allowed to play outdoors or get over-excited whle he waits for treatment for a rare cardiac condtion . He's not even allowed to play outside with his brothers Jack, 14, and Dalton, 12, and sister Maddison, 6. Bradley was diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia after he collapsed earlier this year. The rare condition in children means his resting heart rate is 120 to 200 beats per minute - at least twice as fast as the average person. Ventricular tachycardia is caused by faulty electrical signals in the lower heart chambers known as ventricles. These override the heart's normal rate and rhythm causing the ventricles to contract faster than normal. This causes the heart to pump out blood more quickly and the . ventricles may not have enough time to fill up properly with blood. It can cause chest pain, dizziness and fainting fits. It can be corrected by a course of tablets or an operation but has also proved to be fatal in some child cases. If the condition worsens the heart can go into ventricular fibrillation, where the brain and muscles stop receiving blood from the heart. Bradley, from Huddersfield, West Yorks, will have a preliminary examination in the next few weeks before doctors decide what action to take. Bradley has gone up two ages in clothes sizes due to forced inactivity . Mother Toni Burhouse, 34, said Bradley collapsed and was rushed to hospital in May this year after playing and joking around with his brother. She said: 'Now we have to be so careful that he doesn't get over excited. Even if he's laughing too hard we have to calm him down and make sure he doesn't get too worked up. 'I remember that he used to run up to me and say 'Mum my heart feels like it's going to jump out of my chest'. 'I'd always dismiss it and tell him it was only natural because he'd been running around. 'Then one day he was playing with his brother Dalton out in the field next to the house when he fell down. 'Dalton thought he had fallen and smacked his head so he helped him up and they came into the kitchen together. 'By this time Bradley was screaming in pain and then he was violently sick. My husband Simon rushed him to A&E and initially they thought he had a heart murmur. 'It was only when he had further checks that they discovered he had ventricular tachycardia.' HEART: Usually electrical signals start in the sinus node and travel through the heart making it contract. The signals travel from the atria (upper chambers) to the ventricles (lower chambers) through the atrioventricular node. Ventricular tachycardia occurs when the electrical signals in the ventricles become disorganised and override this process . Bradley is now on doctors orders to stay in on the PlayStation instead of running around outside. Mrs Burhouse said: 'At the moment he can't do any physical exercise. He has had to sit out on PE lessons and he can't play with his brothers. 'He's been bouncing off the walls, you don't realise how difficult it is to keep a seven year old quiet and calm. 'We've had to buy him a PS3 to try and keep him occupied but it's not ideal. 'Bradley has gone up at least two ages in clothes size since the diagnosis and we are a bit worried about how big he is getting.' The mother-of-four said their months of worry could soon be coming to an end as they wait for doctors to tell them what course of action to take. Medicines like beta-blockers are often prescribed. If these don't work, a . device can be implanted under the skin near the collarbone that monitors the . heartbeat and produces electrical signals to correct any ventricular . tachycardia episodes. Mrs Burhouse said: 'We have been put on a 10-week waiting list but we are hopeful that he will have an operation in the next few weeks. 'We will be so relieved when it is over. The consequences of what could have happened if we hadn't discovered the problem aren't worth thinking about. He could have just dropped dead. 'Even the nurses told me not to research too much about it because they knew it would upset me.' The condition is unusual in children and usually occurs in older patients who have experienced a heart attack. Mrs Burhouse said: 'This problem has just come out of the blue. 'When doctors have taken his pulse recently they've all commented on his heart rate. 'But he's had his pulse taken before and it's always been normal. I'm just glad we realised something was wrong when we did.'",Bradley's resting heart rate could reach three times that of an average person .
"By . Laura Schreffler . Last updated at 7:08 AM on 23rd November 2011 . His chances of surviving another another elimination after last week's emotional meltdown were initially slim - but Astro may have learned how to beat the system. Upon learning that there would be not one but two eliminations this week, the 15-year-old rapper kicked off his high-powered performance with an apology on tonight's X Factor. The pint-sized prodigy threw a wobbly when he landed in the bottom two alongside fan favourite Stacy Francis last week - and hasn't been shy about complaining the competition is 'rigged'. Scroll down for video... Redemption song: Astro apologises twice for the temper tantrum he threw on last week's show . Will he survive? The 15-year-old rapper performed his own song tonight on X-Factor . But to survive his massive temper tantrum, Astro nee Brian Bradley, knew he'd have to eat some humble pie tonight. Given . that each contestant was meant to dedicate tonight's song to someone . who has influenced or made a difference in their lives, Astro's move was . completely strategic. He thanked the supporters who stuck with him in the aftermath of last week's drama before shouting an apology from the darkness. Taking . to the stage, Astro opened his performance, rapping: 'No tantrums this . week. I'm 15... 15 is the new 25. What you want me to do? I'm sorry, I'm . from Brooklyn.' Back on track: Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell praise Astro for apologising and getting his focus back . Proud: Nicole and Astro's mentor LA Reid were equally positive in their commentary, with Reid telling the teen he had humbled himself this week . He then launched into a furious rap of Tonight's The Night, an original song in the style of Jay-Z's 30 Something. He apologised again for real after his high-energy performance, earning kudos from the judges for doing the right thing. 'Last week I had a moment. It got over my head a little bit. I could have handled myself better,' he said, adding to his fans: 'I will never let you down again.' Nicole Scherzinger, 33, told him he was a champion and advised him to always remain grateful. Paula Abdul, 49, has previously spoken out about his bad behaviour, calling his rant a 'character mistake'. Tonight she graciously stated that he is well on his way to being 'prolific'. Last group standing: Lakoda Rayne sang sweetly to Taylor Swift's You Belong With Me . His own mentor, 55-year-old L.A. Reid, complimented him for doing the right thing, the necessary thing, to last another week. Shockingly, he even had some unexpected support in notoriously cantankerous judge Simon Cowell, 52. Simon told the young rapper that, not only did he admire his gumption, but that the music industry needs someone to shake it up and some 'unpredictability'. So how did the others fare? Paula Abdul's final group, Lakoda Rayne, did surprisingly well given that they typically wind up in the bottom two. Mini superstar: 13-year-old Rachel Crow dedicated Yolanda Adams' I Believe to her foster parents . The ladies - Paige Elizabeth, 18, . Hayley Orrantia, 17, Cari Fletcher, 17, and Dani Knights, 22 - honoured . two dads, a boyfriend and a grandmother, respectively. They performed Taylor Swift's You Belong With Me to high praise from all judges. Paula, of course, couldn't resist gushing how proud she was of their collective achievements. Perhaps Cowell was in a cheerful mood, or has gotten into the Thanksgiving spirit, because he, too, touted the group. Simon said it was their best performance to date and he genuinely hopes that Lakoda Rayne doesn't go home tomorrow night. Young Rachel Crow dedicated her performance of Yolanda Adams' I Believe to the foster family who adopted her at a young age and saved her from living in a crack house. A song for his mama: Marcus Canty sings Boyz II Men's A Song For Mama right to his own mother . A touching moment: Marcus and his mother hug it out after his performance . All four judges agreed that the . 13-year-old spitfire's performance was fabulous, but she drew raves in . particular from both Paula and Nicole. The . former Pussycat Doll said that Crow made 'a believer' out of everyone . in America, calling her an 'inspiration' and a 'bright light.' Paula, of course, topped this, saying that the Shirley Temple-esque singer is 'a living angel on Earth.' Maryland native Marcus Canty dedicated Boyz II Men's A Song For Mama to his mother, naturally. He played the crowd by crouching down mid-performance to sing directly to his mother and hugging her at its end. A joyful performance: Melanie Amaro breaks down after singing R. Kelly's The World's Greatest . Touched: Judge Nicole Scherzinger got emotional during Amaro's performance . Again, all the judges were in agreement that he was wonderful. His own mentor, Reid, gave him particularly high praise by saying he was as great a singer as he's ever worked with. Melanie Amaro gave thanks like she was winning an Oscar, dedicating her performance of R. Kelly's The World's Greatest to God. She breaks down in tears at the end of the song and thanks her mentor, Simon, for keeping her in the competition. The new Eminem: Chris Rene rapped a version of The Beatles Let It Be . Although her sobs cause Nicole to cry, Paula offers some unusual criticism by saying the typically quiet and reserved 19-year-old's choice of a backing choir wasn't necessary. Simon furiously tells Paula to shut up before urging the crowd to make sure Melanie isn't sent packing tomorrow night. Chris Rene dedicates his quirky rap performance of The Beatles' Let It Be as well as one of his own tunes to his rehab counsellor, Tim Fry. Angel: LeRoy Bell dedicated Sarah McLachlan's Angel to his mother, who passed away two years ago . The 28-year-old's only criticism was from Simon, who said that he didn't like the way Rene adapted The Beatles, but that he enjoyed the original song. Like Marcus, 60-year-old LeRoy Bell thanked his mother, Janice, who passed away two years ago. After singing Sarah McLachlan's Angel, he drew mostly raves from the judges, though L.A. Reid said it wasn't his very best performance. BFF: Drew dedicated Demi Lovato's Skyscraper to her best friend, Shelby . How did I do: Seen here after the performance with host Steve Jones. Her performance sparked a war of words between Cowell and Reid . Paula thought it was his 'most beautiful' performance yet, while Simon respectfully agreed to disagree with Reid's critique and that Bell 'made his mark' this week. Like a typical teenager, 14-year-old Drew Ryniewicz dedicated Demi Lovato's Skyscraper to her best friend, Shelby, because it's 'their song.' While Nicole and Paula agreed that the song was lovely, L.A. was critical in saying that the song was too old for her. Lullaby: Josh Krajcik sang Chantal Kreviazuk's Wild Horses for his daughter, Rowan . Emotional: Josh's daughter watched on from the audience. He dedicated his performance to her . He finally managed to draw Simon's ire, who turned on the music producer and said he was sick to death of his 'pointless, stupid criticism.' Last but not least was a performance from Josh Krajcik, who dedicated Chantal Kreviazuk's rendition of The Rolling Stones' Wild Horses to his daughter, Rowan, while playing the piano. The 30-year-old finally had his moment on the show, finally causing the judges to agree, play nicely and embody the spirit of Thanksgiving. Feisty: As usual, the judges were candid with the contestants - and each other during the nine contestants' performances . As the entire crowd leaped to their feet in applause, Simon finally gave kudos to Nicole - a big moment given the two have been at odds since the season began. Krajcik may have succeeded in bringing the two together, as, through her tears, Nicole even thanked Simon. She told Josh that, through the competition, his music can change the world. While that remains to be seen, his song certainly did create a minor miracle.","Astro raps he is sorry and follows up with post-performance apology .

"By . Richard Shears . Last updated at 10:05 AM on 23rd November 2011 . The hairdresser daughter of a former British policeman was horrifically murdered on a blind date by a drug-crazed criminal, a court in Australia was told today. Elsa Corp, 26, was found in a hotel room with an electrical cord around her neck, 60 stab wounds to her head and neck, a stab wound in her back, a severed spine, multiple rib fractures, facial fractures and a torso injury that is believed to have been made with a steam iron. After murdering the young blonde, killer David Clifford, 30 - who was on parole at the time - set fire to the hotel room and drove into two people as he fled the scene. Murdered: Elsa Corp, 26, was found in a hotel room after being killed by David Clifford, 30, who was on parole at the time . His first hit-and-run victim as he fled was a woman and the second was a man, who was carried along on the bonnet for 40 yards. 'The murderer was on parole and on bail for other offences,' Miss Corp's father, former UK police officer Mr Andrew Corp, said in a victim impact statement to the Victorian Supreme Court today following Clifford's plea of guilty to murder. 'He should not have been at liberty on the first of February 2010…our daughter should be with us today.' Mr Corp said earlier that his experience as a former British policeman was of no help when tragedy touched his own family. 'I thought I'd be a little better prepared because I'd seen some horrible things myself, but it's something that will live with us always, I'm afraid,' he told Melbourne's Herald Sun. 'The flashbacks and the nightmares and all that sort of stuff is pretty gutting. Our lives have changed - not for the better, sadly.' Crime scene: Miss Corp agreed to meet Clifford on a blind date before being taken to the City Park Hotel in Melbourne . The court was told that Clifford had a history of drug abuse and violent behaviour - facts unknown to Miss Corp, who lived with her parents, after she agreed to meet him on a blind date before being taken to the City Park Hotel in Melbourne. She is believed to have agreed to go to the hotel thinking that other friends were going to be there. A man with a history of speed and ice abuse, Clifford's convictions include resisting police after a home invasion during which he terrified two elderly people last December. He was also arrested, but not charged, over a siege at his own family home which involved up to 30 police in December 2006. Two years later he had to be tied up and restrained by family members after he became delusional and violent, claiming he was being eaten alive by mercury in his computer. He has pleaded guilty to Miss Corp's murder and is awaiting sentencing, but Miss Corp's father said he was waiting for an apology from the authorities after a bureaucratic bungle allowed Clifford to leave prison and be at large to kill the hairdresser. He had been released on parole for drug trafficking and had already breached parole and a suspended sentence following other earlier convictions. He was also awaiting sentence over a violent assault of a bar owner. 'No-one has taken responsibility for Elsa's death,' said Mr Corp, who, with his wife Gilly, expressed his disgust at Clifford's release on parole after just 47 days of a four-month jail sentence. 'It's absolutely gutted us because it was a very bad failure in the system. For the sake of a bit of training, or procedure or supervision, the system fell over and failed us. 'Our daughter would probably be alive today if there hadn't been these stuff-ups.' A secret police report has disclosed that 11 people have been murdered in Victoria in less than two and a half years.","Killer David Clifford was on parole and bail for other offences at the time .

"HIllsborough Independent Panel to contact affected families to explain circumstances . 'I'm sorry this additional distress has been caused,' says panel chairman . Last updated at 2:40 PM on 23rd November 2011 . Tissue samples taken from the bodies of victims of the Hillsborough Disaster were retained without their families' knowledge, it emerged today. The Hillsborough Independent Panel, which is examining documents relating to the 1989 disaster, has confirmed that it has become aware that in 10 of the post-mortem examinations carried out on those who died as a result of the disaster, tissue was taken for further examination and was retained. A spokesman for the panel said: 'Although this was in accordance with established practice at the time and the standard procedures were followed, it has become clear since then that removal and retention of tissue in this way in many post-mortems around the country has caused distress to bereaved relatives.' Inquiry: The Hillsborough Independent panel, headed by Bishop James Jones, has admitted that samples were taken from the bodies of the victims and retained without their families' consent . The taking of tissue samples without telling relatives was legal at the time of the disaster - but it was banned under the Human Tissue Act 2004. The panel is now making contact with those families affected to explain the circumstances and to ask if they would like to know the position concerning their relatives. The spokesman said that if families want to, the panel will discuss with them the options in relation to remaining tissue and assist them to ensure it is 'dealt with respectfully' in accordance with their wishes. The Right Reverend James Jones, Bishop of Liverpool and chairman of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, said: 'I am sorry that this additional distress has been caused to some of the Hillsborough families, who have suffered greatly already. Tragedy: Football fans clamber to safety in the Liverpool enclosure during the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 . Shocking scenes: A policeman gives a Liverpool fan the kiss of life after overcrowding led to the death of 96 supporters during the F.A. Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest . 'I know from my previous experience in Liverpool how much anguish has resulted from this practice. 'The panel believes that it is right that affected families should have the chance to find out about this now.' Dr Bill Kirkup, medically qualified member of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, said: 'New legislation and professional guidance have been introduced to ensure that nothing is removed from a body without the knowledge of relatives and that all body tissue is properly dealt with in accordance with relatives' wishes. 'This legislation and guidance was not in place at the time of the Hillsborough post-mortems, and sadly the result has been additional distress. 'We are dealing with this as sensitively as we can, and I hope that families' privacy will be respected.' The disaster at the stadium claimed the lives of 96 people and a further 766 were injured after police were unable to control the crowds. The Human Tissue Act came into force in 2006 and put family consent at the centre of the use and storage of human tissue. It made removing, storing or using samples without consent illegal. The change in the law came after it emerged in 1999 that Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Merseyside had stripped hundreds of dead babies of their organs without the permission of relatives. Body parts, some of which were also obtained by other hospitals, were then secretly held at the hospital and the University of Liverpool for medical research. Penalties introduced under the Act range from a fine to up to three years' imprisonment, or both.

A holidaymaker alerted police from 5,000 miles away after watching burglars ransacking his home via security cameras he had linked up to his iPad. The unnamed home owner was enjoying a sunshine break in Mauritius when he noticed the burglary taking place at his house in Australia. He immediately alerted his local police who rushed round to his home and arrested two men at the scene. Detective: The victim was on holiday on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius (pictured) when he saw his Australian home being ransacked on his iPad . Distant: The victim may have been 5,000 miles away from Melbourne (pictured) but he was still able to alert local police who arrested two men . The victim said he had been horrified to catch the burglars red-handed as he relaxed on the paradise Indian Ocean island. He said: 'I was shocked. I was watching them for a good two minutes before I called the cops. I didn't know what to do.' The suspected thieves made two visits to the victim's home in Melbourne after realising he had left the property unattended. They allegedly stole thousands of pounds of electrical equipment including a flat-screen television as well as alcohol, shoes and even the family's dog bed. But they were unaware that every move they made was being recorded by webcams and streamed live to the internet. And they were busted when the homeowner decided to log on to check his property and spotted them raiding his cupboards. Security: The holidaymaker saw footage of the theft occur on his iPad . The man said he bought the webcams three years ago for just AUS$55 each. He added: 'But I never thought they would come to be used one day.' Two men, aged 32 and 55, were arrested at the scene of the raid, which happened two months ago. The Herald Sun reported that both had been charged with burglary and theft and are due to appear in court next month. Police spokeswoman Bianca Aitken, one of three officers who rushed to the house, said she had been amazed to receive a tip-off from such a distance. She added: 'You obviously have CCTV footage, which helps, but to actually get them on an iPad from the other side of the world is a pretty good find, I think. 'I guess he was being cautious with going overseas, but it paid off.' The island nation of Mauritius is a popular tourist destination which offers pristine beaches and calm turquoise waters. It lies in the Indian Ocean, around 5,200 miles north west of Melbourne.","Victim on holiday in Mauritius when he saw burglary taking place in Melbourne .

When Jeeby Burns boarded the 218 bus to got go home with her 15-month-old daughter, she expected a bit of sympathy when she didn’t have the 20p the driver asked for. Instead, the 26-year-old was met with a confrontation and after getting off the bus in Tonbridge, Kent, the driver ‘flipped the bird’ at her. Fortunately for Waitrose worker Mrs Burns, she had her camera ready and managed to get a picture of the driver and his offensive gesture. The driver of the bus objected to having his picture taken and can be seen reacting by sticking his middle finger up . She tried to pay a £2.20 fare with a £10 note for the one-and-a-half mile journey from Tonbridge Castle to the stop near her house. She was asked for the 20p, but when she said she didn’t have any change on her, Mrs Burns and her daughter, Sophia, were ordered off the bus. Fortunately, a valiant passenger came to her rescue when he saw how embarrassed she became over the exchange and offered her a 20p piece. Mrs Burns completed the journey, but hostilities continued and with the driver refusing to give his name, she took a photograph instead so that she could file a complaint.

I think the way he treated me was just not right. ‘He asked if I had 20p and I said “sorry that’s all I have”. He said “you have to get off the bus”. ‘I was so embarrassed. All the passengers were looking at me and shook their heads. ‘One man asked me how much I needed and he gave me the 20p.’ It was only when she returned home on November 11 and looked at the picture, that she realised in the process of having his face photographed, the Arriva driver had stuck his middle finger up at her. ‘As I was getting off the bus I had my phone camera ready to take a photo. I took a picture of his face. ‘I didn’t realise at first he gave me the middle finger because of the light shining on the window.’ She added: ‘I don’t think he should treat other people like that. I’m still in shock.’ Mrs Burns conceded that the exchange of words became ‘heated’ but added: ‘He didn’t have to be rude to me over 20p. It’s just not right.’ An Arriva spokesman said: 'We have investigated Mrs Burns’ complaint and this investigation has included interviewing our driver and checking the digital CCTV images recorded on the journey in question. 'We cannot condone the driver’s action and he has been suitably disciplined. 'He is a long-serving employee with a good record and he is extremely sorry that he acted in the way he did but he is adamant that he did not swear at Mrs Burns and did ensure that she got to her destination.

"By . Richard Shears . Last updated at 2:26 PM on 23rd November 2011 . Sickening details of a plan to slaughter endangered orang-utans were revealed today with the arrest of two men taking part in a hunt-and-kill operation in the jungles of Indonesia. The palm oil workers were accused by police of hacking to death 20 orang-utans and a number of proboscis monkeys. But it is feared many more have been slaughtered. Endangered: Indonesia is home to 90 per cent of the 50,000 orang-utans left in the wild (library image of a baby orang-utan) For each kill, the men were paid $US100 (£64) for a dead orang-utan and $22 (£14) for a monkey - a fortune on the island of Borneo, where Indonesia has sovereignty over two thirds of the land. The Daily Mail revealed earlier this month that hundreds of orang-utans have been killed for food by villagers in Borneo in recent years as man and beast struggle for survival. The arrest this week of the two palm oil workers is the first evidence that the slaughter is continuing despite appeals for it to stop. Police said that although the men admitted killing the animals - under orders from a supervisor - between 2008 and 2010 officials believed the slaughter is continuing in a number of areas in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo. The arrested men were paid £64 for a dead orang-utan and £14 for a dead proboscis monkey (pictured from library image) The arrested men, who come from the . village of Puan Cepak, have admitted to police that they chased the . animals, bringing them down with rifle shots before stabbing them or . hacking them to death with machetes. Among . the evidence against the men, said the Jakarta Post, were photographs . of the slain animals and buried bones unearthed near the palm . plantation. 'This is the result of oil palm plantation owners trying to protect their crops from hungry orang-utans,' said police spokesman Colonel Antonius Sutirta. 'It's one of those unfortunate situations where farmers are taking more land as the population grows, or where demand for cooking oil increases, and the habitat of the orang-utans gets smaller.' Mr Sutirta said that if convicted the oil palm hunters would face up to five years in prison. But wildlife officials said putting two men in jail would be unlikely to stop the slaughter. 'There's a demand for food for the human population and there's the greed for making money from palm oil,' said a wildlife official in Jakarta. 'The result is diminishing habitat for the orang-utans and the death of these wonderful animals who are becoming desperate for food themselves.' Police said they were considering the arrest of the supervisors who sent the men out on their slaughter missions. Indonesia is home to 90 per cent of the 50,000 orang-utans left in the wild. In the past 50 years, as the demand for palm oil, timber and vegetables has grown, indonesia has lost half of its rain forests.","The men, from Borneo, were paid £64 for a dead orang-utan and £14 for a dead proboscis monkey .

Religious views: Rev Mark Sharpe as vicar in Hanley Broadheath, left, . and today as he attempted to sue God at an employment tribunal .

Rev Sharpe said: ‘This . is a local parish for local people - that is the attitude.When I arrived . here, I held a lunch for the church wardens of all six churches. ‘At the end of the lunch, one of the . wardens, Sally Jones, boasted that they didn’t get on with the previous . rector so they “chewed him up and spat him out”.’ Mrs Jones denies that she made this comment. His claim of constructive dismissal was being supported by Unite, the union. But lawyers for the Diocese of . Worcester pointed to ecclesiastical laws which state that clergy are not . employees but office holders ‘employed by God.’ They say vicars are therefore not eligible to claim unfair dismissal, because God cannot be sued. After moving to the parish in 2005, Rev Sharpe said he was subjected to constant harassment and even threats. The locals were so hostile to the new vicar that he installed CCTV cameras to protect his family. Rev Sharpe says his dog was poisoned, . animal excrement was smeared on his car, his tyres were slashed, his . home phone lines were cut and his heating oil was stolen. 'Forced out': Reverend Mark Sharpe with wife Sara and children Naomi, Lydia, and Thomas at the Worcestershire rectory where life was so miserable for them . 'Murdered': Rev Sharpe said his dog Sasha was poisoned during the 'campaign of intimidation' One church warden even objected to . Rev Sharpe’s beard, warning him that locals wanted a ‘clean shaven . clergyman’, Birmingham’s Phoenix House Tribunal Centre heard. Rev Sharpe claims he asked Bishops to help him, but they ‘washed their hands’ of the case. He eventually left in September 2009 after developing stress-related ill-health. Rev Sharpe told an employment hearing that he had written to Bishops begging them to intervene, but they refused to help him. ‘What confused and upset and distressed me was that I was told: “We are not dealing with it. Doors shut, end of,”’ he said. ‘I was told that I couldn’t access a grievance procedure, that I didn’t have any rights.’ Instead, he said, a series of . replacement vicars were ‘parachuted in’, one of whom was ‘preparing . secret reports to the bishop’ about him, including comments he had made . in ‘confidential meetings.’ In December 2009, the Reverend’s wife . and three youngest children left the dilapidated four-bedroom rectory . after the Diocese of Worcester launched eviction proceedings against . them. Their eldest child was away at university. Taking on the Lord: Rev Sharpe's lawsuit is reminiscent of the Billy Connolly film The Man who Sued God . At the time, the Reverend Sharpe, who . was ordained in 2001, said: ‘My career has been ruined, my health and . that of my wife and children has been shattered, and my family has . suffered terribly from all the strain.’ Reverend Sharpe said the Diocese had . ‘glossed over’ the serious problems in the parish, which is made up of . six churches in local hamlets and villages, when he agreed to move his . family there. ‘When we came here, I was told by the . church that they were looking for stability, as the last vicar had left . after 18 months for health reasons. If most employees resign from their job because of an employer’s behaviour, it may be considered to be constructive dismissal. They would need to show that: . ‘I found a situation that was allowed . to fester for decades, where of the four local parishes only three were . legally constituted because two had refused to merge . ‘This dated back to 1979 and I was staggered that it had not been sorted out already. ‘When I tackled it, it sparked a wave . of resentment from the community which has culminated in my family and I . living in a climate of fear in a supposedly rural idyll. ‘There have been too many incidences of harassment over the last four years for them to be the odd coincidence.’ Describing the beard incident to the tribunal yesterday, Mr Sharpe said: ‘It was a church warden who complained about it. ‘I said I had grown a beard because I had a skin infection.’ When asked if the warden had then retracted their objection to the beard, Mr Sharpe replied: ‘If only it had been that simple.’ Rev Sharpe has not worked as a vicar since leaving the parish, and has been diagnosed with M.E, the chronic fatigue illness. His wife, an environmental health officer, said: ‘I feel like four precious years of family life have been robbed from us. ‘It has been the worst time of my life. I used to be a committed Christian, now I am agnostic. ‘If this is Christianity in action I don’t want anything to do with it.’ Unite officer Rachael Maskell said: . ‘The fact that Mark and his family have been forced to leave their home . during the so-called season of goodwill at the pinnacle of the Christian . year is a disgrace, and a dark stain on the church’s reputation. ‘This is a toxic parish with a 40-year history of clergy leaving abruptly or in broken health.’","Rev Mark Sharpe claims his dog was poisoned, excrement was smeared on his car, his car tyres were slashed and his phone line cut .

A soldier killed on a patrol in Afghanistan was named as Private Thomas Lake, 29, from the 1st Battalion The Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment. His mother Carol said: ‘Tom was a wonderful son and I will miss him more than I can say. ‘He had so many friends who will remember him as a loyal, fun-loving action man. ‘Tom loved the Army and was so proud to be a soldier; he died doing something he loved.’ Pte Lake, from Watford, was hit by a blast from an improvised explosive device while on foot patrol with Afghan forces in the Nahr-e Saraj area of Helmand on Sunday. A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said . Pte Lake was taking part in a patrol to reassure the local population . when he was caught in the explosion. She added that he was airlifted to the field hospital at Camp Bastion where he was pronounced dead. Pte Lake had joined the Army in November 2009. On joining the battalion he attended . courses, including the Infantry Assault Pioneers’ Course and the Team . Medics’ Course, and recently completed part one of the Snipers’ Course . in Brecon, Mid Wales, the MoD spokeswoman said. His death takes the number of British troops who have died since operations in Afghanistan began in 2001 to 389. His commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel James Coote, said: 'Pte Lake epitomised the very best qualities of the British infantryman. He was a true Tiger - ever professional and totally committed to his mates and his battalion. 'He had an irrepressible smile and an understated manner that together made him hugely respected by all those that had the privilege to serve with him. 'He packed an almost impossible amount into his two years in the Army, both at work and off duty. 'Where many soldiers would have sought one specialisation in that time he had three - he was a medic, an Assault Pioneer and was also training as a sniper. 'Equally energetic out of uniform, he . represented the battalion at football, easily earning a coveted place in . the team in his first season.' 'Older than many of his peers, he was often the man that they would turn to for help or advice; maturity and potential abounded and he was fully expected to attend the promotion cadre on his return to Germany. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'The tributes paid to Private Lake by his friends portray a brave soldier who was held in the highest regard. 'His professionalism marked him as an outstanding member of his platoon and he was, by all accounts, destined for promotion. 'Sadly, his full potential will not now be realised and at this tragic time my thoughts are with his mother, Carol.'","Private Thomas Lake, 29, described as 'ever professional' and 'totally committed'

Kate Hancock was walking her German Shepherd-cross Cassie in woods when she was set upon. She was knocked to the ground and bitten on the face, head and arms by the Anatolian Shepherd dogs, a large muscular breed that has the strength to take down lions. Horrific: Kate Hancock suffered terrible bites to her head and arms as her nine-year-old dog was savaged to death next to her. She is pictured in hospital after the attack which took place in woods in Weston-super-Mare . Painful: Mrs Hancock needed plastic surgery to her face after the attack . Cassie was savaged to death during the attack in Wrington Woods, North Somerset. The three dogs, from a breed which can . weigh more than 10st, had escaped from the country home of Sarah and . John Avery, who were on holiday at the time of the attack. But despite being abroad, Mrs Avery – . as owner of the dogs – was ordered to pay £10,000 in costs because the . person she had left in charge had failed to supervise them. Recalling the attack, Mrs Hancock told . Bristol Crown Court: ‘It was horrifying. Initially one of the dogs . attacked me, then as it latched on to my arm the other two dogs started . to attack my dog. ‘I ran towards them screaming, trying . to hit one of the bigger dogs with my lead. But then one of them, which . was so big it came up to my waist, just knocked me over and started . biting my face.’ She continued: ‘I buried my head in . the earth to try and protect my eyes, while it was biting the back of my . head. It then went back to attacking my dog and I realised there was . nothing I could do to save her. They were jumping on her and biting her . throat. ‘I was in fear for my life. God knows what would have happened if a child had been with me.’ Lucky escape: After the court case, Mrs Hancock said: 'I'm a fairly fit woman and was with a fairly large dog. If I had a child with me or if I had been frail then the consequences could have been much more serious' Killed: Miss Hancock with her dog, a German Shepherd-cross, called Cassie, which was mauled to death . She added: ‘To see your dog being mauled by other dogs and being incapable to help is every dog owner’s worst nightmare.’ The trial heard that Avery and her . husband were in New Zealand at the time of the attack and the dogs in . the care of a tenant who was renting an annexe attached to their house. Somehow Mrs Hancock, 47, who lives . near Weston-super-Mare, managed to get to a nearby house, from where she . telephoned her husband and was taken to hospital. Speaking of the breed owned by the . Averys, Mrs Hancock, who now has a retriever-cross called Biscuit, said: . ‘They are used to guard flocks of sheep in Asia and could bring down a . leopard. They are incredibly unsuitable dogs to be kept as family pets . and people need to be aware of the harm these breeds can present.’ Prosecutor Simon Morgan said Avery had . not fulfilled her responsibility to leave the animals in the care of . someone who could adequately supervise them. The court was also told that 18 months earlier one of the dogs had escaped into the woods and bitten a man through his clothing. Sarah Avery, pictured here with two of her dogs. Three of her dogs had escaped from her home while she was on holiday . Vicious: Mrs Hancock was attacked by three Anatolian Shepherd dogs, similar to this one, which had been left to roam wild in the woods . Mrs Avery was told to pay £10,000 in . costs and ordered to carry out 40 hours of unpaid work after being found . guilty of being the owner of a dog causing injury while ‘dangerously’ out of control. One of the three dogs has since died and another has been rehomed. Sentencing, Judge Lambert did not . order that the remaining dog should be destroyed because it could not be . proved to have caused the injuries to Mrs Hancock in October 2009. But he added: ‘It seems to me these dogs are not appropriate to be kept in England.’ The court heard a civil claim between . Mrs Hancock and Avery had been settled for an undisclosed sum before the . trial. Sam Jones, defending Avery, said: ‘She wishes to say how sorry . she is that this incident occurred.’ Bristol-based Avery’s Wine Merchants . have been selling wine since 1793, and Mr Avery, the 69-year-old . chairman of the company, is the fourth generation of his family to run . the business.

A babysitter has been jailed for nine years after inflicting a catalogue of horrific injuries on a three-year-old in her care. Karen Victory - who pinched, bit, strangled and scalded the boy - was only caught when she dialled 999 amid fears that the boy had died. Paramedics took the child, who cannot be named for legal reasons, to hospital where staff who examined him found at least 40 injuries - including bite marks on his thighs, groin and buttocks. A doctor described them as 'the worst non-accidental injuries' he had ever seen, Chelmsford Crown Court heard. Prosecutor Andrew Jackson said Victory told police 'hour after hour of wicked lies' to cover up her abuse. Describing her 999 call in February this year, Mr Jackson added: 'She said her daughter had been playing a game involving scarves being tied around his neck. 'She said she had gone into the bedroom and found the victim lifeless on a bed. 'She was worried she might have killed him. Later, she started telling the truth, saying, 'I have bitten him everywhere to get him to shut up'.' Paramedics reported the injuries to police and Victory was arrested. It later emerged that, on an earlier occasion, she had badly injured his feet after holding them under scalding bath water. Victory, of Witham, Essex, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent at an earlier hearing. She had previously admitted unlawful wounding, cruelty and assault. She sobbed uncontrollably in the dock and said 'I'm so sorry', as she was sentenced today. She sat with her fingers in her ears as the judge described her crimes. Abuse: The youngster, who has not been named for legal reasons, was limp and appeared to be dead when found by paramedics . 'I'm so sorry': Victory sobbed uncontrollably in the dock as she was sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court (pictured) Sarah Vine, in mitigation, said Victory's parents had died at a young age and she had grown up in foster care. She found herself vulnerable and in an 'appallingly violent' relationship. She added: 'However horrific these offences were and whatever level of revulsion they quite properly provoke in the minds of those who have heard about them, this was not an act of sadism. 'Her behaviour, whilst appalling and shocking, was at its heart an overspill of the most tragic kind - an overspill of unmanaged and unaddressed emotions. 'I cannot say enough on her behalf to express her remorse. She does not weep for herself.' Jailing her, Judge Anthony Goldstaub QC said: 'He was not your child but you were looking after him as a minder and you had the responsibility of caring for him for a few weeks. 'When paramedics found him he was limp and appeared to be dead. 'He was taken to hospital and hospital staff found some 40 injuries. He screamed when touched.' Victory was barred from working with children for the rest of her life.","Karen Victory was caught when she called paramedics, fearing the boy had died .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:49 PM on 4th October 2011 . A schoolgirl who became the youngest person in the world to undergo a double lung transplant four years ago has died. Mariam Imran was just five when she underwent the life-saving operation - but a year ago her body began to reject the organs. Shortly before her death, the nine-year-old told mother Faaiza Dar: 'I'm not scared of dying, mummy, but I'm scared of leaving you'. Mariam with her mother Faaiza Dar in 2007: Doctors said Mariam's body began rejecting the organs in September last year . Ms Dar, 29, said: 'I was in shock when she died. She went so peacefully, she didn't scream, she wasn't in pain. 'She looked like she was asleep.' Mariam from Blackburn in Lancashire, had cystic fibrosis - a hereditary condition that affects the respiratory and digestive systems, when she was three-months-old. Following the double transplant in January 2007, Mariam led a normal life but by September last year, doctors told her parents their daughter's body had begun to reject the organs. Sessions of radiation therapy to slow down the deterioration failed and last month Mariam, who is an only child, developed breathing difficulties. She was taken to hospital where for the first time she told her father Imran Khalid that she was 'not fine'. Ms Dar said they were offered another transplant but decided to decline for their daughter's sake. 'After nine-and-a-half years of fighting there comes a point where the body and mind can't take much more. She was my life, she suffered enough and there has to be a cut off point on what someone can take. It was the hardest decision of my life. 'She never complained, but had said ""mama, why can't I be like my nieces?"" I told her she was special and explained that if it wasn't her that was ill it could be someone else. 'And she said she wouldn't wish it on anybody else - she was a very, very wise girl.' She went on: 'Mariam had a short life but I could have lost her four-and-a-half years ago. 'She had so much fight. Mariam was aware of her condition and the of amount medication she was taking. 'At one point she was quite ill and couldn't breathe and said ""I'm dying, I'm dying"". I asked her what they felt like and she said she could see a white light and said that God was calling her. 'I told her about what we believe and she told me that she was more scared of leaving me by myself. Ms Dar added: 'She was an amazing girl. She left her mark wherever she went. She had a cheeky smile and you would always leave with a big smile on your face after speaking to her. 'She left such an impression on people's lives. She was bubbly, funny and moody like her mother but she knew how to wrap people around her little finger. 'I'm empty and I look around and expect her to call for me.' Following her daughter's death, Ms Dar is urging more black and Asian people to register as donors. 'You don't think you'll ever need to know about these things. But people need to have the issues around organ donation highlighted,' she said. Black and Asian people are three times more likely to need a kidney transplant than those from other ethnic origins. But they make up less than two per cent of deceased donors. A spokesman for UK Transplant, said: 'We need people to talk about their wishes for organ donation and join the register.' In May this year, doctors at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London performed a double lung transplant on an even younger child. Mason Lewis, from Atherstone, Warwickshire, was just four when he had the operation.","Mariam had a short life but I could have lost her four-and-a-half years ago, says mother ."

A 15-year-old girl has become the fourth child to die after a woman went on a murderous rampage at the weekend. Makayla Leigh Woods passed away on Wednesday afternoon after being shot by her boyfriend's mother, Mary Ann Holder, 36, in Greensboro, North Carolina on Sunday. The news was confirmed by Guilford County Sheriff BJ Barnes. Holder had also shot her two sons, nephew, niece and married ex-lover before killing herself. One other wounded child is on life support. Miss Woods was found critically injured at Holder's home with Holder's nephew Richard Suttles, 17, and niece Hannaleigh Suttles, eight, who were also in a critical condition. Holder's son Robert Dylan Smith, 17, was already dead. Hannaleigh died on Monday, followed a day later by Holder's 14-year-old son Zachary Smith. Holder had been having an affair with Randall Lamb, 40, for almost four years, and it was coming to a bitter end Sunday when she arranged to meet him at a community college parking lot. Police say she shot him in the shoulder and he was expected to recover. Holder then drove off to meet Zachary Smith. Nearly half an hour after the 911 call from Lamb's wife, a sheriff's deputy spotted Holder's black SUV. Holder was found dead inside with a gunshot to the head, and Zachary was critically wounded in the back seat. Authorities said Mary Ann Holder shot both her . sons - 17-year-old Robert Smith, left, and 14-year-old Zachary Smith, . right - in the head. Robert was killed instantly, while Zachary . succumbed to his wounds Monday . Deputies found two handguns inside the vehicle, including one in Holder's lap, the sheriff said. Officers then went to her home and found the other victims. The victims appeared to have been shot while they slept in a bedroom and the home's living room, Barnes' chief deputy Col. Randy Powers said. Jilted: Police believe Mary Ann Holder, 36, shot her son's girfriend Makayla Leigh Woods, her sons, ex-lover, niece and nephew . Police are continuing to investigate . the case. An autopsy has been performed on Holder and police are . waiting for the results of toxicology tests, but Powers said it . initially appears there were no signs of drug use. Holder, . Lamb and his wife had spent months trading accusations of stalking and . harassment in court documents. Lamb's wife had recently threatened to . file an alienation of affection lawsuit against Holder, investigators . said. Police . are investigating a $10,000 cheque made out to Lamb’s wife that Holder . gave him the day before the shootings, according to an application for a . search warrant obtained by The News & Record of Greensboro. Police say the cheque may have been for an out-of-court settlement of some kind. Despite . that, and despite two notes left by Holder taking responsibility for . the shootings, police say a definite motive is not yet clear. 'This . will be the $64,000 question, because we don't have anyone alive who . can answer it,' Powers said. 'A couple of theories have gone up in the . air, but we really don't know yet.' Richard Suttles remained on life support Wednesday, according Powers. Holder reportedly had custody of her nephew and niece after their mother died. Neighbour Joe Scott told WRAL.com: 'It's beyond my imagination that a mother would - good children such as they were - that she would do any harm to precious children.' Three-tiered shooting: The gunman shot victims at three locations throughout North Carolina . Mr Scott's wife Teresa said: Holder's decision to take in her dead sister's children appeared to add to the pressures of what appeared to be a life in turmoil. Hannaleigh Suttles, eight, had gone to live with her aunt after her mother's death. She is the youngest victim . 'Why would you take them children, keep them children, when your life's rocky, up and down?' Mrs Scott said Holder began renting the home across the street about four years ago. Holder's children were kind towards the elderly couple across the road, Mrs Scott added. They volunteered to help with yard maintenance and enquired about the health of her husband Joe, who has had recent health problems. In the past, Mr Lamb also appeared to like Holder's children, Mrs Scott said. 'They'd pack up things and go places together,' she said. But it was also clear the affair between Holder and Mr Lamb had soured, according to Mrs Scott. Robert Smith posted no-trespassing signs on trees in the front yard this year in response to the rising level of tension between Holder and Mr Lamb, Mr Scott said.","Sheriff .

The estranged wife of a multimillionaire New York investor admitted she hacked into her husband's private computer to prove he had spent hundreds of thousands in 'allowances' for young women. Linda Simon used a private investigator to allegedly discover her husband David  had been accessing the website sugardaddy.com to conduct extramarital affairs. Mrs Simon also claimed her husband gave $250,000 in 'hush money' to a woman he had a child with last year. Bitter feud: The wife of David Simon, a multi-millionaire hedge funder, claims he squandered thousands on young women he met on sugardaddy.com . The couple are in the middle of a divorce at Westchester Family Court where Mrs Simon filed a protection order to have her husband kicked off their estate in Purchase, New York. Mr Simon is believed to have been living at the Setai Hotel, New York since the end of July. In August, Mr Simon, who is a frequent commentator for CNBC, sued his wife and her divorce lawyer Jason Advocate for $25 million at Manhattan Civil Court. He alleged they had copied his hard drive which contained 'trade secrets' from his company Twin Capital Management and his personal financial information. Appeal: Linda Simon, estranged wife of financier David Simon, admitted she hacked his computer - but only so she could prove he was spending marital assets on young women he met on sugardaddy.com . The lawsuit said he was the only . person with the password and his company's computer-monitoring service . showed someone accessed his PC after he left home. Responding to the claims for the . first time, Mrs Simon admitted that she broke into the . computer with the help of surveillance firm T&M Protection Resources. She said she only did so to find out about her husband's affairs and the money he lavished on young women. According to the filing obtained by . The New York Post, Mrs Simon stated: 'Simon was a ''sugar daddy'' to . several young women through a Web site called sugardaddy.com and was . spending thousands of dollars per week paying these women ''allowances'' to be at his beck and call.'

A world-famous university marching band has been thrown further into chaos after its long-serving director was last night fired after the death of a drum major in a suspected initiation ceremony. Julian White, of Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, was unable to stop the alleged ‘hazing’ events in the band and music department, college president James Ammons said. Robert Champion, 26, was found unresponsive on a bus parked outside a hotel in Orlando, Florida, on Saturday night after the school's football team lost to Daytona Beach rival Bethune-Cookman. Problematic culture: Julian White, of Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, was unable to stop the alleged ‘hazing’ events in the band and music department, college president James Ammons said . Mr Champion was vomiting and had complained he couldn't breathe before he collapsed. Mr White meanwhile has been placed on paid administrative leave and has 10 days to respond to his firing. The incident happened following a popular football and marching band competition between two of the state's historically black universities at the Florida Classic in Orlando. The school competes every year before a typically sold-out crowd and Mr Champion had been helping conduct the world-famous Florida A&M University's Marching '100' band. But Mr Champion later said he not breathe in a band bus in the parking lot of a hotel after the game. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Dead: Robert Champion, 26, was found unresponsive on a bus parked outside a hotel in Orlando, Florida, on Saturday night after the school's football team lost to Daytona Beach rival Bethune-Cookman . ‘The investigation indicates that “hazing” was involved in the events that occurred prior to the 911 call for assistance,’ Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said earlier this week. Mr Ammons said on Tuesday the school would indefinitely suspend all activities of the band. He added that the school would also appoint a task force ‘to determine if there are any unauthorized and questionable activities associated with the culture of the Marching “100”.’ ‘Our first priority at Florida A&M University is to protect the safety, health and well-being of our students, faculty and staff members,’ Mr Ammons said. World-famous: The band was invited to perform at both of Bill Clinton's inaugural parades and in Paris in 1989 at France's Bastille Day Parade to celebrate the French Revolution's bicentennial . The Marching ‘100’ is renowned worldwide for its high-stepping, high-energy dance routines. It was invited to perform at both of former U.S. president Bill Clinton's inaugural parades, and in Paris in 1989 at France's Bastille Day Parade to celebrate the French Revolution’s bicentennial. Both the prestigious band and the university have faced hazing allegations in the past. A former FAMU marching band member won a $1.8million verdict in 2001 in a civil battery suit against five members for a hazing incident in which he was beaten so badly his kidneys shut down. The student also settled out of court with FAMU for an undisclosed sum. Then in 2005 Florida lawmakers bolstered penalties for hazing that resulted in great bodily injury or death.

"By . Hannah Roberts and Mark Duell . Last updated at 9:20 AM on 24th November 2011 . One of the new allegations brought against football coach Jerry Sandusky accuses him of abusing his own grandchild, according to his lawyer. Sandusky, the former defensive coordinator for Penn State football team, is accused of molesting at least eight boys over a 15-year period. His lawyer Joe Amendola said the accusation comes from the wife of one of Sandusky's five adopted sons. Accused: Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky allegedly took high school pupils out of class in order to abuse them outside school grounds . Two new cases emerged yesterday, both referring to victims under the age of 18. Amendola told ABC News: 'The allegations are ridiculous and unfounded. Jerry has absolutely denied any inappropriate contact with his grandkids.' The incident was not reported to . authorities until after Sandusky was charged earlier this month, he said. Gone: Penn State head coach Joe Paterno has been sacked after news of the allegations surfaced . Neither the person who made the complaint, nor the alleged victims, have been publicly identified. Sandusky adopted a total of six children with his wife Dorothy. If the two new allegations are found . to be credible they will be the first involving alleged victims who are . still under the age of 18. Their accounts will be investigated by . the state's children and youth services rather than the police as they . are classified as minors. Sandusky, who maintains his innocence, . faces 40 criminal counts involving the sexual abuse of eight boys . beginning in the mid-1990s. The former football coach is free on bail, but has not been required to post any bail money. Earlier this week a judge delayed his preliminary hearing in the Centre County Courthouse for three weeks until December 13. Mr Amendola told . ABC's Good Morning America he feared new criminal . allegations would land his client in jail. Scandal: The mother of one alleged victim has said her son was abused on a regular basis after meeting Sandusky through his charity The Second Mile . Meanwhile a grand jury indictment has revealed a shocking account by the mother of one former Central Mountain High School pupil. 'My concern is, if they bring new charges based upon new people coming forward, that bail's going to be set and he's going to wind up in jail' Joe Amendola . She claims her son was frequently taken off school grounds by Sandusky despite no parental permission having been given. According to the mother's account, the . school's principal Karen Probst repeatedly urged her not to report the . abuse allegations to police. She claims neither Ms Probst nor the . school counsellor took his complaints seriously and she stormed . out of a meeting when they refused to act. She said of the principal and school counsellor: 'They were not helpful. They wanted me to go home and forget all about it.' Age gap: Laywer Joe and Mary Amendola at a charity event before they split up . The mother, who has removed her son . from the school, said he first met Sandusky in 2005 or 2006 through his . children's charity aged 11 or 12. She recalls meeting Sandusky at the . charity's annual parent awards ceremony as well as frequently seeing him . hanging round the school. She said towards the end of eighth . grade her son's behaviour changed and he began 'lashing out' and . becoming 'mouthy and nasty at home’. She said she was alerted to the . possibility that something was seriously wrong one evening when her son . asked her how to look up 'sex weirdos'. Mugshot: Sandusky, who maintains his innocence, faces 40 criminal counts involving the sexual abuse of eight boys beginning in the mid-1990s . Believing he was just playing a game she claims she asked him who he wanted to look up and he replied ‘Jerry’. He then allegedly went on to tell her that he was being taken out of school several times a week, sometimes on a daily basis by Sandusky. 'I didn't know how to start the conversation with the high school counsellor because I didn't know how to come out and say: ""I think Jerry Sandusky is doing something to my kid""' Unidentified mother . According to both the alleged victim and his mother, football coach Steve Turchetta had authorised Sandusky to do this - despite no parental permission being given. Realising the seriousness of the situation she states she arranged to meet with the school counsellor. She said: 'I didn't know how to start . the conversation with the high school counsellor because I didn't know . how to come out and say: ""I think Jerry Sandusky is doing something to . my kid"". 'I finally said to the counsellor ""You're a mother. I'm a mother. I have a gut feeling that something isn't right"".' Taken away: Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, centre, is led away by police after being arrested in Harrisburg this month . But she claims the school shrugged off her concerns, with principal Ms Probst saying: 'Jerry has a heart of gold. 'Jerry has a heart of gold. He's been around all these kids and you really should go home and think about what this is going to do to your son and your family if you do that' What Karen Probst allegedly said to a boy's mother . ‘He's been around all these kids and . you really should go home and think about what this is going to do to . your son and your family if you do that.’ Lawyers for one of the alleged . victims, identified only as Victim 4, today requested for an injunction . that would stop the children's charity that Sandusky founded The Second . Mile from disbanding. In the wake of allegations that . Sandusky used the charity to get close to his victims, The Second Mile . has said it was considering transferring its programs. But Victim 4's lawyers said that they . want to make sure the company's assets are safeguarded. The criminal . charges against Sandusky could be followed by civil lawsuits. Lawyers Benjamin Andreozzi and . Jeffrey Fritz said in a statement. 'We believe it is in the best . interest of our clients, as well as the other victims, to ensure that . the organization is being financially responsible. 'We have reached out to attorneys for . The Second Mile in the hope that appropriate safeguards against the . dissipation of assets can be reached, but are proceeding with these . legal measures in order to protect the interests of our clients and . other victims in the event we are unable to come to an agreement,' the . lawyers said. The allegations have rocked Pennsylvania and led to the ousting of its celebrated football coach, Joe Paterno. Aside from the case, Sandusky's defence lawyer Mr Amendola, 63, is said to have got a teenage girl called Mary Lavasile pregnant when she was 17 and he was 49, before later marrying her. The age of consent in Pennsylvania is 16.","Defence lawyer Joe Amendola: Latest victim is a grandchild .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:07 PM on 23rd November 2011 . A law professor serving in Afghanistan has left his job at a Massachusetts university after a colleague there said it was 'shameful' to send care packages to U.S. troops. U.S. Army Reserve Major Robert Roughsedge resigned from Suffolk University in Boston after fellow law professor Michael Avery sent an email insulting soldiers fighting overseas. Mr Avery attacked a University effort to donate items to soldiers in what Major Roughsedge called a 'hate speech', Fox News reported. Scroll down for video . Quitting school: Law professor and Reservist Robert Roughsedge, pictured in Afghanistan decided to leave Suffolk University in Boston over comments made about U.S. troops . Mr Avery wrote in the email to colleagues: 'I think it is shameful that it is perceived as legitimate to solicit in an academic institution for support for men and women who have gone overseas to kill other human beings. 'Why are we sending support to the military instead of Americans who are losing their homes, malnourished, unable to get necessary medical care, and suffering from other consequences of poverty? 'As a university community, we should debate these questions, not remain on automatic pilot in support of the war agenda.' Mr Avery, who specialises in constitutional law, said it was 'not particularly rational in today's world' to have sympathy for American troops in a war zone. Major Roughsedge was so upset with that sentiment he handed in his letter of resignation on Monday. The soldier told Fox 25: 'It’s basically like a five-year-old throwing a temper tantrum. At odds: Robert Roughsedge, left, was stung by the comments of Michael Avery . 'That is not how we teach our students to rationally look at the issues. 'We want rational adult discourse and that is not something I would tolerate in my class and it is not something the school should tolerate from one of its professors.' Major Roughsedge had been part of the adjunct faculty at Suffolk University for eight years and taught a popular course on terrorism and the law. The university is now getting a lot of complaints from students and alumni who say Mr Avery's view does not represent that of the school. In an . email to Dean Camille Nelson, revealed by newspaper Hampton-North Hampton Patch, Major Roughsedge wrote: 'Professor Avery has engaged in hate speech against a class of citizens who . ironically do not enjoy the same First Amendment rights. 'Members serving in the U.S. military . cannot speak out on matters of politics or personal opinion if doing so would . tarnish the reputation of the military. 'Proud history': The law school says it has always supported service personnel . 'I have a moral obligation to exercise my First Amendment right of freedom of . association and choose not to associate with Suffolk University Law School . any more. 'This is a sad moment for me because I know that the students do not . agree with Professor Avery and I truly enjoy teaching. However, I must go else I . am tarnished by the association. 'The only way for the students and alumnae to . stop this invasion of radical thought by Professor Avery is to do likewise: . transfer from Suffolk, stop donating money and stop supporting this hate . speech. He added: 'Taking action against Professor Avery would in no way threaten academic freedom at Suffolk any more than firing a professor who reveals membership in the Ku Klux Klan.' Barry Brown, Suffolk University's president and provost, said the university supported the 'free exchange of ideas and robust debate' and respected the 'right of our faculty members to exercise academic freedom.' He added that Suffolk had always supported U.S. service personnel and that the care package project had been very successful. Major Roughsedge left for Afghanistan in December 2010 and is expected to return home to New Hampshire next month. The father of three aims to get a teaching job somewhere else.

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 9:51 AM on 24th November 2011 . She was ETA's green-eyed femme fatale - who lured policemen into her bed before calmly gunning down their colleagues days later. But Idoia Lopez Riano, dubbed La Tigresa (The Tigress) for her legendary sexual prowess, has turned from the organisation's heroine to hate-figure - after she renounced her violence and said sorry for her crimes. Riano, now 47 and who was locked up for 1,500 years in 2003, became one of the Basque Separatist group's leading commandos during the 1980s. Scroll down for video... Cuffed: Idoia Lopez Riano, dubbed La Tigresa, has renounced her past violence. Pictured here at Madrid's Barajas airport following extradition to Spain in 2001 . She was responsible for a Madrid explosion that killed 12 Civil Guards in 1986, a car bomb that claimed five more later that year and gunned down several individual policemen and four soldiers. There was also an attempt on the life of a high court judge. But she has now been expelled from the group after publicly condemning the use of violence, and issuing an apology to the relatives of her victims. Her announcement has led to the Basque Political Prisoners Group (EPPK) removing her name from the roll call of ETA prisoners it distributes to its supporters. They said she was persona non grata for 'breaking with discipline'. Support: ETA may have laid down its arms, but there is still a strong desire for an independent Basque state in northern Spain and south-western France . It means Riano's family will no longer be entitled to financial support. She will now be shunned by fellow ETA inmates. ETA . was founded more than half a century ago during the dictatorship of . General Francisco Franco who banned the use of the Basque language. They were fighting for an independent Basque state in northern Spain and south-western France. The name of the organisation - Euskadi ta Askatasuna - means Basque Homeland and Freedom. The group has killed more than 825 people since 1968, typically using car bombs or shootings. The . last ETA-related fatality was the murder of a French policeman near . Paris in March 2010 in a shoot-out - the first French security officer . to be killed by ETA. Reports from Spain also suggest that by signing the statement she has agreed to meet with the relatives of victims - in a programme of reconciliation. Despite her fearsome reputation, Riana was said not to be able to resist seducing policemen ahead of a planned attack. Her comrades were said to have tired of her behaviour, and pensioned her off to the south of France. She was tracked down and arrested in 1994, and later extradited to Spain. Her expulsion from the group comes a month after ETA revealed it was ceasing its 43-year-long bloody campaign for an independent Basque state in territory straddling northern Spain and south west France. More than 825 people have been killed in the five-decade campaign. ETA is considered a terrorist organisation by Spain, the European Union and the United States.","Idoia Lopez Riano dubbed La Tigresa .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 1:12 PM on 24th November 2011 . John Kitzhaber has suspended the death penalty for the remainder of his term . Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber yesterday suspended the death penalty for the remainder of his term, saying he's morally opposed to capital punishment and has long regretted allowing two men to be executed in the 1990s. Kitzhaber's decision gives a temporary reprieve to a twice-convicted murderer who was scheduled to die by lethal injection in two weeks, along with 36 others on death row. It makes Oregon the fifth state to halt executions since 2007. His voice shaking, the Democratic governor said he has repeatedly questioned and revisited his decisions to allow convicted murderers Douglas Wright and Harry Moore to be executed in 1996 and 1997. 'I do not believe those executions made us safer. Certainly I don't believe they made us nobler as a society,' Kitzhaber said. 'And I simply cannot participate once again in something I believe to be morally wrong.' He added: 'It's a perversion of justice.' Death penalty proponents criticised the decision, saying the governor is usurping the will of voters who have supported capital punishment. Kitzhaber's moratorium means Oregon joins, at least temporarily, four other states that have halted executions, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment. Illinois this year outlawed the death penalty after the discovery of wrongful convictions. New Mexico voters abolished it in 2009, two years after New Jersey's Legislature and governor did the same. A New York appeals court struck down a portion of the death penalty statute. Kitzhaber is a former emergency room doctor who still retains an active physician license with the Oregon Medical Board, and his opposition to the death penalty has been well-known. The execution room: Oregon State Penitentiary Superintendent Jeff Premo standing in the execution room at the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem . In a news conference explaining his decision, he cited his oath as a physician to 'do no harm'. Kitzhaber was elected last year to an unprecedented third term as governor after eight years away from public office. Oregon has a complex history with capital punishment. Voters have outlawed it twice and legalised it twice, and the state Supreme Court struck it down once. Death-row inmate: Gary Haugen has had his execution temporarily reprieved . Voters most-recently legalised the death penalty on a 56-44 vote in 1984. Since then, two men have been executed, both of whom voluntarily gave up their appeals during Kitzhaber's first administration. 'It is arrogant and presumptuous for an elected official, up to and including the governor, to say, `I don't care with the voters say, I don't care what the courts say,'' and impose his own opinion, said Josh Marquis, a death penalty proponent and the Clatsop County district attorney. Marquis has prosecuted several capital cases and written about capital punishment. Prison officials had been preparing for the Dec. 6 execution of Gary Haugen, who also had waived appeals. Haugen was serving a life sentence for fatally bludgeoning his former girlfriend's mother, Mary Archer, when he was sentenced to death for the 2003 killing of fellow inmate David Polin, who had 84 stab wounds and a crushed skull. Fighting tears, Kitzhaber said he spoke to relatives of Haugen's victims. He said they were difficult discussions but declined to discuss them further, calling them 'private conversations'. Kitzhaber said he has no sympathy or compassion for murderers, but Oregon's death penalty scheme is 'an expensive and unworkable system that fails to meet basic standards of justice.' Over a three-decade political career, Kitzhaber has built a reputation for charting his own course, sometimes to the frustration of fellow Democrats and others to the chagrin of legislative Republicans. Politicians are often hesitant to discuss abolishing the death penalty for fear it will anger voters, said Richard Dieter, director of the Death Penalty Information Center. Oregon State Penitentiary: Superintendent Jeff Premo walks through the gated corridors . Kitzhaber's decision might give confidence to leaders in other states, he said. California is considering a ballot measure next year to abolish capital punishment, and death penalty opponents are also hoping legislators in Maryland and Connecticut will repeal it. Oregon prison officials said last week that they'd spent $42,000 preparing for Haugen's execution, not including legal fees, including $18,000 spent on lethal drugs. Kitzhaber said he wanted to wait until the legal process played out before announcing his decision. Prosecutors have long complained that death penalty cases take decades to make their way through the courts, but efforts to change the law have been stymied in the Legislature. Eight condemned inmates have been on death row since the 1980s. The fatal room: The Oregon Department of Corrections had been preparing for the execution of inmate Gary Haugen, scheduled for December 6 . 'I cannot imagine, nor do I believe, that voters intended to create a system in which those convicted and condemned to death could determine whether or not their sentence would be carried out,' Kitzhaber said. Oregon's constitution gives Kitzhaber authority to commute the sentences of all death row inmates, but he said he will not to do so because the policy on capital punishment is a matter for voters to decide. Kitzhaber's reprieve will last until he leaves office. His term ends in January 2015, and he has not said whether he'll run for re-election. Kitzhaber said he hopes his decision will prompt a public re-evaluation of the death penalty in Oregon and said he will advocate for a ballot measure that would make it illegal. The governor said he prefers murderers be given a life sentence without the possibility of parole. The direct phone lines to the governor and the attorney general are shown on the wall outside the execution room .","Prison officials had been preparing for the Dec. 6 execution of Gary Haugen - now temporarily reprieved .

Beef farmer Michael Hanson, 26, and surveyor Hayley Morgan, 31, decided they wanted to tie the knot in an 'udderly' brilliant style that celebrated their country lives. The bride arrived at the church in a 2.8 tonne tractor which transported the happy couple after the service to a muddy field to have their portrait taken with a herd of British Blue cattle. Moo..ve over: Newlyweds Michael Hanson and Hayley Morgan surrounded by the British Blue herd belonging to her parents in Powys, mid Wales . Cattle cake: Michael and Hayley cut their British Blue themed wedding cake, decorated with icing figures of their three dogs and the couple as cattle . The couple even had cow and calf named tables at the reception and a British Blue themed wedding cake complete with icing figures of their three dogs and of them as cattle. Guests' names were written on cattle ear tags on the tables and they enjoyed a four-course dinner with, what else, roast beef. The couple then honeymooned in Texas where they spent three weeks touring cattle farms. After the wedding Hayley, from  Llandefalle, Powys in mid Wales, had to spend £95 cleaning the mud from her wedding dress, despite wearing a pair of white Wellington boots. She said: 'We didn't want to pretend to be all prim and proper and not be ourselves on the day. We just wanted to be us and what we do every day. 'We met at a dinner and dance at Brecon Young Farmers in 2009 and everyone who was invited to the wedding was a farmer. 'I've never been to a wedding like ours but then we just wanted something that reflected us. It wasn't expensive, we just did it with the budget we had. The tractor of love: Some arrive at their wedding in a Rolls-Royce, others in a horse and carriage, but for Hayley and Michael, a tractor was the obvious choice . 'The marquee in the grounds of the farm had been up for about a month before. We had Michael's brother Johnny's 21st birthday in there and the local young farmers annual dinner. 'Everyone said how great it was and we are really glad we did it the way we wanted to.' Hayley and Michael met and fell in love attending cattle shows, stock judging and at young farmers' events. They have been on one date to the pub but admit they have never had a evening at the cinema. They married in Hayley's parish church - St Matthews in Llandefalle - on August 20, having been together for two a half years. After the wedding, they drove in the Massey Ferguson tractor to Hayley's parents' farm nearby to be pictured with the herd of British Blue cattle and their three-year-old terrier George. Michael then drove the couple the 28 miles in a farm truck across the border to the reception at his family farm in Eardisland, Herefordshire, where they now live. Field of dreams: Michael and Hayley head off in the tractor after their wedding to her parents' farm, where they had their portrait taken with a herd of British Blue . Herd about this? Hayley, pictured in her white Wellington boots, and Michael plan to spend their wedding money gifts on their own British Blue cattle . The couple headed to Hereford, Texas, the beef farming capital of the world, for their honeymoon. Hayley said: 'We had a great time and relaxed but we learned a lot as well and it added to our education as farmers. 'We saw the intensive fed ranches where 100,000 cattle can live and how farmers in the U.S. operate. 'Mike joked to all his mates he was only taking me to Hereford for the honeymoon. Which of course he was, but the one in the U.S. thank goodness!' They are planning to spend their wedding money gifts on a new herd of British Blue cattle.

"By . John Stevens . Last updated at 1:46 AM on 24th November 2011 . When builders digging up Stephen and Nicky West’s patio for an extension came to the back door clutching a human skull, the couple were understandably alarmed. But fear turned to fascination after experts said four bodies unearthed by the workmen came from a burial site dating back as much as 1,400 years to the middle Saxon period. Archaeologists believe the skeletons may have been there since 650AD and are part of a much larger burial ground under the home in the Warwickshire village of Ratley. Ancient skeletons of four people were unearthed during extension works at  the Rately home, Warks,  of Stephen (pictured) and Nicky West. The 1,400-year-old remains are part of an Anglo Saxon burial ground . They say the remains of two women, a man and a child aged between ten and 12 provide an insight into an obscure period. Analysis of the bones shows that the . population at the time suffered from periods of malnourishment and would . have been in near-constant pain because of infections. Mr West, 55, . said: ‘It was a bit of a shock to find out I’ve been living above an . ancient burial site all these years. ‘It’s a privilege to be so close to . such amazing history – and as long as they don’t wake me up, I’m quite . happy for it to stay that way.’ Radiocarbon dating has revealed the bones date back to between 650AD and 820AD . The bones were taken away first to Gloucester University and then to York University for testing by expert archaeologists . Life of pain: Anglo-Saxon men suffered from long periods of malnourishment and infection . He added: ‘We had builders in as we . were extending the back of our house, and I heard one of them knock on . the door. 'I was absolutely amazed when I saw a workman standing holding a . skull – he just said “I think there’s something you should see”. ‘I was praying that the bodies were really old and we hadn’t stumbled across something more grisly. ‘But the archaeologists came over . within a couple of hours and said it was quite likely there were a lot . more bodies under the house.’ Mr West said he had joked at the start . of the building work that they might find something from the English . Civil War because their house is near the site of the battle of . Edgehill, where the army of Charles I clashed with Parliamentarians in . 1642. But the remarkable archaeological find pre-dates that by nearly . 1,000 years. Carbon-dating from two of the skeletons showed that they died between 650 and 820 AD. England was then divided into a number . of kingdoms and the area may have been a frontier in another war . between the Saxon kingdom of the Hwicce and the eventually dominant . Anglian kingdom of Mercia. Stuart Palmer, of Archaeology . Warwickshire, said: ‘The discovery of this previously unsuspected burial . ground is an extremely rare and important addition to what has . previously been an archaeologically invisible period of Warwickshire’s . history.’ Mr West, who runs an online bird feed company, said further digs may be limited. ‘We’re interested to know what’s down . there, but to be honest we’d like to keep the bit of the house we live . in standing where it is, so we won’t be searching too hard.’ The early Anglo-Saxons founded much of . England as we know it, including developing systems of justice and . currency. They ruled England through the upheavals of the Viking age . right up to the Norman conquest of 1066. Archaeologists have identified the remains of at least four bodies which included two adult females, a young male and a juvenile aged between 10 and 12 . Mr West (pictured outside his home) says the find is 'spine-tingling' to think he's been sleeping on top of such history .","'The builder knocked and said ""Stephen, I think there's something you need to see"".

Over 100 people descended to Fiesta Island, in the city’s Mission Bay, to watch the examination, which determined the whale had been killed by a ship which fractured its vertebral column, according local newspaper reports. And Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Oceanic organisation is paying for the carcass to be towed out to sea and sunk deep into the ocean tomorrow so researchers can study its decomposition over the next several years. Examination: Over 100 people descended to Fiesta Island, in San Diego's Mission Bay, to watch the examination of the dead fin whale . The cost of towing the whale is very expensive, but Virgin Oceanic's operations manager Eddie Kisfaludy said the effort made by Virgin is part of a larger vision by Branson to ‘get the world excited . about exploring’ the deep ocean. Kisfaludy told the San Diego Union-Tribune: ‘The first thing that is going to happen after we sink the whale is it’s probably going to get attacked by . all the deep sea critters that hang out around at 2,500 feet down. ‘That’s going to include hack fish, . shrimp [and] crab and they are probably going to be working away on it . for the next several years.’ San Diego lifeguards are patrolling the carcass until tomorrow and the towing will take place under the supervision of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . Pregnant whale: The fin whale was pregnant when it died, leading its foetus (bottom right) be be expelled from its body 48 hours after its death . Helped by lifeguards: Local lifeguards originally towed the body from the Wastewater Treatment Plant to Fiesta Island so the carcass could be examined . Funding: Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Oceanic is paying for the boat and fuel to tow the whale . Along with the mother whale, which could weigh up to 70 tons, its five-foot foetus had apparently been expelled from its body around 48 hours after it died, due to bloating, scientists said. The whale originally washed up near Point Loma Waste Treatment Plan on Saturday afternoon before San Diego lifeguards moved the carcass over six miles to Fiesta Island where it could be examined. Lifeguard Greg Buchanan told the newspaper: ‘Everything went according to plan but I can honestly tell you the lifeguards were struggling with the enormity of the whale.’ Sir Richard Branson’s undersea leisure venture company is paying for the boat and fuel in return for the research. The carcass will be sunk near the Scripps Submarine Canyon and Scripps Institute of Oceanography, where scientists will study the decomposing body over the years to come and see how new ecosystems form. Fin whales are the second largest living mammals after the blue whale and grow up to 88 feet in length.","Branson's Virgin Oceanic is paying for the boat and fuel to tow the whale so researchers can study its decomposition over several years .

Thrilled: Charles Dance and fiancee Eleanor Boorman are expecting a child in March. It will be a first baby for Miss Boorman and a third for the veteran actor - 27 years after his last child . The baby is due in March and the couple have told close friends. Last night, Miss Boorman confirmed the news to the Daily Mail, saying: ‘We’re expecting a baby. Fingers crossed everything will be fine. We’re both thrilled.’ A friend last night said: ‘Charles is pleased and happy at the news.’ The pair, who started dating in 2008, live together quietly in a town house in North West London. It emerged in September last year that they were engaged. Fingers crossed: Miss Boorman, who started dating Dance in 2008, is hopeful everything will go smoothly with the pregnancy . Dance won a legion of female admirers when he appeared as the suave Guy Perron in the award-winning 1984 TV series. He married Joanna Haythorn, also a . sculptress, in 1970 and they divorced 33 years later. Their two children . are Oliver, 36, and Rebecca, 27. After the break-up he had a relationship with Sophia Myles, who has starred in films including Thunderbirds. The . actress, who was in her early 20s when she started dating Dance, was . said to be ‘utterly devastated’ when they split in 2005. He . then had an on-off relationship with former Gucci model Shambhala . Marthe, 36. During their relationship, French-born Miss Marthe said of . Dance: ‘He’s great company – older men know how to woo a lady.’ Miss Boorman, whose grandfather was the wildlife artist Harry Pettit, was brought up in rural Kent. She attended Princess Anne’s old school, Benenden, before reading anthropology, psychology and economics at Durham. She has been commissioned to complete portraits of the Royal Family, with Prince Charles describing her work as ‘marvellous’.

Apple fans hoping for a bargain this Christmas have had their appetites whetted after details of the tech giant's so-called 'Black Friday' sale were apparently leaked. The sale, set to take place at Apple stores worldwide and online tomorrow, will include some of the deepest cuts ever made by the company. The best discounts will be on Apple's big-ticket items, with $101 knocked off the retail prices of the the Macbook Pro, Macbook Air and iMac. On sale: Tech giant Apple is set to discount a range of products for a special one-day 'Black Friday' sale, according to an apparently leaked sales circular . Leaked: Apple fansite 9-5mac.com claims details of the sale were leaked to them by a 'trusted tipster' The company's iPad tablet computers will be offered at lesser discounts of between $41 to $61, iPods with $21 to $41 off, and iPod Nanos will be discounted by $11. Fans of Apple's mobile phones will be disappointed, however, as it looks like there will be no discount on the iPhone 4S or any of its predecessors. Fan site 9-5mac.com claimed a 'trusted tipster' leaked the details of the 2011 sale prices to them. The site has published pictures of . what appears to be a printed brochure detailing the special discounts, . which are some of Apple's deepest yet. But news of the sale was met with mixed responses from online technology commentators. ZDNet's Jason O'Grady described the discounts as 'anaemic'. Best deals: The heaviest discounts will be on Apple's big ticket items, like this Apple Macbook Pro which will be sold for $101 off the usual retail price . In previous years Apple has resisted heavily discounting its products, relying on their brand's hefty consumer appeal to drive sales - even as rivals make heavy price cuts. The discounts come as the Consumer . Federation of America warned retailers face a tough festive season, with . a survey showing consumers feel the financial situation has . deteriorated over the past year. The group found 37 per cent of 1,011 . respondents said their financial condition is worse today than it was . this time last year, compared to 30 per cent who say their finances have . not changed since last year. Nevertheless, . some retailers have gone all out to try to lure more shoppers to their . doors, with special opening hours creeping further back into the . Thanksgiving holiday. Walmart and Toys'R'Us have pushed their opening times into Thanksgiving evening, opening at 9pm and 7pm respectively. Target has provoked the outrage of its staff with its opening time tonight. Tens of thousands of Target employees have signed a petition objecting to its 12am opening time tonight in anger at being taken away from their families on the Thanksgiving holiday. With household budgets already so stretched, 10 per cent more people are expected to shop for their Christmas gifts on Black Friday this year than last year, according to a National Retail Federation (NRF) survey. Retailers are hoping that a string of discounts will help to persuade shoppers not to cut back too heavily on Christmas purchases amid the gloomy economic outlook. The NRF's survey also found that 62.2 per cent of Americans said the state of the economy would have an effect on their plans for spending over the festive season, and most people said they would be hunting for sales and discounts. News of Apple's discounts comes as speculation grows that the company will add to its 358 outlets worldwide with its biggest yet at New York City's Grand Central Station. Reports suggest a new space in Manhattan bustling train terminus will top the size of the corporation's massive 25,000-square-foot Regent Street location in London. An online video appears to give a walk-through tour of the site - but the corporation was giving little away about rumours it would be officially opened on Black Friday.

The manager of the Samoan rugby team is having to raid his piggy bank - after he was fined 100 sows by his home village for misbehaving at the recent World Cup. Mathew Vaea was ordered to give leaders in Leauva'a the animals for tarnishing  his chiefly title of 'tuala' by drinking regularly and treating the campaign in New Zealand like a holiday. Leauva'a chief Vaifale Iose said Vaea's actions, which he claimed led to the team failing to reach the quarter finals, had brought his position into disrepute. Getting the pork chop: Mathew Vaea (left) has been fined 100 pigs for his conduct at the Rugby World Cup . He told the Samoa Observer newspaper: 'The title of tuala received bad publicity in the media because tuala Mathew failed to perform some of his duties as the manager for the Manu Samoa.' Rather than hand the animals over to the village, Vaea has paid a fine of 2,000 Samoan tala (£535) and made a formal apology to village elders. The revelations of Vaea's conduct came from Samoan captain Mahonri Schwalger. Last month he provided a damning assessment of team officials' behaviour during the tournament, in a report to Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sa'ilele Malielegaoi. He said Vaea 'did not want to be there' and would disappear for days at a time, accusing him of drinking regularly when he was present and treating the campaign like a holiday. Tarnished: Leaders in the Pacific Islands village of Leauva'a had fined the country's rugby coach 100 pigs for his misbehaviour at the World Cup . The monetary value of the fine may be considered staggering in Samoa. But it is dwarfed in comparison to the £25,000 penalty handed to England's Mike Tindall who also behaved inappropriately during the competition. The husband of the Queen's grand-daughter was also dropped from the national team for his role in the England team’s infamous night out in New Zealand on September 11. Smarting over their poor performance in the opening match, the players downed cut-price shots at a ‘dwarf-tossing’ competition while the newly married Tindall drunkenly cavorted with a glamorous former girlfriend. Fined: England player Mike Tindall (left) was fined the sum of £25,000 for his misbehaviour at the Rugby World Cup . That raucous night and the recriminations that followed overshadowed the competition and set the tone for England’s appallingly poor show. Vaea, meanwhile, still does not know whether he will continue as manager of the Samoan team. The country's Rugby Union has advertised for a new team manager, head coach and two assistants since the doomed tournament. But he has not been formally fired. Tuilaepa, who is also chairman of the Samoa Rugby Union (SRU), has also ordered a full audit of World Cup funds, the release of which is scheduled for next month.","Mathew Vaea 'did not want to be there'

Justin Bieber's people have said that despite their superstar client agreeing to take a paternity test to prove whether he is the father of Mariah Yeater's baby, her people have failed to contact them and that she is 'avoiding' comparing the DNA samples. Not so, her camp says. Lawyers for Miss Yeater say that they have repeatedly contacted Bieber's lawyers and that she can't wait to match Bieber's DNA with her baby Tristyn's. Speaking to TMZ, Yeater's attorney Jefferey Leving says he was in touch with Bieber's lawyer Howard Weitzman twice last week. No . contact: Mariah Yeater, who gave an interview to TV show The Insider in . which she claimed Justin Bieber is the father of her baby Tristyn . He also expressed concern that he was not present when Bieber provided his DNA sample. Leving argues that they are not convinced that the proper controls were used during the test in New Jersey last week. Last night Bieber once again protested . his innocence, telling Letterman: 'I mean I could smell a weasel. People . make up false accusations.' Decked out in denim: Bieber pictured tonight to a record an appearance on the David Letterman Show in New York . The singer went on: 'I am 17, but it is going to happen….Being in the spotlight.  I took it. They just swab your mouth.' Yesterday he looked pretty relaxed and confident about the test as he stepped out with girlfriend Selena Gomez. The young couple went out for a bite to eat at IHOP in Los Angeles.

Yeater has dropped her lawsuit against the teen star although her lawyer has claimed they plan to pursue the matter privately. However .

A woman claiming to be the ex-wife of Colonel Gaddafi's captured son Saif al-Islam has emerged in Ukraine with extraordinary stories alleging domestic violence and womanising. Nadia, a blue-eyed brunette claims to have met him when she worked as a stripper in a top Moscow nightclub, and says she is currently in hiding, fearing for her life. She claimed that as she prepared for marriage to Saif, she had to fly to Paris to have an operation to 'restore' her virginity. ' 'The doctor proved my innocence in the presence of Saif's aunt. Then I embraced Islam,' she added. 'I . tried to have a normal family, but Saif wanted to live as a single man . with lovers and orgies,' she said in a Ukrainian newspaper interview. While . there is no proof of her claim of have married and divorced Saif after . two years, her claim appears to be taken seriously in Russia and . Ukraine. If she is who she . says, she could be a key witness at his trial whether it is in Libya or . under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. One . aspect of his trial is likely to be his alleged friendship with a . number of prominent British figures, including Prince Andrew, Tony Blair . and Lord Mandelson. High life: Nadia claims playboy Saif loved luxury and money and was a womaniser. He is pictured here at the Viennese Opera Ball in 2006 . 'Our house looked like more as bordello: a lot of his friends and a lot of women,' she said. 'We got married under religious traditions, I embraced Islam for that, but nobody treated me as the mistress of the house. 'There was no respect at all. My husband tried to make me a submissive Eastern woman, and I couldn't stand that attitude. 'That broke me, ate me from inside. And . what's more important, Saif took drugs and he couldn't control himself . when he was under narcotics. 'He had certain sexual perversions . in sex, for example, he liked to do it in public. I understood that we . couldn't live together.' Nadia, . who is believed to be 29, claimed that their relationship ended after a . furious row in a restaurant which culminated with him beating her and . throwing her out of a window but she miraculously survived. She claimed she was in a coma for 47 . days, and that Gaddafi - who acknowledged her but never started a . conversation with her - was outraged by his son's behaviour. Gaddafi was known to have employed . Ukrainian nurses in his medical team, but until now it was not known his . second son has a wife from the former Soviet country. Arrested: Sair al-Islam Gaddafi sitting with his captors in Obari airport on Saturday . Of . Gaddafi himself she said: 'About me being in hospital, he was in a . fury. He kicked Saif away to the desert. It could spoil the reputation . of the family that was already not so clean.' She left Libya and returned to . Moscow. 'The last time he came was in 2008, and he suggested that we . lived together again ~ but I was cold to him by that time.' Nadia said she was working in Moscow until 2010 but a mutual friend then told her to disappear or she could face danger. She claimed that Saif could not have replaced his father. 'He was afraid of his father, as of fire. And Gaddafi, I think, despised him for internal weaknesses.' The fall: Saif al-Islam sits after his capture, with his fingers wrapped in bandages and his legs covered with a blanket, at an undisclosed location . Playboy Saif loved luxury and money. She said: 'He was cheating on me all the time.' Nadia . - it is not known if this is her real name - is apparently in hiding in . the Crimea where she says she is fearful of his enemies. 'I don't know . any secrets, but still I'm scared,' she said. She claims not to be rich but for Saif 'it was all in a day's work to spend $20,000 (USD) at a restaurant. 'When we separated I had only . luxurious earrings which I managed to sell for $1million. I lived in . Moscow on this money. Now almost nothing is left.' Her most recent interview was with Ukrainian paper Respubika. It was made shortly before his capture. 'I thought Saif would turn my life into an Eastern fairytale,' she said.

But a teenager admitted having two handguns and live bullets stashed under the floorboards at his home. He had also been convicted of carrying a knife in the street when aged just 13. Lethal weapon: A Tokarev TT-33 self loading pistol, similar to the one found at the home of the 14-year-old schoolboy (File photo) However, despite these offences, he walked free when a judge said the law had ‘tied his hands’. Judge Roger Chapple said his powers . were ‘severely limited’ and he could not lock up the boy because he was . not considered a ‘dangerous offender’. He told the defendant: ‘If you were two years older, you would be facing a minimum sentence of three years’ detention. ‘Parliament has tied my hands almost . completely. I have no power at all in the particular circumstances of . your case to send you to any form of detention. There is really only one . sentence I can pass which is a youth rehabilitation order.’ The judge added that he could not even . put the boy under a more intensive supervision and surveillance . programme because he was not a ‘persistent offender’. The sentence at Inner London Crown Court prompted anger from campaign group Mothers Against Guns. Founder Lucy Cope, 56, who lost her son Damian, 22, in 2002 when he was shot outside a nightclub, said she was shocked. ‘It is difficult to believe that something like this that puts more lives in danger could be dealt with so leniently,’ she said. Discovered: An Italian Mini Gap pistol, similar to the one found by police . ‘We want strong deterrent sentences. What message does this send? If you are 14 you can get caught with a gun and walk free? ‘The statistics show that more and more young people are being found with guns and this will not help to stem the problem.’ Detectives suspected the Italian and . Russian pistols, along with 13 rounds of ammunition, were being looked . after for older criminals involved in drugs and violence. The court heard the haul was found in a . raid at the boy’s home  in Manor Park, East London, in August. Prosecutor Stephen  Clayton said the teenager claimed he was befriended . by another boy in a local park who asked him to look after a package. The defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, thought it was cash but, after opening it, failed to call police. The boy admitted two counts of possessing a prohibited firearm and one of possessing ammunition without a licence. Seat of justice? Judge Roger Chapple told London Crown Court he was powerless to give the teen a custodial sentence . Sentencing him to the three-year order, Judge Chapple said: ‘You have a chance, please use it. ‘Do I need to emphasise how dangerous . guns are? They kill people.  While a gun remains in criminal . circulation, the risk is high that it is going to be used to commit . crime, to kill or to cause serious injury. ‘Those who store guns keep them in the . hands of the wrong people. That is what you did and the courts . generally take a very serious view of this sort of thing.’ He added ‘no court can be other than . deeply disturbed’ that a  14-year-old with a conviction for possessing . an offensive weapon at just 13 was found in possession of two handguns . and ammunition. The boy’s solicitor James Burley said . he was not involved with gangs and hoped to be an engineer but had been . excluded from school. Anyone aged 18 or over caught with a gun must serve at least five years in prison. Those aged 16 or 17 must serve at least three years.","Judge insists he cannot issue harsher sentence because 'Parliament has tied my hands'

That's because the competitive eater has just broken another record - after scoffing 5lbs worth of the bird's meat in just ten minutes. The 5ft 5in 105lb woman claimed the record as part of the Wild Turkey 81 Eating World Championship, held in Times Square, New York, yesterday. Champion! Sonya 'The Black Widow' Thomas shows off her trophy after eating 5lbs of turkey meat in ten minutes to add another competitive food eating record to her collection . No cutlery required: Thomas and her rival Eric Booker, left, tuck into the turkey while showing off their different ways of tackling the challenge . Thomas's victory was made more remarkable as she crushed her nearest rivals - all men - by more than a pound of meat. Her feat saw her collect a cash prize of $1,581 and adding another title to her collection of world records. Speaking after her victory, the 42-year-old told the New York Daily News: 'I left only bone. I’m so happy.' 'I’m not normally a fan of turkey... but their turkey today was . very tasty, moist and warm. That’s why I ate most of the meat.' Thomas, who is from Alexandria, Virginia, and works as a restaurant manager, used a less frenzied technique to eat the bird during the contest. Even though Thomas weighs just 105 lbs, she owns a slew of eating records . In . the zone: Sonya concentrates while scoffing another chicken wing - one . of 183 she managed in 12 minutes - to break her own record in September . While no competitor uses cutlery, Thomas stripped handfuls of meat from the bird and placed the pieces in her mouth while drinking water in between. Asparagus - 5.75lbs deep fried in 10 minutes . Burgers - 7 3/4 pounders in 10 minutes . Cheesecakes - 11lbs in 9 minutes. Chicken nuggets - 80 in 5 minutes . Chicken wings - 183 in 12 minutes . Crabcakes - 46 3oz cakes in 10 minutes . Eggs - 65 hard boiled in 6 minutes, 40 seconds . Fruitcakes - 4lbs, 14oz  in 10 minutes . Gyoza - 206 n 10 minutes . Jambalaya - 9lbs of crayfish variety in 10 mins . Lobster - 11.3lbs of meat in 12 minutes . MoonPies - 38 in 8 minutes . Oysters - 46 dozen in 10 minutes . Pizza - 6 extra large pizza slices in 15 minutes . Pulled pork - 23 sandwiches in 10 minutes . Tacos -  43 soft tacos in 11 minutes . Tater tots -  250 tater tots in 5 minutes . Thomas's technique differed vastly from Eric Booker, who claimed second prize in the contest. The 400-pound man, nicknamed 'Badlands', picked up the bird in one hand and gnawed away using a technique more suited to a chicken leg. Booker said of his strategy: 'I just ripped the bird apart and ate the innards. 'I think I ate the wishbone by accident.' Booker, who holds his own world record for eating pumpkin pies, praised his fellow competitor. He added: 'I’m definitely in awe of her abilities, to be so small and eat so . much.' Thomas's success in New York follows several other world records. In September she managed to eat 183 chicken wings in just 12 minutes, breaking her own record. And in July she became the first Female World Hot Dog . Eating Champion by swallowing 40 hot dogs in 10 minutes. She also has records for eating in several . other categories including cheesecakes, crayfish, oysters and jalapenos. And for anyone wondering what Sonya is having this Thursday - she is planning a feast with Korean food.","Sonya 'The Black Widow' Thomas collects $1,581 first prize .

"By . Press Association Reporter . Last updated at 8:28 AM on 22nd November 2011 . Three top Khmer Rouge leaders accused of orchestrating Cambodia's ‘killing fields’ went on trial today before a U.N. backed tribunal more than three decades after some of the 20th century's worst atrocities. Judge Nil Nonn declared the trial open and read the names of the three senior Khmer Rouge leaders who are defendants in the tribunal in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. The defendants, who sat side by side with their lawyers, are 85-year-old Nuon Chea, the Khmer Rouge's chief ideologist and the No. 2 leader behind the late Pol Pot; 80-year-old Khieu Samphan, an ex-head of state; and 86-year-old Ieng Sary, the former foreign minister. On trial: Defendants from left to right - Former Khmer Rouge second-in-command Nuon Chea, former President Khieu Samphan and former Foreign Minister Ieng Sary are on trial in Cambodia for crimes connected to the Khmer Rouge . As they were: Khmer Rouge leaders Khieu Samphan (left) Nuon Chea (centre) with Pol Pot (right) in January 1986 at a camp in Cambodia . A fourth defendant, 79-year-old Ieng Thirith, was ruled unfit to stand trial last week because she has Alzheimer's disease. She is Ieng Sary's wife and served as the regime's minister for social affairs. The charges against the surviving inner circle of the communist movement include crimes against humanity, genocide, religious persecution, homicide and torture stemming from their 1975-79 reign of terror. An estimated 1.7 million people died of execution, starvation, exhaustion or lack of medical care as a result of the Khmer Rouge's radical policies, which essentially turned all of Cambodia into a forced labour camp as the movement attempted to create a pure agrarian socialist society. Intellectuals, entrepreneurs and anyone considered a threat were imprisoned, tortured and often executed. Former Khmer Rouge Deputy PM: Ieng Sary (sitting) was in charge of Foreign Affairs, pictured in the courtroom during the public hearing at the (ECCC) in Phnom Penh . Public hearing: People attending the trial for the former Khmer Rouge leaders at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) Tribunal spokesman Huy Vannak called the proceedings ‘the most important trial in the world’ because of the seniority of those involved. ‘It sends a message that the trial, which survivors have been waiting more than three decades for, finally begins,’ he said. The Khmer Rouge's supreme leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998 in Cambodia's jungles while a prisoner of his own comrades, who after being toppled from power fought a guerrilla war that did not fully end until the late 1990s. There is serious concern that justice may not be done if any of the ageing and infirm defendants dies before a trial is finished. Charges: The charges against the surviving inner circle of the communist movement include crimes against humanity, genocide, religious persecution, homicide and torture . Watching from the front row: Cambodian Buddhist monks sit in the courtroom at the ECCC in Phnom Penh attending the trial of three top Khmer Rouge leaders . The courtroom: Cambodian Buddhist monks walk in front of the courtroom in Cambodia . In September, the tribunal announced it would split up the indictments according to charge into separate trials in order to expedite the proceedings. The current trial is considering charges involving the forced movement of people and crimes against humanity. ‘It's the first time the senior leadership of the Khmer Rouge is being tried by a court with international backing. ‘It's the first time thousands of victims have had a forum to tell their stories, and demand reparations for their suffering,’ said Clair Duffy of the Open Society Justice Initiative, which has been monitoring the tribunal's work. Lining up to the trial: Cambodian Buddhist monks queuing up before entering the court . Facing trail: A Cambodian man looks at pictures of former Khmer Rouge leaders Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and former Khmer Rouge leader ex-social affairs minister Ieng Thirith . Battle-hardened former Khmer Rouge guerrilla Lim Sambath echoes the words that have become a mantra for the servants of the ultra-Maoist regime that tore Cambodia apart three decades ago. ‘We had to follow orders,’ he said of his role in the bloody ‘year zero’ revolution that wiped out 1.7 million Cambodians - a quarter of the population - from 1975-1979. ‘Almost all Cambodians are victims. Everybody had to follow the regime's policy,’ he said. ‘Those who defied the rules, their fate was death.’ Like Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan and Ieng Sary, Lim Sambath, 58, distances himself from the killings and says his recollection of the harrowing era is vague. He tells stories of his battlefield heroics to repel Vietnamese invaders but denies responsibility for any of the hundreds of thousands of men, women and children who died of torture, starvation, disease and execution in the rice fields and makeshift jails run by Pol Pot's black-clad disciples. ‘I don't know how many people were killed,’ Lim Sambath, a former guerrilla commander, now a community leader, told reporters at his home in Boyakha village on the western border with Thailand. ‘We had to follow orders. We had little knowledge. We saw no light. It was like living on another planet. But that was the only planet we knew.’ The closest any of the former cadres have come to disclosure is seen in the documentary film ‘Enemies of the People’, in which Nuon Chea, during six years of interviews with journalist Thet Sambath, admitted threats to the party line were ‘destroyed’ if they could not be ‘corrected or re-educated’. The film is expected to be used as evidence against Nuon Chea, who denies the charges. Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, which has compiled evidence to use during the trial, said it was unlikely defendants would confess but he was confident justice would eventually prevail.   ‘Everyone wants a final judgement of what happened,’ he said. ‘We've seen the Khmer Rouge hasn't changed its attitude. They won't admit anything, so the tribunal is really important.’ ‘It therefore has a huge potential not . only to contribute to justice in Cambodia, but also to contribute . dialogue to on-going efforts to bring perpetrators of these kinds of . atrocities to justice around the world.’ Chea Leang, Cambodian co-prosecutor, recalled for the court the brutalities of Khmer Rouge rule, beginning on April 17, 1975, when they captured Phnom Penh to end a bitter five-year civil war, and immediately began the forced evacuation to the countryside of the estimated one million people who had been sheltering in the capital. She also recounted the new social order established by the group: Personal property was banned, religion, press and all personal freedoms abolished. Pol Pot had led the Khmer Rouge from its clandestine revolutionary origins to open resistance after a 1970 coup installed a pro-American government and dragged Cambodia directly into the maelstrom of the Vietnam War. When the Khmer Rouge took power in 1975, they all but sealed off the country to the outside world. Sending the inhabitants of the cities off to vast rural communes was part of an effort to turn the country into a socialist utopia. Economic and social disaster ensued, but the failures only fed the group's paranoia, and suspected traitors said to be working with the U.S., or Vietnam, the country's traditional enemy, were hunted down, only plunging the country further into chaos. Vietnam, whose border provinces had suffered bloody attacks, sponsored a resistance movement and invaded, ousting the Khmer Rouge from power in 1979 and installing a client regime. The U.N.-backed tribunal, which was established in 2006, has tried just one case, convicting Kaing Guek Eav, the former head of the regime's notorious S-21 prison, last July and sentencing him to 35 years in prison for war crimes, crimes against humanity and other offences. That case was seen as much simpler than the current case, which covers a much broader range of activities and because Kaing Guek Eav confessed to his crimes. Those going on trial today have steadfastly maintained their innocence. The prison chief was also far lower in the regime's leadership ranks than the current defendants.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:35 PM on 24th November 2011 . Human remains have been found on the farm that formerly belonged to a millionaire who murdered his wife, police said today. Officers have been searching for the body of Kate Prout at the farm in Redmarley, Gloucestershire, for four days after Adrian Prout finally confessed to her murder in prison last week. Prout, 49, had previously maintained that his wife disappeared in November 2007, but was convicted of her murder last year and is currently serving a life sentence. Detective Superintendent Simon Atkinson this afternoon tells the Press that officers have found human remains . Search: Police have spent the last four days searching for the remains of Mrs Prout on the Gloucestershire farm she shared with her husband Adrian, who killed her in 2007 . Detective Superintendent Simon Atkinson, of Gloucestershire Police, said: 'At one o'clock this afternoon we have found human remains close to the location Adrian Prout identified as the place he buried his wife. 'No formal identification has taken place; however, we have informed Kate's family of recent developments. 'I do hope that this will be the final chapter of these harrowing events for Kate's family.' Speaking at a police cordon next to the farmland, Mr Atkinson said officers were aiming to remove the remains from the ground tonight. Specialist dogs, trained to locate decomposed bodies, were taken to the site at Cobhill Woods along with a body deposition expert who was flown in by helicopter yesterday. Last week, Prout led officers to an area of 300 square yards on the 276-acre Redhill Farm where he said he had buried the former teacher. Painstaking: Police officers walk down a footpath towards Redhill Farm during the search . Grim: Two police cars protect the entrance to the footpath leading down to the farm. Mrs Prout's husband, Adrian, who confessed to killing her, led detectives to the spot on the 276-acre farm where he dumped her . Mr Atkinson said: 'We have been . searching for nearly four days, and that perhaps gives you an indication . of just how tough it has been. 'Adrian . Prout has not been able to give us a precise location and that's why it . has taken so long, but it's within the area he indicated.' Police . have used diggers and forensic archaeologists, as well as cadaver dogs . in what police described as a 'challenging' search for Mrs Prout's body. In a dramatic twist last week, Prout . confessed to killing his wife and burying her body in woodland on their . £1.2 million farm, after failing a lie detector test. Last Friday, Prout was taken from prison to the farm in handcuffs to show police the spot where he said he dumped her. His admission from behind bars . comes four years after he murdered his 55-year-old wife and exactly 12 months . since her family last pleaded with him to reveal the truth. Waiting game: The media gather and wait while police carried out their hunt for Mrs Prout's body (left), while a wooden sign (right) warns of the closure of a footpath leading to the area where her body was thought to be . Prout (pictured right getting out of the van) arrived at the farm in handcuffs late on Friday morning. He directed officers to the precise spot where he buried his wife's body . Prout always denied any part in her disappearance as he refused to help officers in their search for the retired teacher. Friends had called for his release, claiming there had been a miscarriage of justice, while Prout maintained his innocence. But he is said to have told his fiancee . Debbie Garlick that he strangled his wife after a row and buried her . body in woodland on his farm. Ms Garlick is believed to have subsequently spoken to Gloucestershire Police about his confession. Prout, who has fathered a child with Ms Garlick after his wife's . disappearance, was thought to have strangled her and then used his . expertise as a professional pipe-layer to bury her body. Jurors heard that Mrs Prout had confronted her husband with an increased divorce demand the day before she went missing. He had offered her a settlement of £600,000 but, after discussion with accountants, she decided to demand £800,000. Wedding day: The Prouts in 2000. His shock confession came four years after Mrs Prout, a retired schoolteacher mysteriously vanished . Nightmare: Prout with fiancee, and mother of his child, Debbie Garlick shortly before his conviction. Before Prout confessed Ms Garlick campaigned to get his conviction overturned . The last time anyone heard from her was at 3.29pm on November 5, 2007, when she called her bank, First Direct. Since then no organisations have had any contact with her, including banks and passport agencies. Even after Prout was jailed, police continued to search Redhill Farm for his wife's remains, but failed to locate her. On Friday Ms Garlick told ITV Westcountry of her prison visit last week: 'He just confessed.' Ms Garlick, who had led a campaign . proclaiming Prout's innocence, said: 'Myself and my family are obviously . devastated for the news we received. 'My heart goes out to Kate and her . family. I hope this gives them a chance to grieve properly for their . sister and have a proper burial and somewhere they can lay flowers.' Ms Garlick, who was accompanied by . her sister during the interview, was asked whether having campaigned for . her fiance's release, she was devastated at his sudden confession. 'Yeah we were, obviously, but our heart goes out still to Kate and her family,' she said. A large cordon was formed around the area where Kate Prout's body is believed to have been buried . Crime scene: Police stood guard outside the couple's former home as other officers started the grim task of excavating Mrs Prout's body .

"By . James Chapman . Last updated at 5:03 PM on 24th November 2011 . Lecture: Nick Clegg will accuse banks of discriminating against customers from a minority background . Nick Clegg will today warn that hundreds more young black men are in jail than at top universities, in an explosive attack on race relations in Britain. The Deputy Prime Minister will also use his speech in Brixton, South London, to accuse the banking sector and the sports industry of discrimination. There are 400 more young black British men in prison than young black students at the elite Russell Group of universities, he will say. Britain has 'come a long way', he will concede, but it is now up to businesses and industries to support talented people from ethnic minority backgrounds. Mr Clegg will say that no matter how . many new laws are put on the statute book, what happens at home has a ‘huge influence’ on how . children do. He will say: . ‘In any family, black, white, rich, poor, we need parents and relatives . to support their children, helping with homework, keeping them in . school.’ Mr Clegg will also criticise football's elite, . pointing out that there are no black managers in the Premier League and . just two in the . top four divisions, though a quarter of players are black. In an onslaught on High Street banks, he will point to evidence suggesting that firms owned by black people are four times more likely than those owned by whites to be turned down for loans. Even if they they can get credit, he will say, black African, black Caribbean, Bangladeshi and Pakistani-owned firms have also been subject to higher interest rates than white and Indian-run enterprises. Aides . insisted, however, that he was not accusing banks of institutional . racism, and admitted current evidence was limited and that the reasons . for ethnic minority customers having less access to credit were likely . to be complex. Mr Clegg will announce that he is asking race equalities minister Andrew Stunell to examine the ‘barriers preventing black and ethnic minority groups from accessing loans’, working with the Equalities and Human Rights Commission and the Government’s ethnic minority advisory group. Probe: Equalities Minister Andrew Stunell will be asked to examine barriers preventing people from ethnic minority backgrounds accessing loans . Giving the annual Scarman Lecture in Brixton, the scene of race riots in 1981, Mr Clegg will attack Labour’s approach to race equality as ‘too narrow’. He will say: ‘They attempted to deliver equality solely through the state. The state has been used to hide the sins of the market – and the veil is now being lifted.’ Mr Clegg, who will admit that he leads a party that is ‘still too male and too pale’, will say that among current business leaders, there are some ‘hugely important’ ethnic minority figures – but not enough. ‘Why is it that members of some of our ethnic communities want to start their own businesses, but their success doesn’t match their ambitions?’ he will ask. We know, for example, that 35 per cent of individuals from black African origin say they want to start a business, but only six per cent actually do. ‘Past evidence shows that firms owned by individuals of black African origin have been four times more likely than so-called “white firms” to be denied loans outright. And that Bangladeshi, Pakistani, black Caribbean and black African-owned businesses have been subject to higher interest rates than White and Indian-owned enterprises. ‘The reasons will be complicated: a mix of poorer education among ethnic minority groups, perhaps a lack of the right guidance, a lack of their own capital to invest. There may be an element of self-exclusion too. Address: Nick Clegg will deliver the annual Scarman lecture in Brixton where race riots happened in 1981 . ‘But if we are serious about turning the UK into an island of entrepreneurs, we need to get to the bottom of this. Are our banks doing enough? ‘Britain’s banks, bailed out by the British people, have just as much responsibility as everyone else, arguably more responsibility, to help Britain build a strong and dynamic economy. Unleashing black and ethnic minority talent is their duty too. 'We urgently need to lift a lid on the . injustices hard-wired into our economy. It simply cannot . be right that we still live in a society where if you are from an ethnic . minority, you are much more likely to be poor.' The research highlighted by Mr Clegg was published in the International Small Business Journal, and involved more than 3,000 British firms. Lesley McLeod, of the British Bankers’ Association, said: ‘UK banks wish to support all our customers. We take racism very seriously and many already have diversity and inclusion policies, with trained staff in place to help. Bank mentors are already working with the Enterprise and Diversity Alliance.’","Ethnic minorities are discriminated against by High Street banks, he claims .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:22 AM on 24th November 2011 . Police believe Mary Ann Holder shot her sons, ex-lover, relatives, and son's girlfriend before committing suicide . The jilted lover who who shot her former boyfriend and five children had given the married man who ended their affair a cheque for $10,000 hours before her murderous rampage, it was revealed today. Mary Ann Holder, who killed her two sons and blasted one of the boy's girlfriends while also shooting her niece and nephew, gave Randall Lamb the money in a Walmart parking lot in a bid to stop his wife Jennifer from suing her, say police investigating the possibility of extortion. The next morning the 36-year-old met Mr Lamb in another parking lot in Greensboro, North Carolina, and during their meeting began firing her gun, hitting the 40-year-old once in his shoulder. Holder went on to shoot in the head her sons Robert Dylan Smith 17, and Zachary . Smith, 14, who have both now died, before firing at Robert's girlfriend, Makayla Woods, 15, and killing her niece, Hannaleigh Suttles, eight. She also injured her her 17-year-old nephew, Richard Suttles during the rampage on Sunday. And in a final twist to her murder spree, the 36-year-old turned the gun on herself and committed suicide, meaning - including herself - the death toll currently stands as four as Miss Woods, 15, died this afternoon. Major Tom Sheppard with the Guilford County Sheriff's Department said the cheque, made out to Mrs Lamb, was a 'settlement' to her threat to file an alienation . of affection lawsuit against Holder. Mrs Lamb filed a restraining order against Holder in February in which she claimed that the killer and her husband began an affair in 2008. The case was thrown out because neither the Lambs nor Holder showed up at court. Five months later, Holder herself filed a restraining order against Mr Lamb in which she curiously claimed in filed documents that Mr Lamb would stop his wife from filing the lawsuit 'if I give him what he . wants'. Sheriff BJ Barnes, whose department issued a warrant to search the Lambs' house, told Fox 8 News: 'I want to know what the story is on that check. I want to know the . documentation that goes with that. 'want to know if there if there is . any coercion, if there is any extortion going on. I'm not saying any of . that is there. I want to know if it's there' Search Warrant: The document reveals Holder had written out a $10,000 cheque in section 3 . Zachary Lee Smith, 14, died late Monday after being shot in the head over the weekend, authorities say . If any crime was . committed by others, charges will be filed,Mr  Barnes said, adding: 'It's been a week from hell, not only for the family, but for the community.' On Monday after Holder's fourth . victim, her son Zachary died, Southeast Guilford County High School, . whereattended as a freshman, released a statement, offering crisis teams . for families who were struggling to process the events. It . read: 'The Guilford County Schools family has been greatly impacted by . the violent and tragic incident that took place in our community on . Sunday. 'We are continuing to work with law . enforcement agencies with their investigation. Our thoughts and prayers . are with the victims and their families.' 'I just can't believe it - my best . friend is gone,' Nick Couch, 15, said. His mother Stacy had been friends . with Holder for ten years. In a 911 call Sunday, Mrs Lamb told operators: 'I don't know exactly what happened, but my husband has been shot. 'He . just called me and said he was on the highway and that he had been . shot. He was at - I don’t know for sure... I think he was at his work. And this woman who he had had an affair with... she was there when he . got there and she shot him.' Authorities said Mary Ann Holder shot both her . sons - 17-year-old Robert Smith, left, and 14-year-old Zachary Smith, . right - in the head. Robert was killed instantly, while Zachary . succumbed to his wounds Monday . A parent and students console each other over during a prayer meeting to remember the victims of Mary Ann Holder's shooting spree in Guilford County, North Carolina .

And in a final twist to her murder spree, the 36-year-old turned the gun on herself and committed suicide. ‘We’ve got death. We’ve got drama. We’ve got a situation basically no one could ever imagine,’ Sheriff Barnes said . He added that it was 'one of the worst situations I've seen in my 30 years in law enforcement' Investigators are trying to find out what could have motivated Holder to turn a gun on her children, her family, and herself. ‘We’re trying to find out why,’ Mr Barnes said. ‘We’ve come up with some probable solutions, but no one will ever really know.’ Zachary (left) was a freshman at . Southeast Guilford County High School . The gunwoman left behind two notes taking responsibility for the shootings. Sheriff Barnes said she apologised for the pain she caused but also that she felt 'wronged'.. The . tragedy unfolded shortly before 9am on Sunday when Holder met her . one-time boyfriend Randall Lamb in the parking lot of the Guilford . Technical Community College Aviation Centre in Greensboro, North . Carolina. They spoke . briefly before Holder shot at him multiple times, before a bullet struck . him in the shoulder, investigators said. He remains in stable . condition. Mr Lamb phoned his wife from the car . after the violent confrontation - and she then called 911, saying her . husband had been shot, prompting deputies to begin a search for Holder. They went to Holder's one-level brick residence on nearby Cocoa Drive in Pleasant Garden around 9:30am. Officers were stationed outside her home, but a deputy spotted her car driving down the street about an hour later. The deputy said he saw a 'puff of . smoke' in the SUV and found Holder dead and her son Zachary  shot in the head. He died of his wounds late Monday. Deputies recovered two handguns inside the vehicle, one in Holder's lap, the sheriff said. The officers then went into Holder’s home and discovered her son Robert dead. Inside they found Robert’s . injured girlfriend, Makayla Woods, along with Holder’s niece, Hannaleigh Suttles, eight, and her 17-year-old nephew, . Richard Suttles. Holder reportedly had custody of her nephew and niece after their mother died. Hannaleigh died on Monday of her injuries. The other two remain in critical condition. Hannaleigh Suttles, eight, had gone to live with her aunt after her mother's death. She is the youngest victim . Neighbour Joe Scott told WRAL.com: 'It's beyond my imagination that a mother would - good children such as they were - that she would do any harm to precious children.' Mr Scott's wife Teresa said: Holder's decision to take in her dead sister's children appeared to add to the pressures of what appeared to be a life in turmoil. 'Why would you take them children, keep them children, when your life's rocky, up and down?' Mrs Scott said Holder began renting the home across the street about four years ago. Holder's children were kind towards the elderly couple across the road, Mrs Scott added. They volunteered to help with yard maintenance and enquired about the health of her husband Joe, who has had recent health problems. In the past, Mr Lamb also appeared to like Holder's children, Mrs Scott said. 'They'd pack up things and go places together,' she said. But it was also clear the affair between Holder and Mr Lamb had soured, according to Mrs Scott. Robert Smith posted no-trespassing signs on trees in the front yard this year in response to the rising level of tension between Holder and Mr Lamb, Mr Scott said. Mr Lamb’s wife also filed an . alienation of affection claim, which in North Carolina allows someone . who is cheated on to sue the person their spouse had an affair with. The notes also indicate Holder was angry about how her relationship with Lamb came to an end. The deadly shooting spree, in which three were left dead, started in the car park of the Guilford Technical Community College .

Brad Durham, a 9th-grader at Southeast Guilford High School erects a memorial he created in front of the home where Mary Ann Holder is believed to have shot the children .

The result is the same. We may never know exactly what her thoughts were and why' Authorities yesterday said they were still . trying to determine when the victims in Holder’s home were shot and . whether it happened before or after she met with Lamb.

"By . Jessica Satherley and Chris Parsons . Last updated at 7:45 PM on 23rd November 2011 . Yemen president Ali Abdullah Saleh has finally agreed to step down after 33 years following an agreement which gave him immunity from prosecution in exchange for losing power. The authoritarian leader stepped down after signing a U.S.-backed power transfer deal mediated by Gulf Arab states to resolve the impoverished nation's crisis. Under the deal, Saleh, who had faced a fierce uprising to oust him as president, will step down and transfer power to the vice president in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Gearing up to sign the deal: Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh (right) in a meeting in his Presidency Office in Yemen on Tuesday before flying to Saudi Arabia today . He is the fourth Arab leader toppled in the wave of Arab Spring uprisings this year, after longtime dictators fell in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. Seated beside Saudi King Abdullah in the Saudi capital Riyadh, Saleh signed the U.S.-backed deal hammered out by his country's powerful Gulf Arab neighbors to transfer his power within 30 days to his vice president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. That will be followed by early presidential elections within 90 days. Saleh had arrived in the Saudi capital today to sign the agreement, according to Yemen state television. He was dressed smartly in a dark business suit with a matching striped tie and handkerchief and he smiled as he signed the deal, before clapping his hands a few times. He then spoke for a few minutes to members of the Saudi royal families and international diplomats, promising his ruling party 'will be cooperative' in working with a new unity government. Saleh said: 'This disagreement for the last 10 months has had a big impact on Yemen in the realms of culture, development, politics, which led to a threat to national unity and destroyed what has been built in past years.' [caption . Saleh addressed the country's troubles without mentioning the demands of protesters who have filled squares across Yemen calling for his ouster, often facing deadly crackdown from his security forces. He also struck out at those who strove to topple calling the protests the protests a 'coup' and a bombing of his palace mosque that seriously wounded him in June 'a scandal.' Saleh said his ruling party will be 'among the principle participants' in the proposed national unity government that is to be formed between his party and opposition parties, who also signed the deal. The plan Saleh agreed to calls for a two-year transition period in which a national unity government will amend the constitution, work to restore security and hold a national dialogue on the country's future. Saleh has clung to power despite an eight-month-old uprising, mass protests calling for his exit and a June assassination attempt that left him badly wounded and forced him to travel to Saudi Arabia for more than three months of hospital treatment. Security in Yemen has unravelled amid the uprising against Saleh's 30-year reign. Protesters: Anti-government protesters shout slogans during a demonstration today to demand the ouster and trial of Yemen's President in Sanaa, Yemen . The situation is particularly bad in the south, where al-Qaida militants - from what is perhaps the world's most active branch of the terror network - have taken control of entire towns, using the turmoil to strengthen their position. The unarmed protesters have held their ground with remarkable resilience, flocking to the streets of Sanaa and other Yemeni cities and towns to demand reforms from the autocratic government and braving a violent crackdown by government forces that has killed hundreds. But their uprising, inspired by other Arab revolts in the region that saw longtime rulers of Egypt and Tunisa go, has at times been hijacked by Yemen's two traditional powers - the tribes and the military - further deepening the country's turmoil. Breakaway military units and tribal fighters have been battling in Sanaa with troops loyal to Saleh, in fighting that has escalated in recent months. An impoverished nation of some 25 million people, Yemen is of strategic value to the United States and its Gulf Arab allies, particularly Saudi Arabia. It sits close to the major Gulf oilfields and overlooks key shipping lanes in the Red and Arabian seas.","Deal transfers Ali Abdullah Saleh's power to Yemeni vice president in exchange for immunity .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:25 AM on 24th November 2011 . Defence attorneys today played a videotaped interview of a nine-year-old girl whose father is facing a possible death sentence for a home invasion that killed three people. Joshua Komisarjevsky's daughter giggles frequently in the 20 minute video as she talks to a child welfare expert about her dogs and other animals and her toys. At one point, she says she used to play with 'Nana's son Josh' and says he went to jail for something. Komisarjevsky, 31, objected to his attorneys' plans to play the video as they try to persuade the jury to spare him the death penalty, saying . he didn't want his daughter to feel compelled to help 'one of the most . hated people in America.' Guilty: The jury convicted Joshua Komisarjevsky last month on all 17 counts in the home invasion - including capital felony, murder and sexual assault . Komisarjevsky and his co-defendant, . Steven Hayes, were convicted of murder in the 2007 killing of Jennifer . Hawke-Petit and her two daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old . Michaela, at their Connecticut home. Caroline Long Burry, a child welfare . expert interviewed the girl last weekend, said Komisarjevsky's daughter . calls him 'Daddy Josh' when she's with his family, but refers to him as . the son of her grandfather when with her maternal relatives. As Courant.com reports, she was told . by her maternal aunt, her relative guardian, that she was going to the . legal guardian's office to talk, and was not aware she was being filmed. As the video played, some jurors . smiled as the girl laughed, doing puzzles and colouring pictures with Ms . Burry during the interview. Komisarjevsky looked intently at the . screen. In a two-minute segment, the girl, . after seeing a photo of her father, said: 'Josh... went to jail for . something he did at work.' When asked if she recalled ever living with Josh, the girl replied: 'I don't remember anything.' Ms Burry later testified, describing . the girl as 'bright, engaging and sparkly' and expressed concerns that . if Komisarjevsky's execution could be 'very damaging' to the girl. 'She . would have to live on a daily basis with being labelled and quite . possibly stigmatised with the fact her father is on death row and there . is an execution coming up,' Ms Burry explained. Victims: Dr William Petit Jr (left) with his daughters Michaela (front) Hayley, (centre rear) and his wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit . She also said the girl is known to . withdraw and has a lot of anxiety, and that prison records showed that . Komisarjevsky had 55 visits with his daughter while he was in prison. Prosecutor Michael Dearington reminded . jurors under cross-examination that Komisarjevsky was convicted of . sexually assaulting and killing a girl less than two years older than . his daughter. 'In this particular situation, I . have carefully weighed the potential risks and have found that those . risks and negative consequences to my daughter far outweigh the benefits . of helping save my life.' Joshua Komisarjevsky . Dearington also noted that those sentenced to death spend . many years on death row and asked Burry about the last execution, which . was in 2005 and was the only one since 1960 in Connecticut. Komisarjevsky, speaking for the first . time in his trial other than a taped confession, told the trial judge . earlier today that his daughter was coached, an allegation denied by an . attorney for the girl's guardian. Reading from a three-page statement . his attorneys had not reviewed, he said: 'In this particular situation, I . have carefully weighed the potential risks and have found that those . risks and negative consequences to my daughter far outweigh the benefits . of helping save my life.' Family: Joshua Komisarjevsky poses with his mother, Jude, who lost custody of his daughter to her late maternal grandmother. The girl's maternal aunt is now her guardian . Father and son: Ben Komisarjevsky warlier told the jury about the 'miracle' of adopting his son Joshua as a baby . Standing behind the defence table as . he addressed the judge, wearing a dark suit and tie, he continued: 'I've . carefully come to the overwhelming opinion that I am not at all . comfortable putting my daughter in a position wherein she may feel that . she has to explain or justify herself to anyone who perceives her . statements to somehow help one of the most hated people in America.'

The decision has been made for her,' he said. Komisarjevsky noted his life is on the . line. He said the negative consequences to his daughter outweigh the . benefits of helping to save his life. 'I will not beg for my life,' he said. 'I will humbly request in earnest that your honour please uphold the . thoughtfully weighed decision of defendant over the wish of the defence . team.' Turning point: Joshua Komisarjevsky sorted his life out for a while and completed Army Reserve training . New Haven Superior Court Judge Jon . Blue overruled his objection, agreeing with the attorneys that they have . the final say. Komisarjevsky's lawyers played the videotape of the girl . in hopes of persuading jurors to spare him the death penalty later in . the morning. Only jurors were permitted to see and . hear the video, while credentialed journalists and others in the . courtroom gallery could only hear it and watch reactions from the jury. Accomplice: Steven Hayes is already on death row for the killings . The attorney for the girl's guardian said the interview with the girl was done carefully in a non-confrontational way. Komisarjevsky said his daughter has been told by her guardian not to talk about him. 'It should also be considered how her . memorialised words will affect her emotionally and psychologically in . the future if she believes she's party to assisting the effort to put me . to death,' he said. As Courant reports, Ms Burry said she . believed the girl's friends and acquaintances do not know she is . Komisarjevsky's daughter. Her name has been changed. After her paternal . grandparents Ben and Jude Komisarjevsky lost custody of the girl, she . went to live with her maternal grandmother. When the grandmother died, a . maternal aunt became her guardian. The girl's mother has struggled with . drug addiction and was admitted in the past to a psychiatric hospital. Komisarjevsky, was . convicted last month on all 17 counts in the 2007 Cheshire, Connecticut home invasion - including capital felony, murder and sexual assault. Komisarjevsky and Hayes were convicted . of killing Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her two daughters, 11-year-old . Michaela and 17-year-old Hayley, in their Cheshire home. Authorities say . Komisarjevsky sexually assaulted Michaela, who would have turned 16 . today. Hayes, meanwhile, sexually assaulted and strangled Hawke-Petit. Scorched: The house was set alight with the girls still inside, tied up with pillowcases over their heads . Horror: An image shown to the court shows the charred bedroom of Hayley Petit after the attack . The house was then set on fire, and . the two girls – who were tied to their beds – died of smoke inhalation. Hawke-Petit's husband, Dr William Petit, was severely beaten but . survived. Komisarjevsky and Hayes were caught . when they crashed the Petits' car into police cruisers near the home . while fleeing. Komisarjevsky's accomplice, Steven Hayes is on death row . following his 2010 conviction. In Komisarjevsky's case, jurors will . have to weigh whether aggravating factors in the case, including the . sexual assaults, outweigh mitigating factors, such as Komisarjevsky's . troubled childhood. The same Superior Court jury that . convicted Komisarjevsky will decide whether he should be sentenced to . death by lethal injection or to life in prison without the possibility . of parole. The defence is expected to rest next Tuesday. The sentencing phase began October 25.","Only jurors saw video testimony from Joshua Komisarjevsky's daughter .

"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 11:32 AM on 27th July 2011 . Part of Oslo's central train station was evacuated this morning after the discovery of an abandoned suitcase. And police were looking for a 'dangerous' and unstable man released from prison on Monday who claims to identify himself with the man who launched fatal bomb and shooting attacks last week. The Norwegian Railway Authority said the suitcase was found in on one of the buses which links the Oslo Sentral to the city's airport. Evacuated: The main train station in Norway's capital, Oslo S, has been evacuated after a suspicious suitcase was discovered this morning . Threat: A police officer stands outside the car park entrance to Oslo S station. Reports say a man was seen leaving the suitcase on a bus, before leaving the station . Police sealed off the area, but the abandoned luggage was later found not to contain anything suspicious. A fireman at the scene said: 'There is some baggage that was left on a bus and that the police bomb squad is checking it out.' An official for NSB, the national rail service, said: 'All the trains and the buses have been cancelled until further notice. 'Under police orders nobody is allowed to go into the station.' Jack Vaadahl, the driver of a bus scheduled to travel to Oslo airport, said he reported the suspicious suitcase to security personnel. He said: 'A suspicious person left in a hurry... leaving his luggage on the bus.' Cordoned off: The bus was scheduled to drive to Oslo's airport when the driver spotted the bag left on board . Investigation: Police are also looking for a 'dangerous' man released from prison on Monday who claims to identify with massacre suspect Anders Breivik . NTB news agency reported that someone was spotted putting a suitcase on a bus near railway track 19 and then leaving the scene. The city is on high alert in the wake of Friday's bombing and youth camp shooting that killed at least 68 people. The first Cabinet ministers were due to return to their offices today after the car bomb exploded in the government district of the Norwegian capital. Anders Behring Breivik, a 32-year-old Norwegian, has confessed to the attacks, according to police and his lawyer, but pleaded not guilty to the killings. In a rambling 1,500-page manifesto, he claims to have been associated with two terror cells within the country, as well as others abroad. Acting alone? Breivik leaves court in Oslo on Monday. The 32-year-old has admitted detonating a bomb in the capital and a mass-shooting on Utoya island, but denies killing at least 68 people . It comes as a Norwegian Cabinet minister was preparing to make a symbolic return to her bomb-damaged office as the nation tries to return to some form of normality. Administration and Church Affairs Minister Rigmor Aasrud will be the first to return to her normal office after the blast blew a hole through the prime minister's office and badly damaged other buildings. For the moment, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg will work from the defence ministry and cabinet meetings will be held in a medieval fort near the Oslo waterfront. It is unclear whether the prime minister's 17-storey building will be rebuilt or torn down.Police blew up at cache of explosives found at a farm rented by Breivik last night. He is believed to have developed his bomb using fertiliser he bought under the cover of being a farmer.","Ex-prisoner claimed to be associated with Anders Behring Breivik .

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 7:35 PM on 24th November 2011 . A club owner has come up with a novel way to try and beat the recession. He is allowing people to bring their own alcohol with them. Bob Senior, who runs a Durham Live Club in Durham, said his industry had been wrecked by supermarkets selling cheap alcohol. And in what appears to be case of 'if you can't beat them, join them', he is charging an entry fee, but allowing customers to provide their own drink. While the practice is common in restaurants that don't have an alcohol licence, it is thought to be the first time a nightclub has made such a move. Bob Senior has come up with the idea of letting people into his club with their own alcohol in the fight back against supermarkets . Mr Senior said:  'Business in nightclubs is down 70 per . cent in the last five years and big companies are going out of business. 'This is because bars have been allowed to open 24 hours and . supermarkets are selling very cheap drink. 'People are either staying in . and having house parties or they're spending several hours drinking . cheap alcohol before they go out. 'Nightclubs cannot compete. We have to . be imaginative if we are to going to survive.' Revellers pay £7 to enter the club which provides glasses and ice so that people can keep their drink cool. Mr Senior said the idea would initially be operated just on Friday and Monday nights. He added: 'Our principal aim is to accept the reality of the situation that has been developing and accelerating over the last nine years.' Not everybody agrees that it is a good idea, however, with Safe Durham Partnership saying it could be bad for people's health. Claire Sullivan, chairman of an alcohol group, said: 'We believe it poses a number of risks including the potential for greater consumption of higher-strength drinks such as spirits and wines. Bob Senior says the move has been driven in part by cheap supermarket alcohol . 'This will not just have a detrimental impact on the health of the individuals but may in turn impact on Accident and Emergency and ambulance services and increase disorder, including domestic and sexual violence. 'There is also the potential for glassware in the club to be used as a weapon both within and outside the premises, possibly increasing the risk of injury, violent crime and litter. Durham Police spokesman said: 'We have been made aware of the proposal to allow people to bring their own drinks into Durham Live. 'While the police are not the licensing authority, it is obviously something we will monitor closely as part of our commitment to managing Durham's night-time economy.' Mr Senior added: 'We will be monitoring the customers and their behaviour as always, and show zero tolerance for anyone acting irresponsibly or excessively.'",Durham Live Club will trial scheme for two nights each week .
"One in twenty who took part in poll of 2,000 said formal 'thank you' was not often needed . in everyday conversation . By . Nadia Gilani . Last updated at 12:46 PM on 24th November 2011 . Cheers: One in 20 people say 'nice one', while younger generations are more likely to offer a 'cool' than a thank you . For many a traditionalist, it is the most important two-word phrase in our vocabulary. But ‘thank you’ is falling by the wayside, replaced increasingly with less formal expressions of gratitude, a poll reveals. Although the average person will say 'thank you' nearly 5,000 times a year, one in three are more likely to throw in a 'cheers' or 'ta' where it's needed, rather than risk sounding old fashioned. One in 20 now say 'nice one' instead, while younger generations are more likely to offer a 'cool' than a thank you. 'Merci', 'fab' and even 'gracias' were also listed as common phrases to use, as was 'much appreciated'. One in twenty who took part in the . poll of 2,000 people by the Food Network UK for Thank You Day, which is . marked on November 24 said a formal 'thank you' was now not often needed . in everyday conversation. Nick Thorogood, managing director of . Food Network UK, said: 'When it comes to saying 'thank you', people will . always find the way that works best for them and it's interesting to . see what the act means to different people. 'The fact that over a quarter of us . choose to say thank you through food highlights that taking the time and . effort to say 'thanks' is still very important to us.' A massive 95 per cent of respondents . to the poll claimed manners are important, with eight in ten Britons . believing their etiquette is spot on. Having said that, more than one in ten adults said they regularly won't say thank you if they are in a bad mood. Poor show: Inattentive service is seen as a good reason to remain tight-lipped . But despite being quick to talk up their own politeness, it seems most people are not clear on the bigger picture. When asked if Britain was a polite country for example, opinion was split down the middle. Most people claimed that saying thank . you was something drilled into them by their parents, but four in ten . will utter a thank you purely out of habit. And while eight in ten people think they . could show more appreciation, a third of respondents barely even . acknowledge what they're doing when they say thank you. A huge 70 per cent of those questioned . will say thank you to a person's face without even meaning it, while a . fifth avoid saying it when they know they should - on at least two . occasions every day. A total of 95 per cent claim manners are important. Eight in ten . believe their etiquette is spot on. A huge 70 per cent of people will say thank you without meaning it. A quarter of people prefer to express gratitude via social networks. Another quarter of Britons say thank you with food - with 23 per cent cooking a meal to show their appreciation . Another 15 per cent will bake a cake. A third will send a handwritten . thank you note - but 45 per cent admit its been more than six months . since they sent one. It seems our friends and family get the brunt of our bad manners with half admitting they're rubbish at thanking those closest to them - many justifying the lack of thanks because their family 'already know I'm grateful.' When spoken words won't do, it falls to a nice text to do the job for most people. A thank you email is also popular, while a quarter turn to social networks to express gratitude. And while people seem happy to say thanks digitally, six out of ten are adamant it's no easier to thank someone by email than in person. A quarter of Britons say thank you with food, with 23 per cent cooking a meal to show their appreciation to someone. Another 15 per cent bake a cake. A third will still send a handwritten thank you note - but 45 per cent confess its been more than six months since they bothered to send one. It follows that 85 per cent of people will be annoyed at not getting the gratitude they feel they deserve. It emerged that one in three believe people say thank you a lot less now than in previous generations, while most thought the world could do with showing more gratitude. Anger is the biggest reason for not saying thank you, while poor service is seen as a good reason to remain tight lipped.","One in twenty who took part in poll of 2,000 said formal 'thank you' was not often needed .

Chris Huhne was facing an inquiry . last night after it was revealed his girlfriend touted for work boasting . she had access to Cabinet ministers. Carina Trimingham contacted top . lobbying companies in London suggesting she could get their clients in . front of senior members of the Coalition. In an extraordinary email, which she . appears to have sent with her CV to most of the major public relations . companies in London, the 45-year-old former journalist and PR consultant . said she had ‘excellent contacts… from Cabinet members to more junior . ministers’. Political circuit: Chris Huhne MP and Carina Trimingham share a drink at the Museum of London . The email, also sent in letter form, urges them to ‘make use of my skills and contacts’. A senior PR source said: ‘I’ve seen her letter and I believe she has sent it to all of us.’ Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Mr . Huhne has denied any wrongdoing. His spokesman said: ‘There is no . question of a conflict of interest as Chris Huhne understands Carina . Trimingham does not intend to accept any work that touches on his . departmental responsibilities.’ But a senior Lib Dem source last night conceded it was ‘not sensible’ for Miss Trimingham to have sent out the email. Labour MP Paul Flynn wrote to the . Prime Minister to demand an investigation into whether the ministerial . code had been breached. He said: ‘This is completely shameless. It is . entirely wrong that she should be hawking around her contacts with her . Cabinet minister boyfriend and his pals.’ The ministerial code states that . ministers are responsible for ensuring that ‘no conflict arises, or . could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and . their private interests, financial or otherwise’. In his letter Mr Flynn says: ‘If . these allegations are true it suggests a very worrying situation if . relatives, partners or others closely connected with Cabinet Ministers . are offering their contacts to the highest bidder.’ Miss Trimingham last night defended . her actions, saying: ‘As a former political journalist for 12 years, I . have many friends and acquaintances in all parties. ‘I have worked in communications and . public relations, including with the Liberal Democrats. Obviously in any . role I take, it will not involve energy and climate change and there . will be no conflict of interest.’ Mr Huhne is already facing a . criminal investigation into claims by his ex-wife Vicky Pryce who has . alleged he persuaded her to take his penalty points for a speeding . offence.

"By . James White . Last updated at 3:08 PM on 23rd November 2011 . David Cameron savaged Labour today for its failure to condemn the huge upcoming public sector strike after it emerged almost 90 per cent of the party's funding now comes from unions. Civil servants, teachers and health workers are set to walk out on November 30 in a dispute over pensions. During a lively Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons today, Mr Cameron brandished figures which show the Labour Party received £3,138,443 from unions. Attack: David Cameron savaged Labour in the House of Commons today over its failure to condemn union strike action, which he said was a result of funding agreements . He said: 'It really is irresponsible when negotiations are ongoing call strikes that will lead to the closure of most of the classrooms in this country.' He described the pension deal offered to public sector workers as 'extremely reasonable' and added: 'It's not just the union leaders who don't understand this but the party opposite who refuse to condemn this strike.' Referring to Ed Miliband, he said: 'In his first year as leader, 86 per cent of Labour's funding came from unions. Under the last Labour it was 50 per cent. 'That's the only thing he has improved since the time of Gordon Brown.' Mr Miliband also attacked David Cameron for youth unemployment figures that were shown to have hit one million last week, saying he was 'playing politics' with the figures. However, Mr Cameron said youth unemployment had been rising since 2004 and had risen by 40 per cent under the last government. Labour outstripped the Tories in party fundraising over the summer by nearly 30 per cent, official figures released today show. Donations registered with the Electoral Commission between July and September totalled £3,529,270 for the Opposition compared with the Conservatives' £2,744,618. Funding: The Labour Party, led by Ed Miliband (pictured in the Commons today) has received more than £3m in donations recently . The third-largest income during the period was recorded by the Scottish National Party, which received £1,988,657, the commission said. It comes a day after the main Westminster parties united to oppose extra state funding for parties as part of a bid to end the reliance on a few wealthy donors. The Commission's figures showed that taxpayers underwrote political parties to the tune of just under £2.1million in the quarter. Almost 90 per cent of the Labour total - £3,138,443 - came from the unions. That figure is certain to fuel Tory claims that the party is overly influenced by the sector. A Labour spokesman said that its biggest single source of income was membership subscriptions and small donations below the threshold requiring declaration to the commission. The three main parties also came under fire from the watchdog for late reporting of some of their donations - with the Tories and Liberal Democrats also censured over loans reporting. Outstanding loans now totalled £14,789,996, the Commission said. The biggest single donation was £1,493,317 given to Labour by the Unite trade union - with Unison giving another £731,299. Coffers at the SNP were swelled by a surprise gift of nearly £1 million left to it in the will of former national poet Edwin Morgan, who died last year, and another £1 million from Europe's biggest lottery winners, Colin and Chris Weir. The Tories did not bring in any mega-donations during the period - the biggest being a £258,500 boost from Peter Cruddas. Their coalition partners the Liberal Democrats accepted £580,272 from the Methuen Liberal Trust Fund as part of its £1,199,623 total. Labour presently owes almost £10 million in loans, the figures show, compared with £2.7 million for the Tories.","Summer donations totalled £3,529,270 for Labour compared with the Conservatives' £2,744,618 ."
"By . James White . Last updated at 8:19 AM on 23rd November 2011 . Tragic: Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham was killed when he was ejected from an aircraft while it was on the ground at RAF Scampton . A Red Arrows pilot died of multiple injuries after ejecting from his aircraft and landing while still strapped into his seat, an inquest has heard today. Flight Lieutenant Sean James Cunningham, 35, was killed when he was ejected from his Hawk T1 while on the ground at the Red Arrows base at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire on November 8, the coroner at Lincoln Registration Office heard. The inquest was told that Flt Lt Cunningham had completed ground safety checks when the ejector seat of his Hawk jet was deployed. The main parachute did not deploy and the pilot did not become separated from his seat during the incident, the hearing was told. He landed on the ground still strapped into his seat. An ambulance was called and Flt Lt Cunningham was taken to Lincoln County Hospital where he was confirmed dead in A&E at 12.14pm. A post-mortem examination was carried out and the cause of death was given as multiple injuries due to a fall from height following ejection from an aircraft. Toxicology tests were performed and came back negative. After the incident the Ministry of . Defence banned flights by warplanes fitted with the ejector seats . involved in the accident. A full investigation into how the . ejector seat deployed is being carried out and further tests are being . done, the inquest heard. Det Supt Shaun West, from Lincolnshire Police, told the inquest they were investigating the incident and were preparing a file for the coroner. He said there were two critical questions they were investigating - why the ejector seat activated and why the parachute mechanism did not do what it was reasonably expected to. He said they were using experts to help them examine the ejector seat. Paramedics were called to the team's world-famous aerobatics base in . Lincolnshire earlier this month after the incident involving one of the . display team's Hawk T1 aircraft . Grounded: The planes are sealed off by investigators after the shocking incident . Mr West said Lincolnshire Police were . in regular contact with Flt Lt Cunningham's family, none of whom were . present at the hearing. Coroner Stuart Fisher adjourned the inquest to a later date but said it could be 'months' before it is reopened. Military top brass took the decision . to suspend the Hawk, Tornado GR4 and Tucano fleets from the air except . for ‘non-essential’ flying as tributes poured in for the airman. Operations in Afghanistan and the defence of Britain were not be affected but training programmes were hit, said the MoD. The suspension affected RAF aircraft . fitted with Martin Baker Mk 10 ejection seats, which are the Tornado . GR4, the Tucano and the Hawk. According to Martin Baker, the Mk.10 seat is designed in four main units, catapult, main beam structure, seat pan and parachute assembly. On its website, the company says: 'This greatly simplifies and speeds maintenance or cockpit access. 'The seat can be rapidly installed or removed by assembly or disassembly of the main units in the aircraft. 'As the aircraft canopy is not removed, valuable maintenance time is saved.The overall size footprint of the 10L seat has been tailored to suit a large number of aircraft installations. An . independent investigation by the Military Aviation Authority will focus . on whether the accident was caused by a technical malfunction or pilot . error. Flt Lt Cunningham joined the world-renowned Red Arrows last year and flew in air shows over the summer. He . was the second Red Arrows pilot to be killed this year. Flt Lt Jon . Egging, 33, died in August when his jet crashed after an air show in . Bournemouth. Earlier this year, Flt Lt Cunningham told how . he had achieved his schoolboy dream of joining the Red Arrows. Speaking to his local paper in May, he . said: ‘Being on the Red Arrows team has been my dream job and something . I have wanted to do since I can remember. I remember seeing them on the . telly and thinking I want to be able to do that.’ Flt Lt Cunningham qualified for his . private pilot’s licence when he was 17. He joined the RAF in 2000 after . studying electrical and electronic engineering at the University of . Nottingham. Concerns about the ejection seats recurred when Flt Lt Egging was killed after the Bournemouth Air Show in August. Minutes earlier his wife Dr Emma . Egging had watched the breathtaking performance. Witnesses who rushed to . the crash site in a field near the village of Throop found his body . floating in the River Stour with the ejection seat a short distance . away. Flt Lt Cunningham joined the Red Arrows last year at the same time as Flt Lt Egging. He grew up in Binley, near Coventry – 15 miles from the Warwickshire village of Ufton where Flt Lt Egging was raised.

But now Downton Abbey and Strictly Come Dancing are to go head to head on Christmas Day in the annual battle for millions of festive viewers. The broadcasters are placing the smash hit shows at the heart of their festive schedules and will compete to be the most watched programme on December 25. ITV are set to put the ratings-winning drama - starring Hugh Bonneville and Dame Maggie Smith, on at 9pm - while Strictly is set to air in a slightly earlier slot. It's war: ITV and the BBC prepare to go head to head with their most popular shows - Downton Abbey (pictured) and Strictly Come Dancing . This comes as terrestrial broadcasters are expected to air more than 380 hours of repeats between them in the two week period around Christmas Day. BBC1 and BBC2 are between them almost certain to air well in excess of 100 hours of repeats in the fortnight up to December 30, including a Royle Family special and the Two Ronnies. According to the first drafts of festive schedules, ITV will air something like 120 hours of repeats and old films including Santa Clause: The Movie, Polar Express, E.T, Miracle on 34th Street, Towering Inferno, Harry Potter And The Chamber of Secrets and The Railway Children. Channel 5 is also set to break the century mark for repeats over the period, with tens of hours also expected for Channel 4 as well. Festive foxtrot: The BBC will be pulling out all the stops with its Strictly Come Dancing Christmas special - but it will screen the programme earlier than Downton Abbey's 9pm start . These figures are only a start as . channels have yet to finalise what will appear, with a much larger slew . of old shows expected when the time comes. But . amidst all the vintage programming on ITV, the festive instalment of . Downton Abbey is the stand-out programme in its Christmas line-up. While not all details are known about the episode, it will see the introduction of Nigel Havers as the suave Lord Hepworth who is said to bring romantic intrigue to the series, by charming Earl Grantham’s sister Lady Rosamund. Meanwhile, the celebrity edition of Strictly Come Dancing features Hi-De-Hi favourite Su Pollard, boxer Barry McGuigan, singer Simon Webbe,  comedienne Debra Stephenson,  EastEnders’ actress Charlie Brooks. Familiar favourites: Both networks are expected to pad out their festive schedule with repeats of popular programmes, such as ITV's Midsomer Murders (pictured) As tradition requires, ITV is packing . its schedule with repeats of shows like Midsomer Murders, Poirot, Miss . Marple, You’ve Been Framed. Other films are set to include Notting Hill, K-9, Cats and Dogs, Gladiator, Vertigo, Happy Feet, March of The Penguins and King Ralph. The BBC has only released a fraction of its schedule, which apart from children’ s programmes such as Horrible Histories Horrible Christmas also includes repeats of The Two Ronnies Sketchbook and The Royle Family Christmas Special. Observers are predicting that there will be more repeats than ever this year as a result of the financial climate. Among the other shows set to challenge Strictly and Downton Abbey over the Christmas period will be Ray Winstone starring in an adaption of Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations, the Doctor Who Christmas special as well as the soaps EastEnders and Coronation Street. The BBC is also showing adventure film The Borrowers, starring Stephen Fry and Victoria Wood and a re-working of Jim’ll Fix It with Shane Ritchie and an animated version of the hugely popular children’s book, The Gruffalo’s Child.","The smash-hit shows are to be placed at the heart of their festive schedules .

After Owen Thomas was born he was fitted with the endotracheal tube at Stafford Hospital, Staffs, because he was not breathing. This occurred after one of his shoulders became stuck during birth - something referred to as shoulder dystocia. However, staff then failed to remove the 6in-long PVC tube and he struggled to cough it up more than a week later. Owen Thomas sits with his mother Clare and father Kev. The couple brought a claim of clinical negligence against their local NHS trust after son, when he was a baby, coughed up a breathing tube . His parents Clare Thomas, 33, and husband Kev, 35, from Cannock, Staffordshire, have now won a claim of clinical negligence against the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. Owen, four, was not affected long-term by the incident but Mrs Thomas says she believes her son would have died had she not been there when he brought up the tube in February 2007. Mrs Thomas also said she had expressed her concerns about Owen in the first few days of his life but was told by medical staff there was nothing to worry about. 'When Owen was 10 days old, my husband and a friend of mine were visiting me in the specialist care unit at Stafford Hospital,' she said. 'Owen turned blue and looked like he was choking. So I slapped him on the back and this tube came out. 'The nurse took him off me and gave him oxygen as well as checking him over.' She added: 'If I had not been there, I think he would have died - he had gone very blue.' Mrs Thomas decided she did not want to have her second child at Stafford and instead gave birth to daughter Phoebe at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton two years ago. Mrs and Mr Thomas said they believe there have only been two similar incidents worldwide. The couple were awarded a five-figure sum but Mrs Thomas preferred not to reveal the amount. Colin Ovington, director of nursing & midwifery at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We can confirm that this case has been settled.' Stafford Hospital hit the headlines in 2009 when a report was published by the Healthcare Commission that found there were 400 more death than expected at the trust from 2005 to 2008. An independent inquiry in 2010 claimed patients were routinely neglected at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, after it became driven by targets and cost-cutting.",'Owen turned blue and looked like he was choking.

Hope Evans was one of two babies who died in Swansea from a strain of the chronic stomach bug. She was born 'very premature' and contracted the infection while being cared for on a specialist ward. The second baby died in the community, but doctors suspect the child’s mother had caught the infection at the hospital and passed it on at home. Outbreak: Two babies have died after contracting E.Coli and three other people are ill. Health chiefs are investigating how the cross-infection occurred (file pic) Both cases are centred on Singleton Hospital in Swansea. Hope died after contracting the ESBL . E.coli strain, which is resistant to antibiotics and can cause serious . problems for the ‘vulnerable’. Her parents Jeanette and Neil are too upset to speak about their loss, but grandmother Valerie Evans, 66, said: 'They are very distraught - they don't know what is going on. 'We haven't been given any information as to the cause of Hope's death. We've only been told an inquiry is ongoing and they are investigating. 'We need to know the answers of what took Hope away from us.' Mrs Evans said the family was 'unaware' of any link with the other baby and three adults who are also being treated for E.coli at the hospital. Paul Roberts, chief executive of Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said: 'The purpose of the review will be to ensure we have taken all reasonable measures to identify the cause of the cross infection. Deaths: Singleton Hospital in Swansea, South Wales, where baby Hope Evans died. A second baby died 'in the community' but health chiefs believe the cases are linked . 'It will also ensure that the . management of the infections in conjunction with Public Health Wales has . been effective, and that the arrangements put in place for the ongoing . care of mothers and babies are safe and appropriate. 'This review is expected to commence . after we have concluded our own investigation into the two cases of ESBL . E.coli cross infection.' Dr Bruce Ferguson Medical Director of . ABM University Health Board: 'We can confirm there is no evidence of . the infection spreading further, and reiterate that these appear to be . isolated incidents which have been contained. 'Singleton's maternity unit is open as normal for full-term births. 'The temporary precautionary neonatal . unit restriction limiting routine admissions to babies over 36 weeks . gestation is continuing, but this is under constant review and we . anticipate lifting this restriction shortly. NHS chiefs at the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg Health Board said they were aware of five cases of the infection over the past month. It said two of the cases of ESBL . E.coli – normally less serious than the food poisoning strain of E.coli - . are being investigated in the maternity and neonatal unit at Singleton. Hope was born in the hospital on October 31 but never went home after contracting the illness. She died on November 4. Health officials yesterday said a new mother on a maternity ward had contracted the infection but is not seriously ill. A hospital spokesman said: ‘ESBL . E.coli is most often found in the gastrointestinal tract but may cause . urinary tract infections. ‘It is resistant to commonly used antibiotics such as penicillin, but can be treated.’ Dr Bruce Ferguson, medical director, . said: ‘Tests have confirmed that in one of these cases the ESBL E.coli . infection was contracted in the hospital. 'Sadly, this was a very premature baby who, despite the best efforts of staff, later died. ‘The cause of death of this baby is . currently being investigated by the coroner. Everyone involved with the . unit and in the care of this baby deeply regret this tragic loss.’ Dr Ferguson added: ‘These appear to be . isolated incidents which have been contained, and there is no evidence . of the infection spreading further. ‘Checks have been taken of patients, . equipment and areas in the maternity-neonatal unit and no evidence of . ESBL E.coli has been found. The unit has an excellent record for hand . hygiene and general infection control adherence.’ Extra precautions have been taken at . the hospital which include carrying out a ‘deep clean’ at the obstetric . theatres and increasing cleaning in the neonatal and labour wards. The doctor said: ‘As a precaution, we . have temporarily restricted the neonatal unit to admissions for babies . of 36 weeks and over gestation. 'We would like to reassure expectant . mothers due to give birth in Singleton Hospital that the maternity unit . is open as usual for full-term births.’ According to the Health Protection . Agency, there are between 2,000 and 2,500 cases of ESBL E.coli every . year in England, most of which affect the elderly. Any concerned mothers-to-be are advised to speak to their midwife first but a helpline has also been set up on 0774 761 5627. What is E. coli?Escherichia coli is a type of bacterium found in the intestines of humans and other animals and forms part of the normal gut flora. However, some strains can cause serious food poisoning and infection. While most people are affected with short-term diarrhoea, E. coli bacteria can cause the bladder infection cystitis and more serious complications, such as haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS). This is a serious disorder of the digestive system, which produces toxic substances that can get into the blood stream and cause kidney disease. Where do the E.coli bacteria come from?Most people carry harmless strains of E. coli in their intestine. Both these and the strains that cause diarrhoea come from contaminated food or water. It can also be passed from animals to people and person-to-person through hand to mouth. What about ESBL?The latest E.coli outbreak involves the ESBL strain - a milder strain than E. coli 0157 which causes food poisoning. ESBL infects around 30,000 people in England and Wales each year and causes no harm in most. However, it can cause infections in vulnerable people such as babies and the elderly and is difficult to treat as it is resistant to antibiotics. Patients with the strain can develop urinary tract infections that in turn can develop into deadly septicaemia (blood poisoning). How do you stop E.coli it spreading?Good hygiene is very important in preventing person-to person spread and small children should be supervised with hand washing after using the toilet and before eating.It is always advisable to wash fruits and vegetables before you eat them. Peeling or cooking fruit and vegetables can also remove germs. Also be careful not to swallow water while swimming in lakes or ponds.","Cases centre on Singleton Hospital in Swansea, Wales .

Widow Judy Collins, 72, found decorations had been removed when she turned up to pay her respects. In place of her late husband Harry's memorial was a mound of mud, she claimed. Memorial: The grave of Second World War hero Harry Collins as it used to look before council workers stripped it bare in a dispute over the plot's ownership . Barren: This is how widow Judy Collins found the grave on one of her weekly visits, reduced to a 'mound of mud' with the cross and decorations removed . Judy, who has visited the grave every week for the last 23 years, even found the cross bearing his name had been taken away. The council said it removed the items because its records showed the grave was ‘unpurchased'. They say they put up notices in the area saying graves at the cemetery not owned by relatives would be cleared away. Disrespectful: Harry Collins (pictured), who served as an army mechanic in the Second World War, died in 1988 . But the family of Mr Collins - who served as an army mechanic in the Second World War - insist they were never informed. And they claim his plot was paid for by the Co-operative Funeral Directors when he was buried at the cemetery on May 25, 1988. Daughter June Collins said her mother was on one of her weekly visits to the grave when she found the items were 'bagged up' in council sacks and left in a shed. June said: 'We have been looking after the grave and putting flowers on it every week without fail for 23 years. 'My mum has been left very distressed by this. A wooden cross made by my sister Linda’s partner has been ruined.' Miss Collins said the family met council officials and claim they were told there is no record of the grave plot being paid for. She said the authority told the family that notifications were placed on 'unpaid' graves and letters sent to families. June, from Portsmouth, Hants, added: 'We haven’t received anything from the council and there wasn’t a notice on my dad’s grave. It could have blown off. 'The council said they have no record of mum owning the grave and have it listed as ‘common’, which means they can bury someone else on it.' Distressed: Mr Collins's daughter June (right) visits the now-empty graveside at Warblington Cemetery in Hampshire with her niece Jade Finch . The council confirmed the plot is one of 2,756 listed as 'unpurchased' at Warblington Cemetery, near Havant, Hants, and said decorations recently started appearing on it. A spokeswoman for Havant Borough Council said: 'Prior to removing these items, we attached a sign to the area asking for those who had been visiting to make contact with us. 'After the time had lapsed for the visitors to make contact, the decorations were carefully removed and stored in a safe place.' Graham Lymn, head of operations for The Southern Co-operative End of Life Services, said it has offered to pay half of the cost for purchasing the plot. He said: 'We, nor the council, have been able to find records going back to 1988. It’s difficult to say what may have happened nearly 25 years ago.'","Widow devastated to find 'mound of mud' in place of memorial .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 2:07 PM on 25th November 2011 . A young mother has written an open letter to a burglar who ransacked her family home telling them they are a ‘coward’ and wishing them ‘sadness’ and ‘misfortune’. Mother-of-two Angie Sowton pinned the note to lampposts in her area so the criminal would know how hurt they had been by the break-in. The letter comes days after another 16-year-old burglar wrote to his victim that he was ‘not bothered or sorry' after ransacking their property. A householder hits back: Angie Sowton wishes 'sadness, misfortune and the dark days you so rightly deserve' on the person who burgled her home . The teenager, who broke into a property in Moortown, Leeds, even hit out at the family for their ‘dumb mistakes’ in making their property a target for thieves. But, following a raid on her south London home, Mrs Sowton, 34, has decided to hit back at the burglar in an open letter. Her husband Chris, 34, returned home to discover the kitchen window had been broken and their south London property had been ransacked, the Daily Telegraph reported. In the letter she wrote to the thief: ‘You saw the photographs of our childrens' innocent faces and were still able to steal from them. We will never understand the kind of person that makes you.’ Mrs Sowton, 33, was out at an art gallery with her daughters Olivia, three, and Amy, one, when the break-in happened. Anger: Angie Sowton, a former schoolteacher, with her daughters Olibia and Amy. She posted her letter on lampposts in the neighbourhood after the break-in . Writeback: A woman reads the message which Angie Sowton wrote for the burglar who broke in while she was at an art gallery with her children . Two Christening necklaces given to her children, a ring given by Mrs Sowton’s in-laws, an iPod and a laptop were stolen. The thief also tore open Christmas presents and took a bottle of champagne from the fridge. She addressed the letter to the ‘coward who burgled our home’. Mrs Sowton, who used to work as a schoolteacher, added: ‘The few pounds you make from stealing ours and our childrens’ hard earned, beloved and sentimental possessions will bring you sadness, misfortune and the dark days you rightly deserve. ‘The love and sentiments attached to the items you took, you will never understand. Hit out: Thief writes to his victim that he is 'not bothered or sorry about the fact that I burgled your house' ‘However our love and our children will bring us to terms with what you have done to our family and are everything  you are not and could never be.’ The letter was signed off ‘A hard working young family.’ Mrs Sowton told the Daily Telegraph that she felt better to have written the letter – so that the thief or thieves know what they have done. She said: ‘It was a bit of therapy for myself and a hope that it might evoke a pang of guilt in them. ‘I want them to see it and I want them to know how much hurt they have caused. I want them to know it was personal. It wasn't just some anonymous possessions from an anonymous house. ‘We haven't got lots of money. All our money goes to pay the mortgage and most of the things that have gone were gifts. The family are insured so will not be left out of pocket following the break-in.","Mother-of-two Angie Sowton, 34, wrote: 'You saw the photographs of our childrens' innocent faces and were still able to seal from them'

A family of drug dealers and their associates who peddled heroin and crack cocaine on the streets of Liverpool have been jailed for a total of 82 years. Thirteen people involved in running a 24-hour drugs cash and carry service have been jailed after a complex police operation. Police put the family under surveillance and deployed undercover officers before eventually swooping on the Whitney family clan and their cohorts. Scroll down for video . Behind bars: Leslie Whitney, 57 . Jailed: Lisa Whitney, 31 . Custody: Carol Whitney, 54 . Jailed: Ringleader Paul Whitney, 32, was given nine years and four months behind bars while and Matthew Mayor, 37, hurled £47,000 worth of drugs out of a car window as he tried to escape police . As the net closed on the drug dealers, officers found an SA80 assault rifle which had been stolen from army barracks on Salisbury Plain in 2005 and around 1,200 rounds of ammunition as well as a large quantity of Class A substances. Undercover officers from Merseyside Police posed as addicts to make 'test purchases' to gain the . necessary evidence as undercover officers filmed the footage. Seized: An Army SA80 rifle which was stolen from Salisbury Plain in 2005 with some of the ammunition recovered by police . Drugs find: These pills were part of the haul belonging to the Whitney family which were discovered by police . The Whitneys used unregistered, . pre-paid mobile telephones and deployed untraceable vehicles to . rendezvous with addicts, often in a telephone kiosk on a street corner. One undercover officer, known as Ray, . obtained a mobile number from a female addict which soon became known . as the 'Whitney line'. Ringleader Paul Whitney, his accomplices . Michael O'Toole and Matthew Mayor, together with other family members . Leslie Whitney, 57 and now estranged wife Carol Whitney, 54, were . prominent players in the conspiracy that plagued the streets of Anfield, . Tuebrook and West Derby between 2009 and this year, Liverpool Crown Court heard. Custody: Mary McCabe . Prison: Thomas Dowd . Behind bars: Gary Edwards . Ringleader Paul Whitney, 32, was given nine years and four months behind bars. Matthew Mayor, 37, who threw £47,000 of drugs out of a car window, was given eight years and four months. Banker and matriarch Carol Whitney, 53, was sentenced to eight years. Mary McCabe, 53, was given the same term. Michael O'Toole, 33, was jailed for eight years and Leslie Whitney, 57, was given seven-and-a-half years. Michael Waters, 25, was told he must serve five years and four months in prison and Neil Brady, 35, received five years and four months. Wayne Hincks, 28, received six years and eight months in prison. Lisa Whitney, 31, and Gary Edwards, 48, were given four years. Thomas Dowd, 29, was ordered to serve four years and four months. Emma Mackenzie, 29, was also jailed for two years and three months. In a desperate attempt to escape police, clan member Matthew Mayor, 37, hurled one kilo packets of cocaine out the window of his Mercedes S320 as he was chased down by surveillance teams in December last year. The packets split as they hit the road - showering the carriageway with £47,000 worth of drugs. After weaving in and out of rush-hour traffic and crossing the central reservation he was eventually cornered and arrested. Mother Emma Mackenzie, 29, tried to hide . cocaine wraps in the nappy bag of her young child, then aged under 12 . months, as she passed the toddler to her own mum, Mary McCabe, during a . police raid on her home in Anfield. When police arrested grandmother Carol Whitney, who was the matriarch and banker, officers found more than 500 wraps of heroin hanging from a bush in her garden. Judge John Roberts, sitting at Liverpool Crown Court, jailed them all for their role in the conspiracy. Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Doherty from the Merseyside Police Matrix team said the family - who were on incapacity benefits - were making a lot of money out of their drug deals. 'We took out for example 12 kilo of heroin which was plum cut. This has made heroin certainly more scarce in that area,' he said. Custody: Wayne Hincks, 28, received six years and eight months while Neil Brady, 35, must do five years and four months behind bars . Behind bars: Michael O'Toole, 33, was given eight years and Michael Waters, 25, was told he must serve five years and four months . 'There were seven actual members of the Whitney family involved and there were their associates as well. 'It's not an unusual situation and the family were doing very well. The matriarch in it was on £5,000-a-year benefits but she was able to take large mortgages out and about £114,000 had gone through her account in just 12 months so it was very profitable for them. He added: 'We watched this family and there were people calling all hours of the day and nice cars outside the house. Bear in mind all they had was invalidity benefit. 'If you see people who aren't working who have nice cars who have houses that they can't possible afford then let us know who they are. 'We will have a look at them and if they are the same as this family we will do the same to them, we will put them where they belong.' Sinister: The rifle is standard-issue for soldiers in the British Army . Ammunition: Police discovered 1,200 rounds of ammunition as they carried out raids at addresses across Liverpool .

Leafing through a regional newspaper's classified adverts, a reader normally expects to find babysitters, cleaners and gardeners touting their services. But one jilted lover used the section to take her revenge on a cheating partner. Hidden among adverts for a snooker table and a single bed an advert read 'Useless piece of cheating male Michael McCartan'. The entry was titled 'Erdington Librarian'. Directly beneath the piece in the Birmingham Mail was another advert for a 'male cheater £0'. Both entries contained the same local phone number. The adverts are believed to have been missed by the regional newspaper's classified section editorial team. 'I couldn't believe it when I was flicking through Tuesday's paper at work,' said 37-year-old mother-of-two Julie Wood. 'You don't expect to see something like that in the ""bargain"" buy section. Whoever put the advert in must have been pretty angry. 'I can understand why she did it, if he has cheated on her then I would want to get my own back and humiliate him too. 'Mind you, an advert in the local paper would be the least of my husband's worries if he had an affair.' Speaking to MailOnline, a man at Erdington Library who identified himself as Michael McCartan said he did not like 'malicious rumours' being spread about him. He said: 'I am aware of the advert. I don't know why it was put in there. I didn't know people could put adverts in the paper like that and I'm going to get in touch and make a complaint because I don't like malicious rumours being spread about me.' When pushed further and asked if he was a married man he said 'thank you for your time' and hung up.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:16 AM on 25th November 2011 . Tragic: Margaret Nicholl, pictured with her husband Richard, was thrown from her bike after hitting a pothole at 35mph . A retired civil servant was killed when she was thrown from her bike after hitting a deep pothole, an inquest heard yesterday. Margaret Nicholl, 67, was on a country ride with husband Richard, 70, when they sped down a hill. Mr Nicholl noticed five deep  craters at the side of the road and shouted a warning to his wife. Seconds later she hit one of the ruts . at 35mph and continued for several yards before falling off. She was not . wearing a helmet and suffered massive head injuries, dying ten days . later in hospital. The . inquest at Wells Coroner’s Court in Somerset heard that the potholes had . been there for at least four months and the road was overdue for . inspection. Mr Nicholl told . the hearing he and his wife had been keen cyclists for more than half a . century and usually cycled up to 4,000 miles a year. They had been cycling for three miles when they approached the hill in Shepton Montague, Somerset, at around 10am on March 12. He said: ‘As we went over the brow of the hill I saw some potholes. I was slightly ahead of Margaret and to her right. ‘I pointed with my left hand and shouted “potholes”. Within two  seconds I heard a bang and I am sure she hit a pothole. ‘I then heard a dull thud as if she had fallen off her bike. I saw Margaret lying in the road still astride her bike. I went back to her and saw she was unconscious.’ An inquest into Mrs Nicholl's death heard that along with husband Richard, the couple cycled up to 4,000 miles each year . Scene: The pothole which Mrs Nicholl hit is marked with an orange box. A drinks can placed inside indicates that the pothole was quite large . PC David Horsley, of Avon and Somerset police, went to the scene shortly after the accident and measured the gradient of the hill to be nine per cent or one in 11. He found five large potholes, with the largest measuring 39 inches (100cm) long, 19 inches (49cm) wide and three inches (8cm) deep. The final pothole - measuring 26 inches (67cm) long, nearly 12 inches wide (30cm) wide and 2.5 inches (6cm) deep - had tyre tracks in mud on it which matched those of Margaret’s bike. Phillip Kingdom, highways inspection manager for Somerset, said he was not surprised that the road was in such a bad state of repair. Mrs Nicholl was rushed to the Royal United Hospital in Bath following the pothole accident, but sadly did not survive . ‘We went through one of the most severe winters I have known. We were experiencing potholes all over the county. ‘We had 25,000 potholes last year in the county, which was a record. There was no extra money available at the time.’ Verdict: Accidental death.",Margaret Nicholl sustained massive head injuries after hitting pothole .

Hannaleigh Michelle Suttles, eight, and Zachary Lee Smith, 14, were gunned down by Mary Ann Holder, 36, in Greensboro, North Carolina. Holder shot six people in total - her two sons, niece, nephew, ex-lover and one of her son's girlfriends - before turning the gun on herself. Scroll down for video . 'Blessing': Hanna Suttles, left, and Zachary Smith, right, were gunned down by Smith's mother, Mary Ann Holder. But they went on to save the lives of 12 others . Hanna, Holder's niece, saved five lives with her organs. Zachary, Holder's son, saved seven. Holder's nephew Richard Suttles, 17, whom . she was raising with Hanna, remains in critical condition with gunshot . wounds to the head. A family spokesman told Fox 8 News that the boy would be taken off life support as soon as matching organ recipients were found. 'Like the saying goes, out of tragedy comes something,' Deputy Durand Dulin of the Guilford County Sheriff's Office told ABC News. Rampage: Zachary Smith is pictured with his mother, Mary Ann Holder, who shot him and his older brother dead. She also killed her niece and son's girlfriend . Victims: Holder shot her son Robert Smith, 17, and his girlfriend Makayla Woods, 15, as they slept. Makayla's family turned off her life support on Wednesday . 'It's just so sad that so many lives had to be taken for someone else to survive. But it is a blessing.' Holder had been having an affair with . Randy Lamb, 40, for almost four years, and it was coming to a bitter . end when she arranged to meet him at a community college parking . lot on Sunday. Police say she shot him in the shoulder and he was expected to recover. Holder . then drove to meet Zachary. Nearly half an hour after a 911 . call from Lamb's wife, a sheriff's deputy spotted Holder's black SUV. Mourning: A parent and students console each other over the loss of their friends during a prayer meeting at Pleasant Garden First Baptist Church on Monday . Holder was found dead inside with a gunshot to the head, and Zachary was critically wounded in the back seat. Officers then went to her home and found the other victims. They appeared to have been shot while they slept in a bedroom and the home's living room. Her older son Robert Smith, 17, was found dead at the scene. His girlfriend Makayla Woods, 15, was in critical condition but died Wednesday after her life support was switched off. Holder left two notes at her home, but police would not reveal the contents. Remembered: Friend Brad Durham erects a memorial in front of the house where Holder allegedly shot one of her sons, his girlfriend, a niece and nephew . Empty: Police discovered the bodies in a bedroom and the living room . The day before the rampage, she had given Lamb a $10,000 check written to his wife. It is believed to be an out-of-court settlement for an 'alienation of . affection' lawsuit the wife threatened to file, a spokesman for the . Guilford County Sheriff’s Office told the Daily News. 'I worked the day of the shootings and it was hard to conceive that anything like that would happen,' said Dulin. 'There . just aren't any words to thank the recipients. Everybody is really . praying for the family, not just the victims but the survivors, too. They have to live with that -- and it's hard, especially on the kids.' Three-tiered shooting: Police believe Mary Ann Holder shot victims at three locations throughout North Carolina before turning the gun on herself in her car . With . few child deaths and a lack of awareness about organ donation, more . than 1,900 children under the age of 18 still sit on the national . waiting list. More than 110,000 people are waiting for life-saving organ transplants nationally, according to the Carolina Donor Services. 'Meaning': Christina Taylor Green died after an assassination attempt on Congresswoman Giffords. She saved one life and the sight of two others . Of those, 3,400 are in North Carolina. More than 28,000 waiting for transplants were helped in 2010. One person can save up to eight lives with their transplantable organs, which include the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, pancreas, small intestines. Tissue donations can benefit up to 50 people. When Congresswoman . Gabrielle Giffords was shot last year, the youngest vicitim, . nine-year-old Christina Taylor Green donated her organs in one of the most high-profile cases of its kind. The organs saved the life of a little girl in Boston and brought sight to two other children in Arizona. 'It was a blessing when we heard about the children,' her mother Roxanna Green told ABCNews.com last year. 'It gives us some comfort that Christina would have wanted this. She didn't think twice about this. 'We are so honored we could help these children. It can bring meaning and comfort at a time of incredible loss.'

The Occupy Black Friday movement, which promises disruptive flash mobs, consumer zombies and carol singing over the course of today's sales, seems to be no match for the consumer might of thousands of bargain hunters who have turned up at stores in force. The group, which has formed on the back of the Occupy Wall Street protests, hopes to persuade shoppers to buy local and turn their backs on mega retailers. But at Macy's Herald Square in New York, just four activists chanted 'boycott Macy's' and 'stop supporting big corporations' as around 9,000 people queued to shop at the landmark department store this morning. Occupy Black Friday: Just four activists attempted to dissuade 9,000 Macy's shoppers from bargain-hunting in New York early this morning . Diluted effort: The largely uncoordinated efforts of the mini-movement have so far proved to be no match for the 152 million shoppers predicted to hit stores this weekend . Stores across the U.S. continue to brace . themselves for potential unrest as protesters from the Occupy Wall . Street movement urge people to either forgo the annual retail frenzy, or to support smaller, local stores. While there is little evidence of direct action so far today, each mini-protest promises some kind of surprise action on the day . after Thanksgiving, which marks the traditional start of the holiday . shopping season in the U.S. But with thousands of shoppers turning out to find great deals this holiday, it looks as though U.S retailers are set to attract the National Retail Federation's predicted 152 million shoppers over the course of the holiday. Happy camping: Shoppers camp out at Best Buy for Black Friday in Pembroke Pines, Florida . Camping for bargains: Shoppers wait for midnight at a Best Buy store at Santee, California . Waiting for goods: These shoppers erected themselves a canape to shelter from the elements . Ready: Barbara Riccelli, Vicki Hawkins, Robert King and Vicki Lawrence (left to right) sit outside their tents while camping out outside the Best Buy store waiting for when the store opens at midnight in Mesquite, Texas . While shoppers camped outside stores in eagerness, groups going under the names Occupy . Black Friday and Stop Black Friday said they would focus efforts on . Target, Wal-Mart and Dick's Sporting Goods, though the net covers most . major name retailers. Their . actions are uncoordinated but hold similar themes of supporting small . businesses while criticising the day's dedication to consumption and the . shopping frenzy that fuels big corporations. In Seattle, protesters said they would drive to Wal-Mart stores to protest with other Occupy groups from around Washington state. Washington D.C. is offering a ‘really, really free market,’ where people can donate items they don't want so others can go gift shopping for free. Demonstrations: Protesters are driving to Wal-Mart stores to protest with other Occupy groups on Friday . Boredom: These shoppers in Santee, California are among thousands willing to sit out and wait for deals . Elsewhere the 75-person encampment in . Boise, Idaho, planned to send ‘consumer zombies’ to wander around in . silent protest of what they view as unnecessary spending. In Chicago, protesters are planning to serenade shoppers with revamped Christmas carols about buying local. Fears that shoppers camping out for Black Friday deals may secretly be Ocuupy Wall Street demonstrators have prompted some stores to demand tents are removed. The annual tradition of bargain hunters hoping to be first in line is thought to be the perfect pretext for the anti-capitalist protesters to set up a permanent encampment outside businesses. One of the stores - Best Buy in Roseville, California, claimed that having tents in front of the store is a liability issue. But, as this has not been the case in previous years, those now forced to huddle up with only blankets and each other for warmth, are convinced the protests have caused the change of heart. The Des Moines, Iowa, group plans flash mobs at three malls in an attempt to get people to think about what they're buying. ‘We didn't want to guilt-trip people at a mall,’ Occupy Des Moines organiser Ed Fallon said. ‘We wanted to get at them in a playful, friendly way, to support local businesses.’ Protesters say the movement should not take away money and seasonal jobs from the working-class majority it purports to represent. They want the corporations to be the . focus of any protests. But organisers do hope their actions drive people . to reconsider shopping at national chains and go to small locally-owned . stores instead. That may . not fly with small businesses wary of any association with the movement, . which presents itself as pushing back against corporate power. ‘If you ask, a lot of small business . owners identify as business owners, not specifically small business,’ Jean Card, of the National Federation of Independent Business, said. ‘I would like to believe there is a . silver lining, but I don't picture a frustrated consumer that can't get . into a box store turning around and going to a small business. I see . that person going home.’ Online shopping: Staff at an 800,000 sq ft Amazon centre in Britain process orders as they prepare their busiest time of the year as Black Friday begins in America and Cyber Monday follows in the UK . Trying to shop exclusively local neglects . economies of scale, job specialisation and other benefits that big, . multi-state corporations can bring, said George Mason University . economist Russ Roberts. 'I don't picture a frustrated consumer that can't get into a box store turning around and going to a small business. I see that person going home' Jean Card, National Federation of Independent Business . ‘Don't punish yourself by not shopping where you can get the best deal - that's foolish,’ he said. Small businesses are not necessarily better employers in terms of wages, benefits, opportunities for advancement and other measures, said North Carolina public policy research expert John Quinterno. He calculates small ‘mom-and-pops’, which he defines as businesses with fewer than 10 employees, account for nearly 80 per cent of employer firms in the U.S., but only about 11 per cent of the jobs. It's all good: A joke sign is seen at an entrance to the Occupy Portland camp last month, with protesters asking shoppers to occupy something besides door-buster sales and crowded aisles of big-box stores . Crazily busy: People shop at the Times Square Toys 'R' Us for Black Friday sales in New York last year . ‘Sometimes we romanticise small business - and I say this as a small business owner myself - so that it skews some of our debates about economic and labour policy,’ Mr Quinterno said. ‘It doesn't mean they aren't important. It just means that larger businesses tend to create a lot more . value-added per job,’ the principal of public policy research firm South . by North Strategies said. 'Don't punish yourself by not shopping where you can get the best deal - that's foolish' Russ Roberts, George Mason University . The protests are largely focused on shopping areas in affluent suburbs home to big chain stores. As with the entire movement, the protests bring with them a litany of causes. In addition to protests of big chains, causes include clothes made from animal fur, McDonald's, homelessness and, in Las Vegas, the low gambling taxes paid by casinos. The formula is ideal for the Occupy protests - many of whom have faced evictions from large-scale encampments in recent weeks. With a large number of people in a confined space, the Black Friday protests present one of the earliest tests for the movement in its new, fragmented iteration. Sales: A woman looks at a DKNY display in New York - the city where the Occupy movement began . Most protests plan to make a point and move on - a strategy they have implemented in some cities with targeted marches for specific causes since the camps were broken up. 'Sometimes we romanticise small business - and I say this as a small business owner myself - so that it skews some of our debates about economic and labour policy' John Quinterno, South by North Strategies . ‘It's not about specific occupation camps anymore,’ said protester Peter Morales of Austin, Texas. ‘It's more of, you know, real awareness of what's going on in our government.’ Another shop local movement, Small Business Saturday, was started last year to encourage people to shop at small businesses on the day after Black Friday. But the Occupy groups are underwhelmed as this movement was started by American Express. Last year, small retailers that accept American Express saw a 28 per cent increase in sales volume on Small Business Saturday from the same day the year before, the company says. ‘It's just another example of the banks and Wall Street trying to take the very real desires of working people to have a humane economic system and twisting it to their ends,’ said Peter Rickman of Occupy Milwaukee. Camped out: Vicki Lawrence, left, in Mesquite, Texas, and Brent Hart, right, with his son Aidan in Fairfax, Virginia, are ready for the Best Buy sales . Pam Newman, 30, of Louisville, Kentucky, knows well the trappings of Black Friday. 'Look, some people have printed out the deals two weeks ago. We're not getting to them. While we would like to dissuade the folks camping out and ""occupying"" Wal-Mart, they've already made their mind up. We're looking for the shoppers on the fence' Pam Newman, Occupy Louisville . A former Best Buy employee, she would watch troves of wild-eyed shoppers kick, claw and scrape their ways to holiday deals and is now coy with the details of the Occupy Louisville protest. ‘There are some plans I can't talk about,’ she said, but added the focus will be on people who have not made up their minds. ‘Look, some people have printed out the deals two weeks ago.

The Harry Potter author said her . family was the constant target of paparazzi and described her fury after . a journalist slipped a letter into her daughter’s schoolbag. The mother of three told the Leveson . Inquiry into Press standards how the  letter was hidden in the . five-year-old’s bag at primary school. 'Hounded': JK Rowling said she felt 'under siege' from the Press after being 'driven out' of her home due to media attention . She and actress Sienna Miller gave  evidence about the impact of Press intrusion in their private lives. Layer Cake actress Miss Miller, 29, . told how she had falsely accused her own family and friends of betraying . her by leaking secrets about her. Testimony: JK Rowling arrives back at her hotel last night after giving evidence into her experience of press practices at the Leveson Inquiry . She has since received £100,000 in . damages from the News of the World after she discovered its investigator . Glenn Mulcaire had hacked her phone and emails. Miss Rowling, 46, said she and her . family were driven out of their home and deterred from taking family . holidays because of the constant presence of photographers. The multi-millionaire, who has . previously been targeted by a stalker, said she did not want her family . to live under an ‘invisibility cloak’, like the one used by Harry Potter . in her novels. Miss Rowling, who gave her evidence . using her full name Joanne Kathleen Rowling, said she had taken action . against newspapers 50 times over breaches of privacy and misreporting, . and had been forced to cover her children in blankets to hide them from . photographers. She could barely contain her fury as she described finding a letter from a journalist inside her young daughter’s bag. ‘I unzipped her schoolbag in the . evening, and among the usual letters from school and the debris that . every child generates, I found an envelope and a letter addressed to me . from a journalist. ‘I can only say that I felt such a . sense of invasion. It is very difficult to say how angry I felt that my . five-year-old daughter’s school was no longer a place of complete . security from journalists.’ Miss Rowling, who lives in rural . Scotland, said she had made numerous complaints about covert photographs . of her and her children. She said she felt the Press Complaints . Commission was inadequate. She also said her complaints to newspapers were sometimes . ignored or treated with scorn. However Miss Rowling agreed that newspaper publicity had helped to sell her novels and promote the subsequent films. 'Scared': Sienna Miller, pictured on her way to the inquiry yesterday morning, said she had been intimidated by press attention . Miss Miller said her personal  relationships had been damaged by her paranoia that those in her innermost circle were leaking stories about her to the News of the World. She was catapulted to fame after beginning a relationship with Jude Law which threatened to overshadow her own acting career. Miss Miller was ‘baffled’ about how the now defunct newspaper had obtained the information, she said, and confronted her mother, sister and two of her best friends. ‘I accused my family and people who would never dream of selling information about me,’ she told the inquiry. She said: ‘I was 21 and I would find myself at midnight, running down a dark street on my own with ten big men chasing me. ‘The fact they had cameras meant that was legal, but if you take away the cameras you have a pack of men chasing a woman and that’s obviously a very intimidating situation.’ Evidence: Sienna Miller was speaking to the Leveson Inquiry into press standards yesterday morning .","Author said she has taken action against the press more than 50 times over breaches of privacy and misreporting .

She can deal, she can shuffle, she even knows how to bluff, but what makes Alexa Fisher’s talent unique is that she is only eight-years-old. Having learnt to play poker at the age of just three, she is now taking on experienced card sharks more than seven times her age and is thought to be the youngest poker player in the world. A poker magazine has dubbed her a 'child prodigy' and she can play over 50 varieties of the game, making her a veritable threat on the poker scene in her home town in Texas. The Texan that can hold'em: Alexa Fisher might only be eight-years-old but she can deal, shuffle and knows how to bluff . She even snubbed Disneyland last year, instead begging her parents to take her to Las Vegas to hunt autographs at the World Series of Poker tournaments. There she got an autograph from professional Greg Raymer on her hat that reads, 'See you in 2024!', which is when she will finally be of legal age to enter the WSOP herself. At home in Cibolo, near San Antonio, she takes on grown men at the game they have been playing for decades, frequently pummelling the competition in weekly charity contests. And her father Justin, 35, a house husband and fellow poker enthusiast, thinks his daughter could be the next big thing in professional poker. In the game: Alexa Fisher pictured competing in a charity tournament . He said: ‘I know Alexa could play poker with the best players in the world and definitely hold her own. ‘I also know she would be more than comfortable playing the professionals at the large buy-in events that many top name players are known for. ‘When Alexa was three, I would have . ESPN and poker shows on in the background and she was attracted to the . clapping and the sounds of people being happy on the television. ‘I used playing cards to help her count and to help with her maths skills when she was young and before she attended school. ‘As . she began to learn which cards were higher, such as the aces, kings, . queens and jacks in relation to the numbers, plus recognising what a . pair, a flush, a three of a kind were, it was time to get poker chips.’ Next came plastic playing cards, chips with values on them and a dealer button. By the age of four, she was shuffling, dealing, learning about basic tell signs and bluffing strategies. By age five, she knew No-Limit Texas Hold'em solidly. From there, Justin introduced her to . other games, such as Limit and Pot Limit, and by the age of six, she . knew all of the WSOP games, along with Badugi, Double Flop Hold'em, . Crazy Pineapple, and ace-to-five and triple-draw Lowball. Alexa . has since played in several charity poker tournaments where players pay . to enter or donate to local charities in order to circumvent local . gambling laws. She played her first ever live poker tournament charity event at the age of seven. She set an age record at her first live tournament in 2009, outlasting well over half the field - including her father - and becoming an instant local celebrity. During a tournament poker charity event last year she ended up making the final table that evening and finishing in 6th place. She said: ‘The neat thing about poker is there are a lot of games to choose from and they are easy to learn and play. Idols: Alexa snubbed meeting Mickey and Minnie Mouse at Disneyland, to instead meet her poker idol Greg Raymer (right) at the World Series of Poker tournament in Vegas . World series: She begged her parents to take her to Las Vegas to hunt autographs at the World Series of Poker tournaments (library image) ‘I know how to shuffle and deal the cards, raise, check, fold, and bluff. I also know how to play deuce-to-seven Lowball, H.O.R.S.E., and Badugi. ‘I can now play any poker game with the best poker players in the world. ‘With me being a girl, when I am a professional poker player I hope I can inspire other girls and women to play poker too.’ As far as her parents know, Alexa does not play poker with her schoolmates, but she is allowed to play for money - her cash allowance for doing chores around the house - because it teaches her money management. They gave her some money to start with, and now she has a bank account. Her first win from a major cash game was $42, and her first loss was $25, while in Vegas. Ultimately Alexa's ambition is to be a professional poker player, and her parents are more than happy to encourage the youngster to follow her dreams. In addition, Alexa juggles poker with rock climbing, Zumba classes, football and weekly volleyball practices.","Alexa Fisher started playing poker aged three and now takes on card sharks seven times her age .

The novel idea will run between Black Friday and New Year’s Day at Short Pump Town Center in Virginia and Promenade Temecula in California. New idea: Two U.S. malls in California and Virginia are launching a trial to track shopper's movements through their mobile phone signals (file picture) Forest City Commercial Management, which manages both malls, will not hold personal data as everything tracked is anonymous, reported CNN. With millions of Americans being worked up into a sweat over potential bargains to be had on Black Friday, scientists have come up with the perfect way of working out what excites them the most. Wearing perspiration-sensitive brace, 50 shoppers in Los Angeles, Boston and Atlanta were monitored by experts from the Massechusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab. The information they retrieve will then be sold on to retailers, who are always keen to find out what makes people spend. Crucially, the bracelet wearers will shop both in store and online – allowing firms to discover what difference –if any – it makes to the buying experience. It measures movement, body temperature and electrodermal activity – barely noticeable changes in skin sweat levels, the Wall Street Journal reported. If a shopper’s excited or frustrated, electrodermal activity will go up. If they’re relaxed or bored, it will go down. ‘We won't be looking at singular shoppers,’ Forest City’s Stephanie Shriver-Engdahl told CNN. ‘The system monitors patterns of movement. ‘We can see, like migrating birds, where people are going to,’ she added, saying they have no need to know anybody’s phone number or identity. Shopping centres have previously tracked the movement of people - but mobile phones have never been used to achieve this. Customers do not have to participate . in the trial - but they will have to turn off their phones to make sure . they aren't involved, reported CNN. Signs around the malls are already . warning people about the system, which works through a number of . strategically-positioned antennas.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:48 PM on 25th November 2011 . John Ransford, chief executive of the Local Government Association, described his £300,000 pay packet as 'peanuts' The outgoing head of the quango that acts as a mouthpiece for town halls has described his £300,000 salary as 'peanuts'. John Ransford, who quit as the chief executive of the Local Government Association earlier this month, receives a total pay and pension package of £302,840. He claimed this was 'not particularly out of line' with the salaries earned by other executive staff in the public sector. However, he claimed it would be regarded as 'peanuts' by high-earners in finance and private industry. But the 63-year-old added: 'I don't regard it as peanuts, I regard it as high pay.' Mr Ransford's salary of more than £300,000 is more than double the Prime Minister's salary and £70,000 higher than it was last year. His salary in 2009 was £193,923. This was increased in 2010 to £245,612 - a rise of more than 25 per cent. This is because he was promoted from deputy chief executive. Details of his rapid salary increases came to light earlier this year when the Local Government Association published a report on high-earners within its ranks. Local Government Minister Grant Shapps then called for Mr Ransford to 'lead from the front' by taking a 10 per cent pay cut and 30 top councillors publicly criticised his remuneration package. 'This report is a devastating exposé of how fat cat pay has spiralled out of control in local government,' he said at the time. 'It seems many councils have taken their eye off the ball.' But Mr Ransford this week told the Guardian that none of his 400 members had objected to his salary and blamed Mr Shapps for launching 'a quite unfair and unreasonable sting' against him through the media. Local Government Minister Grant Shapps today described Mr Ransford's comments as 'out of touch' Mr Ransford is now planning to take a long break in New Zealand 'as far from Westminster as it is possible to go'. He explained: 'I've done the heavy-lifting, I’ve given it my all. It’s for others now to perform on that stage.' Mr Shapps today described Mr Ransford's comments as 'out of touch'. He told the Telegraph: 'He has set such a bad example to local government advocating whopping fat cat salaries for chief executives whilst thousands of public sector workers are subject to a pay freeze or losing their jobs. 'We are calling time on the unacceptable practices of mega pay packets, boomerang bosses and double dipping to ensure the taxpayer gets value for money.' Mr Ransford's replacement, Carolyn Down, is on a much lower salary of £169,000 a year, plus £27,000 in annual pension contributions.",Local Government Minister Grant Shapps describes John Ransford's comments as 'out of touch'
"By . James White . Last updated at 4:57 PM on 25th November 2011 . A Premier League footballer who fled the scene of a motorway drink-drive smash by running through fields was today fined £4,500 - the equivalent of just three days' pay. Aston Villa midfielder Barry Bannan admitted ditching his Range Rover Sport and three other offences including driving under the influence of alcohol. The 21-year-old Scotland international, who earns an estimated £10,000-a-week, was also banned for 18 months at Nottingham Magistrates' Court. Banned: Aston Villa footballer Barry Bannan, pictured with his girlfriend, leaves Nottingham Magistrates Court today where he was banned from driving for 18 months . Bannan crashed his car on the southbound carriageway of the M1 near Watnall, Nottinghamshire, at around 5.30am on October 23. The footballer, who lives in Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands, was charged with drink-driving, failing to stop after a road accident, driving without due care and attention and driving on a provisional licence. The court heard that the footballer was almost twice the legal limit. Bannan had been on a night out with friends in Leeds following Villa's 2-1 home defeat at the hands of local rivals West Brom. A friend collected Bannan and they left for Leeds at 6.30pm. Bannan drank two cans of beer on the journey then drank more at a nightclub, magistrates heard. He got a taxi to his hotel at 3am and waited for his friends to return. When they failed to return, Bannan decided to get changed and drive back to Birmingham as he feared he would miss a meeting with a youth football team coach who he had known for 11 years. Midfielder: Bannan, who earns about £10,000-a-week, in action for Aston Villa earlier this season . Bannan said he took the decision to drive as he felt 'alert, in control and clear-headed', the court heard. Bannan had been driving for about an hour when he failed to make a bend and hit the central reservation, the court heard. The car span and came to a stop 1,000ft away in the fourth lane. After getting the car to the hard shoulder, the footballer saw a motorway worker on his mobile phone. Fearing he was calling the police, Bannan panicked and fled over fields to a taxi office in Bulwell. It was here that he was arrested. Bannan, who has held a provisional licence for three years, was found to have 61mg of alcohol to 100ml of breath - the legal limit is 35. He believed himself to be 'a safe and confident driver' who practised regularly with his girlfriend, who had a licence and was insured on his car, Adrian Darbishire, representing Bannan, said. Bannan was sorry for what he had done and had admitted it was 'foolish and immature'. He said he had never driven under the influence of alcohol before and 'never would do again'. 'It was foolish and I am sorry.' Powerful: A Range Rover Sport similar to the one driven by Bannan, who only had a provisional driving licence . In mitigation, Mr Darbishire said of Bannan: 'He is a young man in the public eye. He views these proceedings very seriously and his actions were out of character.' The Range Rover was found to have no mechanical defects. The footballer was fined £2,200 for driving with excess alcohol and a further £2,200 for the charge of failing to stop after a road accident. He was also ordered to pay costs of £85 and a surcharge of £15. He was disqualified from driving for 18 months, but was told this would be reduced by four months and two weeks on completion of a drink-driving rehabilitation course. Magistrates said they would impose no further penalty for the further two charges. A passenger in the car, Shrewsbury striker James Collins, was also arrested on suspicion of drink-driving and failing to stop at the scene of an accident following the incident.

As it turns out, Paula Abdul doesn't have much to be thankful on the eve of Thanksgiving...in regards to her show, X Factor, that is. The 49-year-old former choreographer's entire category has been wiped out after tonight's shocking double elimination. Her one remaining group, Lakoda Rayne, was given the boot alongside Nicole Scherzinger's contestant LeRoy Bell. Double elimination: Lakoda Rayne have been eliminated from the competition . Bye bye Leroy: The youngest-looking 60-year-old on the planet was also sent home during tonight's elimination . Not a happy camper: Paula Abdul's entire category was eliminated with Lakoda Rayne tonight . The ladies - Paige Elizabeth, 18, . Hayley Orrantia, 17, Cari Fletcher, 17, and Dani Knights, 22 - sang Taylor Swift's You Belong With Me last night but received the overall lowest amount of votes. Simon Cowell's act, 14-year-old Drew, was also pulled up alongside the girls but was quickly sent to safety. They appeared to have channelled Swift's graciousness as well, as they gracefully accepted defeat, saying: 'The dream is not over. You'll be seeing Lakoda Rayne in concert everywhere.' Paula, though furious to be out of the running, will remain on the show as a judge and commentator though she is not personally invested in its outcome. The first elimination: Drew randomly found herself up for elimination against Lakoda Rayne . Say goodbye: Paula bids farewell to her final remaining group, Lakoda Rayne . Safety kisses: Simon Cowell kisses his contestant, Drew, as she's saved from elimination . The second elimination came after a sing-off between the second and third lowest vote-getters: Bell and Marcus Canty. The Maryland native, who dedicated last night's performance of Boyz II Men's A Song For Mama to his mother, wowed the crowd by singing Christina Aguilera's You Lost Me. 60-year-old Bell also dedicated his song, Sarah McLachlan's Angel, to his mother but failed to impress the judges with his version of The Beatles' Don't Let Me Down. The X Factor: Canty apparently has it, Bell did not as America decided who to keep around . Like a prayer: The former Pussycat Doll seems to be praying that Bell won't be eliminated . The ride is over: Nicole Scherzinger says goodbye to her contestant, Bell . The 20-year-old's mentor, L.A. Reid, staunchly stood by his contestant, saying: 'If we're talking about a massive star, we're talking about Marcus Canty.' Bell's own mentor, former Pussycat Doll Scherzinger, defended her contestant, saying: 'I know right now you're singing for your life. I have to send home Marcus.' Given that she had nothing to lose, Abdul also chose to send Canty packing. She told the young singer that he was one of her 'favourites' but that LeRoy 'really sang for his life'. Still kicking: Simon's whole group, including Drew, Melanie Amaro and Rachel Crow, are still competing . Safe! L.A. Reid's group of Chris Rene, Marcus Canty and Astro are moving on again in the competition . With his vote as the deciding factor in a tie for Canty and Bell, Simon Cowell opted for the older contestant, bringing the vote to a deadlock. In a 'Deadlock', America's votes determine the winner - and America determined that Bell should go home. Like Lakoda Rayne, the Tacoma, Washington native bowed out with his head held high. Stronger: Former American Idol champ Kelly Clarkson sang her new single, Stronger . Soulful singer: Bruno Mars performed his new single from the Twilight soundtrack, It Will Rain . 'I'm actually feeling OK,' the teary-eyed singer claimed, before his mentor butt in to steal the show, as always. The 33-year-old singer grabbed Bell's mic and yelled: 'He did amazing! Let's hear it for LeRoy!' In between the glaring double elimination, viewers were treated to performances from Kelly Clarkson and Bruno Mars. The former American Idol champion sang her latest single, Stronger, in front of gigantic cartoon fists. Singing circus: The remaining nine contestants performed a medley of Pink songs . 26-year-old Mars sang his latest hit, It Will Rain, off the Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 soundtrack. Before the final elimination, all nine contestants performed a medley of Pink songs while dressed as circus performers. The remaining contestants now stand at seven - Canty, Drew, Melanie Amaro, Rachel Crow, Josh Krajcik, Astro and Chris Rene. Cowell and Reid's entire categories remain intact.

A LUXURY five-star hotel is at the centre of a major food poisoning probe after 80 guests fell ill after a fundraising dinner. Diners at Salford's Lowry Hotel reported fever, dizziness and vomiting after attending an event at what has been dubbed Manchester's most fashionable hotel. The outbreak is being linked to chicken pate served at a charity dinner and is now being investigated by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and officers from Salford council. Investigation: The Lowry Hotel in the trendy Chapel Wharf area of Manchester . It is the first incident of its kind at the hotel since it opened 10 years ago. The Lowry, part of the Rocco Forte hotel group, was recently awarded the highest five-star hygiene rating. Around 200 people are understood to have attended the three-course dinner to raise funds for The Message Trust youth charity. It was discovered that some later became infected with campylobacter, a bacteria found on raw meat which can cause diarrhoea, vomiting, and stomach cramps. Symptoms can last for up to ten days. Solicitor Alex Speed, 44, from . Stockport, told how he fell ill after attending the event. Outbreak probe: Diners at a charity function at The Lowry Hotel in Manchester have reported feeling unwell . Plush accommodation: The Lowry Hotel in Manchester is known as one of the most fashionable hotels in the city . He . said: 'Based on what our table ate, I know that the people who had the . tomato soup as a starter didn't get ill. It's reasonable to assume the . pate was responsible.' He has now . launched a compensation claim on behalf of seven clients. Dr Rosemary McCann, a consultant with . the HPA, said 80 guests had so far reported symptoms - and a number of . cases of campylobacter had now been confirmed by laboratory tests. She revealed: 'Investigations are still ongoing, including analysis of a questionnaire returned by guests.' Hotel bosses confirmed that the pate dish had been prepared by hotel staff for the dinner on October 8. The dish has now been taken off the menu while the investigation continues. General manager Peter Kienast said: 'We are very sorry to hear that a number of guests fell ill following a function at our hotel. 'We are determined to get to the cause of the issue and the detailed investigation is reviewing every stage of the process from the food source itself to its delivery. 'On being informed we immediately requested our retained food safety specialist carry out a full and in-depth investigation with the Environmental Health Office which is still continuing. 'The Lowry Hotel has very stringent procedures and training methods to ensure the highest quality of hygiene in our kitchens. 'We are regularly reviewed by the Environmental Health Office and two months ago we received the highest five-star hygiene rating which we have held for a number of years. This is the first incident of its kind in The Lowry Hotel's past 10 years. 'We are in contact with the organisers of the event and assisting them with any needs they may have as the investigation continues.' The 164-room hotel, which is on the bank of the River Irwell, was built in 2001 and quickly gained the coveted five-star status. Cheshire businessman Roy Newey complained on Twitter that he too had been laid low for several days. Coun Ray Mashiter, Salford council's lead member for environment, said: 'We have visited the hotel and given them advice after a resident made us aware of a possible problem.'","Council probes Manchester's posh Lowry hotel after outbreak .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Last updated at 9:05 AM on 25th November 2011 . Three executives of Japan's Olympus Corp resigned today ahead of a boardroom showdown with ousted CEO Michael Woodford, as the British whistleblower said he would not be surprised if ‘some criminality’ were involved in the scandal engulfing the once-venerable firm. The camera and endoscope maker admitted this month it hid losses on securities investments for two decades, blaming former president and chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, former vice-president Hisashi Mori and internal auditor Hideo Yamada for the cover-up. Michael Woodford speaks to the media before speaking at a panel at a Tokyo hall today . But where the money trail leads remains a mystery, and speculation simmers that organised crime syndicates may somehow be involved. Kikukawa, who quit as president and chairman on October 26, and Mori, who was fired, had tendered their resignations from the board with immediate effect, as had Yamada, who could attend board meetings but not vote, Olympus said in a statement. And new President Shuichi Takayama said in a separate statement the current management team was ready to quit once ‘the path to Olympus's revival became clear.’ Woodford, 51, who earlier met with Japanese police, prosecutors and regulators in Tokyo, expressed confidence that the authorities would fully investigate the scandal. Speech: Mr Woodford speaking at the panel . ‘The talks (with authorities) have passed all my expectations ... and it's very evident to me they are going to investigate this whole issue without bias and thoroughly, and that will include following the money flows in relation to all the transactions,’ he told reporters. ‘I'm immensely encouraged. I've been treated with great courtesy and I'm much more confident than I thought I would be with what I've been told.’ Woodford returned to the Japanese capital on Wednesday for the first time since he fled the country after being fired as CEO on October 14, having lifted the lid on some large and dubious payments related to acquisitions by the company. Hand-over: Michael Woodford, right, shakes hands with Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, who quit last month over the scandal . Tomorrow, he will attend a board meeting. ‘I want to take the opportunity to look the directors in the eye and tell them what I think is best for the company,’ he said. ‘I just hope they understand the game is up and do the decent thing, stop damaging the company. Don't look for self-interest, look for the 45,000 people. ‘Have some shame, have some dignity, that's what I want to tell them.’ Woodford later welcomed the resignations of Kikukawa and the other two executives, but told an audience of business people that the entire current board should resign. Probe: Woodford says the Tokyo police have a big role to play in uncovering the truth . ‘If they have an iota of care for the company then they should realise what they have done and give assurances they will resign in the near future,’ said an animated Woodford, who also criticised Japanese shareholders for their relative silence and Japanese media for their slow start to covering the scandal. Olympus fired Woodford as CEO, asserting he did not understand Japanese culture or the firm's management style. His return to Tokyo caps a remarkable turnaround for a rare foreign senior executive in Japan. After being sacked, he was told his driver would no longer be available and he should vacate his apartment. Someone Woodford trusted suggested he leave Japan immediately for his own safety, which he did. Woodford, who said he was axed for questioning the M&A deals, fled to England and has campaigned for Olympus to come clean. Big foreign shareholders have called for his return to run the company, which Woodford has said he was willing to do. On Thursday, he said he had a ‘dream team’ in mind to run the company, but declined to give details. Woodford says the Tokyo police, who have mobilised an organised crime unit to take part in the probe, have a big role to play in uncovering the truth. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Britain's Serious Fraud Office are also investigating. Woodford had refused to return to Japan because of safety concerns, but says now he is confident police will protect him. Olympus said on Monday a third-party panel it set up to investigate the matter had found no evidence that organised crime gangs were involved in the M&A payments - which included a massive $687million (£411million) advisory fee paid mostly to an obscure Cayman Islands firm.",Ousted CEO Michael Woodford suggests 'criminality' could be involved .

A mother and daughter have been banned from owning animals after 45 cats and dogs and a squirrel were found living in squalid conditions in their council house. Kindred Hummer, 47, and her daughter Lauren Stead, 23, were arrested during a raid by RSPCA inspectors on their home in Beverley, East Yorkshire, in August last year. Inside, horrified inspectors discovered 41 cats kept in just six cages in bedrooms. Four of the animals were in such terrible shape they had to be put down. Cruel: Kindred Hummer, pictured leaving Beverley Magistrates Court, and her daughter Lauren Stead have been banned from owning animals after RSPCA inspectors found 46 animals living in squalid conditions in their home . Elsewhere in the house were found four desperately ill dogs and a grey squirrel, Alfie, kept in a dark cage in the attic. One dog, named Jenny, had to be put down by a vet, while a cream and black pug called Alfie had conjunctivitis and a prolapsed eyeball, causing him to go blind. A vet recommended both of his eyeballs be surgically removed. A third dog, Phoebe, was found with a chronic skin condition and severely infected ears and needed four months of treatment. At Beverley Magistrates' Court yesterday, Hummer and Stead were yesterday disqualified from owning animals indefinitely and sentenced to ten weeks imprisonment, suspended for a year . The court heard details of the appalling conditions and suffering endured by the animals living in the house. Prosecutor Philip Brown revealed how RSPCA inspectors found 36 cats kept in five large cages and five 'exceptionally thin' cats suffering from diarrhoea in a cage in a second upstairs room. Squalid: The RSPCA discovered 41 cats kept in just six cages in bedrooms. Four of the animals were in such terrible shape they had to be put down . He said: 'The sheer number of cats contained in the manner described shocked the inspector and vet. 'The failure to provide constant access to a supply of drinking water was detrimental to welfare. 'The method of housing these cats together meant they were not kept in a suitable environment and prevented from exhibiting normal behaviour patterns expected of cats.' Tim Bishop, mitigating, said Hummer and Stead, who have since moved to Hull, were remorseful. He said: 'While it is apparent that animals have suffered as a result of the actions or inaction of the defendants, these two individuals are not, at heart, bad people. 'They didn't set out to cause these animals harm - it's something that has arisen from the personal circumstances of the defendants, combined with simple ignorance. 'Both appear to show genuine remorse for their actions.' As well as the 41 cats, inspectors also found four desperately ill dogs - one of whom had to be put down - and a grey squirrel kept in a dark cage in the attic . Sentencing Hummer and Stead, who each pleaded guilty to 12 charges relating to animal cruelty, magistrates chairman Lesley Wood stressed that 'a number of these animals were neglected for some time'. The pair admitted charges including failing to provide a constant supply of fresh drinking water for 45 cats and not addressing the poor condition and weight loss of various cats. Hummer and Stead each received a ten-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, and were ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work. They were disqualified from owning animals indefinitely, for a minimum of five years, and ordered to pay £2,500 costs. A total of 21 cats found at the home were passed to RSPCA, which will find them new homes.","Kindred Hummer and Lauren Stead banned from owning animals indefinitely .

The Formula One star and the pop singer split up last month after four years together as the strain of barely seeing each other took its toll. It is understood that Hamilton's failure to commit to starting a family further undermined their relationship and forced them apart. Still in love: Lewis Hamilton flew to Los Angeles to attempt a reconciliation with Hawaiian born beauty Nicole Scherzinger . The break-up resulted in Hamilton adopting a negative attitude and, combined with poor results and incidents on the track, the 26-year-old has cut a forlorn figure for a number of weeks. That appeared to be underlined this week when pictures were published of what looked like a frosty reunion in a Los Angeles car park between him and US X-Factor judge Scherzinger. But as he prepared for this Sunday's final race of the F1 season, the Brazilian Grand Prix, in Sao Paulo, he said that could not be further from the truth. Sporting a long black set of rosary . beads overlaid with white gold given to him by his ex as a present in . LA, Hamilton said of the photographs: 'Well, they didn't catch us at the . best of times. 'What you . didn't see is that we had a really good week, a couple of really nice . lunches together. We had a really nice dinner together. 'It's very early days and we still have very strong feelings for one another. I still love her very much. 'Amicable': The pair announced their split last month but Hamilton who has 'fond memories' hopes for a reconciliation . 'So, who knows? Maybe we will be together in the future.' Hamilton's trip to the United States also included a visit to New York in which he 'got to hang with Mary J Blige, Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz in the studio, which was really cool'. Hamilton could now not be more upbeat ahead of the weekend, saying: 'I'm very much here in a positive frame of mind. 'I am very happy to be here, I've great memories of being here in the past. 'Actually she (Scherzinger) was here with me when I won the world championship (in 2008), so I've very good memories. 'But certainly it was a really positive few days which meant more to me than a race win, so I came away from LA feeling great and things are different, so that's cool. 'I've a lot of positive energy at the moment.' Hopeful: Lewis is keen to give the relationship another go .","Formula One star and singer .

Thomas Hart, 69, has become the oldest person to be convicted of involvement in the unrest which swept England in August. He claims he committed the crime when drunk, having consumed at least six pints of lager before joining a crowd of yobs looting JD Sports. Convicted: Thomas Hart, 69, pleaded guilty to burglary yesterday . Hart handed himself in to police after seeing his picture printed in a newspaper, and yesterday pleaded guilty to burglary at Camberwell Green magistrates' court. He is now out on bail, and will be sentenced at Inner London crown court next month. As he was leaving the pub following his massive drinking session on August 8, Hart was caught up in gangs of rioters looting shops in Lewisham, south-east London. He joined them in breaking in to the sports shop and took a number of tops, which have not been recovered by police. Youth: Most rioters were much younger than great-grandfather Hart . Speaking outside court yesterday, he told the Daily Mirror: 'I was stupid. I'd had a good drink. 'I wasn't one of those people setting fire to things and smashing the place up - there's no need for that. 'I took two or three jumpers but I didn't get them home. Someone pushed me to the ground.' The rioting cost JD Sports more than £700,000, as the shop is popular with the teenagers and young people who made up the majority of looters.",Thomas Hart says he stole tops after 'a good drink'
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:40 PM on 3rd October 2011 . A failed Chinese asylum seeker who has given birth to four children since coming to Britain claims her home country's one-child policy means sending her home would violate her family's human rights. Xiu Fang Zhang, 34, claims her children could be taken from her if she returns to her homeland as the communist government only allows . one-child families in urban areas. Parents in some rural areas . are permitted to have two children. Mrs Zhang first came to Britain in 2003, and was refused asylum shortly after her arrival. Despite this ruling, she has remained in the country, giving birth to four children in her eight years in Britain. Deportation appeal: Xiu Fang Zhang (right) leaves court with her partner, children and interpreter. She came to Britain in 2003 and was refused asylum shortly after her arrival . Earlier this year Mrs Zhang, of Newport, South Wales, was refused leave to remain in Britain, meaning she and her family are under threat of deportation to China. Now, arguing her children could be taken from her if she is sent back to her homeland, Mrs Zhang has mounted a judicial review challenge to the Home Office's decision at the High Court in London. Judge James Dingemans QC told the court that Mrs Zhang flew into Gatwick airport in September 2003, but her asylum application was rejected despite her claims she was from the persecuted Falun Gong religious minority. During her years in Britain, she met her partner with whom she has four children - a four-year-old boy, a two-year-old girl, and twins, born in April this year. Mrs Zhang applied for indefinite leave to remain in Britain under the Home Office's Legacy Scheme, which gives preferential treatment to immigrants who have lived in Britain for long periods. Her application was refused earlier this year. Lawyers for Mrs Zhang argue that she now has a network of friends and an established life in Britain. Since the refusal of her application, Mrs Zhang has been terrified her children could be taken away from her if she is forced to return to China, the hearing was told. China's communist government only allows one-child families in urban areas, with parents in some rural areas permitted to have two children. The court also heard claims the Home Office should have given more consideration to the human rights of the four children when processing the application for leave to remain. Judge Dingemans has now ruled her case 'arguable' and granted her permission to have the Home Office's decision judicially reviewed at the High Court later this year. He said recent judgements have emphasised the importance of considering children's human rights in immigration decisions, adding: 'It seems to me that this case does cross the threshold of arguability, and for that reason I grant permission.'","Xiu Fang Zhang says children could be taken from her as China has a one-child policy .

"By . Sophie Borland . Last updated at 8:19 AM on 25th November 2011 . The NHS body that rations life-saving drugs has spent tens of thousands on taxpayer-funded credit cards. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence spent £78,000 on government procurement cards last year, according to documents released under the Freedom of Information Act. They were used by staff to travel ‘for business purposes’ to destinations including Rio de Janeiro, Vietnam, California, South Korea, Chicago and Prague. But the documents reveal they were also used for such unlikely purchases as a box of toilet brushes and sink plungers at £16.92, an inflatable cushion at £11.10 for a member of staff with a sore tail-bone, a £49.99 Christmas tree from Argos and seasonal decorations costing £7.99. They were also used to pay for morale-boosting staff ‘away days’, including one costing £751 at the Eden Bar and Restaurant in Manchester and another worth £379.77 at the city’s Victorian Chop House. Other expenses included Marks & Spencer gift tokens used as prizes for staff quizzes, as well as wheat and gluten-free sandwiches from the upmarket chain. The cards were used to buy a tablecloth for £19.98 and a vacuum cleaner for £27.99, both from Robert Dyas, as well as dishwasher tablets (£7) and dishwasher cleaning fluid (£4.44) from Tesco. Officials also used the cards at Sainsbury’s to pay for fruit juice, milk and biscuits ‘for meetings’. Nice agreed to publish details of its . spending only after several Freedom of Information requests from the . Mail, our sister paper the Mail on Sunday and the TaxPayers’ Alliance. Idyllic: Staff traveled to destinations such as Rio de Janeiro, pictured, for 'business purposes' using government procurement cards . When the Mail first asked for the information in September, we were told Nice ‘does not use government procurement cards’. When the organisation finally acknowledged their use, it pointed out its bill was much lower than those of other public bodies. Last month the Mail revealed the Health Protection Agency had used the cards to spend £3.1million in two years on items such as golf equipment, clogs, nail care and even a prawn-peeling machine. And the Government Offices for the Regions quango was found to have blown £5million in three years on items including video games, yoga and skiing trips. There are thought to be around 140,000 government procurement cards in circulation and civil servants used them to spend £1billion last year alone. Nice said about 14 of its senior members of staff had the cards. Sir Andrew Dillon, the organisation’s chief executive, said: ‘Government procurement cards and other credit cards are only used when it is difficult to make a payment any other way and their use is subject to strict guidelines.

"By . Paul Revoir . Last updated at 10:17 AM on 25th November 2011 . A BBC report about the Dale Farm evictions was biased, according to an internal investigation. Basildon Council had complained of misleading coverage, saying The One Show had effectively sided with the travellers at the illegal site. And the corporation’s editorial standards committee has now found that the broadcast breached impartiality rules. Under fire: The One Show's presenters Alex Jones and Matt Baker front the show which was criticised for its editorial lapse . On the show, one traveller had claimed the Essex council was ‘throwing us out on the road’ with nowhere to go. In fact, Basildon, which was given no right to reply, had offered to rehouse and relocate travellers. A subsequent studio discussion with presenters Matt Baker and Alex Jones and studio guest Neil Morrissey, also broke rules by creating an ‘overall impression’ that was ‘unfair’ to the local authority. Mr Morrissey suggested the council may have earmarked the site for development and wanted to sell it for a profit. A Panorama programme last month sparked complaints of bias in favour of the travellers, a claim also levelled at some BBC news coverage. Basildon Council was furious about the report – broadcast in February – calling it biased, badly researched and misleading. Editorial failing: The One Show was found to have been less than clear about the status of the Essex site . The council said a clip taken from a 2005 documentary about the row had been used to show local residents in a negative light. It added that there was no mention of the unauthorised site being on green belt land. The BBC Trust rebuke came in an appeal lodged after an initial complaint was rejected. Councillor Tony Ball at Dale Farm illegal Travellers' camp. Basildon council spoke out against the BBC piece . Yesterday’s report said: ‘It was unfair that the council was not given the opportunity to reply to the accusation relating to its statutory homelessness obligations. ‘The live studio discussion had been unfair to the council because it highlighted the estimated £13million cost to move families and posed the question to the studio guest of whether the cost could be justified. This question had resulted in a response which went unchallenged by the presenters.’ The Trust said the rest of the report was ‘duly accurate’. Tony Ball, who leads Basildon Council, said last night: ‘The site clearance of Dale Farm has always been about the protection of the green belt, but this was not accurately portrayed by The One Show report, nor the fact that we had made several offers of housing to traveller families.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘We note the findings, which we have taken very seriously.’ Protest: The council spent some £20million to evacuate the protesters from the site in October . The six-acre site in Crays Hill was cleared last month. The number of gypsies and travellers in England has almost trebled over the past 100 years, statistics suggest. Latest figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government put the number at 18,600 in July 2011.

Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe has called David Cameron ‘satanic’ for suggesting that Britain may withdraw aid from developing nations that discriminate against homosexuals. The 87-year-old tyrant told a group of young people: ‘Do not get tempted into homosexuality. We will punish you severely. ‘It becomes worse and satanic when you get a Prime Minister like Cameron saying countries that want British aid should accept homosexuality. Mugabe, who has previously compared homosexuals to animals, branded David Cameron as 'satanic' ‘To come with that diabolical suggestion to our people is a stupid offer.’ Mugabe referred to previous remarks in which he compared homosexuals to animals. He added: ‘It [homosexuality] is condemned by nature. It is condemned by insects and that is why I have said [homosexuals] are worse than pigs and dogs.’ Gay sex is illegal in Zimbabwe, and two same-sex individuals caught even holding hands face prison. Many other African countries take a similar line. Last month Mr Cameron said he believed British funding to developing nations should in future depend on recipients’ record on human rights. Mugabe is the latest in a string of African leaders to criticise the proposal, which some governments have argued is an attempt to impose British values on other countries.","Zimbabwean tyrant has previously compared homosexuals to animals .

Squatters have taken over a £5 million house in one of the most exclusive postcodes in London - because they 'can't afford' rents in the capital. The group of Eastern Europeans moved into a large Victorian house in Highgate, north London, two weeks ago, close to the homes of supermodel Kate Moss and actor Jude Law. They pinned a notice to the front window of Hillcrest Lodge claiming 'squatters' rights' under the Criminal Justice Act. Valued by local estate agents at around £5million, it is directly opposite historic 18th century pub The Bull, which also became home to squatters at the end of last year. Squatting in style: The basement of the house in Highgate, which has been inhabited for the last two weeks . Exclusive: The property is one of the most exclusive postcodes in London and has reportedly been empty for two years . The neighbours claim they were told . by police it was 'none of their business' when they asked officers to . take action against the squatting - and they also said the property . developer owner is aware the house has been taken over. However, . in a legal notice the squatters threaten him with legal action if he . attempts to enter the building, stating: 'Any entry into these premises . without our permission is a criminal offence as any one of us who is in . physical possession is oppose to such entry.' Farukl . Islam, who has owned adjoining restaurant Kiplings for 20 years, says . he called officers after he noticed six Eastern European men moving into . the property. He said: 'I . saw some boys, about 18 or 19-years-old, Eastern Europeans, moving in. I . called the police and they said to me ""it's none of your business"". 'They . don't come out in the day time but I have seen them going in and out at . night. I am worried about how this will affect my business because I . don't know who these guys are. I don't know if they are good guys or bad . guys. If they stay it is going to be a big problem for us.' Mr . Islam said the property used to be owned by Haringey Council and was . split up into flats before being bought by a property developer two . years ago. Too expensive: The occupants claimed they had been forced to squat in the house after being unable to afford rents in the capital . The developer began works on the building before being forced to stop when the recession hit, it was claimed. Mr Islam said: 'He came in to see me last week and asked what happened.

Repair kit: Research shows breast milk is rich in stem cells with the chameleon-like properties normally found in those taken from embryos . Breast milk contains stem cells that could potentially beat diseases from Alzheimer’s to cancer, according to scientists. The milk, intended by Mother Nature to give babies the best start in life, is rich in stem cells, which have the chameleon-like properties found in those taken from embryos. The milk could provide a ready and ethical source of stem cells, which are widely seen as a ‘repair kit’ due to their potential to turn into any cell type in the body. Cancer, blindness, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases and paralysis could all potentially be healed by the power of ‘master cells’. The use of embryonic stem cells is mired in controversy because harvesting them from an embryo leads to its death. But the New Scientist reported that breast milk stem cells can turn into bone cells, cartilage, fat, brain, liver and pancreas, a breastfeeding conference will hear next year. Researcher Foteini Hassiotou, of the University of Western Australia, said: ‘Breast milk offers a new exciting opportunity for stem cell therapies.’ Chris Mason, professor of regenerative medicine at University College London, said more proof is needed that the cells are as versatile as billed, but added: ‘If they are truly embryonic, this will be another way of getting stem cells that would not raise ethical concerns.’ Even if they do not turn out to be as versatile as hoped, said Newcastle University stem cell scientist Lyle Armstrong, a woman could still bank stem cells from her milk and use them to help in the treatment of a disease such as diabetes later in life. Insurance: A woman could bank the stem cells from her milk and use them to treat illnesses she might contract later in life . For instance, a woman could bank the stem cells from her milk and then use them  to help in the treatment of a disease such as diabetes later in life. Embryonic stem cell research suffered a major set-back earlier this week when the first company to test them in people withdrew from the field. Californian biotech company Geron hoped the revolutionary therapy would help  the paralysed walk again. The trial on men and women with spinal cord injuries caused by car crashes and  sporting accidents was hailed as 'the beginning of a new chapter in medical  therapeutics'. But after treating just four patients, Geron shelved the work, blaming the high costs and red tape of stem cell research as well as 'uncertain economic conditions'. However, others questioned whether it would have given up on the treatment if  it really was going to produce the miracles promised. Geron, which now intends to focus on cancer drugs, has not released any  information about how well the treatment worked. Europe's first embryonic stem cell trial is due to start later this year when a jab to cure blindness is tested at London's Moorfields Eye Hospital.","Embryonic stem cells could revolutionise treatment of cancer, blindness, diabetes, Parkinson’s and paralysis .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:36 PM on 26th November 2011 . A paedophile with HIV who arranged online to have sex with three young children has been jailed after not realising he was talking to an undercover policeman. Steven King, who worked in the accounts department in a solicitors' office, made the two hour journey from his home thinking he was going to abuse the children aged five, six and 10. The sick 30-year-old also bragged to the undercover officer that he had already raped a young boy aged just 13 years. Jailed: Steven King was locked up for four years after the police sting . In a twisted message he told the policeman: 'Any age, younger the better.' King was jailed for four years after admitting arranging the commission of child sex offences and two further counts of possessing indecent images. The judge, sitting at Southwark Crown Court, was told how King began talking to the undercover officers in July this year when the officer claimed to have three young children. During the online chats the defendant revealed how he had previously raped a 14-year-old, who he later claimed was just 13. On July 19 he said 'any age, younger the better'. in a message and told the officer he was willing to travel the 80 miles from his home in Southampton to London in order for the pair to meet. Sting: King met an undercover police officer at Waterloo Station, who he thought was going to allow him to abuse children . When they met at Waterloo Station on July 27, King confessed that he wanted to abuse the five-year-old boy and six year old girl. A second meeting was arranged when the paedophile believed he would be taken to the undercover officer's home and be allowed to abuse the children. On August 2, King was arrested and in interview confirmed he planned to go to the policeman's home and sexually assault the children. He said he had lied about abusing children in the past during his conversations with the undercover officer. When he was arrested he was in possession of flavoured condoms and some toys for the children. A number of items were also seized from his home, including a laptop, USB stick and external hard drives, which contained indecent images of children. King of Southampton, Hampshire, was jailed for four years. Speaking after the sentencing Detective Chief Superintendent Reg Hooke, head of the MPS Child Abuse Investigation Command, said: 'The plotting of child abuse over the internet is a sickening crime and one that poses a serious and ongoing threat. 'Officers from the Met's Paedophile Unit conduct operations, such as the one that caught King, on a weekly basis. 'Luckily, this time, King's appalling intentions remained just that. The result reflects the Met's continued commitment to fighting child abuse in all its forms.'","Steven King jailed for four years .

"By . Sophie Borland . Last updated at 6:59 PM on 23rd November 2011 . Rules relaxed: Women suffering from anxiety and fear of childbirth will be eligible for a Caesarean . Maternity wards are relaxing the rules on caesarean births amid concerns that some expectant mothers are so afraid of childbirth they seek abortion. Under new NHS guidelines, pregnant women who are very anxious about labour will be able to have the operation even if there is no medical justification. Currently they are only offered a planned caesarean in certain circumstances, such as if they are expecting twins or triplets, they have high blood pressure or diabetes, or the foetus is in the wrong position. But under the guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, women with ‘mental health issues’ including fear or anxiety will also be eligible. Senior doctors and charities say that some women are so afraid of giving birth naturally they are having their pregnancies terminated. This fear of childbirth is known as tokophobia and it is estimated to affect one in ten expectant mothers. Malcolm Griffiths, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Luton and Dunstable Hospital, said he did not think it was ‘uncommon’ for women to ask for terminations following previous bad experiences giving birth. He said he had recently seen one woman who had undergone two very traumatic labours and had asked to be referred for an abortion because she could not bear the thought of going through it all again. The current shortage of midwives is also ‘a factor’, he added. Mr Griffiths said: ‘It’s fair to say caesarean section is a major operation. It’s about as major as a hysterectomy. ‘It’s not a major operation that most pregnant women are interested in or want to have.’ NICE estimates that a planned caesarean costs the NHS an average of £2,369 while a natural birth costs £1,665 . In some cases tokophobia is brought on by previous traumatic experiences but in others it is simply an irrational fear with no apparent cause. Dr Gillian Leng, deputy chief executive of NICE, insisted that the guideline was not about ‘offering free caesareans for all’. ‘For a very small number of women, their anxiety about childbirth will lead them to ask for a c-section,’ she said. Dr Leng added that these women would first be offered counselling. If their fears were still not allayed they would be offered a planned caesarean. The guidelines only refer to planned or ‘elective’ caesarean sections. Thousands of other women are forced to have emergency procedures because of complications which develop during the labour. The latest figures show that 24 per cent of women give birth by caesarean, up from 12 per cent in 1990. NICE estimates that a planned caesarean costs the NHS an average of £2,369 while a natural birth costs £1,665.","New guidelines say women with fear or anxiety will be eligible for a Caesarean .

But rewind 12 months and the picture was about as different as it could be with early snow and freezing conditions. This time last year, Hannah Walker was having fun sledging in her garden and building a snowman in Portchester in Hampshire. But this year the five-year-old is watering the geraniums and relaxing in the unusually warm weather that has been with us for weeks.

Co-owner Paul Crossland had to put a warning on the Lion Inn's website urging customers not to attempt to reach the pub. He said: 'This year it's a very different story.

The Met Office says figures for the month so far reveal the average UK temperature has been 9.4c (48.9f) – the November average is 5.9c (42.6f). The mean temperature in the South-East and East Anglia –  traditionally one of the UK’s warmest regions – has been a balmy 11.2c (52f), which is 4.5c above the usual average. The average temperature for Middlesex is 11.8, 4.3 degrees warmer than normal. The Met Office says the unusual weather is caused by warm air blown up from southern Europe. It is also drier than normal. Average rainfall in the first two weeks of November was 25mm, less than half of what would usually have fallen.

'It’s too early to say whether it’s going to be above that, but it looks like it could be one of the warmest.’ She said the weather this weekend would be ‘unsettled’ for much of Britain but that temperatures would remain unusually high.

Salmon usually travel upstream, but recent floods led to an astonishing sight where a handful of fish were forced to swim up-street. Heavy rains in Mason County, Washington caused water levels to rise by around two inches across Oregon. When that happens the salmon go wherever the rivers are flowing, according to professional fisherman Conway Bowman, host of 'Fly Fishing The World,' a fishing show on The Sportsman Channel in the U.S. Stranded: A salmon can be seen trying to swim up-road as a car passes in Washington state . 'This can happen when high water correlates with the spawning season,' Mr Bowman told The Huffington Post. Several intrepid salmon were pictured . frantically battling the water in an attempt to swim across Skokomish Valley Road near Shelton in the southern Puget Sound area of Washington. The salmon's struggle upstream is a vital part of their lifecycle. Washed up: Several salmon struggled to swim across the road due to water levels rising following heavy rain . They lay their eggs in a stream bed and once hatched, grow in the freshwater for several years before travelling downstream to the sea. They travel great distances to feed in the oceans and, when fully mature, after between one and four years, must return to their birthplace to spawn. This means they must swim up rivers, against rapids and leap waterfalls. Once they arrive, they lay their eggs and usually die within a week of spawning. A small proportion are strong enough to survive and start the cycle again.","Heavy rains in Mason County, Washington caused water levels to rise by two inches ."

A judge in Aruba has ordered the . release of a U.S. businessman who has been detained over the August . death of his travelling companion. Gary Giordano will be freed on Tuesday without conditions. The 50-year-old employment agency . owner from Gaithersburg, Maryland, has been in jail since August 5, as . investigators sought more time to gather and evaluate evidence over the . disappearance of 35-year-old Robyn Gardner, of Frederick, Maryland. Insurance: Gary Giordano tried to redeem . accidental death policy on missing woman Robyn Gardner, which named him . as a beneficiary, days before their trip to the Dutch Caribbean island . of Aruba . Aruban authorities have said they believe Giordano was involved in the death, Fox News reports. Giordano claims that Miss Gardner was swept out to sea on August 2 while snorkeling. Prosecutors immediately filed an appeal seeking to reverse the ruling and prevent Giordano from leaving jail, Taco Stein, Aruba's solicitor general, said.  A three-judge appeals panel will consider the matter. Giardano's attorney Chris Lejuez said Giordano 'couldn't believe' the decision because he had lost faith and confidence in the Aruban criminal justice systems. 'When I asked him what he really thinks about his release, he started to cry and asked me to excuse him for a few minutes,' the attorney said. He added that he believes Giordano would leave as soon as he is freed. The pair had gone travelling with each other on July 31 after reportedly meeting on a swingers’ website called Adult Friend Finder. Missing: Robyn's travelling partner Gary Giordano is thought to have got angry after reading a text she sent to her boyfriend . Giordano and Miss Gardner were last seen leaving the Rum Reef Bar & Grill restaurant on Baby Beach at about 4pm on August 2. Two hours later, Giordano is seen alone on a security camera, wearing no top but with his toupee still in place. He reported her missing and initially assisted the search but was later detained and arrested at the airport as he tried to flee the country. After Gardner disappeared, Giordano inquired about claiming a $1.5million insurance policy on her life, which he filed on the day before the trip. Shocking CCTV footage emerged showing missing Miss Gardner having a violent fight with Giordano hours before her disappearance. Last movement: This picture was released . by the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Aruba of Robyn Gardner and her . travel companion Gary V. Giordano as they left the Rum Reef Restaurant . Memory: Aruba prosecutors described these as 'the . last known photos of the woman and the suspect' taken on the day the . Maryland woman went missing, to help aid potential witnesses . He is alleged to have threatened to kill his friend while grabbing her by the neck and shoving her into an elevator on the last day she was seen alive. Prosecutors need more evidence to charge him, but witnesses have come forward to claim he was sweating profusely on that August 2 day. They say there was blood next to him on the beach and a large scratch mark on his throat. His father, Frank Giordano has said his son is a 'not a monster' but a 'good human being, who is good to his family'. Prime suspect: Giordano, covering his head while being led to jail from a police station on August 15, is the only suspect in the case . Miss Gardner's boyfriend Richard Forester, 40, said the couple had a row before she left for Aruba. Giordano is said to have read a text on her phone to Mr Forester, which said: 'I love you. I care about you. We'll sort this out when I get back.' A team of cadaver dogs from the Netherlands were brought in at the end of September but were unsuccessful in the search of the Dutch Caribbean island. Hunt for remains: Search parties were eventually joined by cadaver dog teams . Trouble in paradise: Robyn Gardner was seen at this restaurant on the afternoon that she vanished . Police also investigated a report that she was buried alive in a dog’s grave dug up by her lover who taped a plastic bag over her head.

August 18 – it emerges Giordano tried to redeem a $1.5million accidental death insurance policy taken out a day before they went on vacation . November 25 - Aruban judge orders the release of Giordano, who had by then spent more than 100 days in jail . It is thought that Giordano was trying to collect a $1.5million accidental death policy but slipped up, leading to his arrest. Sources said police considered the theory that the suspect was obsessed with the 2005 death of Natalee Holloway, a teenager from Alabama, and the subsequent failure of police to convict Joran van der Sloot of killing her. One source said: 'Cops think Giordano believed that Joran dumped Natalee's body at sea, and he was planning to do the same thing.' Robyn is not thought to have had a physical relationship with him. She was dating another man, Richard Forrester, at the time but travelled with Giordano to Aruba after the relationship was said to have hit some stumbling blocks. Police are said to believe that on the day of her disappearance, Robyn sent a text to her boyfriend, which read: 'I love you. I care about you. We'll sort this out when I get back.' 'Police believe that Giordano, who by now was fantasising that Robyn was in love with him, saw the messages on her iPad and went berserk with jealousy,' a source said.'He became furious because he'd paid for their trip and she was sending romantic texts to another guy.'After eating lunch, the two were spotted by a fisherman walking around a reef behind the restaurant before getting into a car. 'Police believe Giordano drove Robyn to a nearby area called Seroe Colorado, and either strangled, beat her or tortured her to death after he dragged her into one of 50 abandoned shacks that used to house workers from a once-bustling oil refinery,' the source added. Later in the afternoon, Giordano returned to the restaurant where they ate lunch and reported her missing, saying they had just been snorkelling. An employee at the restaurant, however, said he thought it odd that Robyn would have been going snorkelling that day due to the clothes she was wearing and the way her hair and makeup were done. Other eye witnesses said she seemed woozy and did not touch her salad when she ate in the Rum Reef Bar and Grill with the man suspected of killing her. A close friend of Robyn said that she did not just pack up and go to Aruba with a man she barely knew, but she had actually known him for years after meeting him on dating website Match.com. Lianne Delawter said: 'Their relationship spanned back a long way, they'd known each for a couple of years. They met on Match.com and went out a ""date"" but it didn't work out and they stayed friends.'It wasn't a date-date, they were never seeing each other,' she told Radar Online. Alone: Footage shows Giordano walking by himself after Robyn went missing . Miss Delawter added: 'She wasn't the type of girl to go away with someone she didn't know at all. She was very trusting and always saw the good in someone, saw light where there was darkness, but she wasn't naive. They were just going as friends.' She also revealed that Robyn lied to her live-in boyfriend Richard Forester about where she was going, telling him she was off on a family vacation to Orlando rather than Aruba. Her roommate claimed that the businessman invited her on a cruise earlier this year and became 'very angry' when Robyn cancelled on him, according to Radar. She said she was worried when she heard Robyn had agreed to go away with him and has 'no doubt' Giordano is involved in her disappearance. Gary Giordano's lawyer, Jose Baez, told ABC News that Giordano would be freed Tuesday night at 8 p.m. and could be home as early as Wednesday. He said: 'Gary had a chance to speak, and the judge listened to him. 'He made a heartfelt plea - explained the situation.'","Maryland woman missing since August; presumed dead .

Air travellers heading to London next week have been warned they should change their plans or prepare for long delays due to a strike by Britain's immigration officials. Heathrow Airport bosses said that arriving passengers, including those from the United States, could be held on planes for a staggering 12 hours in the chaos following the November 30 strike. The planned action, part of a nationwide protest by public sector workers over proposed changes to pensions, could lead to 'very long delays' and 'mass cancellations of departing aircraft'. Travel hell: International passengers flying to London's Heathrow Airport next week have been told they could be held on planes for up to 12 hours thanks to long queues at passport control . Operating chiefs at the airport - Europe's busiest - said: ‘There are likely to be very long delays of up to 12 . hours to arriving passengers. 'The delays at immigration are likely to . be so long that passengers could not be safely accommodated within the . terminals and would need to be held on arriving aircraft. ‘This in turn would quickly create . gridlock at the airport with no available aircraft parking stands, mass . cancellations or departing aircraft and diversions outside the UK for . arriving aircraft.’ The warning came in a letter from the airport's chief operating officer Normand Boivin to all airlines which fly to Heathrow. Delays: Passengers have been advised to change their travels plans to avoid the chaos after November 30 . He added the airport 'may also be obliged to advise arriving passengers... that they should avoid arriving into the UK on November 30 unless absolutely necessary'. The British Government has already . pledged civil servants and other inexperienced workers to man the . country's ports and airports when immigration staff walk out. But it is predicted that the strike will still affect international passengers arriving into all UK airports. Disruption at Heathrow is expected to be particularly severe because almost 100 long-haul services plan to arrive before 9 a.m. local time on the day of the strike. Unrest: British union bosses warned the public sector pensions strike next week could go on for months . Heathrow Airport handles 180,000 . passengers on a typical day, according to BAA. Its most popular . destination is New York's JFK Airport. Gatwick . Airport also warned passengers to be prepared for 'significant . disruption' at immigration and said it had asked carriers to give . passengers the chance to change their flights. Airlines have also expressed their concern over the predicted chaos following next week's strikes. British . Airways, which flies from more than 200 airports in the United States, warned there could be 'a significant risk of severe delays in . passing through passport control'. A spokesperson added: 'We are concerned that the strike on November 30 . creates considerable uncertainty for our customers booked to fly into UK . airports on that day. 'We . are doing everything that we can to protect our customers and continue . to liaise closely with Government, the UK Border Agency and airport authorities about . possible contingencies.' Warnings: Airlines, including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, have said there is a 'significant risk of severe delays' for passengers passing through passport control at British airports next week . Backlog: Passengers arriving at all UK airports will be affected but the chaos at Heathrow will be particularly bad as it is the world's largest airport in terms of international passenger numbers . A Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman said: . 'We are very concerned about the effect next week's strike will have on . passengers and airport operators. Britain cannot afford to be closed for . business. 'To reduce . the number of passengers coming into UK airports and to minimise . disruption to our passengers, we will allow those booked on inbound . travel on November 30 to rebook for travel up to four days earlier or . later without charge. Q: Who is striking? A: Twenty-nine unions are taking part in the walkout, including teachers, nurses, paramedics, top civil servants and tax inspectors. Q: How many workers is that? A: One of the country's trade unions, the GMB, predicts up to two million workers could walk out. Q: What will be affected? A: Most schools will be closed, bins will not be collected, hospital operations will be cancelled and the elderly may go unfed in hospitals. Q: What is the financial bill? A: It is feared that more than £500million in output will be lost. Q: Why are they striking? A: The British government wants public workers to pay more into their pensions, get a lower payout and retire at a later age. Q: What does the government say? A: Ministers say it is wrong to strike over pensions that were much more . generous than those in the private sector. The public sector pensions . bill is around £32billion a year, with workers contributing £5.5billion a . year and the rest paid by the taxpayer. 'Along . with airport operators, other airlines and the wider aviation industry, . we are continuing discussions with the Government and the UK Border . Agency about possible contingencies.' On the Heathrow disruption, the UK Border Agency said: ‘The security of the UK . border remains our top priority and it is absolutely right we explore . all options to ensure we minimise any disruption caused by planned union . action.’ BAA, the owner of Heathrow airport, has . told airlines to fly planes half full to help ease the chaos expected . when immigration officers walk out. Twenty-nine unions are taking part in Wednesday’s walkout, including teachers, nurses, paramedics,  top civil servants and tax inspectors. Up to two million workers are expected to walk out over proposed changes to pensions. It is set to be the biggest since the General Strike of . 1926 - and union barons said it was fantasy to think it would be a . one-off. Paul Kenny, general secretary of trade union the GMB said the strikes would continue into 2012 in the bitter dispute over pensions. ‘It is Alice in Wonderland stuff to think that 30 November will happen, . people will stop work, take part in rallies, go home and say: “That was . all right. Now we can give in”. It is just nonsense.’ It is feared that more than £500million in output will be lost and jobs . could be axed at a time when unemployment is at a 17-year high of . 2.6million. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: 'Clearly we're going to do everything we . can - notwithstanding the terrible disruption and, frankly, cost to the . economy these strikes will create - to make sure that systems, . including our borders are properly policed and properly controlled. 'But my message to the trade union bosses who are corralling their members into conflict is: let the teachers and the nurses and the doctors, and so on, let everybody take a bit of time to look at the information that we've provided on our Government website so people can look for themselves at what we're offering. 'Actually what we're offering is reasonable and generous. We're saying all your pension entitlements you've got until now will be protected; if you're going to retire within 10 years there will be no change; if you're on a low or middle income your pension will be the same, if not better than it was before. 'I think the trade union bosses are really doing a disservice - obviously to the public - but also to their own members by not allowing their members to make up their own minds based on the information that we're providing in our reasonable offer from the Government.'","British immigration officials set to strike on November 30 over pensions .

"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 1:34 PM on 23rd November 2011 . Pakistan's ambassador to the U.S. resigned last night just days after a businessman said he was behind a memo that accused the Pakistani military of plotting a coup in May. Envoy Husain Haqqani said in a Twitter message that he had sent his resignation to prime minister Syed Gillani. State television said it had been accepted. In a statement, Mr Haqqani said: 'I have resigned to bring closure to this meaningless controversy threatening our fledgling democracy. 'I have served Pakistan and Pakistani democracy to the best of my ability and will continue to do so.' Stepping down: Pakistan's U.S. ambassador Hussein Haqqani (right), pictured with President Asif Ali Zardari in August, has resigned over claims he wrote a memo to Washington asking for its help in reining in the country's military . Pakistan today moved quickly to fill the vacant post after tension between the civilian government and military by appointing Sherry Rehman, a former information minister and human rights campaigner, as Mr Haqqani's successor. Her appointment came as a surprise, with many analysts and media pundits expecting someone seen as closer to the military. Businessman Mansoor Ijaz, writing in a column in the Financial Times on October 10, said a senior Pakistani diplomat had asked that a memo be delivered to the Pentagon. It pleaded for U.S. help to stave off a military coup in the days after America's May 2 raid that killed Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, he said. Mr Ijaz later identified the diplomat as Haqqani, who denies involvement in the memo. No evidence has emerged that the military was plotting a coup and the Pentagon at the time dismissed the memo as not credible. Replacement: Former Information Minister Sherry Rehman has already been appointed as Mr Haqqani's successor . Close ties: U.S. Senator John Kerry talks to Mr Haqqani (left) alongside Mr Zardari (right) during a visit to Multan during the summer . Mr Haqqani today said: 'I still maintain that I did not conceive, write or distribute the memo. 'This is not about the memo. This is about bigger things.' He declined to comment further. Mr . Haqqani's resignation followed a meeting with Pakistan President Asif . Zardari, the nation's powerful army chief General Ashfaq Kayani and its . intelligence head, Lieutenant-General Ahmad Shuja Pasha. A spokesman for the prime minister's office said Mr Haqqani was asked to resign and there would be an investigation into the memo. Mr Haqqani is a former journalist who covered Afghanistan's civil war and later wrote a book on the role of radical Islam and the military in Pakistan. With his crisp suits and colourful turns of phrase, he has developed close ties with Washington's top power brokers as Pakistan's envoy since 2008. In the past year, he has sought to ease tempers in both capitals and find common ground during an extraordinarily tense period in U.S.-Pakistani relations that included the Bin Laden raid, the jailing of a CIA contractor, and U.S. accusations that Pakistan backed a militant attack on its embassy in Kabul. He is close to Zardari but estranged from Pakistan's military. A Pakistani shepherd herds his goats past the hideout of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was killed by US Special Forces in a ground operation in May . Tensions between Pakistan's civilian . government and military have bedeviled the nuclear-armed South Asian . country for almost its entire existence, with the military ruling the . country for more than half of its 64-year history after a series of . coups. Mr Haqqani's resignation was seen by . many analysts as further weakening the civilian government, which is . already beset by allegations of corruption and incompetence. Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst in Islamabad, said: 'The military may expect much more from the government, much more beyond the resignation of Husain Haqqani, because they see that everybody perceived to be involved in this affair will be seen as anti-military and by implication anti-state.' Vali Nasr, a former senior State Department official who worked on Pakistan, said the issue would be unlikely to have a major impact on the strained U.S.-Pakistan relationship unless it seriously weakened or toppled the civilian government. As U.S. officials focus on thorny diplomatic and security issues with Pakistan, Mr Haqqani's departure did not immediately make many visible ripples in Washington. Democratic Senator John Kerry, who has been heavily involved in U.S.-Pakistani relations, said he was sorry to learn of Mr Haqqani's resignation. Senator Kerry said he respected the Pakistani government's decision but that Mr Haqqani would be missed 'as we continue to work through the ups and downs of our relationship'.","President Asif Zardari asked Husain Haqqani to resign .

Debbie Garlick went to visit fiancee Mr Prout at HMP Rye Hill, Warwickshire, on Thursday, moments before detectives found the body of strangled Kate Prout, 55, in rural Gloucestershire. Ms Garlick, 40, who is the mother of Prout's 22-month-old daughter Evie, took their child along for the two-hour visit on Thursday. Nightmare: Prout with fiancee, and mother of his child, Debbie Garlick shortly before his conviction. Before Prout confessed Ms Garlick campaigned to get his conviction overturned . According to The Sun, Ms Garlick remarked to police after being told of the discovery: 'Now her body's been found, it's real and has hit home. 'This isn't about me, it's about her and her loved ones who will now want to give her a rightful and proper burial.' The discovery of Kate Prout's body came just days after Adrian Prout, 49, dramatically confessed to her murder in prison, over a year after he had been convicted of the crime. Wedding day: The Prouts in 2000. His shock confession came four years after Mrs Prout, a retired schoolteacher mysteriously vanished . Last Monday he led officers to a secluded spot on the couple’s £1.6million country estate in Redmarley, Gloucestershire, and digging started.

"By . Chris Greenwood . Last updated at 3:10 AM on 26th November 2011 . Facing jail: Terry Adams, 56, walked straight back into his criminal lifestyle and now faces years behind bars . Britain's most feared gangster could face years in prison over a £16,000 makeover. Terry Adams, 56, walked out of jail after serving half of a seven-year sentence for money laundering and straight back into his high-rolling lifestyle. He splashed £7,500 on a Harley Street facelift, up to £7,000 on dental work and £2,000 on gym membership at a luxury hotel used by the England football team, The Grove in Hertfordshire. His wife Ruth even gave him back a prized £2,200 gold Cartier watch she bought at a police auction of his confiscated possessions. But he failed to declare the spending spree to the authorities, breaking a court order forcing him to declare anything he owned or purchased worth more than £500. Wearing a light blue cashmere Ralph Lauren sweater, Adams gently shook his head yesterday as he was jailed for eight weeks. The former gangland boss could now be made to serve the remaining two years of his original sentence as his actions breached the terms of his release licence. City of Westminster magistrates’ court heard that Adams has paid less than half of £750,000 of criminal assets he was ordered to hand over on his conviction in 2007. Bought back: The gangster's wife Ruth Adams purchased his gold watch back from police . District Judge Quentin Purdy said: ‘It . seems to me you are a shrewd and calculating individual, quite clearly . determined not to pay this money as you should.’ Adams built up an estimated fortune of £200million through a vast . racketeering and drug trafficking empire with his brothers Tommy and . Patsy. The crime gang, known as the A Team, collected a huge portfolio of . properties, antiques and art and has been linked to 25 murders. The brothers were so feared that they franchised out the Adams name so . lesser criminals could say they were working with or for them. Police and MI5 bugged Adams’s mansion in Finchley, north London, as part . of a ten-year operation aimed at bringing down the crime lord. The property, bought for £1million cash and now sold, was furnished with . antiques and paintings including Meissen figures and Henry Moore . etchings. Potential witnesses have been too terrified to testify against Adams but . he was jailed four years ago for the relatively minor charge of money . laundering. He was caught out by new ‘Al Capone’ laws designed to stop mobsters from . enjoying the benefits of their crimes. The court heard that while in . jail, Adams filled in forms requiring him to declare his spending and . assets. But on his release detectives became suspicious after discovering he was . splashing money around and enjoying meals in expensive restaurants. Adams admitted four charges of breaching a Financial Reporting Order. His barrister Malcolm Swift QC said he is a ‘broken man’ and ‘completely . paranoid’ that he is being watched by undercover officers. ‘He doesn’t . even drive a car or use the telephone because he is determined nothing . should be misconstrued,’ he said. Outside court Mrs Adams said: ‘Terry is severely dyslexic. ‘He did not fill out the forms, a solicitor did it for him. He is not what everyone thinks.’ A spokesman for the Serious Organised Crime Agency said: ‘Financial . Reporting Orders are intended to be preventive rather than punitive . measures to make  re-offending more difficult.’","Terry Adams failed to declare a £16,000 spending spree .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:32 PM on 25th November 2011 . A gang who produced 9,000 bottles of sub-standard fake vodka in a £1.5m scam have been jailed. The five men attempted to flood the market with fake alcohol by producing the vodka from their own bottling and distribution plant near Great Dalby, Leicestershire. Officers seized 9,000 bottles marketed as Glen's vodka, as well as manufacturing equipment and counterfeit packaging. Gang: The five men (left to right), Kevin Eddishaw, John Mark Humphreys, Mark Gyles, Michael Matthews and James Fyfe produced fake spirits 'with no thought for the safety of themselves or others' A court heard that the hugely dangerous operation could have triggered a major explosion, as the alcohol vapour alone from the vodka would have caused a massive blast if a naked flame or cigarette had been lit. Today Kevin Eddishaw, 57, from Southwell, Nottinghamshire, John Mark Humphreys, 46, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, James Fyfe, 51, from Nottingham and Michael Matthews, 56, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, were jailed for a combined 16 years and ten months. The fifth member of the group, Mark Gyles, 48, from Nottingham, received a 12-month sentence, suspended for 12 months. Hull Crown Court heard there was a complete lack of any fire or safety measures in the gang's unit, posing a serious and life-threatening hazard. The manufacturing and distribution plant was set up 'without any thought for the safety of those working there or nearby'. Police seized 9,000 bottles of fake vodka at the remote production facility used by the gang in Leicestershire . The five men produced a further 165,000 bottles of vodka falsely marketed as 'Glen's' between 2008 and 2009 . The court heard Eddishaw was the principal gang member who masterminded the plot, while Humphreys was his right hand man and Fyfe the site foreman of Moscow Farm. Gyles was a driver who transported the goods, with Matthews employed as a printer who obtained supplies of counterfeit labels and boxes. A spokesperson for HMRC said the revenue loss to the Exchequer due to the scam was thought to be £1.5m. Mass scale: Huge pieces of manufacturing equipment can be seen inside the plant in remote Leicestershire . Officers also found 25,000 litres of pure denatured alcohol, enough to produce 100,000 bottles of vodka . Simon De Kayne, assistant director of criminal investigation for HMRC, said: 'This was a substantial production, bottling and distribution plant with the infrastructure to distribute large quantities of counterfeit Glen's vodka throughout the country. 'But it was set up without any thought for the safety of those working there or in the area nearby. 'The gang were fully aware the counterfeit vodka they manufactured contained highly dangerous chemicals, making it unfit for human consumption, but were interested only in making a profit at the expense of British taxpayers.' Evidence showed that at least a further 165,000 bottles of fake vodka were manufactured at Moscow Farm during 2008 and 2009. They had been distributed to independent stores across the UK. Dangerous: The group used bleach to remove the colouring from methylated spirits in the plant, before diluting it to the required strength for vodka . Scam: Huge amounts of counterfeit packaging and labels were also seized as part of the operation . HMRC officers had seized the same illicit vodka from shops in Salford, London and South Wales. Forensic analysis showed it was a positive match for the vodka seized at Moscow Farm. In addition, more than 25,000 litres of pure denatured alcohol (methylated spirits) was seized, enough to make around 100,000 bottles of vodka. Denatured alcohol is used as a solvent and contains hundreds of additives. It is coloured purple to distinguish it from drinkable alcohol and is not fit for human consumption. Bleach was used by the gang to remove the colouring to make it clear before diluting to the required strength.","Group had made 165,000 bottles of fake alcohol between 2008 and 2009 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Last updated at 4:52 PM on 5th October 2011 . Prince Harry will fire a live missile for the first time when he arrives in the U.S. this week to take part in an intense eight-week training programme in one of the world's most awesome fighting machines. The 27-year-old royal will take the controls of an Apache helicopter in a mega-shooting range at Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field in Imperial Valley in the Californian desert. He is already qualified to fly the aircraft after passing earlier this year but in order for him to be 'battle ready' he now has to complete a 'Conversion to Role' course and could face battle as early as next year. One road town: Prince Harry will attend training at an air force base just outside the tiny desert community of Gila Bend, Arizona, next month . Tough training: The prince in front of an Apache helicopter earlier this year. He . will stay at Gila Bend as part of a 12-week RAF Apache course . A spokesman for St James's Palace said: 'The training in the USA will consist of environmental training, live . firing and tactical exercises.' Prince Harry will be in for a shock when he arrives at Gila Bend. It is a dusty one-road town that boasts a population of just 1,700 and 'five old crabs' - and has just one bar. After two lavish summer holidays - in Hvar, Croatia, and at a luxury villa in Majorca - Harry's forthcoming trip promises to be slightly more demanding. He will stay at the remote location as part of a 12-week RAF Apache helicopter training course, following a short time in El Centro, California, where he will arrive in the first week of October. Gila Bend has been chosen by military chiefs because its environment is similar to Afghanistan. The U.S. Air Force Base is . basic with just one runway, an air-traffic control tower, a few tents . and a couple of building and is surrounded by giant cacti. Facilities are so sparse that most RAF pilots visiting on the course - Exercise Crimson Eagle - stay in the adjacent town. While Harry is used to staying aboard yachts and in some of the world's most luxurious hotels, Gila Bend's top lodgings costs just £60 per night. The Space Age Lodge - a Best Western - has bizarrely been designed to look like a space ship. All there is: Bartender Brigette Mowry works at Netos, the only nightlife option in Gila Bend . Two horse town? Local Cowboy Terrell Farnsworth hasn't even heard of Prince 'Henry' During his stay in Croatia last month, Harry was photographed jumping fully-clothed into a swimming pool surrounded by fellow party-goers dancing to thumping music. But Gila Bend has only one small pool at the quirky Space Age Lodge. A receptionist said: 'Visitors who are not staying at the hotel can use the pool for $2.50 (£1.60). Harry will be welcome to come if he wants.' And it seems Harry, who is used to being recognised wherever he goes, might get a different reception in Gila Bend, where many residents are clueless as to his identity. Local cowboy Terrell Farnsworth, 49, said: 'I have no idea who Prince Henry is. I've never heard of him.' He joked: ""The girls are going to go crazy if there's a prince coming here. All five of them. 'The town is very small. They built a freeway around it a few years back and it killed the town. Now people just drive around it when they used to go through it and stop off.' Barren: A rusty bridge just outside Gila Bend, the area has been chosen because if its similarities to the conditions in Afghanistan . Should the single prince be looking for an American bride in Gila Bend, then it seems his options will also be limited. Brigette Mowry, 45, the bartender at Gila Bend's only bar, Netos, said: 'There's nothing really here so most of the young women move away as soon as they can. 'The women here are usually a bit older and already married. Most of the people who live here are retired. 'Sometimes the British pilots come in here and play pool or have a beer. 'We occasionally have karaoke and live music here and that's when the few girls of the town come in. 'If we put on a karaoke night here that'll be his only chance of meeting any of them.' At ease: Fellow clubbers take their cue from Prince Harry as he strutted his stuff barefoot on the side of an swimming pool at a Croatian nightspot last month . Soaked: The prince was having such a good time he jumped into the pool at the Veneranda nightclub . Local tourist sights are also limited - a small, one-room museum displays old Native American antiques found in the area. Day-trips include the Butterfield Pass Trail - an historic hiking path Mormons moving to the West Coast once used. Nearby are some native American rock carvings created by old tribes who lived in the area. Harry could also head down to the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument - a national park forest of huge cacti. The course at Gila Bend is the culmination of Harry's . training in flying Apache helicopter gunships, which he has been doing . back home at RAF Wattisham in Suffolk. Following the U.S. leg of his . training, Harry - known as Captain Wales in the Army Air Corps - will . return to Britain where he take part in final exercises before any . possible deployment.","The 27-year-old royal will arrive at Gila Bend for military training this week .

"By . Emma Reynolds . Last updated at 4:16 PM on 21st November 2011 . The agent of Labour MP Chris Bryant has been imprisoned after he was caught with a huge stash of 'the most serious child pornography police have ever seen'. Stephen Carnell, who was a chairman on a primary school board of governors in Mr Bryant's south Wales constituency, was sentenced to three years in jail. The 58-year-old was found with 12,130 pornographic images, as well as material showing sadism and bestiality, Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court was told. Shocking discovery: Stephen Carnell, who helped Chris Bryant win his seat in last year's election, was found with an enormous collection of hardcore pornography . The divorced father of two helped shadow justice minister Mr Bryant to a resounding victory in Rhondda during last year's election. He had worked as a Labour councillor in Tonypandy in Rhondda and also sat on the board at another school, the court heard. Carnell began downloading paedophilic images eight years ago - and became obsessed with the 'disturbing and appalling' scenes. A spokesman for Chris Bryant, above, said that any comment would come from Welsh Labour, who said: 'Steve Carnell was expelled from the Labour Party immediately following his conviction' When police visited his home, Carnell let them in, saying: 'The child pornography is on my laptops. I've been stupid.' Police saw the disturbing images on five laptops and storage equipment at his home, said David Pugh, prosecuting. Mr Pugh said: 'He was also distributing the images through internet . file-sharing to swap with other paedophiles.' The prosecutor said many of the images were of the most serious category, level four and five, showing 'sexual activity with children, sadism and bestiality'. He said Carnell had admitted to being 'sexually interested in both male and female images on his computer'. But he added: 'Carnell denied being sexually attracted to children in real life.' The election agent  admitted a total of 47 charges, consisting of 35 counts of making indecent images, seven counts of . possessing and four counts of distributing indecent photographs of . children between May 2003 and March 2011. There were 12,130 images and 453 films of paedophilia - . showing the abuse of babies as young as 12 months as well as boys and girls up to the age of 11. Stephen Jury, defending, said Carnell had a 'good character' and had been a 'hard-working man' for 39 years. He said: 'He has operated at a high professional level but he has lost his employment. 'From the time he was arrested, he has co-operated and done what he can to assist police. 'He appreciates the need to join a sex offenders' treatment programme.' A . reference was handed to Judge John Curran but the author was not . identified. Judge Curran said: 'This is not a victimless crime - small children are . subjected to the most appalling abuse for these photos and videos to be . made. 'Anyone who is twisted enough to take part in this activity is going to . be severely dealt with especially as there is an element of . distribution. 'This has been one of the largest number of images and movies I've ever . had to deal with.' Carnell was ordered to register as a sex offender for . life and banned from ever working with children. A spokesman for Mr Bryant said that any comment would come from Welsh Labour, who said: 'Steve Carnell was expelled from the Labour Party immediately following his conviction.'","Stephen Carnell was chairman of governors at a primary school in Mr Bryant’s constituency .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 3:34 PM on 26th November 2011 . Pope Benedict XVI insisted today sexual abuse was not just confined to within the church, but affected every institution in society. His remarks to U.S. bishops during an audience at the Vatican hinted at recent high-profile American sex abuse cases which do not involve the clergy. The pope added that he felt paedophilia was a 'scourge' for all society, and that he understood decades of scandals over clergy abusing children had left Catholics in the United States bewildered. Speaking out: Pope Benedict, pictured earlier this week, said today all of society's institutions should be held to 'exacting' standards in their response to the sex abuse of children, not just the church . 'It is my hope that the Church's . conscientious efforts to confront this reality will help the broader . community to recognize the causes, true extent and devastating . consequences of sexual abuse, and to respond effectively to this scourge . which affects every level of society,' he said. 'By the same token, just as the church is rightly held to exacting standards in this regard, all other institutions, without exception, should be held to the same standards,' the pope said. The pedophile scandal has exploded in recent decades in the United States, but similar clergy sex abuse revelations have tainted the church in many other countries, including Mexico, Ireland, and several other European nations, including Italy. But the most high-profile sex abuse case in the United States at the moment doesn't involve the church. Accused: Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky allegedly took high school pupils out of class in order to abuse them outside school grounds . Penn State university's former defensive football coordinator Jerry Sandusky has been charged with sexually abusing eight boys, and the fallout has led to the firing of longtime coach Joe Paterno and the departure of university president Graham Spanier. College football in the U.S. is highly popular. The scandal has shaken the reputation of a college program that long had prided itself on integrity. Benedict didn't address accusations by many victims and their advocates that church leaders, including at the office in the Vatican that Benedict headed before becoming pontiff, systematically tried to cover up the scandals, and that they have rarely been held accountable for that. Taken away: Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, centre, is led away by police after being arrested in Harrisburg earlier this month . Investigations, often by civil authorities, revealed that church hierarchy frequently transferred pedophile priests from one parish to another. Benedict told the bishops that his papal pilgrimage to the United States in 2008 'was intended to encourage the Catholics of America in the wake of the scandal and disorientation caused by the sexual abuse crisis of recent decades.' Echoing sentiment he has expressed in occasional meetings with victims of the abuse on trips abroad, Benedict added: 'I wish to acknowledge personally the suffering inflicted on the victims and the honest efforts made to ensure both the safety of our children and to deal appropriately and transparently with allegations as they arise.' Benedict seemed to be reflecting some churchmen's contentions that the church has wrongly been singled out as villains for the abuse. The bishops were making periodic consultations with the Vatican, scheduled for every five years.","Pope tells U.S. bishops he understands decades of scandals has left American Catholics 'bewildered'

As one of the Duke of Wellington’s most skilful generals, he fought on the frontline of some of the bloodiest Napoleonic wars and was the highest ranking officer to die at the Battle of Waterloo. So it is perhaps unsurprising that, to celebrate Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Picton’s military heroism, a large portrait of the Welshman hangs inside the court house in Carmarthen, South Wales. But today it emerged that a row has broken out about the painting, which lawyers claim is offensive and should not be displayed behind the judge’s chair in Carmarthen Crown Court. They say Sir Thomas’s reputation as a cruel and brutal colonial governor – he was military governor of Trinidad at the turn of the 19th century, where he was accused of torturing a young slave girl - mean his image should not be associated with modern equality and justice. The portrait of Sir Thomas Picton, Lawyers say Sir Thomas's reputation as a cruel and brutal colonial governor - he was military governor of Trinidad at the turn of the 19th century, where he was accused of torturing a young slave girl - mean his image should not be associated with modern equality and justice . Pride of place: The painting has hung above the judge's chair at Carmarthen court house for the last 182 years . Sir Thomas Picton was born in Poyston, Pembrokeshire in 1758. In 1771 at the tender age of just 13, he was commissioned to enlist in the 12th regiment which was commanded by his uncle. Jack Hawkins (above) played the role of . Sir Thomas Picton in the 1970 film 'Waterloo'. Sir Thomas was leading . the British infantry in civilian clothing - and carrying his umbrella - . when a French musket-ball penetrated his top hat and killed him . instantly . He first saw active service in St Lucia in 1796, shortly after which he served as governor of Trinidad. It . was during his tenure as governor in the West Indies that he acquired . both a reputation for having a violent temperament and respect for . courageously leading troops into battle. He is chiefly remembered for serving under the Duke Of Wellington in the Iberian Peninsula War and at the Battle Of Waterloo. He became the most senior British officer to die when a French musket-ball penetrated his top hat and killed him instantly. Sir . Thomas was leading the British infantry in civilian clothing - and . carrying his umbrella - at the time, due to his uniform having failed to . reach him. However,  Carmarthenshire Museum, who . own the 8ft x 4ft portrait, disagree and say it was specifically . commissioned for the court house, where it has lived for the past 182 . years, and should stay. Criminal lawyer Kate Williams, who is . among those calling for the painting to be taken down, said: 'I . appreciate the painting for historical purposes and that he (Picton) was . a figure of note. 'But I find it very offensive that . someone who was not only a known slaver, but also allegedly tortured a . slave, should have his picture in a place where the values of justice . are served. 'It’s fair to say he has a murky past . and it is inappropriate to have his picture in a modern court of law, . where we are supposed to represent the principles of equality and . justice for all. 'I think people might misread the . prominence of the picture as saying he has done something worthwhile to . contribute towards justice, which really isn't the case.' Sir Thomas, who was born in Poyston, . Pembrokeshire, in 1758, was appointed military governor of Trinidad . following the British victory in 1797 where he oversaw the production of . sugar by slaves on the island’s plantations. But he operated a brutally authoritarian regime which lead to accusations of slave torture, false imprisonment and execution. In 1806 he was called back to Britain . and faced trial in London over claims he authorised the torture of a . 13-year-old girl, Louisa Calderon, who was accused of robbery, by . forcing her to stand on a sharpened wooden peg while suspended from the . ceiling. This form of torture was dubbed . 'Pictoning' at the trial and, although he was found guilty, Sir Thomas . later overturned his conviction on appeal and went on to resume his . military career. His greatest successes came in Spain, . where he was instrumental in the Battle of Vitoria, helping Wellington . eventually claim victory in the Peninsular War. Sir Thomas was killed after being was . shot through the temple by a musket ball at the Battle of Waterloo, . where, Welsh folklore contends, he fought in his top hat and tails . because his uniform had not arrived at the frontline in time. The portrait, by Sir Martin Archer Shee, was presented to the former Carmarthen Borough Council on September 2 1829. It was placed in the town¿s Guildhall (pictured) ¿ which is now used as a court ¿ and has been hanging in the same spot ever since.

Ann Dorset, a spokeswoman for the . museum, said that although Sir Thomas was a 'cruel and brutal' governor . of Trinidad, he was a 'a man of his time' and should not be judged by . today’s standards. 'I think it would be a shame to move the painting from its original home,' she said. 'Picton was a very well respected . general but on the other hand he was regarded as a rough and tough man . and a great disciplinarian. 'He was a great leader of men and these wars were tough. 'It was hand to hand fighting and they were not like the battles of today. He would have been right in the middle of it. 'I think we have to accept Picton warts and all and not judge him by today's standards.' Richard Goodridge, former mayor of Carmarthen, said removing the painting would be churlish. He said: 'Louisa Calderon suffered no ill effects from the treatment she received and required no medical attention afterwards. 'After she was released from custody she walked more than a mile to the store where the crime took place, smoking a cigar. 'In February 1810 the court ordered . Picton's recognisance and no further action ever took place. He was, and . remains to this day, innocent of all the charges. 'Lieutenant General Sir Thomas .

"By . Rick Dewsbury . Last updated at 3:38 PM on 26th November 2011 . All expenses paid: Prince Andrew has been on more trips than last year since quitting as a UK trade envoy . Prince Andrew has been on more taxpayer-funded overseas trips this year despite stepping down from his trade role over links to a convicted paedophile. The Duke of York gave up his role as a trade envoy for Britain when disturbing details emerged of his close friendship with Jeffery Epstein. But since then Andrew has spent more nights abroad and clocked up considerably more miles than in the same period last year. The trips have included stays in a string of luxury hotels and the use of a private jet at a cost of about £40,000 for a trip to Saudi Arabia. Campaigners branded the Duke's overseas travels 'shocking' and called on him to reign in the expenses. Prince Andrew had been expected to cut back on expenses-paid trips when he left his role as Special Representative for UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) in July this year. But he has since spent 28 days abroad, visiting Saudi Arabia, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi. He covered more than 40,800 miles. In the same period last year he spent 22 nights abroad, flying about 29,500 miles, according to the Telegraph. The total cost to the taxpayer could exceed the figure from last year, which came in at £358,763. He does not have a paid position for the costs are met by taxpayers. Also included in Adrew's trips were luxurious hotel suites, advertised at up to £7,700 a night, during a 12-day tour of Hong Kong, China and Malaysia.

Hong Kong, which claims to offer the ‘finest in 21st Century luxury’ and . its sister hotel in Kuala Lumpur, which boasts custom-carved door . handles and ‘sumptuous’ beds. John O’Connell, the research director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said the most recent figures raised questions about the Duke's 'value for money'. 'Taxpayers will wonder why they are paying even more for Prince Andrew’s jet-set lifestyle now that he has quit as trade commissioner,' he told the Telegraph. 'Many wondered whether the Prince was . providing value for money before he quit, it’s shocking that he’s . costing even more now despite not having a formal role in representing . the country on trade issues. Paedophile scandal: Prince Andrew's friend Jeffrey Epstein . 'It’s time the Prince drastically cut back on his foreign jaunts at taxpayers’ expense.' The fourth-in-line to the throne, nicknamed Air Miles Andy for his reputation for foreign trips, faced . pressure earlier this year after being caught up in revelations about . Epstein, a billionaire financier. Epstein faced a lawsuit being brought by alleged child sex victims. The abuse was said to have taken place at his mansions, including one in Palm Beach, Florida, that Andrew had visited. The Duke faced the prospect of being called as a witness in any future trials to explain his relationship to the billionaire and his knowledge of such activities. Two months before the revelations, Epstein and Andrew were photographed in conversation while walking in New York’s Central Park, while the Duke was a guest of the tycoon. Epstein had earlier been jailed for two years after he was jailed for soliciting prostitution from minors. He served 13 months. That was bad enough but even Andrew's most loyal supporters were left floundering when a photograph emerged in late February of the smiling duke with his arm around 17-year-old Virginia Roberts, an 'erotic masseuse' who was sexually abused by Epstein. She was one of dozens of teenage girls allegedly abused by Epstein. A spokesman for UKTI said: 'When the Duke stood down as Special Representative for Trade and Investment it was always the intention that he would continue to work with the Government to promote British trade and investment overseas, and the recent trips are evidence of that.' Buckingham Palace said the trips had been arranged before the Prince had stepped down.","28 days abroad including trips to Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Abu Dhabi .

GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain has risked the wrath of Occupy Wall Street protesters by fuming that they are only holding demostrations to distract from President Obama's failed policies. The businessman addressed protesters in a Wall Street Journal interview, saying: 'Don't blame Wall Street, don't blame the big banks, if you don't have a job and you're not rich, blame yourself.' Meanwhile around $35,000 has now been sent to the protesters who have been camped out in Manhattan, New York, for almost three weeks now - angry at the state of U.S. politics and economics.

A mother whose home was allegedly torched when her jilted lover set himself ablaze in the house has died in hospital after two months in a coma. Tracy Jones, 40, had been receiving treatment since late September following the blaze at the house in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, which killed her 15-year-old son Shaun. She had been induced into a coma because of the severity of her burns but died in Whiston Hospital. Her ex-partner, David Potts, 39, also suffered serious burns and died a short time after the fire was started in the early hours of September 19. Victims: Tracy Jones, left, pictured with her surviving daughter Cailin, has died in hospital two months after the attack by her former partner . Mr Potts had reportedly set himself alight at her house. Ms Jones's other children, who were in the house at the time, continue to receive treatment for their injuries. Daughter Cailin, 18, awoke from her . coma but remains in hospital where police said she is making a 'gradual . recovery', while son, Zachary, four, has been discharged but continues . to receive daily medical aid. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman . said: 'A joint investigation between police and Greater Manchester Fire . and Rescue Service continues.' Police had previously confirmed there . had been contact between them and Ms Jones, believed to be over unwanted . attention from Mr Potts, in the month before the fire. The police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), is investigating how officers dealt with that contact. Tragic: Shaun Van Straaten was 15 when he died in the days after the attack . Potts, 39, was taken to hospital suffering from severe burns following the attack but died a short time after the blaze. Potts had reportedly gone to the house in Barlow Road in Broadheath, Altrincham and set himself alight. Local reports suggested that Potts had split up with Ms Jones and had attempted to get back with her but was rebuffed. The . 39-year-old apparently left a Facebook message for Miss Jones prior to . the attack, saying: ‘I used to be happy but now I am sad. I used to . laugh, now I cry. ‘I used . to be someone, now I am no one’, he added just four hours before going . to her home, where they allegedly had an argument.' After the row, he is said to have poured petrol over his body and screamed: ‘If I can’t have you, no one will’, and lit a match. The . former couple are said to have had a one-year on-off relationship, . which began when his teenage son Nathan started dating Cailin. Potts and Jones’s relationship was apparently ‘stormy’ and police had reportedly been called to the house on several occasions. Potts . is also said to have fallen out with Shaun last October and wrote him a . message saying: 'Please read this before telling me to f*** off… I am . sorry for what happened.’ He then wrote on Facebook afterwards: ‘Why is life so hard – you can’t live with them but you can’t live without them.’ After . getting back together briefly, Potts and Jones split again in August . and he posted on Facebook one month ago: ‘My life is s***.

The Vermont-based ice-cream company, known for standing up for liberal issues, slammed the ‘immoral’ inequality between classes in the U.S. It followed House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi backing the movement as the political debate around the protests intensified. Ice-cream: Ben & Jerry’s said it has the ‘deepest admiration’ for protesters because of the U.S. unemployment crisis and rising cost of higher education . Ben & Jerry’s said it has the ‘deepest admiration’ for protesters because of the U.S. unemployment crisis and rising cost of higher education. ‘We know that words are relatively easy but we wanted to act quickly to demonstrate our support,’ a statement on its website said. ‘We realise that Occupy Wall Street is calling for systemic change. ‘We support this call to action and are honoured to join you in this call to take back our nation and democracy.’ Liberal attitudes: Ben & Jerry's co-founders Ben Cohen, left, and Jerry Greenfield, right, are known for giving away free ice-cream (file picture) Ben & Jerry's, which is part of the Unilever conglomerate, is well-known as an outspoken anti-capitalist company. 'We support this call to action and are honoured to join you in this call to take back our nation and democracy' Ben & Jerry's board of directors . ‘We seek and support nonviolent ways to achieve peace and justice,’ its mission statement on the Unilever website reads. ‘We believe government resources are more productively used in meeting human needs than in building and maintaining weapons systems.’ It was founded in 1978 and two years ago launched a 'Hubby Hubby' ice-cream in support of same-sex marriage. Big protest: A large group of protesters affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement attempted to cross the Brooklyn Bridge on October 1 . The company also launched a 'Yes Pecan' flavour to celebrate Barack Obama's becoming U.S. president. Ben & Jerry’s often holds free ice-cream giveaways - so Occupy Wall Street protesters will be hoping that will be the case again here. It comes as concerns were raised that the protesters' New York camp in Zuccotti Park is being infiltrated by opportunists looking for sex and drugs. The National Air and Space Museum was closed in Washington D.C. on Saturday after anti-war protesters stormed it and were repelled by guards. They were the unlikely pair who used a $5 course in ice-cream making to become one of America's most iconic success stories in recent decades. Ben Greenfield and Jerry . Cohen set up a business with $12,000 in 1978, and it turned into one of the . most well-known ice-cream firms worldwide. The Vermont company tries to promote 'linked prosperity', so it is big on ethical business practices, sustainable growth and being socially responsible. It became a multimillion-dollar publicly traded company before being bought by conglomerate Unilever for a whopping $326million in 2000. Mr Cohen and Mr Greenfield kept away from the running of the company, but they often help out at openings of new stores. The duo were disillusioned that Unilever had not vigorously pursued the mission of corporate social responsibility it accepted with the purchase. But they have maintained their political affiliation despite the sell-out, and Unilever has brought out its own liberal flavours over the last two years. The 'Hubby Hubby' ice-cream was launched in 2009 to support same-sex marriage and 'Yes Pecan' marked Barack Obama's presidential election. But it caused a stir with its latest creation, 'Schweddy Balls', which was boycotted by a leading mothers' organisation who branded it 'vulgar'.","Ice-cream firm known for standing up for liberal issues .

A Doberman had to have five golf balls removed from his stomach in an emergency operation - and some of them may have been trapped inside him for more than six months. Worried owner Graham Saysell, 54, rushed Zac to the vets the day after he collapsed at home last month. Mr Saysell had no idea the balls were there until he was shown an X-ray. Emergency operation: Graham Saysell rushed his Doberman Zac to the vet after he fell ill - and discovered that he had five golf balls in his stomach . Vets believe the 18 month old dog ate the balls on five . different occasions and had been walking around with them in his stomach . for up to six months. Two of the balls were wedged in Zac's gut as his body tried to digest them and vets only gave him a 50/50 chance of survival. But a two-hour long emergency operation to remove the balls from his stomach was a success and he has since returned home. He was in a critical condition for three days. Mr Saysell rushed his Doberman to Heathcote Veterinary Centre in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, last month after he suddenly fell ill. The father-of-four, who lives with his wife Rachel, 47, said: 'It would've been devastating if he had died because we lost another dog, Max, at this time last year. 'It's incredibly upsetting when your pet is ill because they can't tell you what is wrong. When you look at the size of the golf balls it amazes me he managed to swallow one let alone five.

Graham, a former managing director of an automotive firm, said: 'I take Zac for a walk around the side of the golf course twice a day. 'Apparently he ate the balls over a period of about six months - which is quite amazing. 'It means he would have been walking around with these in his stomach for ages. 'But it only became a problem when two of them moved from his stomach into his gut. 'He was fine on the Friday before he fell ill but he started whimpering, vomiting, and could hardly move by the Sunday.

We took him to the vets on Monday morning and they were extremely worried. 'So they took an X-ray and found he had five golf balls in his stomach. They operated immediately but it was very touch and go. The op almost killed him as they had to cut very close to his pancreas. 'Thankfully he has made a full recovery and seems to be more boisterous than ever. 'I still don't know why he likes to eat golf balls - he probably thinks they're treats.' Vet Emily Emerson removed the balls from Zac's badly damaged gut - and said there were fears he may die. She said: 'It's not common to find dogs eating odd objects but we do see it from time to time. 'I have removed socks, children's toys, needles and more from dogs in the past. 'Two of the balls had passed into the gut as the body tried to digest them which caused the blockage.

Giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry, Mary Ellen Field described how the supermodel confronted her and accused her of being an alcoholic who was unintentionally passing private details to journalists.

Adviser: Mary Ellen Field (left) was accused of leaking stories to the press by her client Elle Macpherson. The allegations eventually led to her being sacked . It eventually emerged that the probable source of the stories was voicemails that had been hacked on the behest of the News of the World. Mrs Field, who is a specialist in intellectual property rights, laid out how she was working for an international tax and accountancy firm when she met Ms Macpherson in . 2003. She said she got on well with the model - who, like her, came from Sydney, Australia - and Ms Macpherson quickly became her client. Mrs Field said the partnership was 'very successful' from both a 'financial' and 'developmental' point of . view and they became friends. She told the inquiry the model would confide in her. But their relationship began to deteriorate after a series of stories appeared in the papers in 2005. These revolved around the breakdown of Ms McPherson's relationship to financier Arpad Busson. Mrs Field described the articles as 'tittle-tattle.' She said the model became concerned about 'listening devices' and security checks were carried out but nothing was found.

This was overturned by the Court of Appeal in early 2002, leading to public humiliation for the married father when his name was finally disclosed. Flitcroft told the Leveson Inquiry into press standards today that he 'strongly suspected' that reporters hacked his phone to discover details of a second woman with whom he had an affair. But he admitted he had no firm evidence that his voicemail messages were illegally intercepted. He told the inquiry: 'That is just speculation. I have no evidence at all. It just seems a massive coincidence that the same newspaper gets two girls in the space of a couple of months.' Flitcroft, who is now manager of Northern Premier League side Chorley FC, said he had an 'intimate relationship' with the first woman, whom he saw 'three or four times'. He claimed that she contacted him threatening to go to the press if he did not give her £3,000 for a breast enlargement operation, which he refused. The former footballer said the woman sent an envelope to his mother's house containing copies of text messages he had sent her and details of precisely when they went to a hotel together. Flitcroft said he showed the envelope to the solicitor of the Professional Footballers' Association, and as a result took out the injunction against the People. Explaining why he resorted to legal action, he said: 'I hold my hands up and I know I did wrong, but nobody's perfect and at the end of the day I had a wife and a kid, and I had a very close family, and I did not want it to get out to them.' The inquiry heard that the People was edited at the time by Neil Wallis, who went on to become executive editor of the News of the World. Flitcroft said the People printed hints about his identity, such as that he played for an 'unfashionable' club in the North West, before the injunction was overturned. The Bolton-born father-of-three, who is now separated from his wife and living with his girlfriend, Sarah Lancashire, said he was subsequently contacted by the second woman, who demanded £5,000 in return for not selling her story to the People. He said he was surprised by this because the first woman lived in Chester and the second in Stockport, and they did not know each other. 'I strongly suspect that my phone was hacked by journalists and as a result the second woman was contacted, and asked to sell her story to the papers,' he said in a statement to the inquiry. Carine Patry Hoskins, counsel to the inquiry, said both women denied blackmailing Flitcroft. Mrs Field said she was contacted by a . lawyer representing Ms Macpherson and told that the model was 'not prepared . to have me speaking in the press any more'. 'I was amazed. So I called Elle,' said Mrs Field. 'It was the first time she was really grouchy with me. She said ""I can't have you speaking to the media. You have been speaking . to the press"".' Mrs Field told the inquiry that she had 'absolutely not' been speaking to the media about Ms Macpherson. The situation finally came to a head . when Mrs Field returned home to find her husband had received a phone call from the model's lawyer. He . had said she was going to be sacked, adding 'Elle says she knows you . weren't doing it on purpose. You did it because you're an alcoholic'. Mrs Field agreed to attend a meeting with the model a few days later. 'Elle . wanted to see me on her own,' she told Lord Justice Leveson. I went in . and she puts her arms around me and cries and she says she knows what . it's like to be an alcoholic. 'She says she know I would never have spoken to the media if I was not an alcoholic.' Mrs Field told the inquiry that after half an hour of 'psychobabble', she asked to see her husband. He came in, along with representatives from Mrs Field's firm Chiltern and the supermodel's lawyer. 'I know it sounds like a B-movie,' Mrs Field continued. 'They proceeded to trash my reputation, trash everything and said I had to go to this place. I wasn't going to go.' Mrs Field and her husband left the meeting and went home. At that stage she was still adamant that she would not go into rehab. But a few days later, at a second meeting with the model, she gave in. 'She totally broke me down and I gave in and went to this horrible place,' she said. 'Elle had made out it was a spa. It was a grade one psychiatric hospital with men with guns parading around. 'For the first ten days you're in this hospital where there's no plugs in the hand basins in case you drown yourself. They try and make you take anti-depressants. I wouldn't take them and they thought I was hostile. 'I'm a runner . and I wanted to use the gym and they wouldn't let me because they said . it was 'obsessive behaviour'... 'They said I was getting intervention - like in those CIA renditions. 'I had to share a dormitory. One woman injected drugs between her toes. I'd never met anyone like that before. It was hard. 'After ten days they said that I wasn't an alcoholic and that I'd been bullied.' Mrs Field was diagnosed with adjustment disorder which she described as the American phrase for stress. But she stayed for the five-week programme - which was being paid for by her firm and Ms MacPherson - and then returned to work. She told Lord Justice Leveson that she had 'kept her side of the bargain' and believed that things would return to normal. However, she was immediately fired by Ms Macpherson and later made redundant by Chiltern in March 2006. Mrs Field said it was not until the arrest of News . of the World royal editor Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn . Mulcaire in August 2006 that she realised what had happened. The financial adviser said her experience had had a massive impact on her - both professionally and personally. She attributed the decline in her health, which eventually led to her having a pacemaker fitted in 2009, as at least partly related to what had happened. Mrs Field has spoken to police about her phone being hacked and is seeking damages through the High Court.","Financial adviser Mary Ellen Field gives evidence to Leveson Inquiry .

"By . Vanessa Allen and Colin Fernandez . Last updated at 9:03 AM on 22nd November 2011 . The mother of murdered Milly Dowler told yesterday of the cruel moment she was given false hope that her daughter was alive. Weeks after the 13-year-old disappeared, Sally Dowler was finally able to connect to her daughter’s mobile phone because some voicemail messages had been deleted. She recalled how she cried out to her husband, saying: ‘She’s picked up her voicemail – Bob, she’s alive.’ Scroll down for video . Faces of anguish: Bob and Sally Dowler giving evidence side by side to the Leveson Inquiry yesterday . Murdered: Milly Dowler was abducted and killed by Levi Bellfield . Mrs Dowler, 51, and her 59-year-old . husband were giving evidence about phone hacking to the Leveson Inquiry . into Press standards. The couple were not told by police until this year . that their daughter’s mobile phone was hacked by the News of the World, . and that messages were deleted. However in a surprise development last night, lawyers for the alleged hacker, private investigator Glenn Mulcaire who worked for the now defunct Sunday tabloid, denied he was responsible and claimed the police inquiry would confirm this. Milly was abducted by nightclub bouncer Levi Bellfield near her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. Her body was found six months later on Yateley Heath, Hampshire. Addressing the inquiry yesterday, the pain and anger was evident in Mrs Dowler’s voice. She said she had rung her daughter’s mobile repeatedly after she vanished. ‘At first we were able to leave messages, and then her voicemail became full and then you rang and then you just got the recorded, “You are unable to leave messages at the moment”,’ she said. Then, on one occasion, Mrs Dowler was able to connect to Milly’s voicemail system and in a moment of elation she heard her daughter’s voice on her recorded message. The revelation that Milly’s mobile phone . had been hacked by the News of the World triggered public outrage, and . was the catalyst for the establishment of the Leveson Inquiry. Frustration: Sally Dowler said she didn't sleep for three nights after being told that Milly's phone had been hacked . Denial: Lawyers for Glenn Mulcaire last night said he was not responsible for hacking Milly Dowler's mobile . The Dowlers learned about the hacking in April as they prepared for Bellfield’s murder trial. Mrs Dowler said: ‘As soon as I was told, literally I didn’t sleep for about three nights because you replay everything in your mind and just think, “Oh, that makes sense now”.’ The couple said they believed their own mobile phones or home phone had also been hacked. They told the inquiry how they . privately arranged to retrace their daughter’s steps seven weeks after . Milly disappeared. Three days later a photograph of Mrs Dowler appeared . in the News of the World. She . told the inquiry at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London: ‘We . did not see anyone – they must have used a telephoto lens. ‘How . on earth did they know we were doing that walk on that day? It felt . like such an intrusion into a really, really private grief moment.’ Mrs . Dowler said the media had helped to publicise Milly’s disappearance, . and to appeal for information about her. But she said her family had . been engulfed by constant attention from journalists at their home. The . couple, who gave their evidence sitting side by side, suffered brutal . cross-examination during Bellfield’s Old Bailey trial and their . treatment prompted a review of the way victims’ relatives are dealt with . by courts. They received a personal apology from News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch for the hacking. Mrs Dowler said Milly’s sister Gemma told him: ‘Use this as an opportunity to put things right in future and to have some decent standards and adhere to them.’ Mrs Dowler added: ‘It was a very tense meeting. He [Murdoch] was very sincere.’ Her husband said police had told the couple that Milly’s phone was hacked by private detective Glenn Mulcaire, who worked for the News of the World. False hope: Sally Dowler, right, told how the News of the World gave her 'false hope' that her daughter was accessing her voicemails. She is pictured here with her husband Bob and lawyer Mark Lewis arriving at the Leveson inquiry . Mulcaire was jailed, along with the paper’s former royal editor Clive Goodman, in January 2007 after they admitted intercepting voicemail messages left on phones belonging to aides to the Royal Family. Last night Mulcaire denied he had deleted messages on Milly’s phone. His solicitor Sarah Webb said: ‘He confirms that he did not delete messages and had no reason to do so.’ Scotland Yard has launched a criminal investigation into the claims surrounding phone hacking at the News of the World. The Dowlers started legal action against the paper and their case was settled for £2million earlier this year, with Mr Murdoch agreeing to make a £1million personal donation to charity. Accusations: Hugh Grant yesterday said the Mail on Sunday may have hacked his phone. The newspaper 'utterly refute' the claims . Hugh Grant made extraordinary claims yesterday that the Mail on Sunday may have hacked his phone to obtain a story about his relationship with Jemima Khan. Last night the newspaper ‘utterly refuted’ the allegations made by the actor during two-and-a-half hours of evidence to the Leveson Inquiry. The 51-year-old star said the story published in 2007 claimed his relationship with Jemima was on the rocks because of his ‘late-night phone calls with a plummy voiced studio executive’. He said the story was untrue and he believed the only explanation was messages left on his phone by an executive’s assistant with a ‘plummy’ voice. ‘I would love to hear what the (Mail on Sunday’s) explanation of that is, if it wasn’t phone hacking,’ he declared. The Mail on Sunday said the story had emanated from a freelance journalist who had been told by a source close to Jemima Khan herself and added: ‘Mr Grant’s allegations are mendacious smears driven by his hatred of the media.’ Challenged about his hacking claims against the Mail on Sunday, Mr Grant was asked by counsel for the inquiry Robert Jay QC: ‘You haven’t alleged that before, have you, in the public domain? I think the highest it can be put is frankly it’s a piece of speculation on your part, isn’t it, in relation to this question?’ During a combative appearance, the actor also accused the Daily Mail of obtaining information about the recent birth of his baby with Chinese ex-girlfriend Tinglan Hong from a source at a London hospital. The Mail unequivocally denied the allegation, saying the information came from a showbusiness source two weeks after the birth, and stressing that it spent a further two weeks seeking a response from Mr Grant’s representatives. ‘None was forthcoming and indeed we did not publish anything until Mr Grant’s publicist issued a statement describing the baby as the product of a “fleeting affair”. Throughout, the Mail behaved with total journalistic propriety.’ Mr Grant also claimed the Daily Mail had paid £125,000 to Miss Hong’s former boyfriend for pictures. In fact, it was the Mail on Sunday which conducted an interview with him, paying a fraction of the amount mentioned by Mr Grant to an agency for the interview and photographs. Actor Grant speaking at the Leveson Inquiry at the High Court also accused the Daily Mail of obtaining information about the recent birth of his baby with Chinese ex-girlfriend Tinglan Hong from a source at a London hospital . The actor, the first celebrity to appear before Lord Justice Leveson,  described phone-hacking as ‘cowardly, bullying and shocking’. He accused tabloid journalists of wide-ranging abuses and insisted it was time to regulate the press. During his evidence Mr Grant also made allegations against the Sun, Daily Mirror and the Daily Express – and the police, who he accused of leaking information. The actor said that the day after Miss Hong gave birth to his child, ‘the phone calls started’. Mr Jay said: ‘Whatever they were saying to you to get you to confirm or deny the story ... they didn’t publish the story did they? The Daily Mail did not publish the story until the news had been broken by someone else. The reason why they didn’t publish the story is because you didn’t confirm its truth.’ The inquiry heard that the Daily Mail did not run an article about the birth of Grant’s child until the story was broken by an American magazine. Mr Grant said: ‘I think the reason that they didn’t publish it was because they would not have looked good merely on leaked information from a hospital, which is unethical.’ Mr Grant claimed he had a conversation with Paul McMullan, a former News of the World journalist, in which he suggested the Daily Mail was prepared to buy hacked material. Mr Jay said: ‘He hasn’t given any details there of any phone-hacking involvement by the Daily Mail, has he?’ Mr Grant: ‘No.’ The actor was particularly withering in his contempt for the paparazzi who gathered outside Miss Hong’s home, accusing one photographer of deliberately driving his car at his former’s lover’s 61-year-old mother. Earlier this year, Mr Grant said he had to go to a London hospital in the ‘middle of the night’ and that details of his ailment and treatment had appeared a couple of days later in the Sun and Daily Express. It came five years after the Daily Mirror had run a story about Mr Grant’s visit to see a specialist at another London hospital. The article had contained details of his condition and treatment.","Glenn Mulcaire's lawyers said it wasn't him that hacked Milly's mobile .

"By . Nick Pisa . Last updated at 8:00 PM on 5th October 2011 . Freed Amanda Knox has revealed for the first time why she refused to look at the horrific photographs of murdered Meredith Kercher during her appeal and how she is 'not the Monster of Perugia.' Knox, 24, was sensationally released from jail earlier this week, along with her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 27, after being dramatically cleared of killing student Meredith, 21, who was found semi-naked and with her throat cut. During the trial graphic photographs of her mutilated body were shown to the court by the Kercher family lawyer Francesco Maresca, without the public gallery being cleared and which he justified by saying it was 'necessary to show her suffering.' Fresh agony: Stephanie Kercher, pictured today on her return to the UK, faces new turmoil after Amanda Knox revealed she couldn't bear to look at dead pictures of her sister in jail . Freed Amanda Knox insisted in never before seen notes that the evidence against as to whether she killed Meredith Kercher, right, was always 'unreliable and circumstantial' In never before seen notes written the . day they were shown Knox said:'I could not bring myself to look at the . photographs of Meredith's body because I could not stand to see the way . she had been reduced. 'I never saw Mez (Meredith) dead other than in those photographs which my lawyers showed me and which shocked me. I can't look at them calmly because Mez was my friend.' Freed Knox then added:'I am not the Monster of Perugia.' In his closing argument, prosecutor . Giuliano Mignini had attacked Knox and Sollecito for not looking at the . photographs - suggesting it was an indication of their guilt. The notes also reveal how Knox felt . she had been betrayed by the Italian police and prosecutors - a theme . she had mentioned in her dramatic and heartfelt plea of innocence just . before judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman and his jury retired to consider . their verdict. Writing in blue biro she said:'Justice . already failed me. Need for justice for Mez parallel, not contrasting , . with need for justice for me and Raf. 'No history of violence/mental disturbance. Didn't run away (the wicked flee).' She then added: 'Naive, unable to understand the aggressive insistence of the investigators, unable to defend myself. 'Our lives have been destroyed': Meredith's family have spoken of their agony . 'The development of the appeal highlights the fact that the evidence against me is either unreliable or circumstantial.' This was in reference to the . independent report carried out by two court appointed experts into the . DNA findings on two hotly contested pieces of evidence - the 30cm . kitchen knife found at Sollecito's apartment and a clasp from Meredith's . bloodied bra. The original trial heard how their was . DNA from Knox on the handle and that of Merdith on the blade but the . experts said that of the victim was so low that it should be considered . unreliable and not used to convict her of murder. Resting place: The flower-strewn temporary grave of Meredith Kercher, near her family home . While the clasp was found six weeks . after the murder and there was the very high possibility that the DNA . from Sollecito found on it was there by cross contamination - these were . the only two elements that put them both at the murder scene. Knox added in her notes, which were . written in a mixture of English and Italian, that she was 'naive to . believe the investigators were unbiased' as she described how she had . been pressured into wrongly naming bar man Patrick Lumumba as the . killer. After hours of questioning she had . said she had 'covered her ears as Patrick murdered Meredith in her . bedroom' which led him to being arrested and held in jail for two weeks . before being released. Homecoming: The Seattle home of Amanda Knox's family has been decorated in anticipation of her return . At her appeal trial earlier this week . she was convicted of this slander against him and given three years but . as she had already spent four in jail she was freed - although she was . ordered to pay him 22.000 Euro damages. She said:'The objective of the . interrogation was to leave me with no choice but to convince me to . confirm their premeditations against me,' before adding that police are . making mistakes by not believing their alibis. Knox also wrote:'No justice for Mez by perpetuating my injustice.'","Fresh agony for Kercher family. Sister shows strain back in England .

"By . Rick Dewsbury . Last updated at 5:37 PM on 26th November 2011 . Their golden arches have become a familiar sight on Britain's high streets. But now it seems that even McDonald's is losing faith in the ability to make money from French fries and burgers in some places. The fast-food chain has closed its only store in Rochdale town centre after trading there for 28 years. The recession-hit part of Lancashire is now among the few major towns without a McDonalds. Deprived: Rochdale town centre has seen a string of big-name stores leave the area after the credit crunch in 2009 caused revenue to fall . The move has been seen as the 'death knell' for the high street, which has struggled after the credit crunch in 2009. Just 11 months ago both Arcadia's Dorothy Perkins store and Burton  pulled out of the once-thriving Yorkshire Street in the town centre. Some have seen McDonald's withdrawal as a worrying barometer for retail nationwide, with Arcadia boss Sir Philip Green announcing this week that 260 of his stores are at risk of closure. McDonalds is the latest in a string of high-profile causalities in Rochdale. TJ Hughes pulled out of the town's Whetsheaf shopping centre two months ago. While the building next to the former McDonald's store had been occupied by the Body Shop but they left last year. Clothing chain Ethel Austin and Littlewoods have also closed. The town has been the third worst-hit town in the wake of the recession and 29 per cent of its buildings in the town centre stand empty. Charity shops, pawn brokers and discount stores such as Poundland have moved into some of the empty units. But residents still believe the area is becoming a 'ghost town'. Iconic: The 'golden arches' of a McDonald's are recognised globally . Rochdale is the 29th most deprived authority out of 326 in England with 7,741 people - almost six per cent of its population - on jobseeker's allowance. 'When even Ronald McDonald's no longer believes there's a cat in hell's chance of making a fast buck from burgers and Coke here, know that Rochdale Town Centre is finished,' resident  Abbie Hoffman wrote online. The council have made some attempts to regenerate the region with a planned tram link to Manchester and Oldham. 'That's supposed to bring people in. I'd say it makes it easier for them to leave,' former bus driver Anthony Smith, 65, told the Guardian. 'It's a dump.' Wife Liz, 59, added: 'Here it's just charity shops and pound shops.' Another pensioner agreed, saying she now goes elswhere to do her shopping. Andy Zuntz, the council's executive director, said that new libraries and retail units could encourage rejuvenation. But it is unlikely to tempt McDonald's back to the town centre where some shopkeepers compain that footfall and turnover have plummeted over the last 12 months. A McDonald's spokesman said that it has closed three other restaurants in Hemel Hempstead, Kirkcaldy and Bridlington. They said that the chain still has two outlets in Rochdale based in out-of-town retail parks and has opened nine others nationwide. 'The high street environment continues to change and opening, closing or relocation restaurants enables us to take an integrated, focused and strategic approach to future growth.'","Fast-food chain flees deprived Rochdale town centre .

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 12:51 PM on 24th November 2011 . Most people love surprises, but they are agony for Caitlin Wallace, who collapses whenever something unexpected happens. The 26-year-old suffers from cataplexy, where moments of extreme emotion cause muscular weakness. This can range from a slackening of the facial muscles and weakness at the knees to total collapse. Laughter, anger, excitement and fear can all cause reactions, but for Mrs Wallace her trigger is surprise. Surprise: Caitlin Wallace suffers attacks - which can be triggered by an unexpected phone call - up to 20 times a day . Simple things like her phone ringing, bumping into an old friend and letters coming through the door have all made her collapse - at its worst up to 20 times a day. Her extreme form of the condition means she loses control of all her muscles and is paralysed for several minutes. Although she can hear everything, she cannot see. Mrs Wallace from Liverpool, said: 'It started off with a very small feeling of falling whenever I laughed at something, and by the end of the week when someone at work told a funny story, I just lost muscle control and fell onto the floor. 'It's developed from laughter to shock and surprise. I can collapse just because my mobile rings when I'm holding it. 'I was shopping in the supermarket a couple of months ago when I bumped into an old friend I hadn't seen for about five years. 'It was so unexpected that I collapsed. It's really embarrassing. 'With cataplexy you can't put your arms out to break your fall. You have no control or no way stopping yourself from falling. 'I'm covered in bumps, bruises and scars from falls. I can hear people when I have an attack but I can't see or speak. It's like I'm paralysed.' Complete collapse: Caitlin Wallace during an attack on holiday earlier this year. She can hear but cannot move or see during the episodes . Her husband John, 35, who is a lift engineer, knows not to surprise his wife with flowers or chocolates and made sure their wedding in June last year was a low-key affair. Mrs Wallace said: 'A surprise party would be my idea of hell. If John has something to tell me, he asks me to sit down first in case I collapse. 'If he walks into a room and I don't realise he's there, it can happen. Once, I was blow drying my hair with my back to the door. He walked in and made me jump. I fell face down onto the bed. 'John is very good. He always tries to catch me when I fall.' Her symptoms started in February last year, and after her first attack she went to her local accident and emergency department fearing she had suffered a stroke. Doctors there suggested she see a neurologist, who carried out tests, including a brain scan, before referring her to a specialist sleep clinic at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. It was there Mrs Wallace was diagnosed with cataplexy and narcolepsy, which causes excessive daytime sleepiness. Her condition means she has had to give up her driving licence and her job as a receptionist at a dental practice. She said: 'I kept falling asleep on the phone and making mistakes because of the tiredness. It was causing a lot of problems so I had to leave. 'Work were very good and patient, but it wasn't working out to anyone's benefit' No surprises: Caitlin with her husband John who knows to warn her of anything about to happen, and who tries to catch her when she falls . Last Christmas, the attacks became so severe Mrs Wallace was scared to leave the house on her own and she would use a wheelchair in public. She wasn't able to cook or have a bath on her own in case she had a cataplectic attack. She had to stop exercising because it was too dangerous, causing her to put on more than two stone. With medication, her condition has improved and she has started doing voluntary work with the hope of getting a part-time job next year. Mrs Wallace said: 'A few months ago, I wouldn't have thought about the future, but I'm feeling more positive. 'When my condition was at its worst, I spent so much time indoors. I got bored of watching television so I started reading a lot of books. 'It's made me realise I want to be a writer, and now I have my days free to try and make that happen.' Dr Paul Reading, consultant neurologist at James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, and president of the British Sleep Society, said: 'People with narcolepsy lack a chemical in their brain that regulates sleep, without which they cannot stay awake for more than a couple of hours or so. 'Cataplexy is found only in people suffering from narcolepsy. 'It is triggered by intense emotion, particularly laughter or surprise, as with Caitlin, but occasionally anger or frustration. 'I have a patient who has a cataplectic attack whenever he gets a good shot while playing golf. 'Cataplexy can be treated with anti-depressants, not because the sufferer is depressed but because these drugs create a chemical state in the brain that inhibits cataplexy.'","Caitlin Wallace's cataplexy is triggered by surprise .

Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveils the first-generation iPod Nano: Now Apple says models released six years ago may have a battery malfunction - and is offering free, new replacements to owners . It's one of the oddest product recalls in some time. Apple has warned that the batteries on the iPod Nano can catch fire - but only on the very oldest models. One might imagine that a Nano that has stood the test of time since 2005-2006 when the first generation of the slim devices was on sale would be safe - but Apple thinks not. The defect discovered in the batteries appears to get worse over time. So much so, in fact, that the company is offering a replacement, new iPod Nano - a serious technological upgrade which adds a touchscreen, an FM radio and a pedometer to the rather basic Nano that late Apple CEO Steve Jobs launched six years ago. All you have to do is remember where you put your six-year-old MP3 player. It's not clear what incident sparked the current recal. There have been unconfirmed and highly isolated reports of batteries overheating around the world, including incidents where overheating batteries set fire to users' clothes. But it's not exactly an epidemic. In a statement, the company said that,'Apple has determined that, in very rare cases, the battery in the iPod nano (1st generation) may overheat and pose a safety risk. Affected iPod nanos were sold between September 2005 and December 2006.' 'This issue has been traced to a single battery supplier that produced batteries with a manufacturing defect. While the possibility of an incident is rare, the likelihood increases as the battery ages.' What you get: The replacement iPod Nano is a new model that can clip to a watch strap, and also features a colour touchscreen, FM radio and pedometer . 'Apple recommends that you stop using your iPod nano (1st gen) and follow the process noted below to order a replacement unit, free of charge.' Apple says serial numbers will be checked to ensure the units are affected - you can check via their website. Replacements will be issued within six weeks.","Affected models sold between September 2005 and December 2006 .

"By . Hugo Duncan and Sean Poulter . Last updated at 10:29 AM on 25th November 2011 . Families are spending almost £40 a week less than before the credit crunch and banking crash plunged the economy into crisis. Rising unemployment, muted wage increases and the soaring price of everyday goods have left many struggling to make ends meet, according to official figures yesterday. The gloomy statistics came as consumer experts Which? warned that four in ten Britons – equivalent to 20 million people – will spend less on Christmas this year. Some are under so much financial pressure, they cannot even afford a tree. Struggle: Many families are finding it difficult to make ends meet due to the soaring cost of everyday goods and rising unemployment . Latest figures from the Office for . National Statistics showed that households spent a total of . £210.7billion in the third quarter of this year, an average of £623 each . a week. That was £39 . down on the £662 a week forked out in the third quarter of 2007. The . weekly average for the same period last year was £633. ‘Households . continue to face difficult financial conditions, not least because . inflation is over twice the rate of earnings growth,’ said the ONS . report. ‘This, with an uncertain labour market, is continuing to weigh down on confidence.’ Admission: Paul Tucker has said that the Bank of England could have prevented the crippling rise in living costs, 'but chose not to' Previously, . the Bank of England Governor Sir Mervyn King has said households face . the biggest squeeze on their finances since the 1920s. Weekly spending has plunged since the autumn of 2007, when Northern Rock suffered the first run on a British bank for 150 years. It marked the start of the country’s worst financial crisis since the 1930s. A . spokesman for campaign group Consumer Focus said: ‘Consumers are . struggling on ever tighter budgets with rising energy bills, increases . in food and fuel, higher inflation and the pressure to spend at . Christmas adding to their anxiety.’ The bleak household spending figures . were revealed as the ONS confirmed that the economy grew by 0.5 per cent . in the third quarter of the year. But fears are rising the recovery is stalling and Britain is close to a double-dip recession. The . stock market fell for a ninth day in a row in London yesterday, the . second longest losing streak in the history of the FTSE 100. The index edged 12.21 points lower to 5127.57, taking losses over the last nine days to £107billion. This week, Sir Mervyn’s deputy, Paul Tucker, admitted that the Bank could have prevented the crippling rise in living costs ‘but chose not to’. He said the situation ‘would have been worse’ if the Bank had increased interest rates. The spending figures include the cost of everyday goods such as food and fuel as well as housing. Homeowners have gained from low mortgages but rents have never been higher, pushing up bills for tenants. Today’s report from Which? warns that 20million consumers will cut back this Christmas as the squeeze tightens. Fears over finances are marring preparations for half of Britons and they are also worried about being able to keep children and relatives happy. The consumer group urged against resorting to loans and credit cards to cope with the cost of the festive season. Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘Christmas doesn’t have to be cancelled. Savvy shoppers can save with online deals, discount days and pre-Christmas sales.

Mass for English-speaking Catholics will be led using the new translation of the Roman Missal, which is intended to be closer to the Latin original . English-speaking Roman Catholics may have noticed a little something different during their church services today as a new translation of the liturgy is introduced. For decades at the very beginning of Mass, the priest has greeted the congregation by saying 'The Lord be with you' and congregants responded: 'And also with you.' However starting today in the English-speaking world, the response has become: 'And with your spirit.' Familiar prayers, both spoken and chanted, have also changed to contain new words like 'consubstantial' and 'incarnate. In the Nicene Creed, which is recited during services, the affirmation 'We believe' has been replaced with 'I believe' The . changes were agreed following a year-long process to produce an English . translation that is closer to the original Latin of the Roman Missal - . the text of prayers and instructions for celebrating Mass. It is the most significant change to . worship for English-speaking believers since the Second Vatican Council . in the 1960s, which was held at the Vatican in Rome to address relations . between the Roman Catholic Church and the modern world. An English-language missal was produced by 1973, but that was intended to be temporary while improvements were made. In 2001, the Vatican office that . oversees worship issued a directive requiring translation of the English . missal that would be closer to the Latin rather than to more familiar . vernacular speech. All change: Services will all be held using the new translation of the Roman Missal, which has become compulsory . Numerous revisions and bishops' meetings eventually produced agreement on the translation being used this weekend. Britain's . five million Catholics have already been dealing with half of the new . liturgy since September. However, the full translation has become . compulsory as of today. Monsignor Michael Clay, pastor of St Ann Catholic Church in Clayton, North Carolina says he likes the new translation, but is aware of some priests and parishioners who have been less enthusiastic. Critics say the new version is too laboured and in some cases have circulated petitions that called for a delay in introducing the new missal. Mr Clay said: 'It's human nature that we're resistant to change. 'I'm old enough to remember when we went from Latin to English, and that was just a huge change.' Parishes and dioceses around the U.S. have spent months trying to prepare Catholics for the change. Priest: The lord be with you . Response: And also with you . Start of the Nicene Creed: 'We believe in one God.' Believe in: seen and unseen . The relationship between Jesus and the Father: consubstantial . To receive Communion: 'Lord, I am not worthy to receive you . . Priest: The lord be with you . Response: And with your spirit . Start of the Nicene Creed: 'I believe in one God.’ Believe in: visible and invisible. The relationship between Jesus and the Father: one in Being . To receive Communion: 'Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof . . .' Descriptions of the new translation have been printed in weekly bulletins, seminars have been held and since many parishes have been gradually introducing the new translation piece by piece, starting with the parts of the liturgy that are sung. 'Most of those activities are for the benefit of the average Catholic, but it's priests who have more new material to master. 'I've had a new missal in my hands for about three weeks now, and I've been literally practicing the prayers. 'I've been doing this now for 31 years, and a lot of these prayers I actually know by memory. I have to make sure my brain isn't getting ahead of my mouth.' 'I've been literally practicing the prayers...a lot of these prayers I actually . know by memory. I have to make sure my brain isn't getting ahead of my . mouth.' The Church of Notre Dame in Morningside Heights, New York City had leaflets printed informing its parishioners of the changes. Parishioner, Camelia Flye, of Harlem, learnt Mass in Latin as a youngster told the New York Daily News: 'I’m 63, so this is all going back to the old for me. It’s great.' However, Ellen Smith, 50, who attends services at the Church of the Holy Name of Jesus also in New York isn't keen on the changes. She said: 'Hopefully, it’ll bring more consciousness to the words we say when we’re praying. 'But there’s something I don’t like about making it uniform that prevents the unique cultural influences from each community that might be taken away.' Pauline Ioelu, 29, who moved to Washington Heights this year from New Zealand, where the changes have already taken place said: 'If you know your faith, then it’s not really a big deal. 'It’s very close to the Catholic culture and its origins, and it makes it more helpful in understanding it.'","Changes aimed at unifying one billion Catholics worldwide .

Jailed: Junior Henry has been locked up for four and a half years after he stabbed a man during this year's Notting Hill carnival . A teenage thug photographed stabbing a man during the Notting Hill Carnival has been jailed for four and a half years... and could be out in just two years. Junior Henry, 17, was caught on camera as he tried to flee the scene after plunging a knife into the abdomen of Rio Andre as the carnival drew to its conclusion on August 29. Valentine Simatchenko, a Russian bystander who witnessed the attack, was dubbed a 'hero' after attempting to trip up Henry as he ran from the scene while police officers stood motionless. Today campaigners have expressed their outrage at the relatively light sentence. Jean Taylor, of Families for Justice, said she was shocked the thug was not locked up earlier. She told the Daily Mirror: 'This yob we be out in two years if he behaves himself. The police must be so frustrated when all their hard work ends in sentences like this.' Following the sentencing it was revealed that Henry was acquitted of the murder of pharmaceutical student Yasin Abdirahman in a trial at the Old Bailey during 2009. He was found guilty of conspiracy to cause GBH and violent disorder but was spared prison by The Recorder of London, Judge Peter Beaumont QC. Instead he was given a supervision order but it was reported that he had broken that many times, include after being a 'final warning' by Judge Beaumont. Today the same judge was residing as he sentenced the teenager to prison, while also lifting an order banning the naming of Henry. The Old Bailey heard that Henry, who was aged 16 at the time of the attack, was caught on CCTV wielding a knife, rushing at Andre and then plunging a knife into the student. The court was also hold of Mr Simatchenko's attempted intervention as he tried to escape. Mr Andre was rushed to hospital where he spent five days undergoing operations for nerve and tendon damage. In a victim impact statement he said he was suffering 'flashbacks' of the attack. Fleeing: With the knife still in his hand, Junior Henry makes his escape from the scene in Notting Hill Gate, avoiding the attempted trip by Valentine Simatchenko. In the centre of the image the bleeding victim staggers towards police . Henry eludes the outstretched leg and flees. It was revealed in court that he escaped jail after being found guilty of conspiracy to cause GBH and violent disorder during 2009. Blood can clearly been seen coming from the victim's stomach . Henry was only caught after his picture was published online and in the national newspapers and a policeman recognised him. He was arrested as he left his Hammersmith home still wearing the scarf he wore during the knifing. He later admitted wounding with intent. Sentencing Henry at the Old Bailey, Judge Beaumont said: 'In September 2007, when you were just 12-years-old, you were caught up in gang related mob violence on an estate in West London, in which a young man died an another was injured and had to flee for his life. 'You were tried before me for the murder and acquitted. You were convicted of conspiracy to cause GBH and violent disorder. 'The sentence that I passed in May 2009 was a three-year supervision order. That sentence was to reflect your extreme youth at the time of the events. 'Since passing that sentence in May 2009 I have twice varied that order because you breached it.' Pale and looking up at those around him, Rio Andrew receives immediate treatment from police officers for the stab wound to his abdomen . In November 2009, a six-month curfew was added, and on March 7 this year the length of the order was altered. Hero: Valentine Simatchenko attempted to trip up Junior Henry as he fled the scene in Notting Hill . Judge Beaumont added: 'You left this court on March 7 with my warning ringing in your ears. On March 16, you committed the offence of assault by battery for which you were convicted in the youth court on July 26 and bailed on the condition you would appear at this court for sentence. 'A month later at the Notting Hill Carnival on August 26 you took out a knife and used it to stab a man causing serious injury. 'At the time you committed that offence you were in breach of the supervision order, in breach of bail and awaiting sentence for battery.' In 2009 Henry was the youngest of ten youths convicted after London Metropolitan University student Yasin was set upon by masked youths armed with baseball bats, broken bottles and knives. The gang were looking for rivals The Gritset when they chanced upon him and a friend as they walked back to his flat after seeing two girls off at a bus stop. He was stabbed three times in the head, with one blow piercing his brain and he died eight days later in hospital. Yasin was a blameless victim targeted as part of an initiation ceremony by the notorious MDP gang  - responsible for numerous attacks including the murder of Kodjo Yenga. In total 20 youths were arrested and three were jailed for murder, one for manslaughter and the 17-year-old was one of six jailed for violent disorder and conspiracy to cause GBH.","'The police must be so frustrated when all their hard work ends in sentences like this'

A television advert for the Littlewoods mail order company has been seen as hinting that Father Christmas does not exist. It features children in a Christmas play who sing about who has bought their presents, with a chorus which says their mothers have done all the shopping. Scroll down for video . Under fire: A Littlewoods TV ad featuring a nativity play in which children sing a song about how it is 'muvver', and not Father Christmas, who puts the presents under the tree has angered parents . The Advertising Standards Authority . has ruled that the ad can continue to be shown despite having received . 456 complaints that it destroys children’s belief that Santa Claus puts . the presents under the tree. Many of the complaints called for the 40-second advert to be rescheduled to a time slot after youngsters have gone to bed. And a Facebook petition has been . launched demanding it is taken off the air altogether. One parent said: . ‘Thanks, Littlewoods for letting the magic of Santa be trashed.’ Fury: Hundreds of viewers have complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about the advert, saying it has caused their children distress by revealing that Father Christmas does not exist . Another said: ‘It has upset a lot of . parents new and experienced. Children have been coming to their parents . asking them why Santa doesn’t come on Christmas Eve to deliver the . presents.’ The advert has also been criticised . for encouraging parents to spend too much on Christmas gifts. It shows . ‘muvver’ using her credit card to pay for luxury goods that she . otherwise might not be able to afford. A further Facebook posting said: ‘This . ad should be banned. Shame on you Littlewoods, especially as we are . going through tough times. Putting such pressure on parents who struggle . as it is to keep jobs and make ends meet.’ Hundreds more people have signed a Facebook page petitioning for the ad to be scrapped . The ASA said its council had decided . ‘after careful consideration that, as the ad did not make reference to . Father Christmas or suggest Father Christmas did not exist, it was . unlikely to cause distress to children and therefore we won’t be . launching an investigation’. A spokesman for Littlewoods said: ‘We . would never want to suggest that Santa doesn’t exist. We carried out a . lot of research and found families have different Christmas traditions. ‘‘Some told us that Santa puts the presents in the stocking while family and friends place gifts under the tree. ‘Others said that Santa brings most of . the presents but mum and dad do buy some presents for the children as . well as the gifts for the rest of the family. We like to think of . Christmas as a team effort.’","Littlewoods explains that mum uses her credit card to pay for presents .

Jonathan Bloomfield, 37, was filmed by a neighbour viciously punching and swearing at his 18-month-old Staffordshire bull terrier, Butch . A dog owner filmed punching his pet in the head has been banned from keeping animals - but now claims he should be compensated for an invasion of his privacy after the footage was posted on Facebook. Jonathan Bloomfield, 37, was filmed by a neighbour viciously punching and swearing at his 18-month-old Staffordshire bull terrier, Butch, earlier this year. The footage was posted online and went viral and his violence enraged people so much that an angry mob turned up on his doorstep and forced him to flee with his family from his home in Grimsby to London. Bloomfield was banned at Grimsby magistrates' court from keeping dogs for 15 years after admitting two counts of animal cruelty, but now claims he 'should be compensated for the invasion of privacy'. The 37-year-old said he felt sorry for what he did but added: 'If my neighbour had concerns, he should have got in touch with the RSPCA, not made videos of my family and put them on Facebook and YouTube. 'I will be seeking the advice of a solicitor and should be compensated for the invasion of privacy which has left my family homeless and denied my young son a better future.' The court heard how Bloomfield claimed that he punched the dog because it had bitten his three-year-old son's hand when taking a packet of crisps from him. He also claimed he was stressed from work and was 'sick of the dog barking'. Bloomfield said: 'I heard my son crying and he was holding his hand, saying the dog bit him. I was angry so I went out and bashed him. 'It is not in my nature to be cruel to animals and I know it was not the best way to go about things but I was upset.' Bloomfield claims to be an animal lover and insisted that his neighbours didn't like his family because they were from London. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The video, shot from a neighbour's window, shows Butch being kicked, . punched in the face and repeatedly hit in Grimsby, north-east Lincolnshire . During the court case, magistrates . were warned the footage - filmed between September 9 and October 18 - . contained 'disturbing' images. It shows Butch at the back door whimpering to . be let inside the house and then being beaten twice with a . pole by Bloomfield. In a . separate shot, Butch is then seen standing outside the door whining when it is flung open and he flinches in fear.

Right, a woman in a bra and trousers with a towel on her head opens the door and appears to whip the dog with a cloth . As Butch cowers in terror, a pole is brandished at him from the doorway of the property. The Staffordshire bull terrier was taken to Grimsby Blue Cross Animal Hospital to be checked over and the RSPCA took hundreds of calls . Next, a woman in a bra and trousers with a towel on her head opens the door and . allegedly whips the dog with a cloth before slamming the door. One shot shows the dog eventually being allowed into the house, but . not before it cowers in terror. Finally, the most disturbing piece of footage shows Bloomfield seemingly grabbing Butch by his neck before punching the dog twice in the head and kicking him. A small boy appears . behind Bloomfield, apparently egging him on. Bloomfield can be heard shouting . 'shut the f**k up'. Bloomfield was arrested on October 18 after his neighbour Michael Currie posted the video on Facebook. People gather near Bloomfield's house in Grimsby after the footage was posted on Facebook . Bloomfield continued: 'Neighbours didn't like us because we are from London. 'They would come round complaining that the dog was making a noise and then film me when I smacked him.'

But, at the last minute, Ameneh Bahrami, 34, refused, preferring her attacker, a former university classmate, to be spared. What happened next, though, has enraged her. For Iranian authorities have declared Ms Bahrami no longer has a right to the compensation Majid Movahedi was ordered to pay by the courts. She needs the money to pay for more plastic surgery to her disfigured face and body. Ameneh Bahrami suffered severe injuries to her eyes, face and hands when Majid Movahedi threw acid in her face in 2004 after she spurned his hand in marriage . Movahedi: After being pardoned, his sentence was reduced to 10 years in prison . She now says she was cheated, and is now suing Iran's judiciary, the Independent reports. Ms Bahrami, suffered severe injuries . to her eyes, face and hands when Movahedi threw acid in her face in 2004 . after she spurned his hand in marriage. In November 2008, a criminal court in . Tehran ordered Movahedi to be blinded in both eyes under the country's . application of the sharia code of 'qisas', which allows retribution for . violent crimes. But in July, he was given an eleventh hour reprieve when Ms Bahrami exercised her right to pardon him. Prison officials had been preparing to drop acid into his eyes when the pardon was delivered. Miss Bahrami said the international . interest in the case was one reason for deciding to drop her demand for . the sentence to be carried out: 'It seemed like the . entire world was waiting to see what we did.' The case attracted international . media attention, and the human rights group Amnesty International urged . Iran not to inflict the retributive form of punishment. Pictures of Ms Bahrami before the acid attack in Tehran, which left her blinded and disfigured . After being pardoned, Movahedi's . sentence was reduced to 10 years in prison. It is as a result of this new sentence that judiciary . figures now say he no longer has to pay compensation. 'Even though I agreed to pardon Mr . Movahedi, I didn't think I was surrendering my right to compensation,' Ms Bahrami told the Independent. She said her request for compensation was recognised at the time as legal by judiciary officials. 'But then the deputy prosecutor said . he had made a mistake and that my request for compensation had no legal . grounds,' she added. Ms Bahrami says she needs the money . to pay for further surgery. She has already spent more than £150,000 – . partly funded by the Iranian state – on treatment but more is needed. After being told she was no longer . entitled to compensation, Ms Bahrami says she was persuaded by Tehran's . deputy prosecutor to sign a document limiting her claim to injuries to . her hands and face. Now she has been told by a lawyer that the prosecutor's ruling is in fact unlawful. She has responded by opening legal . proceedings against the deputy prosecutor for abuse of trust and . depriving her of her legal rights. 'If Majid Movahedi walks out of . prison without paying the compensation money for my eyes, it means I . have been subjected to injustice,' she said.","Ameneh Bahrami, 34, offered chance to exact retribution by dropping acid into his eyes but - at the last minute - spared him ."
