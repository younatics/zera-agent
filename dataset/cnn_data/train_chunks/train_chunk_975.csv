"A mother from Oklahoma who had been serving a life sentence in jail for the murder of her three-month-old son has been set free after 20 years when questions arose over the reliability of the DNA evidence. Michelle Murphy was put behind bars in 1994, but her sentence was vacated after issues over the original DNA evidence were brought to light earlier this year. She was freed from prison after evidence was reviewed by a Tulsa County District Judge in May but was finally pronounced innocent on Friday. Free to go: Michelle Murphy, 37, seen here on the right, has been released from jail after serving 20 years of a life sentence for the murder of her three-month-old baby boy. A judge found her to be innocent . The walk to freedom: 'I spent 20 years wrongfully in prison for something I didn't do, and I've been fighting all these years to prove that,' she said . During the hearing to examine the DNA testing and biological evidence, Judge William C. Kellough exonerated Murphy. Friday also marked the 20th anniversary of her son's death. One of her attorney's called it 'appropriate timing.' 'I spent 20 years wrongfully in prison for something I didn't do, and I've been fighting all these years to prove that,' Murphy said to News 9. 'The law, the facts, the evidence and the witnesses, as they exist at the present time, as well as the passing of 20 years creates a set of circumstances where the State of Oklahoma does not believe that it can meet its burden of proof at a jury trial of 'beyond a reasonable doubt,' a motion made by Tulsa County District Attorney Tim Harris said. What happened next was a surprise to Murphy and her team of lawyers. She said the judge looked at her and said, 'You're innocent.' Hugs at last: Murphy was convicted of the 1994 murder of her 15-week-old son. His throat had been slashed and Murphy, then 17, was sent to prison for first-degree murder . Freedom! New DNA evidence, which the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office says wasn't available 20 years ago, helped overturn Murphy's conviction early in 2014 . 'I could do nothing but cry,' she said. 'Every day is a miracle to me. To be able to wake up in a real bed, to be able to go outside when I want to -- I can actually mourn my son now. I can maybe be privileged to know my daughter.' The baby boy's body was found with his throat slit, almost decapitated and in a pool of blood inside Murphy's apartment in 1995. Murphy was just 17 years old at the time. Her other child, a two-year-old girl, was taken into protective custody when she was arrested. Her lawyers believe that blood at the scene that was first thought to be hers was the evidence that saw her heading to jail. Prosecutors claimed that samples of blood at the crime scene did not belong to the baby. However, subsequent DNA testing proved that the initial findings were incorrect. Her lawyer, Tim Harris, felt that such errors may well have affected the verdict against her. Murphy's attorneys filed a motion prior to her release to have the DNA evidence tested against William Lee, a key witness in the original case who committed suicide before the trial . Lee lived in the same apartment complex and was reportedly the last person to see Murphy's baby alive. Botched investigation: Blood from the crime scene that was originally used to convict Murphy did not belong to her . Michelle Murphy was just 17 at the time of the baby's killing. She also have to give up her two-year-old daughter . Police have a 1994 taped confession of Murphy saying she leaned over her baby with a knife and accidentally killed him, but her lawyer said the confession was forced. It's claimed the baby was killed by 14-year-old William Lee who lived in the neighborhood and committed suicide after Murphy's preliminary trial. It was Lee who called 911 from a pay phone in the neighborhood the night the baby died and told operators he was reporting a domestic situation. Lee also later testified that he couldn't sleep and was walking around outside the apartment complex in the middle of the night when he heard Murphy and the baby's father arguing. He claimed that through the apartment windows, he saw Murphy carry the baby from one room to another, and the next time she appeared, she had blood on her arms and the baby was in the floor in blood. Harris said he is a 'minister of justice,' and he felt he couldn't go forward in prosecuting Murphy further because 'Father Time has a way of taking away evidence,' the witnesses are 20 years older, and the DNA isn't that exact in this case. 'If you can't go forward in the case, you've gotta do the next right thing and move to dismiss,' Harris said. The case was dismissed with prejudice, which prevents it from being refiled in the future. Murphy can, however, file a claim against the government for the handling of the case, although the compensation in Oklahoma would be capped at $175,000. Murphy is now spending her first weekend in 20 years with her family. She is looking forward to the life ahead of her but it proud that she manage to serve her sentence. 'I can learn how to live life free without all this hanging over me,' Murphy told News On 6. 'Learn how to drive. Learn how to be independent. ...It's phenomenal. ...It was traumatic. It was very hard; it was a struggle every day. But I survived. I'm a survivor.'","Michelle Murphy was jailed in 1994 for the murder of her three-month old son .

"A former unpaid intern who was suing CBS and David Letterman's WorldWide Pants production company has now dropped her lawsuit and issued an apology saying she was forced into making the claims lawyers. Mallory Musallam, 26, who interned at the show for four months between September and December 2008 had accused Letterman and his crew of violating minimum-wage and overtime laws. She had also claimed for payment for her four months of unpaid work at Letterman's late-night show, . She has now backed down and written an apology to Mr Letterman and his production team stating, 'While I am ultimately responsible for my actions as an adult, I was caught in a weak, vulnerable time, facing student debt.' Apology: 'I was duped!' Mallory Musallam has issued a public apology to David Letterman . Unpaid: Mallory Musallem, 26, has now dropped the lawsuit agaiinst CBS and David Letterman's production company WorldWide Pants . Compensation: The NYU graduate claimed CBS violated violated New York minimum wage and overtime laws but now says she was coerced into it by 'lawsuit-hungry' lawyers . The class action lawsuit had been filed in the New York Supreme Court on behalf of every unpaid Late Show intern from the past six years. Miss Musallam told the New York Post, 'I have nothing but respect for David Letterman and the whole organization. I wore that internship as a badge of pride.' The former intern has said that she is now broke and wants to apologize for the mess she has created. 'I've had a job since I was 15 and I have always been a hard worker. I was by no means looking for a trap door out by exploiting your established organization and I cannot apologize enough for this debacle.' In her lawsuit, Musallam claimed that the defendants intentionally minimized their labor costs by giving work to unpaid interns instead of hiring additional employees or paying regular staff overtime to do it. She also charged that she typically worked more than 40 hours a week but did not receive any payment or vocational training in exchange. However, the unemployed 26-year-old NYU graduate said that attorneys from the firm Virginia & Ambinder - who have filed at least a dozen similar proposed class-action suits - launched this latest one on her behalf just four days after approaching her on LinkedIn. Lawyers at the firm have not responded to MailOnline for a comment regarding their tactics. She said she was never contacted by anyone at CBS or Letterman's shop and her decision to withdraw the proposed class-action lawsuit on Wednesday was solely her own choice. Not thinking straigh: The unemployed 26-year-old NYU graduate said lawyer from Virginia & Ambinder pushed her into going after CBS and Letterman’s production company just days after approaching her on LinkedIn . No comment: CBS are not commenting on the lawsuit or Musallam's apology . The lawsuit which was seeking wages, with interest, and legal costs 'owed to Named Plaintiff and all similarly situated persons,' was to include around 100 other interns a similar position. The network did not contact her to urge her to drop the legal action and is not making any comment. 'This lawsuit is part of a nationwide trend of class action lawyers attacking internship opportunities provided by companies in the media and entertainment industry,' as CBS spokesman said. 'We pride ourselves on providing valuable internship experiences, and we take seriously all of our obligations under relevant labor and employment laws. We intend to vigorously defend against the claims.' Indeed, Musallam told The Post that she felt duped by the whole affair and that she didn't realize she would be the 'lone ranger' named on the court papers. 'The inveigling suit squad assured me that my intern work was little more than indentured servitude under newly established laws and that I was just one among other participants,' her apology letter reads. 'I feel like I was really duped,' she said.","Mallory Musallam, 26, filed a class-action lawsuit against CBS and David Letterman's production company .

"Airline staff were forced to tie a drunken passenger to his seat with ropes and wires after he threatened passengers and flight crew on an Air India flight from Melbourne to Delhi. The passenger on Wednesday's flight reportedly ripped the clothing of two flight attendants and tried to bite several passengers, before the crew were able to tie him to his seat. The chief pilot had contacted the airline's command centre in Delhi to try to offload him in Singapore, but was told the diversion would have caused long delays across the airline's network. So the crew had no option but to tie the Indian national to his seat for the duration of the flight. Cabin crew were forced to restrain a passenger with ropes after he became aggressive on board a flight from Melbourne to Delhi on Wednesday . The man was later handed over to airport security upon arrival in New Delhi. It's not known whether he has been charged. An Air India worker in Melbourne told Daily Mail Australia they were aware of the incident but had no further details.The airline has been contacted for comment but has not returned calls. An Air India Pilot told The Times of India: 'Unruly flyers are a safety menace to both fellow flyers and the aircraft itself. Indian carriers have witnessed scores of such acts, either by inebriated passengers, or other perfectly fine people who suddenly acted strange.' As a result of similar previous incidences, some Indian airlines have demanded to have plastic handcuffs available on board. Another pilot criticised Indian airlines' leniency towards offering drinks on board their flights. 'Crew of Indian airlines on international flights has to be firm in serving drinks to passengers and ensure that no one gets more than a certain number of drinks,' he told the Times of India. 'Foreign airlines are very strict. Try asking for a third or fourth drink on any western airline and the crew will firmly warn that you will be reported on arrival if you ask for more. Our hospitality, however, makes our crew more lenient which they should not be,"" said the pilot.","The cabin crew were forced to restrain passenger with ropes after an incident on a Melbourne to Delhi flight on Wednesday .

"Bieber's fourth taxpayer funded attempt to have his security downgraded was described as 'absurd' by a judge . A judge has dismissed a cop killer’s attempt to move to a cushier prison cell as an ‘absurd’ waste of public money. David Bieber, 48, who shot PC Ian Broadhurst in cold blood, demanded to have his security category downgraded despite being one of Britain’s ‘most dangerous’ inmates. At the High Court today, Mr Justice Mostyn dismissed his claim as ‘completely untenable’ and designed to make his life in prison a ‘little more comfortable’. It is the fourth time the ‘bestial’ former US marine has used legal aid to sue the prison service for breaching his human rights and his claims have cost the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds. Last night, PC Broadhurst’s widow said it was ‘disgusting’ that her husband’s murderer was able to sue the prison service and branded him a ‘drain on society’. Speaking from her home in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, Eilisa Broadhurst said: ‘I’m very glad the judge threw the case out as I think he’s a drain on society. It’s not right that a convicted murderer can get legal aid to fund this. ‘It’s a blight on my husband’s memory that he has chosen to do this. It’s been more than ten years since my husband was murdered and he is preventing me from moving on with my life.’ Bieber shot the injured traffic policeman at point blank range as he begged for his life outside a betting shop in Leeds on Boxing Day 2003. Describing his crimes as ‘bestial’ yesterday, Mr Justice Mostyn criticised his use of legal aid. ‘Since his incarceration, Bieber has occupied himself by making numerous applications to the High Court about the conditions in which he is being held,’ he said. ‘All of the claims he has made have been funded by legal aid,’ said the judge, who normally sits in the family courts. ‘It is perhaps noteworthy that I have sat in this court, where I usually sit, with litigants in person before me - people who are desperate to see their children - from whom the Government has withdrawn all legal aid.’ Bieber entered the UK in 1996 using the stolen identity documents of a dead child while on the run from the authorities in his native US. Police approached him on Boxing Day, 2003, after spotting that his false numberplates and he opened fire as they tried to arrest him. Traffic officer PC Broadhurst was shot in the back and fell to the ground. He ‘pleaded for his life’ as Bieber approached, but the cold-blooded killer shot him in the head. Bieber was convicted of murder and given a ‘whole life’ sentence at Newcastle Crown Court in December, 2004. However, his minimum term was later reduced to 37 years. Ian Broadhurst, pictured on his 2001 wedding day with wife Eilisa Broadhurst - who has described her husband's killer's attempt to move prisons as 'disgusting' The murderer has been held in maximum security conditions ever since but has used legal aid to launch a series of legal challenges to improve his life behind bars. ‘This truly was a bestial crime,’ Mr Justice Mostyn said, describing the remarks of the judge who jailed Bieber as ‘sobering reading’. Philip Rule, for Bieber, argued that the killer’s right to a fair hearing had been violated. Justice Mostyn described Bieber's case as 'untenable' and 'absurd' But, dismissing his challenge, the judge said: ‘The offence here was at the upper end of bestial. For someone to have committed such a grievous crime he must have no control over when he has normal human contact. ‘It is therefore perfectly reasonable to suppose that somebody who has committed a crime as grave as this, and who has accepted in no respect at all the reason for his incarceration, would make every effort to escape from prison at the first opportunity. ‘The murder offence here must loom large in any judgment as to whether David Bieber is a high escape risk.’ He concluded: ‘The arguments that have been put forward in this case are completely untenable. Indeed, I would characterise them as absurd.’ Bieber’s earliest possible release date is set for 2041 and he would almost certainly be extradited to the US if he is ever freed from prison. He is considered to be ‘one of the most dangerous people currently in the prison system’. But he claims his status as a category-A exceptional-risk prisoner, which restricts his movements within County Durham’s high-security Frankland Prison, breaches his human rights. His security categorisation means he has to move cell every 28 days and change wing every three months, alongside other tight restrictions. Earlier this year found to be unfit for a security downgrade due to the ‘nature of his offending’, fears that he had ‘access to finances, resources and/or associates that could assist with an escape attempt’ and due to his very long sentence. He has attempted two prison breaks.","David Bieber shot PC Ian Broadhurst at point blank range on Boxing Day 2003, as he begged for his life outside a Leeds betting shop .

"Gary Walker, a former NHS chief executive turned whistleblower who raised fears that a Labour drive to meet targets compromised safety . Police are investigating whistleblower Gary Walker’s claims of a ‘cover-up’ at the top of the NHS that led to deaths, the Mail can reveal. The allegations implicate several former and serving senior NHS managers who could now be interviewed in the inquiry. Mr Walker was dismissed from his job as chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust in 2010 after raising fears that a Labour drive to meet targets compromised safety. He claims a £500,000 taxpayer-funded gagging order was used to stop him speaking out. Last year, after the trust he ran and several others were warned about high mortality rates, he broke his silence in the Mail. It is understood that the former chairman of the trust, David Bowles, has also spoken to police about his concerns over safety. Lincolnshire police yesterday confirmed they were investigating. Earlier this year Karl  McCartney, Conservative MP for Lincoln, asked police to look into Mr Walker’s story. He included a letter sent by Mr Walker on October 28, 2013, to former health secretary Andy Burnham. In it, Mr Walker alleges he told former NHS head Sir David Nicholson of his concerns about patient safety, but these were not addressed. Sir David insists that he took appropriate action. The letter also claims Sir David’s right-hand woman. Dame Barbara Hakin, who is still in post, oversaw a dangerous target culture. Last year, she was cleared by the General Medical Council of acting in a ‘bullying’ manner and disregarding patient safety. Mr Walker’s letter alleges that Mr Burnham must have known of his concerns and the gagging order, something Mr Burnham denies. Former health secretary Andy Burnham, pictured, whose spokesman says he has not been spoken to by police . It refers to a ‘cover-up that led to patients dying’ and says scandals at Mid Staffordshire and United Lincolnshire NHS trusts were the result of ‘either political cover-up or because you were deliberately misled’ by civil servants. Lincolnshire police said: ‘We have received  a report connected to United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust. Inquiries are being conducted into this report, as is standard practice.’ A spokesman for Mr Burnham said he had not been spoken to by police. A spokesman for United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust said it was not able to comment on an ongoing investigation but would ‘co-operate fully’ with the inquiry and any requests from police.","Police are investigating claims made by NHS whistleblower Gary Walker .

"Life sentence: Knife-obsessed Kasim Ahmed, then 17, already had a string of convictions for violence and thefts when he stabbed Thavisha Peiris 14 times . A teenager who murdered a graduate while on bail was a ‘natural born killer’ who should never have been set free, his victim’s family said yesterday. Knife-obsessed Kasim Ahmed, then 17, already had a string of convictions for violence and thefts when he stabbed Thavisha Peiris 14 times and left him to bleed to death after a failed bid to steal his iPhone. The Sri Lanka-born victim, 25, had moved to the UK for a better life. He was killed on his final pizza delivery shift before starting work at an IT consultancy he had set up with some friends. Sentencing Ahmed to life in prison yesterday, a judge described the stabbing as a ‘murder waiting to happen’. And Mr Peiris’s brother Pramod said it was ‘shocking’ that Ahmed was allowed out on bail given his criminal history, which began when he was just 14. ‘He was a natural born killer with a killer’s instinct and should never have been allowed out of prison,’ the 27-year-old software engineer said. ‘He was clearly a very dangerous man and he should never have been released so he could kill normal people. It is shocking that he was allowed out on the streets to kill my brother.’ The judge sentencing Ahmed said his criminal record was ‘truly terrible for someone so young’, adding: ‘This was a murder waiting to happen.’ Mr Justice Coulson described Ahmed as a ‘habitual street robber who always carries a knife with him for that purpose’. During a two-week trial, Sheffield Crown Court heard that Ahmed and his cousin Shamraze Khan, 26, both from Sheffield, targeted Mr Peiris for his iPhone. The court was told that Mr Peiris was a hard-worker, described by friends and family as a ‘friendly and gentle person’. Victim: Thavisha Peiris, 25, was killed on his final pizza delivery shift before starting work at an IT consultancy . Scene: The street where Sri Lanka-born Mr Peiris was stabbed to death after a failed bid to steal his iPhone . He . had secured a degree in IT from Sheffield Hallam University after . leaving his home in the respectable suburbs of Colombo, the capital of . Sri Lanka, for a better life in Britain. He worked up to 70 hours a week as a delivery driver for Domino’s to pay back his father Sarath and mother Vajira, who financed his studies in the UK. But as he parked his car to make his final delivery last October, Ahmed and Khan struck after spotting his phone. Mr Peiris tried to fend them off, but Ahmed stabbed him 14 times in the neck, chest, face and arms and he suffered fatal wounds to the neck and heart. 'Gentle': The court was told that Mr Peiris was a hard-worker, described by his family as a 'friendly person' The hooded cousins fled without the . iPhone, leaving their victim to bleed to death in the driver’s seat. They were arrested four days later. Ahmed admitted murder at the start of the trial, and was jailed for life with a minimum term of 23 years. Mr Justice Coulson said he was satisfied he had wielded the knife, and told him that his sentence would have been considerably longer had he been an adult at the time of the killing. Convicted: Ahmed and his cousin Shamraze Khan (pictured), 26, targeted Mr Peiris for his iPhone . Khan was found guilty and jailed for life with a minimum term of 24 years, although the judge accepted he was unarmed and played a secondary role. He said Khan, a father of four, was ‘someone his cousin looked up to’, adding: ‘You should have steered him away from serious criminal activity. Instead you became his willing partner.’ Khan has a lengthy criminal  record just like his cousin, with convictions for theft, shoplifting and cannabis possession. After the sentencing, Mr Peiris’s parents said: ‘We sent our son to the UK so he could have a better life. We never thought he would be in danger. 'The way in which he was taken from us is devastating ... we cannot understand why anyone would do this to another human being and it fills us with such sadness. ‘While it doesn’t bring our beloved Thavisha back, we now have some form of solace knowing [his killers] will be held to account for what they have done and they will be going to prison.’ The couple spent their life savings sending their son to Britain. They are now both in their sixties, and struggling for money. Speaking to the Mail last year, Mr Peiris’s cousin Beena Narangoda described Britain as a ‘glossy red apple with a rotten core’. The 32-year-old English teacher, who lives in Sri Lanka, added: ‘There is no value put on human life. There are some sections of society who take a life and do not bother about it.’","Kasim Ahmed stabbed Thavisha Peiris 14 times and left him to bleed to death .

"She was a diminutive grandmother who lived in an ordinary house in south east London and spent most of her time tending to her roses in her garden. But Melita Norwood was one of the KGB’s most prized spies and stole secrets for decades before she was unmasked at the age of 87. She became known as ‘the spy who came in from the Co-Op’ and the ‘granny spy’ as details of her treachery became known around the world. Melita Norwood was one of the KGB¿s most prized spies and stole secrets for decades before she was unmasked at the age of 87 . The most extraordinary spy to be unmasked by the Mitrokin files, she had lived a seemingly quiet and uneventful life in Bexleyheath, south east London. Perhaps the only indicator of her former life was the fact that she sipped tea from a Che Guevara mug and read copies of the communist paper the Morning Star. Yet the files show that the KGB considered her to be one of their most important assets – prizing her above Kim Philby, who was one of the Cambridge Five spies. Codenamed ‘Hola’, Norwood and was the most important female agent ever recruited by the Soviet Union while she was a clerk at the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association in London. The company carried out metallurgy research which was useful for Russian armament manufacture but, crucially, was also involved in the building of Britain’s atomic bomb, codenamed Tube Alloys. Four members of the 'Cambridge Five': Top left, Anthony Blunt, Donald Duart Maclean, Kim Philby and Guy Burgess . Professor Andrew made Norwood’s name public after he was allowed access to the Mitrokhin files and the world’s Press descended on her doorstep. The Archive details how Norwood, whose father was Latvian, was recruited in 1937 on an ‘ideological basis’ following a tip from the leadership of the British Communist Party. The files describe her as ‘a loyal, trustworthy, disciplined agent, sought to bring maximum benefit. Passed on very large number of scientific and technical documentary materials that are practically applied in Soviet industry.’ The files reveal that she was awarded the Order Of The Red Banner Of Labour for her service to Soviet Union intelligence and a lifetime pension in recognition of her ‘many years of excellent work’. Professor Andrew said that the archive suggested that while the KGB was initially sceptical about Philby, they were keen to recruit Norwood. ‘At that time, security agencies were somewhat chauvinistic, so to prefer a woman to Philby at that time, shows just how important she was to them,’ she said. ‘It is unlikely she realised the significance of much of what she was passing on - to a non-expert and stripped of its context, it would have seemed relatively mundane. ‘But there is no doubt from these documents that the information she passed on was extremely useful to the KGB.’ Norwood was never prosecuted because the attorney general deemed it ‘inappropriate’ and died in 2005.","Melita Norwood was one of the KGB’s most prized spies .

"Bradley Wernham started his life of crime at the age of 10 . A man who burgled 700 properties in a £1 million crime wave and sparked a national outcry after a judge spared him jail has been caught red-handed yet again. Bradley Wernham, who was 19 at the time the judge took pity on him, is thought to be one of the country’s most prolific burglars. A judge decided to let him off if he participated in a ‘rehabilitation’ programme, but he was caught breaking into a house just three months later and sent to jail. Now 23, and with an 18 month jail stint behind him, he has appeared in court yet again and has admitted new burglary offences for which he is facing further time behind bars. News of the judge’s leniency caused a public row over soft justice after Wernham was spared jail, given a place on a taxpayer-funded rehabilitation scheme and handed a rent-free flat and training. Just three months later, he repaid the judge who gave him a ‘second chance’ by breaking into another property. He gave some indication of his intention to reform by posting the following message on Facebook just after he was jailed: ‘Be out in 18 months or before.. Yeeh is guna ride this s**t’.’ Wernham, originally from Harlow, Essex, started his life of crime aged ten and has since been branded one of Britain’s most prolific burglars. When he originally appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court in Essex in October 2009, he admitted 17 burglaries and thefts and asked for 645 others to be taken into account. The one man crimewave already had convictions for 26 other offences and he can now add at least four crimes to his tally, bringing his current tally to 672. He targeted luxury cars, regularly breaking into properties, stealing the keys and making off with vehicles. To avoid jail, he struck a deal with police that they would provide rehabilitation and he would identify the 645 properties that he had broken into in Harlow. So Judge Christopher Ball, QC, let him walk free from court in October 2009 with a curfew and 150 hours of community service. Wernham was also moved to Chelmsford where he was provided with a flat and training. Two months later, he was caught driving without insurance but wasn’t charged. The following month, he broke into a home with a BMW parked on the drive. Police were nearby as they had him under surveillance, after the number of burglaries in the area increased dramatically when he moved to the area. Wernham admitted to his latest offending and will be sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court today . He appeared in front of the same judge, but this time Judge Ball dismissed his claims as ‘palpable nonsense’ and jailed him for five years, telling a smirking Wernham: ‘You cast yourself as a victim and you’re not. Until you are a man, or man enough to appreciate that fact, there will be little hope in you changing your conduct.’ He called Wernham a ‘prolific and successful burglar to which no shop, office, garden shed, garage, school or even house is safe’, adding: ‘Committing offences gives you a buzz, gives you an adrenaline rush, and you were pitting your wits against the police.’ Appearing at court yesterday, Wernham pleaded guilty via video link from prison to burglary, aggravated vehicle taking and attempted burglary. In the latest crimes, he took car keys and laptops in a burglary in Harlow in April, caused damage to a £35,000 Mercedes in Stocking Pelham, Hertfordshire, and attempted a burglary in Buntingford, also Hertfordshire, by entering a garden with intent to steal. Wernham was remanded in custody and will be sentenced tomorrow.","At the age of 19 Bradley Wernham burgled 700 properties in £1m crime wave .

"He said he intended to relax ahead of Wimbledon next week. And reigning champion Andy Murray looked like he was staying true to his word as he and girlfriend Kim Sears dressed down to take their border terriers Maggie May and Rusty for a walk in the countryside. The Scot will defend his title at the championships, which start a week today, under the guidance of new coach Amelie Mauresmo. Murray, who 12 months ago became the first British man to win a Wimbledon singles title in 77 years, was left with some unexpected spare time after losing in the third round at Queen’s last week. Animal lovers: Andy Murray and Kim Sears taking their dogs Rusty and Maggie May for a walk close to their £5 million home in Surrey . The couple looked like any other enjoying the countryside on a balmy day near their £5million mansion in Oxshott, Surrey, as they took the Border Terriers for a walk last Friday. The pair, who were both dressed-down in t-shirts, trainers and shorts, then piled into a grey Land Rover Defender worth about £25,000. It is a reasonable sum to spend on a car in comparison to his previous purchases. In 2012, he was seen driving a silver £85,000 Jaguar XKR convertible through south-west London. It replaced the grey Aston Martin he bought in 2011 for up to £135,000. And that replaced the red Ferrari F430 he bought before that. He admitted that the Ferrari was a ‘too flash’ at the time and said he felt like a ‘prat’ driving it, adding: ‘I’m quite a conservative driver, but when I was driving that you’d get beeped for getting out of the car.’ Despite being knocked out of the competition in the third round, Murray returned to Queens Club yesterday for the Rally for Bally exhibition match . Now, it looks like he has made a much more sensible choice and the decision implies that the 27-year-old may be growing up. He even let his girlfriend of nine years drive him home in a sign he’s settling down to domestic bliss in the home they share. Discussing his choice of vehicle previously, he said that Miss Sears usually drives a Porsche Cayenne. He also admitted that he sometimes prefers to go undercover by riding about in the small Volkswagen Polo he bought when he passed his driving test. ‘We had a Ranger Rover Sport which I used to drive and an Aston Martin,’ he told the Mirror. ‘I sold the Aston Martin and we changed the Ranger Rover for a Porsche Cayenne, I don’t really drive that much - my girlfriend drives that. ‘The only other car I have got is a Volkswagen Polo, which is my first car which I have still got. I had it when I passed my test at 21. Following the frustration of his exit at Queen's Club last week, Murray said he planned to relax and catch up with friends ahead of the start of the defence of his Wimbledon title . ‘I drove that to Wimbledon last year [2012]. It is still the car I drive most in. Are people surprised when they see my get out of it? ‘I don’t think many people look to be honest if it’s a Volkswagen Polo. Is it sentimentality? It’s not something I’ve thought much about it. ‘The reason I kept it is because if people come to stay, it’s a good car to pick people up from the station and those sort of things. Because it is my first car, I have kept it - it’s done about 30,000 miles now.’ Last week, as he casually strolled along a country lane, the Wimbledon champion wore a blue t-shirt with trainers emblazoned on it and a pair of trainers designed by Adidas, which is one of his sponsors. Mr Murray, who won Olympic gold at London 2012, has a £15million five-year deal with the sportswear giant. Following his Queen’s defeat, he said he planned to relax, catch up with friends and watch the World Cup - and he was obviously telling the truth given their romantic stroll.","Murray and girlfriend Kim pictured walking their dogs in Surrey countryside .

"Two horses died at Royal Ascot yesterday on the opening day of the annual event. Case Statement and Sir Graham Wade had to be humanely put down after sustaining serious injuries during races. Their deaths will highlight an ongoing controversy in the sport as animal activists believe horse racing is cruel and the animals sometimes suffer painful injuries and deaths. Case Statement (pictured) had to be humanely put down after sustaining serious injuries during race . Case Statement was pulled up over two furlongs out in the Coventry Stakes while Sir Graham Wade was also injured and pulled up in the two-and-a-half-mile Ascot Stakes. Jenny Hall, chief veterinary officer for the British Horseracing Authority, said both horses were assessed by vets who concluded that they had to be put down. She said: 'Case Statement received immediate first aid on course from the racecourse veterinary surgeons before being transferred by horse ambulance to the veterinary assessment centre at the racecourse stables where he was X-rayed. 'The X-rays confirmed that Case Statement had sustained a fracture of his near-fore fetlock. Their deaths will highlight an ongoing controversy in the sport as animal activists believe horse racing is cruel . Yesterday the Queen attended Royal Ascot with other members of the Royal family . ‘Following full evaluation, the nature of the injury was such that sadly there was no other option but for the horse to be humanely put down.’ On Sir Graham Wade, Hall said: ‘The vets diagnosed that he had suffered a serious pelvis fracture that the nature of the injury was such that there was no other option than to be humanely put down.' Yesterday the Queen was in attendance with the rest of her family. Her Majesty was joined in her carriage by the Duke of Edinburgh, the Duke of York and Prince Harry. In a message in the event programme, the Queen thanked racegoers for the 'wonderful welcome' for her horse Estimate on winning the Gold Cup last year.","Case Statement and Sir Graham Wade had to be humanely put down .

"Top barrister: Amal Alamuddin is defending a suspected Libyan war criminal accused of masterminding the Lockerbie bombing . Having won the heart of the world’s most eligible bachelor, Amal Alamuddin is getting used to being the centre of attention. But George Clooney’s fiancée has also hit the spotlight for a very different reason – defending a suspected Libyan war criminal accused of masterminding the Lockerbie bombing. It has been just a week since her engagement to the Hollywood heart-throb was revealed but it is already clear that the high-flying barrister is not about to let her career take a back seat. The international human rights lawyer is representing Abdullah al-Senussi, Colonel Gaddafi’s former right-hand man, who is accused of numerous atrocities against his people. She is helping the 64-year-old appeal against the decision to allow his trial to take place in Libya, where he could face the death penalty. Beirut-born, Oxford University-educated Miss Alamuddin, 36, previously represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during his fight against extradition to Sweden on sex assault charges. She was also a legal adviser to Bahrain’s king, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, who has been accused by human rights groups of systematic torture and repression. al-Senussi was convicted in absentia by a French court for the 1989 bombing of a French airliner. In Libya he is accused of overseeing a prison massacre of 1,200 inmates as well as torture and hangings. He was charged along with Gaddafi’s playboy son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, with war crimes and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. Under United Nations rules, the Hague court was due to hear the case unless Libya could prove that it was capable of overseeing it. Libya was given approval last October, despite allegations that al-Senussi had been mistreated  in custody. Notorious: She is representing Abdullah al-Senussi (left), Colonel Gaddafi's (right) former right-hand man . In the docks:  The 64-year-old is accused of committing numerous atrocities against his people . But Miss Alamuddin said Libya refused to allow her or any of his ICC-appointed defence team to visit him, which, she says, should have been a red flag to the ICC. The trial began last month in controversial conditions as al-Senussi appeared in a steel cage looking emaciated and prosecutors refused to let him see the evidence against him. Miss Alamuddin said: ‘The whole point of the ICC is to be there when national systems cannot do the job. Instead, it is giving a flawed, dangerous process the stamp of approval.’ When asked why she is defending a suspected war criminal, she declined to comment. However, her colleague at London’s . Doughty Street Chambers, John Jones QC, said: ‘Justice needs defence . lawyers. The system only works if there’s robust advocacy on both . sides.

"It is a routine that many overstretched workers can only dream of. A 9am start, clocking off at 6.30pm sharp... then an evening in the armchair watching a film with friends. But it’s not the timetable of some time-serving office worker winding down to retirement. It was a typical day in the life of the man who led the free world. Ronald Reagan’s habits when he was US president are revealed in newly-released files which show he was perhaps one of the most laid-back heads of state ever. Ronald Reagan's habits when he was US president are revealed in newly-released files which show he was perhaps one of the most laid-back heads of state ever . His efforts to maintain a work-life balance transcend those of David Cameron, who was famously once described as someone who could win a gold medal for ‘chillaxing’. The files show that British diplomats voiced their thoughts on Mr Reagan and his wife Nancy ahead of the couple’s 1982 visit to Europe. They revealed concerns that the president, who died in 2004 aged 93, would be seen as a ‘bumbler’ and a ‘bozo’. Others noted how Mr Reagan was not ‘deeply interested’ in international affairs and had ‘no taste for detail’, often being outed by journalists for making mistakes. ‘His present  pattern of work is as follows,’ the diplomats wrote in the National Archives files. ‘The day starts at 0730 with a wake-up call from the White House switchboard. The President joins Mrs Reagan for breakfast of fresh orange juice, fruit and cereal, sometimes a boiled egg, and decaffeinated coffee. ‘After reading the newspaper, Mr Reagan walks to the Oval Office at 0900. Mr Reagan’s day normally ends at 1830 when he returns to the White House living quarters, changes his clothes and goes to an exercise room for twenty minutes of callisthenics and weight lifting. ‘At 7pm the Reagans normally watch the evening television news.’ The files show that British diplomats voiced their thoughts on Mr Reagan and his wife Nancy ahead of the couple¿s 1982 visit to Europe . Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher talks with US President Reagan in 1982 . The diplomats added that the couple liked to entertain friends and listed Mr Reagan’s favourite films as Chariots of Fire, The French Lieutenant’s Woman and Reds. They said the former actor liked to ‘escape to his ranch at the weekend... where Mr Reagan spends his days riding, chopping wood, clearing brush and in other outdoor pursuits’. world cup fear over falklands.jpg . His love of weekend getaways is reminiscent of a 2012 biography of Mr Cameron by journalists Francis Elliott and James Hanning, which said he ‘chillaxed’ at his official country residence, Chequers. This involved singing karaoke, playing games on his iPad and drinking several glasses of wine at Sunday lunch. He also apparently called his tennis machine the Clegger after once beating the Deputy Prime Minister. In Mr Reagan’s case, however, serious doubts were also raised about his basic ability to do the job. Another newly-released note reveals that there were articles in the US press casting doubt on his competence almost every day. Written by diplomat Stephen Wall to David Barrie in the North American Department of the Foreign Office, it says: ‘Since the press across the country have highlighted the President’s mistakes of fact in recent press conferences as well as his unease in answering questions, some of the criticism is bound to rub off. ‘The White House are certainly concerned that the President could acquire a national image as a bumbler which...could not be eradicated once firmly established in the  public mind.’ Mr Barrie wrote on the document: ‘My guess is that it’ll take some time before Reagan gets labelled as a bozo by Middle America – and even if he is, it won’t matter too much if the economy shows signs of recovery.’ A note by Oliver Wright to then  foreign minister Francis Pym put Mr Reagan’s faults bluntly. ‘We have self-evidently a President – how shall I put it? – whom it is difficult to engage in a serious discussion on any subject of contemporary politics.’","Reagan’s habits when he was US president revealed in newly-released files .

"A charity worker was stabbed eight times by a stalker – despite making 120 calls to the police to beg for their help. Over five years Helen Pearson, 34, was sent threatening letters, had a dead cat left on her doorstep and her locks were glued shut. But she claims police did not take her warnings seriously, telling her there was not enough evidence to make an arrest. Close call: Charity worker Helen Pearson, 34, pictured after her recovery, was stalked by loner Joe Willis, 49, for five years before he attempted to murder her by attacking her, dragging her into a graveyard, and stabbing her eight times . The harassment culminated in a violent attack in which her stalker, Joe Willis, 49, a loner she had taken pity on, dragged her into a graveyard and stabbed her with foot-long dressmaking scissors. She nearly died at his hands and was only saved by a passer-by who pushed him off her. He was convicted of her attempted murder and will be sentenced next month. Miss Pearson said she was glad Willis had tried to kill her because it meant that he was now facing a long prison sentence. She said: ‘In a way the best thing happened that he did try to kill me because now they’ve got him for the stalking - he’ll go away for a very long time. 'If he’d been caught after posting one of his letters then he wouldn’t be facing life and I’m glad he is.’ Ms Pearson, pictured shortly after the attack, says that in a way she is glad police ignored her calls, as her stalker now faces life in jail . Injuries: Ms Pearson was stabbed eight times before a passer-by discovered her plight and came to her rescue . Stalker: Joe Willis, 49, has been found guilty of attempted murder and will be sentenced next month . Miss Pearson, from Exeter, has now made a formal complaint to Devon and Cornwall Police for failing to act on her repeated warnings. She said: ‘The police had ample opportunity to catch him before he tried to kill me. The warning signs were loud and clear for five years. ‘Police must take stalking seriously - and have specially trained officers to deal with these violent, distressing crimes.’ Speaking of her horrific experience, the charity worker said that she had taken pity on Willis after his mother, her elderly neighbour, had asked her to talk to her lonely son. But he became obsessed with her, despite her making it clear that nothing romantic would happen between them, and she found him waiting outside her flat building. Offensive graffiti started to appear near her home, her bike and car tyres were slashed, glue was put in her door locks and she received threatening letters and texts. She reported the incidents to police and suggested Willis as a suspect, but was told that they weren’t serious enough to warrant an investigation. Soon, the harassment escalated and Miss Pearson found the words: ‘Die Helen, die’ daubed on a neighbour’s door in red paint. Her family and friends also received threatening letters. Menacing: Willis painted this graffiti on the pavement outside Ms Pearson's home . By this time, she had become a recluse, quit her job and confined herself to her flat, too frightened to go out. She also started recording the incidents and her repeated calls to police in a log covering 24 pages. ‘I often got the impression they were trying to imply I was doing all this to myself. It didn’t help that every time I reported the incident I got a new reference number and spoke to a different officer,’ she said. ‘The reports were never looked at as a whole, which meant the police weren’t getting the bigger picture.’ Recalling the horrific attack in which she nearly died, she said: ‘I felt a stabbing pain in my back. The sheer force of it pushed me to the ground and I was in total shock. ‘As I turned I saw it was Joe - and he stabbed me again. He was staring blankly at me and my pleas for him to stop seemed to spur him on. It was like he was getting strength from my screams.’ ‘I was certain Joe was going to kill me and stuff my body into one of the graves. I kept thinking about my parents and how they might never find me,’ she added. ‘He kept punching me in the ribs and face and stabbing me over and over. Next thing I knew he’d rolled off me and I took the opportunity to run.’ The mental health charity worker was told by doctors that she was lucky to be alive after the wounds Willis inflicted narrowly missed major veins. Devon and Cornwall Police would not comment but confirmed that a complaint had been received and referred to the IPCC.","Helen Pearson, 34, was stalked by Joe Willis, 49, for five years .

"The 'Game of Thrones effect': More and more children in Britain are being given Olde English names by their parents - with mothers and fathers inspired by the hit television series . They may sound more like characters in a historical drama than our next generation of children. But Millicent, Elvina and Alfred, along with other Olde English names, are making a comeback – with many parents inspired by fantasy television series Game of Thrones. Medieval girls’ names including Kendra and Winnie, as well as boys’ names such as Peyton and Audley are now popular choices for babies, according to a survey. Two in five parents questioned chose a name for their child which was last popular more than 350 years ago, with some names previously fashionable as long ago as the Middle Ages. It replaces the previous trend for giving children more modern ‘fantasy’ names like Princess, Crystal or Prince, with 36 per cent describing these choices as ‘outdated’. The survey of 3,961 parents, by the website Netmums, found the second most prominent British naming fad is customised spellings. One in five had altered a name with their own spelling – for example replacing Chantel with Shantelle – in a bid to make their child stand out. And one in eight said they had opted for a ‘posh-sounding’ name, such as Hugo, Arabella or Harriet. Traditional surnames, for example Mackenzie or Harrison, also continued to be popular as first names with one in nine parents choosing them. According to the survey, most parents settle on a name between the 20th week of pregnancy and the baby’s birth. But some start thinking about their choice considerably earlier, with one in eight mothers saying they had decided on a name before they were even pregnant. Emily Clarke, left, as Daenerys Targaryen in the hit television show Game of Thrones. A survey has revealed the series could be inspiring parents to give their children Olde English names . Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said: ‘Baby names usually work on an 80-year cycle of popularity - but some of the Olde English baby names coming back haven’t been in fashion for almost 800 years. ‘However, they tick all the boxes for modern parents, being unusual but traditional, and cool but not too wacky. It’s a trend which may well grow.’ One in ten wait for around a week after the baby is born before finalising their decision, to ensure that the name suits. But just under one per cent wait until the final day they can register their child’s to commit to a name – a full six weeks after the birth. For boys:                    For girls: . 1) Ned                        1) Millicent . 2) Alfred                     2) Audrey . 3) Cole                       3) Kim or Kym . 4) Audley                   4) Kendra . 5) Peyton                   5) Elvina . 6) Wyatt                     6) Winnie . Despite the struggle to find a decent name, almost all parents said that their child’s name had been commented on, with 13 per cent saying family, friends or even strangers had been negative about their choice. A further 19 per cent of parents admitted they chose to keep their favoured name secret – as a friend or relative had previously stolen a name they hoped to use. But one of the most decisive factors in determining a name was whether or not it went well with the child’s surname, with 32 per cent of parents deciding on this basis. One in five opted for a ‘name to help my child do well in life’, while 17 per cent chose an ‘unusual name to make my child stand out’. A further 14 per cent picked a name which they felt suited their baby’s appearance. Three in four parents (76per cent) also said that they believed children’s names influence how teachers respond to them. George, Edward, Emily, William, Hannah and Elizabeth were perceived as the names teachers felt most positive about. Prince George, pictured with his proud parents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. A survey has revealed parents believe the name 'George' carries extra influence with teachers at school . But Jayden, Crystal, Bailey, Chase, Tyler and Phoenix were seen as the names most likely to make teachers assume the child could misbehave. Among the more unusual names which can currently be heard on British playgrounds include Lanesra (Arsenal spelt backwards), Galaxy Star, Egypt, Kaseza, Cash, Mysti-Rae, Woodrow, Tarrant and Odin Fox. Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said: ‘Baby names usually work on an 80-year cycle of popularity - but some of the Olde English baby names coming back haven’t been in fashion for almost 800 years. ‘However, they tick all the boxes for modern parents, being unusual but traditional, and cool but not too wacky.

"Carlo Ancelotti takes his team to Liverpool this week . There will be no statue of Carlo Ancelotti outside the renovated Santiago Bernabeu if the £500million facelift complete with Abu Dhabi naming rights ever gets completed. The former Chelsea coach who brings his Real Madrid side to Anfield on Wednesday might have ended the club’s 12-year wait for a 10th European Cup in his first season in charge, but he knows his place. ‘I have heard people say that we won it in spite of me, and that I don’t have the personality to lead the team. I just laugh it off,’ he says. He also knows that despite constantly being damned by faint praise and having had his team broken up at the end of the season, he is better off than the man he faces in Group B this week. ‘Liverpool always have a good side but this year they are suffering because of losing Luis Suarez, who guaranteed so many goals,’ he says. Ancelotti lost key players Angel di Maria and Xabi Alonso but £100m was spent on replacements Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez. Despite the quality of the new players it was still typical of Madrid that they should break up a European Cup-winning team. Ancelotti, ever the politician, told Spanish radio Cadena Cope last week: ‘There are certain times when a club should say “No”. You cannot change club policy for one player. Di Maria asked for a lot of money and preferred to leave to get that money elsewhere. I manage for the club not the players.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti performs 73 kick-ups (archive) Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice in a 5-0 La Liga win over Levante on Saturday . Gareth Bale (left), James Rodriguez (centre) and Ronaldo in Real Madrid training at Valdebebas . Angel di Mari left the Bernabeu for Manchester United in a £60m deal this summer . Behind the diplomacy he knows that Di Maria’s enormous contribution last season meant that the wage he was asking for was not unreasonable. Alonso is another who was moved on. The Spaniard left because he was feeling a ‘bit tired’ says the Italian coach. Not half as tired as Kroos and Rodriguez have looked at times this season trying to keep their heads above water in midfield. The central trio last season of Luka Modric, Alonso and Di Maria offered the perfect balance. The former Liverpool midfielder sat, and either side of him Modric and Di Maria went up and down the pitch like pistons, Now it is Kroos sitting and Rodriguez and Modric going box to box. Kroos is a wonderful footballer but the jury is still out on whether that holding midfield spot should be his. Xabi Alonso (left) also departed the Spanish capital this summer and joined Bayern Munich . Toni Kroos (left) has been used in the holding midfield role that Alonso used to fill . Luka Modric has become a vital part of Real Madrid's midfield after joining from Tottenham . And Rodriguez’s inability to cover the same miles as Di Maria has meant Ancelotti has had to adjust. ‘Gareth Bale comes back a little bit more to make it a midfield four,’ he says. He has made a brilliant managerial career out of tinkering to fit the whims of various powerful owners. He was asked this week what it has been like working for Silvio Berlusconi, Roman Abramovich and now Florentino Perez. ‘I have been lucky enough to work with some very intelligent presidents who didn’t just know about football but were also successful businessmen, intelligent enough not to tell me which players to pick,’ he said, ever the diplomat.

"This is the trainee Navy pilot and his volleyball coach sister who were shot dead in an apparent murder-suicide in a wealthy suburb of San Diego. David Reis, 25, who was stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, and his sister Karen Reis, 24, were among the four people found dead in a New Year's Day shooting at a Coronado condominium, the victims' father said today. The siblings were found at after authorities responded to a report of gunfire shortly after 2am Sunday. Scroll down for video . Tragic: David Reis, 25, and his 24-year-old sister Karen Reis were confirmed as victims in the shooting . A passerby called police on his mobile phone after hearing shots being fired at this address in Coronado in San Diego Bay at 2.20am. 'It's still a shocker,' said Rebecca . Bailey, 26, who played college volleyball with Karen and later coached . with her at a high school and club program. 'This kind of thing doesn't . happen to people like her and David. Their family is the family . everybody wants to be a part of. They're just so loving, and there's so . much love in their family.' The elder Reis said he didn't know who else was at the condo in the wealthy seaside community where his son had been living. 'He just had his first F/A-18 flight,' Tom Reis said. 'Oh man, he loved it.' David Reis held a mechanical . engineering degree from the University of New Mexico. Karen Reis . graduated from the University of California, San Diego in 2009 and . stayed in the area, coaching volleyball and working at a grocery store. 'She has a really great spirit and knows how to make things fun,' Ms Bailey said. The remaining victims were another . 25-year-old Navy man and a 31-year-old man from Chula Vista, . authorities said. Their names were not immediately released. Confirmed dead: Tom Reis said on Monday that his son David, left, and daughter Karen, right, were confirmed as victims by the Navy . A SWAT team sent in a robot to the first floor of the building before searching the second and third floors. The bodies of two men and a woman were discovered in different parts of the three-storey building . A passer-by called police on his . mobile phone after hearing shots being fired outside the San Diego Bay . condo in Coronado, California, at 2:20am on Sunday morning. The first officers arrived within . four minutes and found a dead man in the doorway to the three-story . condo and the bodies of two men and a woman inside in different parts of . the structure. 'This is Coronado, for heaven’s sake. The biggest thing that happens here is a kid rides his bike on . the sidewalk' Don Hubbard, 85 . 'They checked and he had no . obvious signs of life,’ Sheriff's Lieutenant Larry Nesbit said. ‘They . tried to make contact with anyone else that might be inside the building . and they got no response.’ A SWAT team then sent in a robot . to the first floor and later searched the second and third floors. The . bodies of two men and a woman were discovered in different parts of the . three-storey building. It was not immediately clear how . the four people died. However, authorities previously said they did not . believe there were any outstanding suspects. Asked if it was a murder-suicide, . he said: 'I'll let it infer what it does. We're not going to say that. Although it's very early in the investigation, we don't believe there . are any outstanding suspects.' Messages left Monday with Navy . Region Southwest and the San Diego County sheriff's homicide detail were . not immediately returned. Family photo: David, far left, and Karen Reis, next left, are pictured in a photo after what appears to be their sister's graduation . Close: The killings took place just a few blocks from the famous Hotel del Coronado (pictured), where it was long speculated that the Prince of Wales, later to become King Edward VIII, visited and met Spencer Simpson . Neighbour Don Hubbard said he was . awakened by the shots that he thought were fired by New Year's revellers. He went back to sleep, but two hours later got a phone call and heard . SWAT teams swarming the area. Hubbard, a retired Navy commander, . said he saw the body of one man in the condo doorway and recognized him . as his neighbour — a Navy pilot receiving training at Miramar. 'The amount of crime happening in Coronado is absolutely unacceptable. This is supposed to be a quaint little village where people come to sleep, not to party' Jerry Toci . 'I knew these guys were pilots . because I was one and we'd talk about airplanes,' Hubbard said. 'Even . now, you say, how could this have happened? What the hell is going on . here?' Officers from the Naval Criminal . Investigative Service (NCIS) were called to the scene of Sunday's . shootings in case any of the victims were military personnel. Mr Hubbard confirmed two victims were Navy pilots training at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. NCIS is the federal law . enforcement agency which conducts investigations of offences - . punishable by imprisonment of more than a year - affecting the Navy and . Marine Corps. NCIS spokesman Ed Buice said its investigators were participating in the probe, which was being led by the Sheriff's Department. Famed: Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe in the 1959 film 'Some Like It Hot'. The Hotel Del Coronado can be seen in the background . ‘This is very shocking,’ neighbour . Julie Lisne told 10 News. ‘We think we live in such a safe little town - . so it's always shocking and sad.’ Coronado, where 24,000 people . live, is home to Naval Air Station North Island where several aircraft . carriers are based and is a haven for Navy pensioners. Murders are . extremely rare in the area. However in July last year the area . made national headlines when the naked girlfriend of a millionaire was . found hanged in his Coronado mansion. The Coronado area was rocked last year by an apparent suicide at a millionaire’s mansion when his lover allegedly hanged herself. Rebecca Zahau, 32, died at the mansion of Jonah Shacknai, 54, in July, two days after his son Max, 6, was fatally hurt from a fall off the stairs while she was looking after him. Her family believed she did not commit suicide but police were not convinced to reopen the case following the results of a second autopsy that was discussed on the TV show Dr Phil. Police sources said Rebecca Zahau, . 32, killed herself two days after her boyfriend's six-year-old son was . fatally injured while in her care (see box). ‘This is Coronado, for heaven’s . sake,’ local man and retired naval officer Don Hubbard, 85, told Sign On . San Diego. ‘The biggest thing that happens here is a kid rides his bike . on the sidewalk.’ The condo where the bodies were . found sits a few blocks from the famed Hotel del Coronado and a block . from the main street, which is lined with boutiques and restaurants. Eleven U.S. presidents have . visited the hotel beginning with Benjamin Harrison in 1891 - just three . years after the beachfront resort was built. In 1920 the Prince of Wales, later . to become King Edward VIII, visited and it has long been speculated . that it was at the hotel that he first met Coronada divorcee Wallis . Spencer Simpson. It was 16 years later that he gave up the throne to . marry her. The hotel is also where a banquet . was hosted to honour aviator Charles Lindbergh after he crossed the . Atlantic in the 'Spirit of St Louis'. A replica of the plane circled the . hotel's Crown Room ceiling during the dinner, according to the hotel . website.

However for PPQ creating a futuristic vibe on the runway involves a little less technology and a little more tinsel. For their SS15 collection showcased last night Le Peep Boutique on London's Park Lane, the British design duo, Amy Molyneaux and Percy Parker created a 'space safari' with a collection that the designer's are calling 'luna chic.' PPQ's SS15 collection saw a collaboration with Claire's Accessories bringing high end to the high street including mother of pearl pieces like the necklace pictured . An array of silver 'tinsel' dresses, white suits and metallic sequins gave a nod to the 90s party scene that wouldn't look out of place in The Ministry of Sound. The palette conveyed the brand's notion of space age perfectly made-up entirely of silver and white in what the pair hope will be an uplifting collection that looks forward rather than back. This collection sees the brand's high-end design meet high-street affordability as PPQ collaborates with accessories brand Claire's Accessories for their SS15 jewellery range. Despite the affordability the pieces look anything other than cheap, with the statement necklaces dripping with mother of pearl and shell. The collection took a futuristic feel and was entitiled Space Safari and the palette was made up purely of white and silver . Laura Whitmore is a big fan of the British brand and attended last night's show at Le Peep Boutique . For Amy, the collaboration means welcoming those who are so often excluded from the fashion industry. 'A lot of 16-year-old girls are fans of our brand and they aspire to it especially when they see celebs like Dasiy Lowe wearing our pieces. But the sad fact is they just can't afford it.' However, this season could see that change with the intricate yet affordable pieces being readily available to the public. 'The jewellery will available to buy online' says Percy 'We wanted to bring high-end to the high-street.' Given the futuristic nature of the collection it would seem that adding wearable technology to the range would have made perfect sense but for Amy, technology in fashion should involve changes in material rather than megabits. The models channeled a new trend of glittery centre partings, fitting for the futuristic theme . 'I think that if there is a suggestion of technology such as new textures in fabric but if there is technology there just for the sake of it and the design is ugly then it is pointless.' As if a clothing collection weren't enough PPQ also has it's own music label 1234 and for their SS15 show they enlisted one of their own DJs to create the sound track to the catwalk. 'We always want to create something new and fresh when it comes to music' says Percy and Amy agrees. 'Yes and whatever it is it is always really close to home,' The pair claim that their SS15 collection is very wearable despite the heavy metallic and suggest that it has a resort feel. The designers are determined to increase PPQs wearability further as they announce plans for a further high street collaboration with online fashion brand Very.co.uk. For Percy this collaboration is all about bringing down the exclusive nature of the fashion industry whilst maintaining quality. 'We want to be able to share our designs but on an affordable level' he says adding 'it's all about creating accessible elitism.'

"In tatters: David Cameron’s long-standing promise to get tough by reducing net migration to ‘tens of thousands’ a year has suffered a humiliating blow . The number of foreigners moving to Britain has soared dramatically, it was revealed yesterday, leaving the Government’s flagship pledge to slash immigration in tatters. David Cameron’s long-standing promise to get tough by reducing net migration to ‘tens of thousands’ a year suffered a humiliating blow with news that it rose by 40 per cent. The Office for National Statistics said 243,000 more people moved to the UK last year than departed – an increase of 68,000 newcomers on the previous year. European Union citizens accounted for 44,000 – or two-thirds – of the increase, including a rise in arrivals from Romania and Bulgaria. For the first time since the annual population survey began in 2004, there were more EU citizens living in the UK – 2.5million – than held non-EU nationality (2.3million). The statistics were published as No10 was rocked by Tory MP Douglas Carswell defecting to Ukip, which has demanded tougher controls on Britain’s borders. The figures offer clear evidence of how a new wave of EU immigration has taken advantage of Britain’s fast-recovering economy – which has produced an extra two million private sector jobs since 2010 – while the Eurozone remains mired in chaos. Experts told Mr Cameron that imposing limits was, in a reference to folklore, akin to ‘King Canute trying to hold back the waves’. According to the quarterly statistics, a total of 560,000 immigrants arrived in the UK in the 12 months to March, while an estimated 317,000 people left. The overall number of arrivals from the EU was 214,000 and, for the first time in three years, the number of people migrating to the UK from outside the EU increased by 19,000 to 265,000. More than 80,000 Britons returned to the UK. There was an increase in people arriving for work to 228,000 – up from 190,000 – while 177,000 people came here as students. Ministers have no powers to stop the free movement of European workers. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said the Tories had ‘gone quiet’ on the target and regarded it as a ‘mistake’, while Labour said the Government’s migration target was in ‘tatters’. ‘This massive gap between rhetoric and the reality, as well as no serious action to tackle the root causes of anxiety about immigration, is destroying public trust and confidence,’ said shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper. Ukip MEP Steven Woolfe said ministers were not ‘listening to the people’ and that the levels of immigration were ‘driving down wages and causing overcrowding in schools’. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the MigrationWatch think-tank, said: ‘Either we get immigration under control or we accept that in the next 20 years we will have to build 12 cities the size of Birmingham. Where can they possibly be put?’ John Hawksworth, chief economist for accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers, said the figures suggested that ‘relatively strong growth’ in the UK was drawing in workers from elsewhere in the EU. The number of people leaving the UK has consistently been lower than the number of immigrants arriving each year since the 1990s . Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg (pictured), the Deputy Prime Minister, said the Tories had ‘gone quiet’ on the target and regarded it as a ‘mistake’, while Labour said the Government’s migration target was in ‘tatters’ ‘In the face of these economic forces, attempts to limit net migration to the “tens of thousands” appear like King Canute trying to hold back the waves,’ he said. He said hard-working immigrants benefited the economy, but added: ‘They also put additional pressure on public services such as health and education, whose budgets have been constrained by austerity programmes in recent years.’ Stephen Booth, research director of the Open Europe think-tank, said the latest figures would be a headache for Mr Cameron. ‘These figures will provide more ammunition for those who want the Prime Minister to go further in limiting the rights of EU migrants not only to claim welfare benefits but settle in the UK,’ he said. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said reforms had cut net migration by a quarter since Labour were in power and the Government remained focused on controlling migration at ‘sustainable’ levels. He said reforms to rules on benefits, health care and housing made them among the tightest in Europe.","Net migration is the difference between those leaving and arriving each year .

"Rebels fighting against President Bashar al-Assad in Syria are suspected of sabotaging a batch of measles vaccinations - leading to the deaths of up to 50 young children. Dozens of infants in the rebel-held cities of Jarjanaz and Sinjar in Idlib province died on Tuesday minutes after being given the drug. Although the cause of death has not yet been established, officials reportedly suspect the vaccines may have been tampered with while left unguarded in a storage facility in Jarjanaz. In this photo released by anti-Bashar al-Assad activist group  Edlib News Network (ENN), which has been authenticated based on its contents, show two Syrian children receiving treatment after they were given a second round of measles vaccinations, in Idlib province . Dr Abdulla Ajaj - a physician who helped administer the vaccine - said the children all exhibited the same 'severe allergic shock' to varying degrees. 'There was shouting and screaming, it was hard for the parents. You get your child vaccinated and then you find your child dying, it's very hard,' Ajaj said. There weren't enough respirators in the clinic, making the situation even worse, he added. Video footage uploaded to social media showed a medic examining a young girl who was squirming. Another child, in an orange tee-shirt and blue pants, appeared lifeless as a medic administered CPR. He then opened the child's mouth to reveal a swollen, blue-tinged tongue. Physicians for Human Rights, a New York-based group that works in rebel-held areas of northwest Syria, sent an internal e-mail saying that up to 50 children may have died from the vaccine. The vaccinations are part of a large-scale campaign to stop the spread of measles, mumps, rubella and polio in rebel-held areas of northern Syria. UN. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said UNICEF and the World Health Organization are 'deeply concerned'. 'Measles is a major threat to children in Syria and the campaigns are vital,' Haq added. They are being distributed by volunteer medical and aid organisations operating in the area, according to the Boston Globe. In a Skype interview with the paper, Dr Ajaj said the drugs had been delivered to the medical centre three days before being given to the children. 'This is the first time we have had such a problem,' he added. Mr Ajaj proposed an alternative theory for the deaths - the vaccines were stored at too high a temperature. 'Most probably they were badly kept inside the fridges,' he said. Samples of the leftover drug have now been sent to Turkey for analysis. It is not yet known how long it will be before the results of the investigation are released. Syria's conflict, now in its fourth year, has caused the collapse of its health system in contested areas, scattering medics, destroying clinics and making medicines and equipment difficult to obtain. Nationwide vaccination efforts have been thrown into disarray and polio re-emerged in parts of Syria last year. United Nations says that more than 190,000 people have been killed since the start of Syria's uprising against President Bashar Assad (pictured) in March 2011 . The Western-backed opposition based in Turkey said it had suspended the second round of measles vaccinations, which began on Monday. The campaign was meant to target 60,000 children. In a statement, it said the vaccines used Tuesday met international standards and did not say what may have caused the deaths. It is extremely unlikely that the vaccinations killed the children, said Beirut-based public health specialist Fouad Fouad, who said spoiled vaccinations were more or less harmless. 'It cannot cause death,' he said. UN. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said UNICEF and the World Health Organization are 'deeply concerned' and awaiting further clarification. 'Measles is a major threat to children in Syria and the campaigns are vital... and especially important for children who've been away from their homes and communities and are living in camps or in other unsanitary conditions,' Haq said. Opposition representatives could not immediately be reached for comment. The United Nations says that more than 190,000 people have been killed since the start of Syria's uprising against President Bashar Assad in March 2011. The revolt began with peaceful protests but escalated into an insurgency and set off a civil war after government forces waged a brutal crackdown on dissent.","Dozens of infants died minutes after being given the contaminated vaccine .

"Sir Cliff Richard threw a lunch party for friends at his Algarve villa yesterday after a 15-hour round trip to the UK to be interviewed by police over child abuse claims . Sir Cliff Richard threw a lunch party for friends at his Algarve villa yesterday after a 15-hour round trip to the UK to be interviewed by police over child abuse claims. The pop star was seen smiling and appeared in good spirits after arriving back at his £3million villa in Portugal late on Saturday night. The 73-year-old was hugged by half a dozen loyal friends who he invited to the 16-acre estate, greeting them with his loyal companion, former priest John McElynn, by his side. Later, the party left to play tennis in balmy 77F (25C) sunshine. Just hours earlier, Sir Cliff travelled to Britain on a private jet to attend a police premises in South Yorkshire. He is thought to have left his holiday home in the early hours of Saturday morning for a flight to meet his lawyers before the appointment with detectives. The singer voluntarily met officers who interviewed him under caution. He was not arrested or charged over the allegation of sexual assault on a boy under 16 at an event held by American evangelist Billy Graham at Sheffield United’s Bramall Lane stadium in 1985. Afterwards, the star is thought to have taken a private plane direct from Doncaster to Faro, arriving at 9pm on Saturday night. His spokesman said: ‘Sir Cliff Richard voluntarily met with and was interviewed by members of South Yorkshire Police. He was not arrested or charged. He co-operated fully with officers and answered the questions put to him. ‘Other than restating that this allegation is completely false and that he will continue to co-operate fully with police, it would not be appropriate for Sir Cliff to say anything further at this time.’ South Yorkshire Police confirmed that a 73-year-old man had ‘entered South Yorkshire Police premises by arrangement’. It comes nine days after a controversial police raid on his £3.1million Berkshire apartment that was broadcast live on the BBC from a helicopter hovering overhead. The South Yorkshire Police chief in charge of the investigation, David Crompton, and BBC Director General Lord Hall are to appear before MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee next week following an onslaught of criticism about how police deal with the BBC. The coverage of the raid provoked 762 complaints, while human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC questioned the legality of the raid. Sir Cliff had no prior warning of the operation and was in Portugal. He has since shunned the limelight, cancelling public appearances to remain at his cherished holiday home, which he described as a place to ‘withdraw’ and engage in some ‘mental therapy’ in his autobiography. Cliff Richard was at his house in Portugal (pictured) when the raid on his UK home took place . Friends have said the committed Christian will draw strength from his faith. Frank Allen, bass player of 1960s band The Searchers told the Daily Mail: ‘As far as I am concerned he is a moral, upright person who has led an exemplary life. ‘I think that he will turn to his faith to get through this.’ The 70-year-old added: ‘The way the police have behaved and the way it was handled by the BBC is absolutely outrageous and appalling. ‘Police are scared to do anything that does not show them going in for the kill in the light of Jimmy Savile ... But they are just going over the top when the slightest accusation is made. While the BBC are scared about not doing anything because they didn’t do anything before.’ Actor Christopher Biggins has also released a statement of support. Fans of the veteran entertainer have showed their support by flocking to buy copies of his 1992 Number 7 hit I Still Believe in You which reached number 57 in the charts yesterday.","Sir Cliff Richard threw a lunch party for friends at his Algarve villa .

"A Dutch man has won the right to take his amputated leg home from a hospital and turn it into a lamp stand. Leo Bonten, from Spijkenisse in the Netherlands, is hoping his creation will fetch more than £78,000 so that he can buy himself a prosthetic limb. The 53-year-old had his right leg leg surgically removed after contracting a bacterial infection when he broke it in an accident in July 2012. Plan: Mr Bonten is hoping the sale of his leg lamp will help him to raise money for a prosthetic leg . A friend had tried to push him into a paddling pool when the pair slipped, and the friend landing on top of Mr Bonten, snapping his leg. Mr Bonten decided he wanted to make 'the world's only leg lamp' after being told that he was going to have to have it amputated - and that the limb would be incinerated. However, he was told that the leg would be the property of the hospital that removed it. As he told Dutch publication NRC Reader: 'My leg is my property. People keep their kidney stones in a jar on the mantelpieces. Ashes of deceased people are included in tattoos. 'I’m going to make a lamp of my leg.' Mirror image: Mr Bonten places his left foot beside his amputated right foot which is now in the lamp . Crutches: Mr Bonten is using crutches as he tries to accumulate enough money for a prosthetic leg . The hospital finally agreed to allow Mr Bonten to keep his leg after it was removed, and it was then he moved forward with his idea to raise funds for a prosthesis. Mr Bonten sought the assistance of pathologist Frank van de Goot to help him preserve his leg - and he now hopes an 'eccentric billionaire' will decide to purchase the extraordinary household accessory. During the video, Mr Bonten can be seen walking on crutches and speaking about how the idea for the leg lamp was initiated. He said: 'I want to sell the leg, the leg lamp. Because the prosthetic leg I'm going to get from the insurance, I wouldn't be able to do a lot with it. Artistic: The unusual and unique leg lamp was created by designer Willem Schaperkotter . 'And I want to have a prosthetic leg that would be capable to do a lot of things but that costs some money.' On Sunday Mr Bonten was putting together the details for the sale of the lamp which was created by designer Willem Schaperkotter. Mr Bonten added: 'I'm hoping an eccentric billionaire who thinks 'well, that's the only leg lamp in the world. 'It's the first person who made a lamp out of [an] amputated leg, and I want to have it. Because it's the only one in the world, [it's] unique.' He initially put his leg lamp for sale on website eBay but the listing was subsequently taken down as eBay does not allow the sale of human remains or body parts.","Leo Bonten, 53, had his leg amputated after he broke it and it got infected .
Pathologist Frank van de Goot preserved limb so it could be used for lamp .

"Schoolchildren as young as 14 are being used as drug mules by London gangs to transport hundreds of rocks of crack cocaine to villages in the Home Counties. Scotland Yard smashed a large criminal network yesterday allegedly trafficking boys and girls to rural parishes and towns in Kent and Hampshire where they were forced to carry crack cocaine and huge quantities of heroin worth thousands of pounds. Around 250 officers swooped on eight members of a Lewisham gang suspected of recruiting children directly from south London schools and youth clubs. Over the past six months 15 boys and girls aged between 15 and 20 have been arrested in Kent and Hampshire carrying up to 200 rocks of crack cocaine or large amounts of heroin (File photo) Police fear that London street gangs are increasingly using children to smuggle Class A drugs as they attempt to find new lucrative markets in leafy towns and villages around Canterbury, Portsmouth and Folkestone where there is less competition. Under pressure from high-profile police tactics that have led to the break-up of dozens of criminal networks in the capital, drug dealers are shifting their operations to areas in the Home Counties considered a ‘soft touch’. Over the past six months 15 boys and girls aged between 15 and 20 have been arrested in Kent and Hampshire carrying up to 200 rocks of crack cocaine or large amounts of heroin. Many are forced to stash the drugs under their clothes as they travel by train from the gang’s south-east London stronghold to a series of rented houses where they deal on the streets. Yesterday officers swooped in dawn raids on six London and four Kent and Hampshire addresses, arresting eight people, including most of the gang’s ringleaders, on suspicion of conspiracy to supply class A drugs, inciting supply of class A drugs, child trafficking and money laundering. One of the network’s chief suspects was arrested on suspicion of trafficking and conspiracy to supply Class A drugs at an address in Tottenham, north London, with £3,000 worth of crack cocaine found at the home. Yesterday officers swooped in dawn raids on six London and four Kent and Hampshire addresses, arresting eight people (File photo) While the gang’s 20-year-old alleged moneyman was dragged into a police van outside a four-storey Victorian stucco building in New Cross, and arrested on suspicion of laundering the organisation’s proceeds. As part of Operation Pibera, a four-month operation targeting the gang, police seized £1,500 in cash from a property in the North Downs village of Petham, five miles from Canterbury as well as raiding addresses in nearby Aylesham, Folkestone, and Portsmouth. They recovered a large quantity of crack cocaine and a press used to package drugs. The arrests included an 18-year-old man from Lewisham, a 20-year-old man in Haringey, a 32-year-old man in Kent, a 42-year-old man and a 31-year old woman in Hampshire.While a 20-year-old man, a 15 year-old youth and a 36 year-old woman were produced from prison. Detective Superintendent Tim Champion, of Trident central gangs unit, told the Evening Standard: ‘This is a gang that has evolved to use children. The controllers of the network stay in London most of the time and use the young people to take all the risks involved in drug dealing. ‘It means all the points where they could be intercepted with drugs is taken by these young people. ‘They can recruit through schools or other means. ‘They are given the promise of money or goods in exchange which never materialises. ‘If drugs are lost or seized debts are incurred and the links to the organised criminal network strengthens. It doesn’t start with a threat, it starts with a promise. It will become mental or physical abuse at the end. ‘They will pick people who the criminal network deems to be vulnerable and perhaps children who are getting into bad habits.’ Scotland Yard identified more than 250 gangs operating in the capital last year, which has been cut by a third, with nearly 900 gang members in prison and another 200 subject to other measures including antisocial behaviour orders. Although many of London’s gangs are territorial, based on postcodes and estates, the crackdown has led to a spike in offences being committed outside the capital as groups spread into new potentially lucrative areas. But neighbouring forces are waking up to the new problem on their doorstep. Kent Police Superintendent Andrea Bishop said: ‘To use teenagers to commit those crimes is despicable and would have far reaching consequences for them, as well as the public, if police hadn’t intervened to disrupt this London based organised crime gang. ‘Kent is the gateway to the UK and Europe and criminals may think that because of our location we are a soft touch. We are not. Our message to anyone who thinks they can pedal their crimes in our county is do so at your own risk.’ Detective Chief Inspector Kevin Dennis from Hampshire Constabulary added: ‘We identified that drug gangs from London were sending young people into Portsmouth to deal. These young people are themselves victims and we have taken steps to safeguard them and to work with them.’","250 police swooped on eight members of Lewisham gang suspected of recruiting children .

"The police raid on Sir Cliff Richard’s £3million home may have been illegal and could wreck any case against him, a senior lawyer warned yesterday. The row over the investigation deepened after the police were warned that any evidence they gathered against the 73-year-old may be struck out if it ever came to court. Last night Sir Cliff announced that he was pulling out of a concert at Canterbury Cathedral next month as the star feared it would be ‘overshadowed’ by allegations that he molested a schoolboy at a Christian rally in 1985, which he denies. Scroll down for video . Sir Cliff Richard pictured together with his friend and former Blind Date presenter Cilla Black in 1968 . His spokesman said: ‘Sir Cliff was due to perform on September 26 at a charitable event in Canterbury Cathedral but doesn’t want the event to be overshadowed by the false allegation and has therefore withdrawn. He is sorry for any disappointment or inconvenience caused.’ The blow for fans comes as Sir Cliff is yet to confirm when he will fly home from his villa in Portugal to face a police quiz. Yesterday his close friend Cilla Black said she was ‘absolutely positive’ of his innocence. The singer and former Blind Date presenter has been a close friend since they recorded a song together in 1969. ‘I, like everyone else, was shocked to hear of these allegations and I am absolutely positive that they are without foundation,’ she said. Human rights QC Geoffrey Robertson yesterday questioned the legality of the search warrant obtained at Sheffield Magistrates’ Court by detectives before they raided Sir Cliff’s Berkshire home almost a week ago. The 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act requires police to satisfy a magistrate not only that there are reasonable grounds for believing an offence has been committed, but there is material on the premises relevant to prove the alleged crime. A warrant should be issued only if it is ‘not practicable to communicate’ with the owner of the premises. Cilla Black, pictured with Sir Cliff Richard at Wimbledon this year, has come out in defence of her friend, insisting she is 'absolutely positive' he is innocent of claimed sexual abuse . Cliff Richard has spoken out against the BBC, claiming they were alerted to the raid before he was . But in this case Sir Cliff only learnt of the search as the BBC filmed live from a helicopter. ‘The police cannot raid your home on a hunch,’ said Mr Robertson. ‘They must make a solemn application to a court, identifying the material they are looking for and swearing that it will be of “substantial value” – in this case to supporting a complaint about an assault 30 years ago. ‘They must explain why they were unable to contact Cliff Richard or his lawyers or agents. ‘Most significantly they should have told the court about their deal with the BBC, because that was a significant matter that would disincline any magistrate from granting the search warrant. Before they blasted Cliff Richard’s reputation throughout the world, they should have given him the opportunity to refute the allegation. The importance of police following the rules is that if they do not, any evidence they obtain may be ruled inadmissible and their case would collapse.’ South Yorkshire Police has said it reluctantly agreed to work with the broadcaster after being approached by a reporter with information about its investigation. Yesterday, sources confirmed that Chief Constable David Crompton will appear before MPs after the Home Affairs Select Committee wrote to him and BBC Director-General Lord Tony Hall warning them they may be called to give evidence. Yesterday the BBC released a statement saying its reporting had been ‘balanced and proportionate’ and it had given ‘due prominence’ to Sir Cliff’s denials. ‘It is worth noting that we made contact with Sir Cliff Richard’s agent as soon as the search had started but well before we broadcast the story,’ it said.

"A double killer who knifed his girlfriend and their six-year-old son to death in a frenzied attack will today begin a court bid to inherit their £200,000 estate. Paranoid schizophrenic Paul Chadwick is seeking to exploit a loophole in the law that prevents killers profiting from their crimes. But his victims’ family have told of their torment at the prospect of having to face him across a courtroom again and their anguish at having to relive the tragedy. Killer Paul Chadwick has launched a bid to inherit the £200,000 estate of his victims, partner Lisa Clay (left) and their six-year-old son Joseph . Chadwick, 35, claims that his mental illness meant that he had not intended to kill. He has been granted permission to bring a test case at the High Court – and has applied for the case to be heard in secret ‘in the interests of justice’, claiming it would breach his human rights for confidential information about him and his financial affairs to be made public. Chadwick stabbed partner Lisa Clay 32 times and their son Joseph 25 times at their home in Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashire, in April last year. His plea of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility was accepted and last September he was ordered to be detained indefinitely in a secure mental unit. The landscape gardener has been granted permission to leave the secure unit in Preston to give evidence at the hearing at Manchester Civil Justice Centre. Chadwick is demanding the £150,000 semi-detached home he shared with Miss Clay, 40, his son’s £30,000 trust fund and £16,000 in joint bank accounts. Chadwick is demanding the £150,000 semi-detached home he shared with Miss Clay, 40, as well as Joseph's (pictured) £30,000 trust fund and £16,000 in joint bank accounts . He claims that because he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he carried out the killings he is entitled to the assets – the proceeds of money inherited by Miss Clay – because he was the beneficiary of her will. If successful, he could set a precedent for other killers to make a claim because their mental health was impaired at the time of their crimes. The Forfeiture Act of 1982 says those convicted of murder or manslaughter cannot inherit from their victims or profit in any way from their crimes. But there is clause allowing that ban to be waived in exceptional circumstances. For example, if a battered wife who has suffered years of violence suddenly retaliates and accidentally kills her partner, she may still be able to inherit his estate. Preston Crown Court heard that Chadwick had complained of hearing voices days before the killings and told Miss Clay, who worked part-time in a Marks & Spencer store, he was concerned that people thought he was gay. Miss Clay’s family, who learnt of the High Court action just before Christmas, told in a statement yesterday of their anguish at Chadwick’s attempt to claim his victims’ estate. ‘To have Lisa and Joseph killed in this way is a tragedy we will never overcome,’ it said. ‘But to be faced with the prospect of seeing their killer in court, fighting to inherit money from the two people he stabbed to death, has been too much for us. ‘He has nothing to lose from taking this action, but it has caused such torment for us. ‘One of Lisa’s aunts was going to give evidence but has had to pull out because of the anguish caused by the thought of seeing him. ‘She is still distraught and this has brought back the nightmares.’ Another family member due to give evidence, who does not want to be named, said: ‘I’m dreading the idea of going into the witness box and seeing him. Is it justice that he can stand there in court with the hope of claiming Lisa’s estate while we have to sit there with the prospect that he could soon be released to enjoy the spoils of his horrendous crime?’ Miss Clay’s relatives have been forced to use their savings to fight the case, while Chadwick has launched a claim against them for his legal costs to be paid. Keith Etherington, of Slater & Gordon, who is representing Miss Clay’s family, said: ‘Manslaughter is the unjustifiable, inexcusable and intentional killing of another person. The usual rule should not be relaxed where the violence was grievous and unprovoked, as here.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Paul Chadwick, 35, stabbed partner Lisa Clay and their six-year-old Joseph .

"A top private school ignored complaints that a paedophile teacher wanted to ‘spend time alone with boys’ while he was secretly drugging and abusing pupils, a report has ruled. William James Vahey is said to have abused 60 boys after a series of failings by Southbank International School, which failed to carry out checks on him, an independent inquiry has concluded. Police believe the globe-trotting predator, who was a leading figure in the international schools community with an ‘immaculate record’, abused hundreds of victims over four decades spent teaching in nine different countries. Paedophile: William Vahey, who was found dead in a motel in the US in March, pictured with his wife Jean . He committed suicide earlier this year as the authorities closed in. He preyed on boys aged 12 to 14 at the elite international school, plying them with sleeping pills before carrying out his sickening attacks during school trips abroad. The married American was found dead in a motel in Luverne, Minnesota, on March 21 just days after confessing to abusing boys. Failed to carry out checks on him: Vahey is said to have abused 60 boys after a series of failings by Southbank International School (pictured) His death came as the FBI was poised to probe a USB memory stick containing graphic images of 90 children in schools around the world who appeared to be asleep or unconscious while they were assaulted by Vahey. A review into his criminal conduct by barrister Hugh Davies QC has criticised the £25,000-a-year London school – favoured by diplomats and international executives for their children – for failing to properly handle concerns raised about the 64-year old. A review seen by the Guardian newspaper said the school breached statutory guidelines when they hired Vahey in 2009, failing to take references before offering him the job and allowing him to be hired after an interview with only the then headmaster, Terry Hedger. The sex offender had a 1969 conviction for child molestation in California, which various criminal record checks at Southbank failed to uncover as he was not on any sex offenders’ register. The interim findings of the review, commissioned by Southbank, reveal that concerns about the humanities teacher’s ‘unusual/questionable conduct’ were known about. A school source said fears were raised about Vahey’s conduct on school trips in his first year. ‘Complaints were made about him wanting to spend time alone with boys,’ the source said. ‘He would say he would stay behind with the boys and the lead teacher would say that was against guidelines. [The teachers] made complaints to the management.’ Mr Davies concluded: ‘Had what was reported within the school about Vahey’s conduct been appropriately recorded and evaluated, the pattern of conduct recorded would have required direct intervention by the school. 'Had what was reported within the school about Vahey’s conduct been appropriately recorded and evaluated, the pattern of conduct recorded would have required direct intervention by the school' Hugh Davies QC . ‘As a minimum, reviewing his role on school trips and almost certainly further independent investigation under the direction and control of the local authority designated officer.’ Chairman of the school board, Sir Chris Woodhead, who is the former chief inspector of schools, said better recording of complaints should have been in place, but he did not accept it would have led to Vahey being stopped. He said: ‘There would have been some intervention but what that would have been is speculation.’","Teacher William James Vahey, 64, is said to have abused 60 boys at school .

"Sir Cliff Richard has been left ‘completely in the dark’ by detectives investigating claims of historic child abuse, it emerged last night. Despite police publicly stating they want to speak to the star, he has yet to be contacted since the search of his home was beamed live around the world by the BBC on Thursday. Sources close to Sir Cliff said he did not want to ‘start a war of words’ over the handling of his case but is understood to be growing increasingly upset with his treatment. Scroll down for videos . Sir Cliff Richard, with his friend John McElynn, has not been asked for an interview by South Yorkshire Police nor even been contacted by them . The latest development came as stars, politicians and a policing standards body spoke out against the way the case had been handled. Former BBC presenter Sir Michael Parkinson, 79, last night said that the singer was the victim of a ‘witch hunt’. Amid farcical scenes, Sir Cliff has been left in ‘cruel limbo’ since police swooped on his £3million Berkshire apartment in front of BBC cameras as he spent time at his Portugal home. Sir Michael Parkinson told ITV News: ‘I think the BBC did create an error in judgement... in reacting to the story in a kind of way that would have done the red tops credit’ Controversial: BBC reporter David Sillito provides news of the raid on Sir Cliff Richard's Berkshire apartment on Thursday, with police vehicles in the background . South Yorkshire Police has said that detectives want to speak to the 73-year-old over an allegation of sexual abuse on a boy under 16 at a Christian rally in 1985. But the singer has yet to hear from police, has not been formally approached for interview and knows nothing of the allegation – nor who his accuser is, his spokesman said. Yesterday, Sir Cliff enjoyed tennis in the sunshine as an extraordinary row erupted over the BBC’s coverage of the police raid. Yesterday, Sir Cliff enjoyed tennis in the sunshine as an extraordinary row erupted over the BBC’s coverage of the police raid . A source close to the star, who has dismissed the allegations as ‘completely false’, said: ‘He has been left completely in the dark about what is happening. There has been no formal request for an interview and no phone call from police since this all started on Thursday.’ Smiling and apparently relaxed, Sir Cliff appeared in good spirits as he also enjoyed a dinner party with friends at his Algarve vineyard. Meanwhile in South Yorkshire, Chief Constable David Crompton faced blistering criticism over the force’s handling of the case. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve suggested the force may have contravened police guidelines which say suspects should not be named before being charged unless doing so serves a ‘policing purpose’ such as protecting the public. He said: ‘They have not arrested him or charged him. All they have done is carry out a search of his house so why have they notified the BBC so it could film this taking place? It is very questionable.’ Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, is writing to the chief constable to demand an explanation. Critical: Former shadow home secretary David Davis and former attorney general Dominic Grieve have both spoken out against South Yorkshire Police . Former shadow home secretary David Davis added: ‘The extraordinary decision by the leadership of South Yorkshire police to allow the searching of Sir Cliff Richard’s house to be televised, like some morally challenged reality TV show, demonstrates there is something sick at the heart of Britain’s police and justice system.’ Investigative journalist and former detective Mark Williams-Thomas, the first to receive the allegations in 2012 when the alleged victim contacted him after his documentary exposing Jimmy Savile, said: ‘I am very disappointed at how South Yorkshire Police have handled the investigation.’ Meanwhile, South Yorkshire has written an official letter of complaint to Director-General Lord Hall amid suggestions detectives were virtually blackmailed into co-operating with the broadcaster. The force said it reluctantly agreed to ‘work with’ the BBC after being contacted weeks ago by a reporter who had found out about the investigation. ‘It was agreed the reporter would be notified of the date of the house search in return for delaying publication of any of the facts’, it said in a statement. ‘The force was reluctant to cooperate but felt to do otherwise would risk losing any potential evidence. The broadcasters appear to have contravened editorial guidelines.’ Police also called for an inquiry into how the leak reached the BBC. The College of Policing, the professional body that sets standards, said if the leak to the BBC was an unauthorised police disclosure it would contravene the code of ethics. The college’s chief executive, Chief Constable Alex Marshall, said: ‘The presence of a BBC film crew at the scene of a police search, usually a closely guarded secret, has attracted understandable attention.’ Last night Sir Michael Parkinson told ITV News: ‘I think the BBC did create an error in judgement... in reacting to the story in a kind of way that would have done the red tops credit.’ Top human rights barrister Geoffrey Robertson QC accused officers of ‘treating Cliff Richard as though he were a bank robber or a mass murderer’ then leaving the star in ‘cruel limbo’. South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright also launched a probe. His spokesman said: ‘Questions need to be answered as to the original source of the leak, which put the force in a difficult position when approached by the media.’ Yesterday the BBC said: ‘The BBC agreed to follow normal journalistic practice and not to publish a story that might jeopardise a police inquiry.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","No interview request to star or even contact from South Yorkshire police .

"Dressed all in white, Sir Cliff Richard took the stage at Billy Graham's evangelical rally to a deafening roar from his fans. For Pauline Wraith, one of the 47,000 packed into Sheffield's Bramall Lane stadium on a rainy June night in 1985, it was a moment she never forgot. That night, she became a committed Christian. She travelled by coach with her sister-in-law to the world famous US preacher's rally because she was a Cliff Richard fan and heard he was going to be a celebrity guest at the event. Scroll down for video . Crusade: Sir Cliff Richard and Billy Graham at an evangelical rally in Birmingham in 1984 . Sir Cliff Richard performs at the Christian rally in Sheffield, where police sources say he is alleged to have molested a young boy . The pop star's gospel songs and moving speech about his Christianity changed her life forever. The 75-year-old grandmother, who still lives in Sheffield, said: 'He talked about how he became a Christian. 'He was just singing on his own from a platform on the pitch and talking. It was a very full stadium. At the time, Cliff was a big star but his Christianity came before everything else.' When Graham invited members of the crowd to step forward as a public commitment to Jesus, she did so. 'I went forward and gave my life to Jesus. Somebody came to speak to me and gave me a card. I was put in touch with a Methodist church and I've been going ever since.' After his appearance, Sir Cliff told a local newspaper he was on 'a tremendous high.' Billy Graham preaching at Bramall Lane, Sheffield, in June 1985 . Sir Cliff has described the American evangelist as one of his 'heroes' He said: 'It's been a busy day and I've loved it. Taking part in the meeting was a great experience for me. Billy Graham has everything you always wished you had yourself – charisma for example.' Sir Cliff, who has described the American evangelist as one of his 'heroes', had already appeared several times at his so-called crusades, making speeches at Earls Court in 1960s and Birmingham in 1984. The singer chose a Graham rally in London in 1966 to announce that he was a Christian. Dubbed 'America's pastor', Graham has also been a counsellor to former US presidents Richard Nixon, George Bush Sr and George W Bush. Around 250,000 people attended the preacher's eight days of mass religious 'meetings' at the Sheffield stadium in 1985. The alleged assault is said to have taken place during one of these events. There had been controversy prior to Sir Cliff's guest appearance, on June 28. The singer was said to be on a United Nations blacklist for concerts played in South Africa four years earlier during the apartheid regime. But his appearance went ahead without any trouble. A police officer, who was given the job of looking after his car at the stadium, remembered what a 'nice bloke' he was. He said: 'He had tea and biscuits sent to the police room for the duty officers with a note thanking us for looking after him.'

"Drink-drivers and yobs convicted of alcohol-related violence are being tagged with ‘sobriety bracelets’ in a crackdown on booze-fuelled disorder. For the first time, the US-style electronic tags – which have been worn by the likes of Lindsay Lohan – are to be handed out by UK courts to binge drinkers in lieu of jail. Those guilty of drunken offences such as assault, criminal damage, drink-driving or brawling in the street will be ordered to wear the ankle devices around the clock. Tagged: Actress Lindsay Lohan with an alcohol monitoring ankle bracelet . Every 30 minutes, they test the subject’s sweat to see if it contains alcohol. If a trace is found, an alert is sent to the offender’s probation officer. They can then be recalled to court, where they may be fined or even jailed. It builds on a similar scheme in the US that saw actress Miss Lohan forced to wear a tag after she failed to show up for a probation hearing relating to a 2007 drink-driving case. Yesterday a 24-year-old thug who provoked a fight outside a nightclub while drunk became the first in the UK to be issued with a bracelet. Augustine Apraku, of Sutton, South London, was ordered to wear the tag for 80 days after pleading guilty at Croydon Magistrates’ Court to using abusive language and provoking unlawful violence. He is the first of 150 offenders to be issued with bracelets in four London boroughs – Croydon, Lambeth, Southwark and Sutton – where the pilot scheme is running. Magistrates can order offenders to wear the tags for up to four months. If an offender manages 120 days without drinking, they will receive no further punishment for their original crime beyond a police caution. Boris Johnson launched the scheme yesterday, saying he wanted to target those ‘getting a bit too tanked up on a Friday night’ and causing problems. The London Mayor added: ‘Rather than lock them up we can help them to beat it by putting this ankle sniffing device on … I think it’s a cheaper, more effective way to help people to beat the booze and to beat violence.’ He said the scheme was aimed at those who have committed a crime while drunk, but who are not alcohol dependent. Offenders will be required to be at home at certain times of the day – usually twice – so a base station can get readings from the tag and transmit them to a monitoring centre. If no readings are received for two days, the supervising probation officer will be notified for further investigation. The policy has the backing of David Cameron, who first suggested the bracelets in 2012.","The devices are used in the US and notably worn by Lindsay Lohan .

"A mother sobbed in the dock yesterday after she admitted killing her three disabled children at the £2million family home. But Tania Clarence, 42, denied murder, instead accepting the lesser charge of manslaughter by diminished responsibility over the deaths of four-year-old Olivia and three-year-old twins Ben and Max. Her husband Gary refused to look at her as she entered her Old Bailey plea in hardly more than a whisper. The 43-year-old investment banker was in South Africa with their eldest child at the time of the tragedy. Scroll down for video . Tania Clarence, 42, sobbed in the dock at the Old Bailey as she pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Olivia, four, and three-year-old twins Ben and Max (pictured above with father Gary) by diminished responsibility .

They were in their pyjamas in bed . and are believed to have been smothered. All three suffered from spinal . muscular atrophy, a genetic condition sometimes described as ‘floppy . baby syndrome’. It leaves children with little control of their movements and can drastically shorten life expectancy. Mrs Clarence is thought to have found that Olivia had the degenerative condition when she became pregnant with the twins. The . couple moved to New Malden, Surrey last year and spent around £1million . adapting their home to cater for their disabled children, fitting a . lift and ramps. The bodies of the children were found at the couple's £2million family home (above) in New Malden, south-west London, on April 22.

"Alexis Scott, pictured at Canterbury Crown Court, has been found guilty of stealing £10,000 from passengers flying from Gatwick Airport . A community policewoman who appeared in a TV reality show about Gatwick Airport faces jail after being convicted of stealing £10,000 from tourists. Alexis Scott, 40, fleeced foreign passengers as they were about to board their planes by falsely claiming they could not take more than £1,000 out of the country. The police community support officer conned at least six travellers into handing over thousands of pounds after stopping them by the departure gate and confiscating cash intended to pay for family weddings and medical operations abroad. The mother-of-two even held out her police hat for unsuspecting victims to put money in, saying she would detain them and they would miss their flight if they did not hand over the money which she said they could claim back. They never saw their cash again. Yesterday a judge warned Scott she faces jail when she is sentenced later this year after she was found guilty at Canterbury Crown Court of six counts of theft and one of misconduct in public office. Judge James O’Mahoney said: ‘What is going on in this proud country when officials in police uniform can steal money from you? 'The defendant’s behaviour has undermined trust in public services and the police.’ Police believe Scott, who gave birth seven weeks ago, netted at least £10,000, but there may be many more victims. She preyed on foreign tourists flying from the North Terminal to destinations including Istanbul, Vietnam and Albania between April 8 and 24 last year. One woman handed over £3,000, but found police had no record of it when she later tried to reclaim it. Scott featured in a 2011 documentary called Inside Gatwick where she was filmed talking proudly about her work. She had previously been a member of a specialist investigation team which confiscated cash from suspected criminals. Although PCSOs have no right to seize cash, she worked alongside officers who can search suspects. Alexis Scott (pictured), 39, held out her police hat for unsuspecting victims to put money in . After Scott left the unit she continued to visit secure airside areas of the airport where PCSOs are not allowed. She was caught when Sussex Police received complaints about stolen cash and identified Scott as the culprit. A jury convicted her of six counts of theft, but she was cleared of stealing £5,000 from a seventh passenger. None of the money has ever been traced. The victims will be compensated and police will be seeking to claw back cash from Scott of Plumstead, south-east London, who has run up substantial debts and has four county court judgements against her name. She has lost her job with Sussex Police. Officers will want to establish whether she paid for IVF treatment which resulted in her becoming pregnant with her second child from the proceeds of the fraud.

Undercover Sun on Sunday reporter Mazher Mahmood posed as a Bollywood film producer offering Contostavlos a leading role in a British Slumdog Millionaire-style movie. The singer is alleged to have arranged to supply the fake movie mogul with cocaine worth £820 in a bid to secure the role, saying she was desperate to leave The X Factor, where she was being paid £1.5million.

The jury . was told that after a drunken night out at a nightclub with Contostavlos . in May last year, Mr Mahmood secretly recorded a 2am conversation he . had with Mr Varey about The X Factor supremo Cowell. Mr Mahmood said: ‘Is he gay?’ Slurring his words, Mr Varey answered: ‘Who?’ Mr Mahmood replied: ‘Simon Cowell.’ Mr Varey answered: ‘Yes.’ Mr Mahmood asked: ‘Have you slept with him?’ Mr Varey answered ‘No’, adding ‘One day I will, when I make my move.’ Mr Mahmood continued: ‘But how do you know he is gay?’ Mr Varey replied: ‘I know people who have.’ Since the conversation, Cowell has fathered a baby with his girlfriend Lauren Silverman. Earlier the . court heard how Contostavlos arranged for 13.9g of cocaine to be taken . to Mr Mahmood’s hotel because she believed he was offering her a . starring role alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in a film based loosely on her . life story as a former ‘bad girl from the ghetto’.

To be honest he’s the only actor I’ve . ever had a crush on.’ But days . after the drugs were delivered by a friend, Contostavlos realised she . had been duped in a tabloid newspaper sting, it was alleged. Yesterday it was claimed she was lured into a trap after her drinks were spiked. Jeremy . Dein, QC, defending, accused Mr Mahmood of plying her with drink, . encouraging her to be a drug dealer and then threatening that Keira . Knightley would get the part if she didn’t supply the cocaine. He asked Mr Mahmood: ‘You spiked her drinks to get her to incriminate herself, didn’t you?’ The journalist replied: ‘That’s absolutely outrageous. No, that’s complete and utter nonsense.’ Mr Dein . continued: ‘You gave Miss Contostavlos the impression she would have a . better chance of getting the film if she was a drug dealer in real . life?’ Mr Mahmood replied: ‘Not at all.’ Tulisa Contostavlos, centre, is pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court with Gareth Varey, right . Mr Dein . said the ploy was ‘irresistible’, adding: ‘Miss Contostavlos was told it . was to be the first urban British role for a US audience. You knew how . the story would really be designed to reflect her life.’ The singer . was flown to Las Vegas for a luxury two-night stay as part of the sting. Jurors heard that she insisted staying another night and called . paparazzi to take snaps of her in a bikini by the pool to show off her . new tattoo. As part of the elaborate ruse, Mr Mahmood pretended to take calls from Cameron Diaz and Miss Knightley. Contostavlos . is accused of getting her rapper friend Michael Coombs to take ‘white . sweets’ – alleged code for cocaine – to Mr Mahmood at the Dorchester . Hotel in London. Coombs, 36, whose rapper name is Mike GLC, has already pleaded guilty to supplying drugs.

"Rolf Harris groped Vanessa Feltz live on television in front of his wife, it emerged yesterday. The broadcaster spoke out for the first time to reveal how the sex predator tugged at her underwear during an interview on a breakfast show. She said she only managed to stop him intimately assaulting her by calling out for an advertisement break. Scroll down for video . 'Staggering': Vanessa Feltz revealed she spoke to police about how Harris moved his hand up her leg while they were filming a sequence together on a bed for Channel 4’s The Big Breakfast . Singer Linda Nolan has also revealed that she too fell victim to the paedophile, who molested her when she was 15. The . celebrities were among 15 new alleged victims who have come forward in . Britain, Australia and New Zealand claiming abuse by Harris, which could . lead to fresh police investigations. Harris, . 84, was jailed for five years and nine months at Southwark Crown Court . on Friday for 12 indecent assaults on four victims including a child as . young as eight and his daughter’s best friend. Feltz, 52, contacted Scotland Yard on the first day of the trial hoping . to testify against him, but his lawyers said the allegations came too . late to investigate without derailing the case. Paedophile: Harris, with daughter Bindi and wife Alwen, at London's Southwark Crown Court last week . The . Daily Mail reported last week that a celebrity had been assaulted live . on television but was unable to identify Feltz because she wanted . to remain anonymous at the time. But yesterday she broke her silence to encourage other victims to speak out. The attack happened in May 1996 on Channel 4’s The Big Breakfast, part of which involved a celebrity being interviewed on a bed. Feltz said some of the make-up girls warned her that Harris was known . in the business for his wandering hands but she did not believe them. The . presenter, who was wearing a floor-length evening dress, added: ‘As the . interview continued, with his wife watching and with the crew all in . the room, I suddenly felt a rustling at the hem of my dress. ‘I . was on live television so I could not look down but I sensed that his . hand was at the bottom of my dress and he was slowly gathering the . fabric up and moving his hand higher and higher up my leg.’ She said Harris carried on smiling and joking as though nothing was happening. ‘Suddenly . his hand had reached my knee and he was still going up and travelling . at speed,’ she told the Sunday Express. ‘After a few seconds he had . managed to get his hand inside the elastic of my knickers and I was . absolutely staggered.

I had no alternative but to cut to an advert break. ‘The . second we went to the break I jumped away from him and got his hand out . from under my dress. He didn’t react in any way at all. When we came . back to the live interview he carried on as if nothing had happened. Days gone by: Linda Nolan (far left, in 1978) has claimed she was a 15-year-old girl supporting Harris on a six-week tour with her singing sisters in Johannesburg when he launched a backstage attack in 1975 . ‘I was powerless to protect myself and he knew and he was getting a thrill from it. ‘After . the interview I rushed off to the dressing room without speaking to . him. At the time I did not even consider going to the police. I did not . think anyone would believe me against the great Rolf Harris.’ Linda . Nolan said Harris pounced on her backstage while she was on tour in . South Africa with her sisters in 1975. She was 15 at the time and was . wearing only a dressing gown. ‘He . came out of nowhere and in seconds his hands were all over me,’ she . told the Sunday Mirror. ‘He rubbed up and down and started kissing and . licking the back of my neck. It was horrible. ‘I . whispered to him, “Please don’t Rolf, please, please stop”. He did stop . then, but looked at me like I was an idiot. He laughed it off and said, . “Don’t be silly, I’m only giving you a hug”.’ Live TV: Vanessa Feltz on the bed for Channel 4's The Big Breakfast, one year after the alleged attack in 1996 . Art galleries, museums, universities and even a cockle stall in Swansea have been cutting their ties with once-loved entertainer Rolf Harris after he was jailed for sex offences. And the owner of a portrait of rock singer Bonnie Tyler - which Harris painted in 1977 - once valued at £50,000, is now thinking of burning it after being told his art’s value has sunk by 90 per cent. In Merthyr Tydfil, Cyfarthfa Castle's Museum and Art Gallery officials have been ‘editing out’ his name from the plaque put in place in 2011 when he re-opened it after a £320,000 refurbishment. Disgraced artist: Rolf Harris paints a portrait of Carol Watts, owner of Carol Watts Gower Cockles and Shellfish at Swansea Market in 2012. She has since taken down large newspaper photos of the day . However, an 1877 photograph of the town taken by Harris's grandfather George Frederick Harris, which is in the museum's entrance hall, will remain in place as it was not the paedophile’s work. In Aberystwyth, The National Library of Wales says it has ‘no plans’ to display the Harris painting Korean Monk, completed in 2007 and donated to the institution in the same year. The painting was donated at an event celebrating Harris's family ties to Wales, with his parents Cromwell and Agnes Harris leaving the town of Merthyr Tydfil for Australia before his birth. Dr Paul Joyner, a curator at the library, said of Korean Monk: ‘We haven't got any plans to display it, and considering the situation at the moment we'd be less likely to be drawing attention to it.’ At Swansea Market, Carol Watts, 52, the owner of Carol Watts Gower Cockles and Shellfish, has taken down large newspaper photos at her market stall of Harris painting her portrait in 2012. Falling value: Mother-of-one Cathy Sims (right), 43, is the owner of the 1970s Rolf Harris oil painting of Bonnie Tyler - who received the artwork from her father. Presenter Philip Mould is seen (left) Harris was filming for a BBC Wales programme about Swansea artist Evan Walters. Mrs Watts donned a 150-year-old shawl owned by her great-grandmother Margaret Phillips for the sitting. She has kept one small photo of the finished painting up at her stall as a reminder of the day, but said: ‘I took down a set of big photos of the event on the first week of the trial.’ Mother-of-one Cathy Sims, 43, of King's Lynn, Norfolk, is the owner of the 1970s Harris oil painting of Bonnie Tyler - who received the artwork from her father. When she took it onto the Antiques Roadshow in 2011, presenter Philip Mould valued it at ‘up to £50,000’, explaining that after Harris had painted the Queen, his values had risen substantially. She tried to sell the picture two years ago at Barry Hawkins Auctioneers in Norfolk but despite bids going up to £26,000 it failed to reach the reserve. Taken away: Harris has been stripped of an honorary degree he received from Liverpool Hope University . Ms Sims said that after Harris was found guilty she was considering burning the painting. She said: ‘It's very weird. I don't know what to do with it. But it's a horrific reminder of what Rolf Harris has done. I have a lot of empathy for the victims. ‘Now all I see when I look at that picture is an innocent-looking sad young girl and all I can think about is what he has been convicted of. ‘I don't want to keep something like that in my house, but it's no longer valuable to anyone. Unless I burn it, I don't know what to do.’ Harris has also been stripped of an honorary degree he received from Liverpool Hope University.","Feltz, 52, claims Harris put his hand inside her knickers on TV in 1996 .

"Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos promised cocaine ‘white sweets’ to a bogus film producer who offered her a  leading movie role alongside Leonardo Di Caprio, a court heard yesterday. The 26-year-old pop star, who once described herself as a ‘drug dealer’s wife’, allegedly arranged to supply cocaine to Samir Khan because she thought he was a ‘big shot’ Bollywood producer offering her a blockbuster role ahead of Keira Knightley and Kate Winslet. But her dreams of being a movie star were shattered when Mr Khan turned out to be undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood, who exposed her in a tabloid newspaper sting. Former X Factor judge: Contostavlos, 26, continues to vehemently deny helping to broker the deal . Southwark Crown Court heard the N-Dubz singer was filmed boasting she could easily sort out ‘white sweets’ – allegedly her code for cocaine – as she was once part of a gang that sold crack and her ex-boyfriend was a major cocaine dealer. Beguiled by talk of a movie loosely based on her life as a ‘street kid, someone who rises up from the streets and is making a better life’, . Contostavlos was ‘queuing up’ to offer drugs and strip-club parties to the undercover reporter offering her the big break, the jury heard. In a series of phone calls and texts, she is accused of arranging for her rapper friend Michael Coombs to take a bag of cocaine to a luxury suite at the Dorchester Hotel in London, where Mr Mahmood was staying. Coombs, 36, whose rapper name is Mike GLC, has already pleaded guilty to supplying the drugs. Jurors were played footage from May 23 last year in which he was seen removing a white bag containing 13.9grams of cocaine from his sock and placing it on a table in exchange for £820. Scroll down for video . On trial: Contostavlos also allegedly bragged that she used to be part of a gang who sold crack cocaine and that her ex-boyfriend was a cocaine dealer . Contostavlos was pictured during a court break having a cigarette (left) and checking her make-up (right) The jury heard Contostavlos first met Mr Mahmood in March last year when he approached her. Posing . as a wealthy Bollywood movie maker, he wooed the singer and Gareth . Varey, described in court as her manager, in top hotels in Las Vegas and . Mayfair and with dinners at Nobu restaurant, a favourite with . celebrities. The court . also heard Mr Mahmood offered to get her on the red carpet at Cannes . Film Festival and said he could make the star and her then boyfriend, . former Newcastle United star Danny Simpson, the David and Victoria . Beckham of India. ‘She . and her manager swallowed the story completely,’ said prosecutor Timothy . Cray. ‘She was told that she would be more suitable for the film than . Keira Knightley or Kate Winslet.’ He added: ‘Although she had not . negotiated the price or the amount, she had done all she could to make a . supply of cocaine happen. It’s very clear to the extent of her falling . for the trick – she is queuing up to arrange this.’ The excited star was filmed saying: ‘I . could probably get a good Hollywood sexy role in a movie but it would . not be a leading movie. When this part came along I was like, a leading . role for the first time…it’s almost perfect.’ When . Mr Mahmood asked her to provide cocaine on a night out, she said she . did not abuse cocaine but could easily get some ‘white sweets’ for him . through  her friends. Rapper: Mike GLC, whose real name is Michael Coombs, 36, pleaded guilty on Monday to supplying half an ounce of cocaine for £860 . Earlier, . she bragged that ‘she used cannabis to help her get to sleep and that . she had connections to drug dealers’, Mr Cray said. ‘In her drug-dealing . speak, white sweets equals cocaine, green sweets equals cannabis.’ The . jury heard that within minutes she was contacting an ex-boyfriend . saying ‘need sum sweets’, but he told her his phone was tapped. She . then contacted Coombs before promising Mr Mahmood ‘white sweets’ on his . return from Cannes. She texted: ‘Let me know wen u land so I can sort u . out! Love Tulisa xxx’. In . other calls she told him she had arranged for him to visit a . pole-dancing club called Whites. Mr Mahmood can be heard saying: . ‘Talking of White, what about white sweets?’ Contostavlos replies: ‘I . can definitely sort it, I just need to make some more calls.’ Mr . Mahmood responds: ‘Obviously, just keep this between us.’ Giggling, the . singer says: ‘It wouldn’t sound too good that Tulisa is off finding . white sweets.’ Days . later, Coombs was caught on camera as he handed over the drugs, Mr Cray . said. The powder was found to be just 37 per cent pure, despite Coombs’ boasts it was ‘100 per cent grade A stuff’. The . star’s alleged drugs deal was reported in the Sun on Sunday by Mr . Mahmood who also reported her to police. She was arrested on June 4 last . year. She told police: . ‘I was trying to find a role in a film. [The journalists] asked me a . number of intimate questions. I answered these sometimes in an . exaggerated manner in an attempt to seek the part. ‘My words have been taken out of context. I’m not a drug dealer.’ She had been dropped as a judge on The X Factor two weeks before her arrest. Contostavlos, of Friern Barnet, North London, denies being concerned in the supply of cocaine between May 10 and 23 last year. The trial continues.

"Rolf Harris faced a flood of fresh abuse allegations yesterday as his victims vowed to reduce him to ruin by launching claims on his £11million fortune. A dozen new alleged victims have contacted lawyers seeking compensation payouts which could top £70,000 each, with a High Court civil claim set to be launched in weeks which will effectively freeze the disgraced entertainer’s assets. Harris, 84, faces being stripped of his fortune and honours, while galleries, schools and even a zoo scrambled to remove all trace of the paintings and plaques which once celebrated his life’s work. Scroll down for video . Compensation: Rolf Harris' £11million fortune would be inherited by his daughter Bindi, right after his conviction yesterday, but 'up to a dozen' women have already contacted a law firm to apply for payouts . Harris was convicted on Monday of 12 counts of indecent assault on victims as young as seven after a jury refused to believe his protestations of innocence during the eight-week trial. The court heard that Harris, who faces jail on Friday, was a ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ predator who targeted youngsters and thought he was ‘above the law’. Yesterday it also emerged that: . He is staying in the multi-million pound house, which backs on to the Thames, with wife Alwen, 82, as he awaits Friday’s sentencing. Yesterday plaques honouring the paedophile were torn down at Colchester Zoo in Essex where Harris opened a £1million elephant enclosure in 1997. Paintings were also removed from schools and galleries in Australia. Yesterday a law firm said it had been contacted by 12 women thought to be from the UK, New Zealand and Australia. Their allegations of sexual abuse could be passed to Scotland Yard, which is already reviewing a handful of new victims. Richard Scorer, lawyer for Slater and Gordon which represents 176 victims of Savile, said the firm had been contacted by ‘up to a dozen people’ and were considering them carefully. Disgraced: In Australia a plaque laid in his home town near Perth has been defaced and may be pulled up while prime minister Tony Abbott said he was 'gutted and dismayed' by the news Harris was convicted . He said: ‘We back an over-arching inquiry into child abuse once those reports which are still outstanding are completed. ‘What we have discovered in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal is just how deep child abuse in institutions ran and how some people were seemingly allowed to continue their sickening crimes unchallenged.’ Mr Scorer added: ‘It is therefore vital we do everything possible now to learn from the mistakes of the past and take this opportunity to toughen the laws around the protection of children and vulnerable adults in institutions.’ Liz Dux, an abuse lawyer at the same firm, added that they planned to launch a High Court claim on behalf of the victims ‘within weeks’, to prevent Harris transferring the deeds of his home and multi-million-pound assets from three companies to his daughter or other family members. NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said they had received an ‘explosion of calls’ from people concerned about sexual abuse, with 36 of those calls relating to 13 alleged victims of Harris. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said: ‘We know there has been more reporting, what we don’t know yet is whether or not more charges will follow. ‘We will work with the police and look at any cases that they send to us to see whether there is enough evidence to bring more charges. So it is too early to say.’ Last night there were calls for a public inquiry to look into the culture at the time of historic sex abuse carried out by the likes of Harris and Savile. Liberal Democrat MP Greg Mulholland said: ‘We have seen another celebrity convicted of a string of appalling child sex offences; someone who has used and abused their position and their power. ‘Is it not now time that we had an overarching inquiry into the culture at that time of these historical sex offences, so that we can both bring closure to that and actually learn lessons for the future?’ Government sources said it ‘looked inevitable’ that Harris will be stripped of a string of honours awarded by the Queen. His case will be considered by the independent honours forfeiture committee after his sentence on Friday.","Harris believed to have £11million fortune from his art, music and TV careers .

"Rolf Harris’s home computer contained a secret stash of child pornography images, it can now be revealed. Police found the vile material after the entertainer was arrested on suspicion of indecently assaulting girls as young as seven. The Crown Prosecution Service wanted to try Harris for possessing the indecent images but dropped the charges amid fears that it could be seen as oppressive following his jailing for the assaults. Scroll down for video . Stash: Police found a stash of child porn on Rolf Harris' computer in November 2012 but dropped the charges . Obsessed: Detectives found the paedophile children's entertainer visited depraved porn sites . 'Haunted': Harris abused his daughter's friend who said his actions crushed her dreams of having a family . Harris’s computer contained images of children under 13 posing suggestively while semi-naked, with teddy bears in the foreground. Detectives found a total of 33 indecent photographs of boys and girls downloaded from child pornography websites. Harris also regularly viewed adult pornography – police found nearly 500 erotic images from more than 300 sites. Four per cent of his computer viewing related to teenage porn with Harris clicking on images which included very young girls naked from the waist down. In many cases, Harris returned to the same pictures over and over again after carefully deleting them from his browsing history. Sentence: Harris sat solemn-faced in the dock today as he was sentenced to five years and nine months in jail . Joking: The 84-year-old laughed and joked with reporters as he left Southwark Crown Court this afternoon . Berated: The judge blasted the painter and singer for showing 'no remorse' for his string of sexual assaults . He even kept a note in his diary of instructions on how to delete them from his computer. Harris was charged in August 2013 with four counts of making indecent images of children after police discovered he had downloaded images between June and July 2012 – months before he was questioned under caution in November 2012 on suspicion of indecent assault. But the jury was not told of his sordid pornography collection – kept on an Apple Mac used by other members of his family – after Harris’s lawyer Simon Ray produced evidence in the form of ID cards that he claimed showed that the girls in the images were over 18. In legal arguments in the jury’s absence, Sasha Wass, QC, prosecuting, was forced to agree to separate the four child pornography charges from the indecent assault trial. Miss Wass said: ‘They are almost certainly going to say girls viewed were overage, anything other than that would be compliant in a criminal offence. 'They are extremely young girls, underage girls in pornographic poses.’ Impact: One victim's statement explained how Harris 'had a hold over me' and drove her to alcoholism . Harris admitted looking at adult erotic material online when questioned by police but denied downloading child porn. He insisted any such images found their way on to his hard drive by mistake when he was clicking from one site to another. ‘The key point here is these were not deliberately sought out,’ Mr Ray said. He accepted there was a ‘huge amount’ of adult pornography on Harris’s computer, with his client regularly viewing adult sites. He argued that the charges should be dropped because the indecent images were ‘wholly and unfairly out of context’ in relation to years of downloading thousands of adult pornography. A BBC radio presenter claimed that Harris’s interest in pictures of naked children dated back to the 1970s. Jeff Cooper recalled Harris showing off six images of naked children aged between four and nine at a canteen of Radio Clyde in Glasgow between November 1978 and April 1979. However, his testimony was not put before the jury. Family: . His wife Alwen was left devastated by his affair with the housekeeper . and daughter Bindi was 'crushed' by his fame. Today, the judge attacked . Harris for his abuse of Bindi's friend as his daughter slept beside them . Took advantage: Victim impact statements heard Harris preyed on awestruck girls, 'haunting' them . Meanwhile, the portrait of the Queen painted by Harris is still in the shamed entertainer’s private collection, the Mail can reveal. Now it could be sold to meet compensation claims lodged by his victims. The picture, which the Queen sat for in 2006 to mark her 80th birthday, had not been seen since 2012. The artist’s dealer, Whitewall Galleries, revealed that it had been handed back  to Harris. This raises the prospect that the portrait could be put up for sale to fund the claims his many victims are expected to pursue. Ironically it is one of the few of Harris’s works that will have kept its value. One art industry source said: ‘Anything the Queen has sat for is sought after... it will easily  hold its value despite what  has happened.’","Harris, 84, today jailed for five months and nine months for 12 assaults .

"Barcelona can’t win anything without kids at the moment. After 18-year-old Munir inspired their opening day win over Elche they made it two wins in two thanks to 19-year-old forward Sandro. Luis Enrique’s team dominated Villarreal but despite superb displays from Lionel Messi and Dani Alves they owed their 1-0 win to their young Canary Island striker who scored the only goal of the game eight minutes from time. Last week’s hero Munir was picked to start ahead of Neymar and he had his first chance after five minutes when Alves fed Messi who crossed for the young striker but his shot was smothered by Sergio Asenjo.

Goal: Sandro 82 . Messi also went close but was denied by Victor Ruiz as Barcelona made all the early running with both full-backs playing high up the pitch outside of the visitor’s narrow front three – Luis Enrique already with one eye on how the team will play when both Luis Suarez and Neymar are available to start with Messi. Pedro, the third man in Barca’s attack, had his first chance on 15 minutes but Asenjo again was able to make the save. Alves was being whistled by a mindless minority of home fans. The last time he was at El Madrigal he was racially abused by a supporter who threw a banana at him and he reacted by peeling the banana and taking a bite. The action gave rise to the ‘somostodosmacacos’ (we are all monkeys) anti-racisim campaign. The Brazilian was a constant threat but Villarreal were finally finding their feet and had their best chance of the first half on 23 minutes when Giovani Dos Santos crossed from the right. The centre evaded everyone and Ruiz was all alone at the far post onside and with the chance to put Villarreal ahead. He made poor contact with the ball and sent his effort over Claudio Bravo’s bar. Barcelona almost punished Villarreal immediately when they counter-attacked through Messi and Pedro was played in only to be fouled in the box by Mario. The penalty was not given and the chance was gone. Messi then hit the post with a free-kick that hit midfielder Manu Trigueros and and was pushed onto the frame of the goal by Asenjo. Barcelona continued to threaten down their right with Ivan Rakitic releasing Alves and the full-back winning a corner which came to nothing. Carlos Velasco Carballo was refereeing the game – the Spaniard was in charge of the Brazil v Colombia at the World Cup in which Neymar suffered a fractured vertibrae. He booked Alves five minutes before half-time when the defender complained of a kick from Villarreal’s Jaume Costa. With Barcelona no closer to breaking the deadlock at the start of the second half coach Luis Enrique made his first change on the hour and it was Neymar, who after a strenuous warm-up that also included signing autographs, replaced Munir. Barcelona almost scored immediately with Rakitic finding space inside the penalty area but dragging his cross-shot wide. Knock it and run! Pedro skips beyond Villarreal captain Bruno Soriano in an attempt to find the opening goal . Making himself known: Barcelona manager Luis Enrique bellows orders to his players . Still the crosses rained in from Alves’ right wing but there was no-one to convert them and Messi was getting increasingly frustrated. He went close with a free-kick that Asenjo pushed out for a corner and from the resulting kick the Argentine headed well wide. Barcelona then had their best chance so far. Messi crossed from the right and the ball dropped to Neymar almost on the goal line. The Brazilian only had to lift it over Ruiz who had gone to ground but instead he blasted against the defenders legs and watched it cannon away to safety. Nyemar’s next chance was much more difficult but again it was one you would expect him to score. This time he leaned back and lifted his effort over Asenjo’s bar. Down at the other end Tomas Pina hit the post as Barcelona were almost made to pay the ultimate price for their poor finishing. It was the cue for coach Luis Enrique to turn to Xavi who replaced Rafinha. Barcelona’s favourite route to goal did not change and neither did the result – yet another Alves cross reached Messi and this time his first time shot came back off the outside of the post. Barcelona were enjoying 75 per cent of possession but were still missing the finish until minute 82 when substitute Sandro Ramirez who had replaced Pedro midway through the second half turned the ball in from a yard out – from almost the same place Neymar had missed his earlier sitter. Neymar it was who played in Messi he tricked his way to the byline and when keeper Asenjo was unable to block his cross it reached the young B-team forward who made no mistake.

"The ex-chief prosecutor and children’s charities yesterday warned of ‘injustice’ if serial sex attackers such as Rolf Harris are able to hide behind a cloak of anonymity. Keir Starmer, the former Director of Public Prosecutions, said Harris’s conviction may never have been possible if the paedophile had kept his name out of public view. The predator used draconian legal threats – citing the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards – to pressurise newspapers into keeping the fact he was being investigated by police secret for five months. Disclosure: Keir Starmer, the former Director of Public Prosecutions, (left) said Harris’s conviction may never have been possible if the paedophile had kept his name out of public view . The letters, sent by Royal solicitor Harbottle & Lewis, claimed there was ‘no public interest’ in reporting that he had been quizzed under caution in November 2012 for allegedly sexually assaulting his daughter’s best friend. The problem was compounded by the police – who Leveson had recommended to normally keep secret the fact a suspect had been arrested – refusing to identify Harris. It was only after journalists finally reported his arrest, in April the following year, that a string of other victims came forward to say they had also been indecently assaulted. Prosecutor Sasha Wass QC told the trial this evidence was crucial in proving the case against Harris by demonstrating his ‘persistent pattern of sexual offending’. Yesterday Sir Keir, who advised on the decision to charge Harris in August 2013, said the publicity of his arrest had been crucial. He said: ‘It’s very difficult for victims of sexual abuse to come forward in ordinary circumstances. It’s particularly difficult where there is a celebrity involved because very often victims feel they simply are not going to be believed against someone such as Rolf Harris. ‘It was exactly the same with Jimmy Savile – very few victims did come forward in that case, they felt they couldn’t take Jimmy Savile on, they wouldn’t be believed. That’s a critical part of this whole case.’ He told Newsnight: ‘One of the critical things that is at the heart of this is anonymity. Very often victims find it difficult to come forward but will come forward if they know there is another victim out there.’ As free speech campaigners warned of the chilling effect of Leveson, children’s charity the NSPCC said police had been wrong to not identify Harris. Historically, police forces have confirmed or denied a suspect has been arrested or interviewed under caution if asked by journalists. But this changed in the wake of Leveson, which was published only days before Harris was first questioned under caution. In his report, Lord Justice Leveson wrote: ‘I think that it should be made clear that save in exceptional and clearly identified circumstances (for example, where there may be an immediate risk to the public), the names or identifying details of those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the press or the public. Draconian measures: The shamed star used legal threats to keep the fact he was being investigated by the police for five months secret. His legal team claimed it was not in the 'public interest' to report the probe . John Cameron, head of child protection for the NSPCC, said police should review anonymity on arrest on a case-by-case basis. He said: ‘Where the police believe there are multiple victims over a large period of time, I think there is a benefit of releasing the name of the accused because it encourages other victims to come forward. ‘When Jimmy Savile’s name was mentioned we were inundated. If the police did not say they were investigating him, would we have got any calls at all?’ After Harris was found guilty on Tuesday, there was widespread alarm that Leveson had been successfully used by the ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ entertainer to buy five months of secrecy. Author and free speech campaigner Nick Cohen said: ‘Don’t say you weren’t warned: Rolf Harris lawyers cited Leveson in an attempt to suppress news of arrest’. Bob Satchwell, of the Society of Editors, said Harris was the second case where publicity in the media had ultimately helped to secure a conviction. Upon the conviction of TV and radio presenter Stuart Hall for sex offences against children and women, it emerged ten of his 13 victims came forward only after his arrest was reported. Liz Mullinar, founder of child abuse charity Heal for Life, said: ‘Not naming suspects in cases like this is a disgrace. It means nobody else can come forward. It is protecting the perpetrators not the victims.’ Current Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said the conviction of Harris gave other sex abuse victims the courage to come forward and report abuse. Asked if more women might have come forward if Harris’s name had been publicised earlier, she said it was a ‘difficult balance to draw’. She said: ‘There are arguments on both sides – some people feel that they have been named and then if no charges are brought their reputation has been tarnished. ‘At the same time we have seen both in Rolf Harris and in other cases that if victims know that people are reporting that someone has been arrested, they feel safer in coming forward.’","Keir Starmer said Harris may have avoided convicted if his name was hidden .

"A dazzling white smile is practically essential for any celebrity hoping to make it onto the red . carpet - they don't call it a Hollywood smile for nothing.

"You know that popular saying about Emile Heskey, a cow and a banjo... well, the former Liverpool striker has gone a long way to answering his critics. The much-maligned forward, who was appearing as a guest on the 'Follow the Football' show on BT Sport on Friday night, was given an opportunity to prove that he can hit a cow's backside with a banjo. It came as a surprise to Heskey when, mid-way through the show, host Des Kelly brought out a 'cow', and handed the ex-England forward a banjo to strike it with. Emile Heskey disproves a popular theory by literally hitting a cow's backside with a banjo . Heskey initially wasn't keen on striking the 'cow', but after reassurance gave in...twice . Host Des Kelly consoles the injured 'cow', while Heskey clutches his broken banjo . Initially, Heskey was not keen on hitting the costumed figure, but after reassurance from Kelly, unleashed. His first attempt did nothing to the prop - cue more claims that he really can't hit a cow's a*se with a banjo - but after a second try, Heskey did manage to break the banjo in half, to cheers from audience members at the show. The 36-year-old is without a team after leaving Australian side Newcastle Jets in the summer. He has made more than 500 club appearances, scoring 119 goals - a ratio of 0.21 goals a game. He signed for Liverpool for £11 million in 2000 - a huge amount of money at the time - and went on to score 39 goals for the club in 150 matches.

"Diego Costa followed in Radamel Falcao’s footsteps at Atletico Madrid; now the tables are turned in the Premier League, and this time it’s the Colombian who has it all to prove. When Falcao joined Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2011 Costa was on his way out of the club. He had done well enough the season before as a back-up for Diego Forlan and Sergio Aguero but Atletico had four non EU players, one had to leave, and Diego Simeone had reluctantly decided it had to be Costa. The player agreed to move to Turkish side Besiktas, only to suffer a cruciate ligament injury in his right knee in pre-season which ruled him out for six months and stopped the switch to Turkey. VIDEO Scroll down for Manchester United's Radamel Falcao's incredible career so far . Friends reunited: Radamel Falcao and Diego Costa were team-mates during their time at Atletico Madrid . Summer signings: Falcao (left) and Costa (right) have both sealed summer moves to the Premier League . When he returned to full-fitness in January Falcao was already well on the way to writing himself into Atletico Madrid’s record books and Costa was packed off to relegation-threatened Rayo Vallecano on loan for the second half of the season. He shocked both his loan club and his parent club by coming back so strongly from such a long lay-off scoring 10 goals in the second half of the season and playing an important part of Rayo’s last day of the season great escape. He was welcomed back by Atletico but he was still only Corporal Costa marching behind Field Marshall Falcao. At the start of the season Costa watched from the bench as an unused substitute, as Falcao scored a hat-trick in a 4-1 European Super Cup win over Chelsea. Goalscorer: Falcao scored 52 league goals in 68 games during his time at Atletico Madrid . Cristiano Ronaldo (31 goals in 30 games, 82 minutes per goal) Lionel Messi (28 goals in 31 games, 89 minutes per goal) Sergio Aguero (17 goals in 23 games, 91 minutes per goal) Luis Suarez (31 goals in 33 games, 96 minutes per goal) Diego Costa (27 goals in 35 games, 110 minutes per goal) Robin van Persie (12 goals in 21 games, 132 minutes per goal) Robert Lewandowski (20 goals in in 33 games, 140 minutes per goal) Falcao (Nine goals in 17 games, 155 minutes per goal) Thomas Muller (13 goals in 31 games, 167 minutes per goal) Neymar (Nine goals in 26 games, 193 minutes per goal) Despite that performance from Falcao in 2012, and despite the fact that Costa watched it from the bench, it was to be Costa and not Falcao that Jose Mourinho would opt for two years later despite having his pick of the pair as he went in search of a new Chelsea centre-forward. His decision was based in part on Costa’s over-all game; his work off the ball; his durability – all qualities that he was to show over the next two seasons, first with Falcao alongside him, and then as his replacement. Costa gradually edged his way into the team alongside Falcao in the 2012-13 season – running the channels either side of the penalty box predator. The two formed a good partnership with many of the 34 goals Falcao scored that season coming from Costa assists, but in the 2013 Spanish Cup final, roles were reversed as Falcao played the pass and Costa applied the deadly finish that helped Atletico Madrid beat Real Madrid. League winner: Spanish international Costa helped Atletico Madrid to the La Liga title last season . It was a reminder to Atletico Madrid’s directors that with Falcao leaving at the end of the season bound for Monaco, Costa had enough about him to fill the Colombian’s boots. The following season, finally out of Falcao’s shadow, Costa’s goals didn’t take Atletico Madrid to the King’s Cup final; instead they took them to the European Cup final and to the league title. Most supporters would now say he was the better of the two strikers – not quite as good in the air as Manchester United’s new number nine but just as prolific in front of goal and with a greater all-round game. Falcao now has the chance to prove those supporters and Mourinho wrong. The two forwards are in very good company these days – there was no Di Maria, Mata and Rooney at Atletico Madrid for Falcao; and there was no Cesc Fabregas, Eden Hazard and Oscar at the Vicente Calderon for Costa. Both can emulate previous Atletico Madrid centre-forwards, Fernando Torres and Sergio Aguero, and steal the show this season in the Premier League. Quiet, introverted men away from the pitch their relationship in Madrid was a largely football one. There will be a lot more to talk about when they meet again on Sunday October 26 – both before and after they have set-about each other’s team’s defences.","Man United signed Radamel Falcao on loan until the end of the season .

"Real Madrid's start to the 2014/15 La Liga season has been far from desirable, with Carlo Ancelotti's men lagging in 14th position after two losses from their first three games. Los Blancos have been under considerable scrutiny from their fans, and leading Spanish newspaper Marca ramped up the pressure on Saturday with their headline, 'Una Finale En Septiembre'. 'A cup final in September', signifying that Madrid's game with Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday evening is a must-win, as Ancelotti fights to save his job at the Bernabeu. 'A final in September'... Marca ramp up the pressure on Carlo Ancelotti in Saturday's paper . Marca report that Ancelotti will make two defensive switches, replacing Pepe with Varane in the centre of defence, and Alvaro Arbeloa returning to right-back. The paper also state that Madrid are 'without room for error', and touch on Cristiano Ronaldo's record of having never scored at Riazor, Deportivo's 'manor'. AS focus on much the same topic, quoting Ancelotti as saying, 'I don't understand so much worry.' Ancelotti continues: 'The pre-season was strange because of the World Cup. There wasn't time for us to practice.' 'The season is long and we will fight to the end in all competitions.' Mundo Deportivo's main story focuses on the other La Liga powerhouses, Barcelona, with the headline 'Total Control'. Much more positive news in that part of Spain, it seems, as Barcelona sit pretty at the top of the league - three matches, three wins, and no goals conceded.

"The world's largest clubs keep on splashing the cash as they seek to surpass their rivals and buy the stars to fire them to glory. Despite rulings such as Financial Fair Play coming into effect, the transfer fees keep on rising. Sportsmail has collated the top 10, with La Liga dominating the list with six of the most expensive deals on record. 10. DAVID LUIZ (Chelsea to Paris Saint-Germain) £50million in 2014 . The Brazilian defender was extremely popular with the Chelsea faithful down at Stamford Bridge and enjoyed a highly successful three years in West London. He helped Chelsea win the FA Cup, The Champions League and the Europa League. However he was susceptible to the occasional error and such lapses of concentration were never going to sit well with manager Jose Mourinho and Luiz lapped up the chance to move to big spending Paris Saint-Germain. VIDEO Scroll down to watch: The Top 10 most expensive football transfers of all time . Erratic: Luiz created a shock by moving to Paris but was clearly not a part of Jose Mourinho's plans at Chelsea . 9. RADAMEL FALCAO (Atletico Madrid to Monaco) £51million in 2013 . In the summer of 2013 Falcao was one of the world's hottest properties. Monaco flexed their financial prowess and lured the Colombian international to France. Falcao fired in 70 goals for Atletico Madrid in just 91 appearances, hence his high fee but after only one injury hit season with Monaco, Falcao has moved to the Premier League on loan . The Colombian forward completed his £6million loan deal to Manchester United in the early hours of Tuesday morning after the Old Trafford club held off competition from Arsenal and Manchester City for his signature. Moved on: Falcao has already left Monaco after one season and signed for Manchester United on-loan . 8. EDINSON CAVANI (Napoli to Paris Saint-Germain) £55million in 2013 . Having impressed during three years in the Serie A for Napoli, scoring 95 goals in 116 appearances, Cavani headed to France to join Paris Saint-Germain who continued to spend big. Prolific: The Uruguay international has already won three trophies in Paris including the 2014 Ligue 1 title . 7. KAKA (AC Milan to Real Madrid) £56million in 2009 . The FIFA 2007 World Player of the Year spent six scintillating seasons at the San Siro for AC Milan prompting a huge bid from Real Madrid in the summer of 2009. Despite winning the La Liga in 2012 with Los Blancos, a series of injuries and inconsistent form saw the playmaker depart the Bernabeu last year, heading back to Milan. However the former Brazil international has already moved on, having signed for MLS side Orlando City for 2015. In the meantime Kaka is on loan back at his first club Sao Paulo. Hit and miss: Kaka joined Real Madrid with huge expectations but the playmaker never reached that billing . 6. ANGEL DI MARIA (Real Madrid to Manchester United) £60million in 2014 . United smashed the British transfer record in paying Real Madrid £60million for di Maria as the Red Devils continued their summer rebuilding under new manager Louis van Gaal. The Argentina international had a fine World Cup but tragically missed out on the final with injury. He was instrumental for Real Madrid for the past four seasons and arrives at Old Trafford with high hopes of inspiring United up the table. The 26-year-old impressed on his debut against Burnley on Saturday but couldn't inspire United to a win as they were held 0-0 at Turf Moor. Van Gaal will hope he can replicate his stunning Real Madrid form which saw him awarded Man of the Match as Los Blancos won the Champions League in May. Good start: Di Maria started for United at Burnley on Saturday and was in fine form before being substituted . 5. ZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIC (Inter to Barcelona) £40million and Samuel Eto'o (£20m) in 2009 . Here's a player never short on confidence. Ibrahimovic signed for Barcelona following three successive Serie A titles at Inter Milan. However after only one season at the Nou Camp, with 16 goals in 29 appearances, he left having fell out with manager Pep Guardiola. Ibrahimovic blamed Lionel Messi and Pep Guardiola for his failure at Barcelona, claiming that his former boss used to 'bully' him. The flamboyant Swedish international has since played for AC MIlan and signed for Paris Saint-Germain in July 2012 where he has guided the club to two successive Ligue 1 titles. Short stint: The striker only lasted a year at the Nou Camp having fallen out with manager Pep Guardiola . 4. JAMES RODRIGUEZ (Monaco to Real Madrid) £63million in 2014 . Rodriguez was one of the revelations of the World Cup this summer, scoring in each of Colombia's games as they reached the quarter-finals of the competition for the very first time, eventually losing 2-1 to hosts Brazil. In total Rodriguez scored six goals at the World Cup to finish as the leading scorer - one clear of Thomas Muller - while his stunning 25-yard volley against Uruguay was voted goal of the tournament on FIFA.com. New Galactico: James Rodriguez signed for Real Madrid after catching the eye at the World Cup this summer . 3. LUIS SUAREZ (Liverpool to Barcelona) £75million in 2014 . What can you say about the controversial striker. A series of incidents blighted his superb record at Liverpool. The Uruguay international fired in 82 goals for the Premier League giants in just 125 games. Despite the controversy surrounding his bite on Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup this summer and his subsequent ban, Barcelona still came in for striker. Suarez is currently serving his four-month ban for the bite and has yet to make his competitive debut for Barcelona. Controversial: Luis Suarez left Liverpool after a series of incidents overshadowed his fine goal scoring record . 2. CRISTIANO RONALDO (Manchester United to Real Madrid) £80million in 2009 . Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo moved to the Bernabeu in a protracted transfer saga. Ronaldo had been sensational at Old Trafford over six seasons, helping Sir Alex Ferguson's side win three Premier Leagues and the 2008 Champions League. Since arriving at Real Madrid, Ronaldo's impact has been stunning. His goal scoring record is second to none with 178 for Los Blancos in 166 appearances. Consequently, the Portuguese star has guided Madrid to the 2012 La Liga title and their much desired 'Decima' Champions League in May. Galactico: Cristiano Ronaldo has been a huge success at Real Madrid since leaving Manchester United in 2009 . 1. GARETH BALE (Tottenham to Real Madrid) £86million in 2013 . The welshman was in inspired form for Tottenham during the last three seasons at White Hart Lane having previously struggled when he arrived at the North London club in 2007. Bale tranformed his game from a troubled left-back, sitting on the bench at Tottenham, into a match winner. He was scoring crucial goals for fun and Real Madrid finally purchased Bale for a record fee last summer. The 25-year-old enjoyed a dream first season in Madrid as the forward played a major role in their Champions League and Copa Del Rey successes.

"Rolf Harris was today linked to Jimmy Savile as it emerged he joined the paedophile on a sick visit to the psychiatric hospital where the DJ habitually abused patients. One of Savile’s victims said Harris ogled vulnerable women as they undressed at Broadmoor in 1973, where the former Top of the Pops star attacked scores of people. Alison Pink remembered the pair suddenly turning up on a women’s ward just as patients were preparing to strip in the corridor and said they were 'birds of a feather'. It came as a video emerged today showing Harris and Savile laughing about how 'we go back a long time' in 1992.

Reunion: The interview came almost 20 years after the pair visited Broadmoor together and where a Savile victim said they watched women strip for bed . Artwork: Savile kept hold of the sketch, which was sold for £4,500 after his death in 2012 to raise money for his foundation . New link: Rolf Harris in the grounds of Broadmoor on the same day as Jimmy Savile signing autographs for fans at a fete. One patient told how on the same day the pair had watched vulnerable women undress . Paedophile: Savile abused dozens of women at Broadmoor, where he also had his own set of keys and living quarters . The Broadmoor ex-patient, now called Steven George after a sex change, said: ‘Harris turned up one evening out of the blue. ‘He was being shown around by Savile in an understated way. Normally stars only came if they were there for an official performance but Harris didn’t do one. ‘It . was also unusual because visitors would come at visiting hours, between . 10am and 4pm, but they came in as we were getting ready for bed.’ New pictures reveal that Harris and Savile also signed autographs for children who attended a fete in the grounds. Almost two decades later the pair were reunited by ITV, who filmed them together for Harris' series Rolf's Cartoon Club. Harris had previously appeared on Savile's BBC show Jim'll Fix It. Discussing their careers and how their paths crossed when Harris was a pop star and Savile was on Radio 1 and Top of the Pops they admitted: 'We go back a long time'. Savile smokes a cigar with his tracksuit top unzipped and deliberately confuses Harris with Elvis Presley. Rolf then unveils a sketch, which Savile holds and says: 'I see strong character lines, I see liquid brown eyes and I see the firm jutting chin, all together makes a horrible sight,' and Harris laughs as he says: 'It looks nothing like you.' Twenty years later it was sold after he died in 2012 to raise money for his foundation, at an auction that raised £320,000. Other lots included a glass eye stolen from a corpse, which he then made into a trophy necklace. It is believed to have been worn by the paedophile DJ as he co-presented the final episode of Top of the Pops at BBC Television Centre in 2006, where he also groped a child. 'Birds . of a feather': Jimmy Savile and Rolf Harris, pictured appearing . together on Jim'll Fix It, watched women in Broadmoor undress, according . to a former patient . Documented: Harris's visit to the Berkshire hospital in 1973 was mentioned in last week's report on Savile's abuse . Yesterday . Harris, 84, was told he faced an 'inevitable' jail term after he was . found guilty of 12 indecent assaults on four victims between 1968 and . 1986, often in 'plain sight'. 'Jekyll . and Hyde' Harris had used his fame to 'mesmerise' underage fans before . abusing them with impunity and believed his celebrity status made him . believe 'he was above the law', Scotland Yard said. The . Australian star spent 16 years abusing his daughter Bindi's best friend . and got a 'thrill' from attacking her when his own child was feet away. A seven-year-old girl was groped when she asked for his autograph at an event where he performed his hit 'Two Little Boys' for children. Account: A report into Savile's abuse said he had forced Broadmoor patients to strip . Today it emerged that Harris could face fresh charges after more women found the courage to come forward after he was convicted yesterday, the Director of Public Prosecutions said. While 12 others have already approached lawyers to apply for compensation from his £11million estate. His native Australia has also turned on Harris, where he was viewed as a national treasure. The mayor of Perth in western Australia said the council was considering tearing up a plaque to Harris inlaid in the city's St Georges Terrace, while there is growing pressure for the disgraced entertainer to be stripped of his honours from the Queen. Australian prime minister Tony Abbott said he was 'gutted and dismayed' by the news of the conviction, telling ABC radio: 'I feel gutted and dismayed but it's very important that we do everything we humanly can to protect vulnerable young people. Sexual abuse is an utterly abhorrent crime. 'It's just sad and tragic that this person who was admired seems to have been a perpetrator.' He will be sentenced at Southwark Crown Court on Friday. Harris’s visit to Broadmoor hospital in 1973 was mentioned in last week’s report on Savile’s abuse. But police and child protection experts found no evidence of wrongdoing by Harris. The report said Savile forced patients to strip, it stated: ‘We heard convincing accounts of a pattern of inappropriate behaviour surrounding Savile’s attendance on female wards at bath time and bedtime... female patients would be obliged to strip while lined up in corridors. ‘We heard that Savile followed a clear pattern of arriving on a female ward at just before this time. ‘Unchallenged by staff, he would then watch from behind, as the row of female patients undressed.’ Mr George, now 62, first wrote an account of Harris’ Broadmoor visit in his 2012 autobiography 'Heartless'. Guilty: Harris leaves Southwark Crown Court today after he was found guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault . Disgraced: In Australia a plaque laid in his home town near Perth has been defaced and may be pulled up while prime minister Tony Abbott said he was 'gutted and dismayed' by the news Harris was convicted . He was sent to the high-security psychiatric hospital as a teenager after running away from adoptive parents and setting fire to a property. A woman who says she was abused by Rolf Harris wrote to Buckingham Palace to say: 'He ruined my life. You need to know what kind of man you’ve let near the Queen'. The alleged victim said she was attacked by him as a child and was furious when she learned the artist, 84, was to paint Her Majesty in 2005. The note, written anonymously, was handed to the Queen's Royal Protection Group, linked to Scotland Yard, who filed them as evidence. It wasn't until 2012, when Harris was arrested, that they were investigated. Scotland Yard has refused to comment. Top of the Pops host Savile was a frequent volunteer and was given his own keys and living quarters at the hospital. He recalled how Savile took Harris to Lancaster ward, where women who were being punished had to strip in the corridor in front of warders. He told the Mirror: ‘Harris was very famous at the time and had his weekend show. He walked down the passageway of York ward with Savile opening the doors along with a nursing officer. ‘Some of the girls came out and there was an unprompted performance of Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport. He then went through to the punishment ward. ‘At that time of the evening all the girls on that ward would have been undressed ready for bed. ‘We all had to get completely undressed in the hallway in front of the staff, male and female, to show nothing was being taken into our rooms. ‘I thought it was odd that he was walking through the female wards and not doing a show. It was strange that he arrived at the same time the women were undressing for bed.’ Harris and Savile were pictured together as they signed autographs at a fete in July 1973.","Savile victim says pair arrived on ward as patients prepared to strip for bed .

He would not have played every game, but the way they lost it against Chelsea and Crystal Palace would not have happened.'

"A season-defining injury is not unheard of for Arsenal fans. But a £42.5million signing, out for three months with Aaron Ramsey also missing? Alarm bells are ringing. Mesut Ozil will miss the remainder of 2014 with a knee injury, the German Football Federation confirmed. A dazzling player at his best, the top No 10 in the world on his day; but is his injury all bad for Arsene Wenger? Here, Sportsmail looks at three reasons why Arsenal will suffer without Ozil, and three why everything could be all right... Mesut Ozil has been ruled out for the remainder of 2014 with a knee ligament injury . Ozil on the ground against Chelsea - but could Arsenal's season take off without their record signing? AGAINST . The win percentage . Arsenal are no doubt a better team with Ozil in the starting XI and on form, but the stats suggest Arsene Wenger copes without his record signing. The Gunners score more goals on average with the playmaker around, but have a win percentage of just 56.2 per cent when he's involved compared to 61.5 per cent without him. Statistics aren't the be-all and end-all, but are perhaps a reminder to fans that it's not the end of the world. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain . Fans have seen glimpses of what Oxlade-Chamberlain can do during his three years at the club, but too often those moments have been split up by niggling injuries. This year (so far) seems to tell a different story for the 21-year-old, who has impressed on the wing in recent weeks. A mixture of raw pace and with the confidence to surge past defenders, whether it be out wide or through the middle, an extended run in the team could follow for the Ox. And that won't harm England, either... Are Arsenal really better off without Mesut Ozil? Their record when he is not on the pitch suggests so . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain could be granted an extended run in the team in Ozil's absence . Big games . Against Manchester City, Chelsea and Dortmund this season, there has been a common theme for Arsenal; 4-5-1, Ozil on the wing. Funnily enough, the natural playmaker has produced his worst performances out wide. It's tough to criticise Ozil when playing in his best position but he's almost non-existent when tasked with tracking back and creating from the right or left. Wenger inexplicably failed to substitute the Germany man against Chelsea at the weekend despite his struggles, and players who are more suited for the wide areas should start the next crunch clashes. Manchester United, Dortmund and Liverpool await in the next three months. Ozil (left) struggled on the wing in big games against Manchester City, Chelsea and Dortmund . FOR . Pass master . Consistency is key for Ozil, who was Opta's 'top passer' for the 2013-14 season, his first in English football. Eclipsing David Silva and Juan Mata, the 25-year-old's pass accuracy in the final third was a staggering 84.24 per cent, and put simply Arsenal don't look the same without him. The Gunners struggled for fluidity when Ozil picked up an injury against Bayern Munich, with many players lacking the nous the German possesses in and around the penalty area. The Germany playmaker was the top passer in the Premier League last season . Arsenal's speedsters . Much has been made of Danny Welbeck and Alexis Sanchez so far this season, while the soon-to-return Theo Walcott has hardly been mentioned. These three could form the quickest partnership in the Premier League. And who better to assist them than Ozil, who was praised for helping Cristiano Ronaldo flourish at Real Madrid? Sanchez and Ozil already showed glimpses that they were beginning to click, while Welbeck was also profiting. Danny Welbeck and Alexis Sanchez certainly would have benefited with Ozil in the team . Finishing off lesser teams . As much as Ozil goes missing in the bigger games out on the wing, his impact against the so-called lesser teams in the Premier League can't be questioned. He keeps things ticking, not allowing opponents to lose their concentration. One slip, and he'll pick you off with a through ball. Oxlade-Chamberlain and Walcott have the pace to hurt defences, but they certainly don't have the guile of Ozil. Ozil is brilliant against so-called lesser teams, often opening them up with a pass and scoring the odd goal .

'When I joined Auxerre's training centre I knew I wanted to become a footballer and I told myself I had to be the best player there.

I am always positive and usually when I start scoring I don't stop. I haven't set any targets yet, all I care about is that I play and improve my game.

The former captain said: 'In 2003 once you've won the World Cup, everything is portrayed as being great and a perfect working machine. 'But of course it wasn't - we were all human beings, we all made mistakes, had our frailties and did similar things that the boys did in 2011.

'People go, ""It was a disaster at the World Cup"", but England have won one Championship in the last 11 years and that was in 2011,' Johnson said. 'We won 10 out of 13 games that year and we did OK. Ultimately we brought through a lot of players who had a successful start to their career, although we were criticised for not doing that. 'Dan Cole, Alex Corbisiero, Courtney Lawes, Tom Wood, Ben Youngs, Chris Ashton, Ben Foden and Manu Tuilagi all came through. Johnson is a Mastercard ambassador for the 2015 World Cup . 'In 2008-09 there was a lack of guys who were really putting their hands up to play Test rugby. We did start bringing some through and they played well.

"More than two weeks after an estimated 234 school girls were kidnapped by Islamic extremists in Nigeria, people have taken to the streets for another day of protests to voice their unhappiness at the government’s failure to ensure the safe release of the hostages. The girls were seized by members of the Boko Haram terrorist network at a high school in the town of Chibok in the nation's far northeast on April 16. Armed men herded the girls out of their beds and forced them into a convoy of trucks which then disappeared into the dense forest bordering Cameroon. Scroll down for video .

With outrage growing over the failure to rescue the girls, thousands of Nigerians took to the streets of the country’s largest city Lagos on Thursday to protest at their government’s inability to find the victims. Protesters around the world have also harnessed the power of social media using hashtags including #BringBackOurGirls and #BringBackOurDaughters to demand that more is done. Celebrities including singers Mary J Blige, Janelle Monae and Deborah Cox have retweeted the call for more to be done to rescue the school girls. ‘If 230 girls can go missing for this long and nobody knows how to find them, then something's very wrong with our country,’ said Tokumbo Adebanjo, 45, a travel agent and mother.

The students are being paid 2,000 naira ($12) to marry the fighters, Halite Aliyu of the Borno-Yobe People's Forum told The Associated Press. She said the parents' information about mass weddings is coming from villagers in the Sambisa Forest, on Nigeria's border with Cameroon, where Boko Haram is known to have hideouts. The girls are between 16 and 18 years old and had been recalled to the school to write a physics exam when they were seized. About 50 of the kidnapped girls managed to escape from their captors in the first days after their abduction, but some 220 remain missing, according to the principal of the Chibok Girls Secondary School, Asabe Kwambura.

Ali Ndume said. ‘The longer it takes the dimmer the chances of finding them, the longer it takes the more traumatized the family and the abducted girls are.’ The failure to rescue the girls is a massive embarrassment to Nigeria's government and the military, and President Jonathan, who is from the predominantly Christian south of Nigeria, has been accused of insensitivity to the plight of people in the north, who are mainly Muslims.

"England’s limited-overs series against India was played in front of crowds largely supporting the away team. This was most evident at Edgbaston last Sunday in a T20 international, where around 90 per cent of the capacity crowd left disappointed as England secured a thrilling three-run victory. Most of those waving Indian flags that day in Birmingham hold British passports, and have spent the majority of their life in the United Kingdom. Many were born on these shores, but still choose to follow the country of their family roots instead of their country of birth. The England team over the years has contained many players with Asian heritage. This summer has seen the emergence of Moeen Ali - born in Birmingham and of Pakistani origin - as an international player. Before him the likes of Ravi Bopara, Monty Panesar and Samit Patel all broke into the England team as well. Moeen Ali has established himself as an international player in the England team this summer . Moeen Ali was born in Birmingham and is of Pakistani origin . The contribution of south Asians to cricket in England and Wales, from the top-level players, coaches, grassroots, youngsters and even recreational players is vast. On October 7 at Lord’s, there will be an event to celebrate that contribution – the Asian Cricket Awards - open to people with south Asian heritage as well as those dedicated to increasing Asian participation in cricket on these shores. England star Ali said: ‘Asians throughout the UK make an enormous contribution to all aspects of the game. It’s great to see their input celebrated in such a positive way at the home of cricket.’ The awards, which are supported by the England and Wales Cricket Board, were founded by Baljit Rihal and Jas Jassal. The 11 categories cover all aspects of the game, from Player of the Year to Coach of the Year, Lifetime Achievement and Women in Cricket. Nominations for the event are now closed and a judging panel, featuring the likes of Mike Gatting, will decide the winners among a variety of categories on the night at the home of cricket. Ravi Bopara continues to press his claim to be part of England's 2015 World Cup plans . Jassal said: ‘The awards are to recognise the contribution made by the British Asian community in cricket within the UK and it’s also about the integration and the role models who broke down barriers and reached the heights. We are celebrating all these contributions. ‘At the same time we are also giving a pat on the back to the governing bodies of English cricket for the work they have done in engaging, being inclusive and reaching out. In terms of participation from the south Asian community, it is very high and it goes from grass roots to the professional game. ‘I was quite stunned to see there was a population of seven or eight million south Asians in the UK yet in terms of the participation in cricket, south Asians represent 30 per cent. ‘British society has become so multicultural and Asians feel they have become part of this society and they see positives in it. There is so much there to be thankful for and rewarded. ‘Nasser Hussain, a second-generation Asian, built up a life in England and reached the highest achievements. He went from playing in grass roots to leading the side out on the field and that is a massive achievement. The Edgbaston stands for England's T20 against India were filled with fans supporting the away team . Sportsmail columnist Nasser Hussain captained England, and now works as a commentator for Sky Sports . Isa Guha will co-present the awards at Lord's . ‘If you look at football, there is nowhere near the level of engagement and success that cricket has. We need people like Nasser, Bopara, Ali and also women in cricket like Isa Guha, who have reached the heights and been successful to help set the standards for future generations to succeed.’ Guha, who is of Kolkata Bengali descent, was born in High Wycombe  and played for England’s women’s team for 10 years. Much like Asian participation in the game, women’s cricket has plenty to celebrate. Guha said: ‘It’s important not to forget your roots but at the same time I appreciate that England has given me and my parents a lot of opportunity. ‘I will always support England because I was born and bred here and I played for England for 10 years. ‘Moeen Ali is a great role model and someone people can really look up to. Given the current climate in this country and attitudes towards Asians in this country, I think he paints a positive picture.’ In the women’s game, England’s side have recently turned professional – a move that looked a long way off a decade or so ago. In 2003, there were 90 clubs with girls’ sections in England and Wales. In 2014, there are over 600. The ECB have also continued their investment in and support of the game, as have broadcasters such as Sky Sports and BBC. Let’s not forget, also, the success that Charlotte Edwards has led the team to – a World Cup win in 2009 and back-to-back Ashes victories over Australia. Guha said: 'Women's cricket has come on leaps and bounds and really has just gone from strength to strength. The ongoing commitment from Sky and the BBC to raise the profile of the game has played an important part in the leading women’s cricketers becoming more recognisable figures.'

Portsmouth are debt free almost two years ahead of schedule after paying off £7million in the last 18 months . Chief executive Mark Catlin told The News: ‘Pompey is completely legacy debt free – but that is just the start. ‘It is a fantastic achievement and a weight hanging over the club since coming out of administration 18 months ago has been removed. ‘We are at Ground Zero now. This club was in a crater and we are out of that now with foundations built. The club has turned itself around and got itself on a level playing field. We are debt free and keep moving forward and progressing, never taking our eye off the ball.’ Tal Ben Haim was involved in a high-profile settlement with Portsmouth in which Harry Redknapp intervened .

'PCFC can now fully focus its efforts on looking forwards instead of backwards, while still recognising that the rebuilding process will continue to be a difficult task in the years ahead.’ In 2008 Portsmouth won the FA Cup but in 2009 they entered administration and were relegated in 2010 .","Portsmouth are finally free of debt .

"Read the Oakland Raiders star's blog for nfluk.com in full here . Oakland Raiders offensive tackle Menelik Watson is determined to fly the British flag higher than ever after being rocked by the news that compatriots Lawrence Okoye and Jack Crawford had failed to make the final cut. Okoye was placed on the San Francisco 49ers’ practice squad while Crawford also failed to make the final 53-man roster at his team, the Oakland Raiders. That leaves Manchester-born Watson as the only Brit left standing in the Bay Area, and the 25-year-old is determined to do his country proud. Bay Area Brit: Menelik Watson is set to embark on another season with the Oakland Raiders . In his blog for nfluk.com, Watson said: ‘This Saturday (final roster cuts) really hit home! I got news that a few of my college teammates were waived. Past that I received news that my two fellow countrymen Jack Crawford and Lawrence Okoye, who both fly the British flag at every opportunity, were waived. ‘When I heard Jack got waived it hit me like a ton of bricks. Jack is more than just a fellow countryman, teammate, and neighbour (we live in the same building)… He’s a brother! I met Jack when I was 15. We played against each other in the England Basketball Under 16 Final Four.

Watson added: ‘I first met Lawrence Okoye last year in Atlanta, Georgia at the airport when I was reporting to rookie minicamp. He was headed to San Francisco for the 49ers rookie minicamp, and we somehow coincidentally managed to be on the same flight weighing down the plane. ‘Just like Jack he is a great representative for the UK, and he is a guy who I was definitely pulling for to make the team. ‘I’m going to miss having those guys in the Bay with me. It’s easy to fly the flag when you have two of the largest guys in the Western Hemisphere flying it with you, but I’m still going to do everything in my power to make sure that flag flies higher than ever out here.’ Manchester's Menelik Watson became the highest-drafted British NFL player when selected by the Oakland Raiders in the second round in 2013.

"Carl Jenkinson believes West Ham have made a statement of intent by drafting in no fewer than nine new players this summer. The on-loan defender from Arsenal was one of many new faces at Upton Park, including the likes of Alex Song, Enner Valencia, Mauro Zarate and Morgan Amalfitano. And the 22-year-old right back says the ambition shown in the transfer market is one of the reasons he moved to West Ham for the season from Arsenal. Arrival: Carl Jenkinson joined West Ham on loan from Arsenal for the season . He told whufc.com: 'We've made some great signings and that was half the reason I joined.

Me, as much as the rest of the boys and the fans, are very excited to have him on board because he'll bring an awful lot to the side.

'I think it’s a clever bit a business from the club, he’s a world class player and, while I appreciate the injuries he’s had, don’t forget that much of the build-up to the World Cup was about him. 'People were so excited to see Falcao and Colombia play and so many thought they had a great chance to win the World Cup because of him. 'They ended up doing so well without him, but imagine how far they would have got with him in the team. 'If he can stay injury free for a year he can recuperate and be stronger, and after a successful campaign, if United get back into the Champions League, he can continue from there.'

"Nico Rosberg is on pole for the Belgian Grand Prix after edging out Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton at Spa. The championship leader was 0.228 seconds faster than the Brit as Mercedes were once again in a class of their own. Relive all the action as it happened. 14:08: In the meantime, I will leave you with our report from qualifying HERE. 14.01: NICO ROSBERG ON POLE FOR BELGIAN GRAND PRIX. Lewis Hamilton has to settle for second place, Sebastian Vettel is in third. Thumbs up for Rosberg. He is primed to extend his advantage in the drivers' championship. Make sure you join us in the race tomorrow from midday. Hamilton with a scruffy final lap with a couple of small errors that left him 0.228 seconds behind his team-mate. Vettel leads the rest of the field in third place, 2.1 seconds off pole. Here are your top 10: . 1. Rosberg . 2. Hamilton . 3. Vettel . 4. Alonso . 5. Ricciardo . 6. Bottas . 7. Magnussen . 8. Raikkonen . 9. Massa . 10. Button . 13:52: The sun is out now again in Belgium, and that means the track will be drying all the time. Rosberg has set the initial pace on 2:05.698 on the intermediate tyres, over two seconds faster than Vettel and Alonso. 13:42: At the end of Q2, it was all plain sailing for Mercedes with Hamilton a tenth ahead of Rsoberg and then a gap of over a second to the rest of the field. The drama occurred lower down the field when Button needed to produce a good lap lying in 11th place. The 2009 world champion did that, and knocked reigning champion Vettel into 11th. But the Red Bull driver also delivered a flying lap, and that means that Kvyat is the man who is eliminated in 11th place. The men who are out then... 11.Kyvat . 12. Vergne . 13. Perez . 14. Sutil . 15. Grosjean . 16. Bianchi . Spray: Championship leader Nico Rosberg competes during a wet qualifying session in Belgium . 13:36: Lewis Hamilton goes a second faster than anyone with a 2:07 on the intermediate tyres. Rosberg is second but a lot closer to the rest of the pack. The rain is showing no signs of easing up as we head into the final five minutes of this session. 13:29: It is raining again in Spa and Romain Grosjean's race engineer has just told him over team radio that the track is getting wetter. It looks like the full wets could be coming back for this session. Sportsmail's Jon McEvoy reports: 'Raining now, at the start of Q2. Getting in a good early lap could be key. Max Chilton, after the hoopla about whether he would drive or not – contractual problems – was eliminated in Q1, a second a half slower than his team-mate Jules Bianchi.' 13:27: Just to run through the men who are out after Q1 as we head into Q2 . 17.

Rain starting to fall again. Host commentator . Hamilton goes fastest with just over nine minutes remaining on 2:07.5. The Brit is on the intermediate tyres and they look like the way to go at the moment. Ferrari have pitted their drivers to put the inters on their cars. Alonso is 3.6 seconds off Hamilton using the full wets. Rosberg second, two tenths behind Hamilton at the moment. A divide in opinion at the moment among the teams. Ferrari have sent both Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen out on full wet tyres while Lotus pair Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado are both on inters. A lot of spray visible at the moment. Leading mark is Ricciardo with a 2:10.6, one tenth ahead of Bottas. The clock is ticking and we are underway in Q1. A queue of cars waited at the end of the pit lane for the session to start. Intermediate tyres for a lot of the drivers, including Lewis Hamilton. Right, it looks like the track is fit for action, and Q1 will be underway very shortly. What the top teams must be careful of in this session is being caught out by a drying track that will result in some faster times towards the end of the session. Here is an update from Jon McEvoy at Spa: . 'The safety car is going round, throwing up quite a bit of water. It has stopped raining though. Christian Horner made it back to the Red Bull motorhome from Mercedes with the help of a Mercedes member of staff holding his umbrella – a kind of chauffeur service.' It's brightening up at Spa! After that torrential downpour, the sun is out and there is blue sky over the track at the moment. No update yet on whether the stat of qualifying has been delayed. There is a lot of water on the track after that downpour. 'Throwing it down with rain. Team principals huddling in Mercedes after a meeting. First to run out of the building is John Booth - that's Yorkshire for you.' These downpours are very heavy and it looks like we could have a delay to qualifying. No word just yet, but I'll keep you informed of any announcements. In the meantime, enjoy some more rain pictures... And here we go. It is now raining at Spa and quite heavily as well.

"Players union chief Gordon Taylor has welcomed the Football League's review into the under-representation of black, Asian and minority ethnic people in coaching and management. Huddersfield's Chris Powell and Carlisle boss Keith Curle are the only non-white managers in the English professional game. This imbalance has been a source of debate for a number of years and Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers Association, recently spoke of 'a hidden racism which holds clubs back'. PFA boss Gordon Taylor has hit out against a 'hidden racism' preventing black managers from finding work . Keith Curle (left) and Chris Powell (right) are the only two non-white managers in the professional game . Taylor has also highlighted how this under-representation extends to general coaching positions throughout the game, while around 20-25 per cent of professional players are not white. The Football League has now discussed this matter and pledged to work towards a solution. Taylor said: 'I am delighted with the news and am very encouraged. 'There will be a lot of people very pleased and I hope we can keep the momentum going. 'At the start of this season we didn't have one black manager out of 92, so it needs addressing. 'I wouldn't say I'm counting my chickens yet but I am encouraged that we can keep the momentum going with this staying on football's agenda.' The League has said it will be open-minded about potential solutions but Taylor advocates an equivalent of American football's 'Rooney Rule', which would compel clubs to interview at least one black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) candidate for management jobs. The NFL employs the Rooney Rule to address the issue of a lack of coaches from minority backgrounds . The Rooney Rule has been used in the NFL since 2003 to ensure ethnic minority candidates are adequately represented in the interview process for head-coaching positions. NFL franchises must interview at least one black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) for management jobs. Taylor, whose organisation supports players wishing to move into coaching or management, has also grown frustrated at what he sees as a lack of transparency in clubs' recruitment processes. He said: 'Of course it (Rooney Rule) is the way forward and at the moment that is all we are asking. 'But if they want to talk about quotas that is fine, if they want to talk about lists of players who are readily available we can. 'We want the recruitment process to be more professional, more transparent and more inclusive, and to be a fair reflection of the number of players coming through on the field of play. 'If our members are going to go through the qualification process, at great cost to them and us, then we want a transparent policy. 'The current ad-hoc policy is so 'rotating door' and is costing the game millions.' The League announced it was setting up the review following a recommendation by chairman Greg Clarke. Its terms of reference will be set at its next meeting on November 6 with a report and recommendations due by the end of the season. Football League chairman Greg Clarke is also keen on addressing the lack of non-white managers . It intends to consult widely with member clubs, other leagues, the Football Association, League Managers Association, Football Supporters Federation and Kick It Out, as well as the PFA, among the bodies to be asked for input. Clarke said: 'The current under-representation of BAME managers and coaches in the professional game is an important matter. 'We have consistently recognised the imbalance in representation at first-team manager level but have yet to see a comprehensive solution being proposed. 'It is a complex issue that needs a careful and thoughtful appraisal of the current situation in English professional football. 'This will include collecting and analysing data on BAME representation at all levels of the coach development pipeline, from opportunities for individuals to acquire their coaching qualifications through to appointments at first-team level. 'The Rooney Rule has been suggested by some as a potential way forward, however until we have consulted fully with all parties we will remain open-minded about any potential solutions. 'The real challenge is to increase BAME representation at all levels of the coaching pipeline and to ensure that there is fair access to employment opportunities for everyone. 'To this end, the Football League is already actively participating in the FA chairman's England commission which is urgently seeking to address existing issues relating to coaching development, including BAME participation.'","Chris Powell and Keith Curle are the only non-white managers .

"Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has said he would welcome the chance to speak to ex-manager David Moyes. Ferdinand has been critical of of the Scot's methods at Old Trafford in his imminent autobiography but rejects the idea that Sir Alex Ferguson should be blamed for United's downfall. The 35-year-old, who is now at QPR, said Moyes' approach last season unintentionally created a 'negative vibe' and some of United's play  was 'embarrassing'. Rio Ferdinand has said he would welcome the chance to speak to ex-manager David Moyes . Moyes was relieved of his duties by Manchester United at the end of last season . Ferdinand ended his 13-year association with United in May after being allowed to leave the club . Moyes succeeded Ferguson in the Red Devils' hotseat in the summer of 2013 but lasted just eight months. Ferdinand has not spoken to Moyes since but asked if he would like to, the former England centre-back told CNN World Sport: 'Yes, of course. I've got nothing against him as a person. 'As I said, I'm saying that he's a gentleman, a great man. As I said, I've never had any bad words to say about him at all in that respect as a person.' United won the Barclays Premier League in Ferguson's final season in charge but then slumped to seventh last term and failed to qualify for the Champions League. New manager Louis van Gaal has since overseen a £150million facelift in the hope of pushing United back up the league. Ferdinand jumped to the defence of former manager Sir Alex Ferguson (left, talking to Rory McIlroy) But even though such a spending spree has been deemed necessary, Ferdinand resents suggestions that Ferguson allowed the squad to grow stale. He said: 'I don't understand how people can say (that). You've got some great players throughout the squad. You win the league by 11 points. You've got to be a top team to do that. 'So he goes and then it all falls apart? So that's his fault? How can people say that? 'I don't think the buck stops with Sir Alex Ferguson at all. I think you leave and you win a trophy. There's not many better ways to go out than that.' Ferdinand left United when his contract expired and he was released at the end of last season. Asked if he was frustrated about how it ended, he said: 'Yes. But you can't keep looking back and thinking like that. 'I think, yes, I've had thoughts like that but at the same time it's been really nice to see a lot of the young lads getting their opportunities.'

"Webb Simpson is motivated by revenge as he seeks to justify the controversial Ryder Cup selection he admits he had to plead for. United States captain Tom Watson was criticised for overlooking form players such as Chris Kirk and Billy Horschel when he named Simpson as one of his three picks for Gleneagles. There was a feeling that Simpson was picked purely on the basis of his past performances, notably those at the 2012 Ryder Cup and his US Open victory earlier that year. And Simpson has now revealed that he personally spoke to Watson in the early hours of the day he announced his selections to state his case for inclusion. Webb Simpson was one of US captain Tom Watson's three wild card picks for Ryder Cup team inclusion . Chief among his arguments was his desire to help the team atone for the heartbreaking loss they suffered on the final day at Medinah two years ago. Simpson, 29, said: 'He called me at 4.30 in the morning Denver time, and he knew I wasn't sleeping because I had texted him. 'I basically expressed everything I could to let him know how bad I wanted to be on the team. 'I tried to acknowledge that it was a tough decision for him. Chris Kirk had just won, Billy Horschel has been playing good golf and Bill Haas had not missed a cut all year. 'I knew it was a tough decision, and in terms of percentages, I wouldn't have been surprised if he had picked the other guys. 'It was kind of one of those things where I knew on paper, he had a few really good choices. 'But I made my final plea, I told him, 'I want revenge on what happened in 2012 and I really, really want to be on that team'. 'He decided, whatever I said - maybe it was nothing I said - but he picked me. I think the emotions were relief and excitement.' Simpson has revealed he spoke to Watson in a 4.30am phone call, pleading his case for a berth in the team . Simpson, who formed a strong partnership with Bubba Watson at Medinah, knows the pressure is now on him to repay Watson's faith as the action gets under way in Scotland on Friday. He said: 'I definitely feel like I want to do my part. He believed in me but certainly he wants me to go out and do my own thing and play like I normally do, and give it my best shot. I've got to win him some points.' Simpson was stung by the final day of the last contest, as the Europeans fought back from 10-6 down to record a remarkable victory. Most of the Americans who were involved have this week played down the revenge aspect, but Simpson seems in tune with Watson's push for 'redemption'. Simpson was in the US team when they lost in a thriller to Europe in what's now called the Miracle at Medinah . Simpson said: 'I remember that feeling Sunday afternoon, it was more a shock than anything because we were all playing such good golf. We were so confident, as well as their team was playing, we just believed that it was going to be our week. 'Even when I finished Sunday it was looking pretty good for us. 'For me personally, I can't play this week without thinking about the way it felt to lose. 'Every time Medinah comes up I see them celebrating - and I just want that so badly for our team.' One man in Simpson's sights is Ian Poulter, who became the heartbeat of the European team with his stirring performance at Medinah. Simpson suffered foursomes and singles defeats at the hands of Poulter and again he would like revenge. Simpson leaves the stage after the official opening of the 2014 Ryder Cup with his wife Taylor . 'I lost two matches to Poulter at Medinah, so I would love to play him again, try to get those points back,' he said. Simpson's team-mate Patrick Reed, a rookie, would also like the chance to play againist Poulter having been captivated by his performances in the past. Reed, 24, played alongside the Londoner at the Travelers Championship in Connecticut in 2012 and found him engaging company. Reed said: 'We had such a great time. He made you laugh literally the entire 18 holes we played, it was always just one-liners and jabbing a little bit. 'He was a lot of fun, real down-to-earth and easy to play with. I felt like if I spent some more time with him, get a couple more laughs and play some good golf.'","Webb Simpson's inclusion in the US Ryder Cup team was much-debated .

"Phil Neville has backed David Beckham to take on a senior role at the Football Association or to move into politics. Former England captain Beckham intimated recently that he would be willing to get involved in the set-up of the national game in some capacity in the future. Beckham is already undertaking one major administrative task as he sets up a Major League Soccer franchise in Miami. Phil Neville claims that David Beckham could work for the FA in the future or even move into politics . Neville, who played alongside Beckham for Manchester United and England, believes his former team-mate could become a success in any field. Speaking at the Soccerex Global Convention in Manchester, Neville said: 'I think he could achieve anything he wants to achieve. 'You could see him going up to government level or to head the FA or to do something in America that is not just average - he doesn't do anything that is average. 'He wants to do something that is going to leave a legacy, a stamp. David Beckham has already worked for the FA in an ambassadorial role but could take more responsibility . 'I heard him talk this week about being involved in the FA. 'It would be silly of the FA not to take up that kind of offer, because what an unbelievable ambassador he is.' Beckham, 39, had an off-field role with England as 'player liaison' at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, which he could not feature in due to injury. Beckham earned 115 England caps during his illustrious career and played for United, Real Madrid, the Los Angeles Galaxy, AC Milan and Paris St Germain before retiring last year.

"Rickie Fowler's much-discussed Ryder Cup haircut has been copied by one of the American game's most senior officials. Fowler, one of the United States team's most in-form players, arrived in Scotland for this week's match at Gleneagles with 'USA' shaved into his hair. US captain Tom Watson described the cut as 'terrific' and suggested even Ted Bishop, the president of the PGA of America, would have it done if it meant his team would win. Ted Bishop sports his new haircut after following Rickie Fowler's lead . Rickie Fowler has caused a stir by getting 'USA' shaved into his head to show his patriotism . Ted Bishop followed suit after being challenged by US captain Tom Watson . Bishop has now taken up Watson on his challenge, with footage of the administrator being shorn posted on the United States team's Twitter feed. A tweet read: 'Tom said @tedbishop38pga should shave USA in his hair if it would help us win. Then there was really only one option.' Bishop then gave an update, tweeting a picture of himself and Fowler stood back-to-back and a message which read: 'It's done. The Fowler USA cut! I believe we will win.' Yet if 25-year-old Fowler, who had long hair in his younger days, intended for his dramatic new look to be intimidating, he may not be succeeding. Rickie Fowler is well known for his outlandish personality - the American always wears the orange of his alma mater Oklahoma State University on the final day of tournaments .

Westwood joked in his pre-event press conference. Asked if he would adopt something similar, the 41-year-old added: 'I know I've got a big head, but I don't know if it's big enough to fit 'Europe' on it. But Lee Westwood was not fazed by Rickie Fowler's daring trim . The Ryder Cup veteran is raring to go as he prepares for a ninth Ryder Cup cap . 'I find it quite amusing. It's the sort of thing that a 25-year-old lad that's right behind his team does, I suppose. 'That's the kind of character he is and fair play to him. Suits him, I think. Looks good.'","US star Rickie Fowler shaved 'USA' into his hair ahead of the Ryder Cup .

"Former Newcastle manager Graeme Souness is not surprised the pressure on current boss Alan Pardew is intensifying. Pardew's future has become the subject of heavy speculation after a dismal start to the season. Supporters vented their frustration as the Magpies, without a win in the Barclays Premier League, slumped to a 4-0 loss at Southampton on Saturday. Newcastle boss Alan Pardew has failed to stem his side's run of poor results in the Premier League . Newcastle are bottom of the league after picking up just two points from their opening four games . A small proportion of Newcastle fans vented their frustration at Alan Pardew during their side's last game . Could Alan Pardew be given the boot in the next couple of weeks? This advertisement at Southampton's St Mary's ironically read 'out today' Ex-Newcastle boss Graeme Souness and former midfielder Lee Bowyer have both backed Alan Pardew . Newcastle's form prolongs a poor run which saw the side lose 14 of their last 20 league matches last season. Souness, in charge at St James' Park from 2004-06, says Pardew will know he must deliver. The Scot said on Pardew: 'Results are everything in football. 'If you are not winning football matches then it used to be you got half a season, or usually a season, now you get six games. If you are in a job you know that is the case. 'Newcastle are a big football club, (with a) very passionate football crowd, and a very frustrated crowd at times. They are not slow to show their emotions. Newcastle fans shout abuse at manager Alan Pardew during their heavy defeat against the Saints . 'But that is the price on the ticket of being a manager at Newcastle. 'You know that if it does go wrong your head will be on the block, and be on the block pretty quickly. That is where he finds himself, unfortunately. 'It is part of the deal. You have to deal with it. You have to be thick-skinned, you have to have the support of the people around you and you hope the players are still with you. 'If that is in place and the board are sensible, then he might get through it.' Pardew, who took charge in 2010, signed an eight-year contract just two years ago. Despite that, Saturday's clash with Hull is being billed as vital for Pardew's future in some quarters. Former midfielder Lee Bowyer believes Pardew needs more time to integrate summer signings. Bowyer said: 'We are only three or four games in and there is a very, very long way to go. 'I thought he did well last year with the squad he had and I think he will do it again this season. 'Don't judge him yet. It takes about six games to start getting into it and he has had a few players come in, so it will take time to gel.'","Alan Pardew is under pressure after his side's poor start to the season .

"Manchester City striker Stevan Jovetic is hungry for more after his match-winning double strike against Liverpool. The Montenegro international is determined to make up for lost time and make his mark with the champions after an injury-ravaged first year at the club.

He underlined that return to form and fitness by scoring two goals in City's 3-1 win over  title rivals Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium on Monday. Jovetic said: 'I was happy with pre-season and against Newcastle I played well but didn't score. 'Now I have scored two but I am going to forget this because in five days we have another game against Stoke and it won't be easy. 'This was a victory for the group, the team, and three points is the most important.' Jovetic pounced on a defensive error by Liverpool debutant Alberto Moreno to fire City ahead after 41 minutes. Main man: Sergio Aguero came off the bench and scored within 23 seconds against the Reds . Rampant: City looked a class above on Monday and have goalscorers throughout the side . He doubled the lead by rounding off a fine move 10 minutes into the second half and Sergio Aguero came off the bench to add City's third after 69 minutes. Liverpool pulled one back with a late Pablo Zabaleta own goal but City had underlined their superiority by then and the potential significance of a win over last season's runners-up was not lost. Jovetic told City TV: 'It was a great game against a big team like Liverpool. 'I think we played very well and at the end this was a game of six points. 'I think Liverpool are going to be back for the title. It is important when you play against them to beat them.'

'We know we have four strikers in the team. We have a very strong squad.

"Four-time Olympic gold medallist Michael Johnson fears for the future of athletics. Johnson believes the sport is in a poor state of health and feels it has become over-dependent on its status within the Olympics for its well-being. The American, who famously won 200 and 400-metre titles at Atlanta in 1996 as well as two other golds, wants to see changes made to the structure and marketing of track and field. The 46-year-old, speaking at the Soccerex Global Convention in Manchester, said: 'There is certainly a real issue with athletics as a sport and there has been for some time now. Concerned: Athletics legend Michael Johnson is worried for the future of the sport . 'It is fortunate and unfortunate that athletics is still the premier sport of the Olympics, because I think that tends to allow the powers that be to sit back and be a little bit more relaxed than they probably should. 'I am not sure athletics would still be around if it didn’t have that status as a premier Olympic sport.” Johnson wants to see a balance struck between protecting the traditions of the sport and improving its promotion. The American’s comments echo similar remarks made recently by Great Britain’s Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford. Johnson said: 'There is certainly some tradition and historic value to athletics as a sport, but there has been a real reluctance to make any significant change from a marketing standpoint.

'Athletics we are not doing anything to draw in new fans because there hasn’t been any changes. I am not sure where it’s going and I am not sure quite what will happen.

"Captain Vincent Kompany insists Manchester City have not been derailed in their latest Champions League quest. The Barclays Premier League winners are facing a familiar battle to qualify for the knockout stages of Europe's elite competition after an unimpressive 1-1 draw with Roma on Tuesday. The result left Manuel Pellegrini's men with just one point from their opening two Group E games and already trailing leaders Bayern Munich by five points. Vincent Kompany remains confident Manchester City can still progress from their Champions League group . Francesco Totti scored Roma's equaliser at the Etihad on Tuesday to secure an away draw for the Italians . They must now make some headway in their next two fixtures, back-to-back away and home games against CSKA Moscow, to put pressure on the Germans and Italians. This is City's fourth season in a competition they are still to make a genuine impact in, but Kompany is confident in the team's quality. The Belgian defender said: 'It won't set us back. It won't affect us. We will deal with it. It gives you a feeling to get back out there and show everyone how good we are. 'I don't think it affects it (the group) too much. Roma have still got to play twice against Bayern Munich. 'We will go out there and play as we always do, to win. It doesn't change much for us. We will play every game from here to the end to win, thinking we can get three points out of it.' City failed to get out of their group in both 2011-12 and 2012-13, performances which contributed to the departure of former manager Roberto Mancini. Some progress was made last season as Pellegrini took City to the last-16 stage for the first time but they were unable to get past Barcelona. Kompany believes City will 'deal with' the draw and it 'will not affect' the players in the rest of the campaign . This season, with the Premier League title reclaimed, the expectations on City to perform in Europe, from inside and outside the club, were greater. Kompany accepts the team have not yet done themselves justice. The 28-year-old said: 'At the moment we all acknowledge that we could play better. 'But we are absolutely convinced that with Roma away, Bayern Munich at home, and the two Moscow games, if we play as well as we can, we should be looking for three points.' City were outplayed for large spells of their opening game at Bayern but were unfortunate to lose to a deflected 89th-minute goal from Jerome Boateng. But back at the Etihad Stadium, fortune perhaps helped them against Roma as the Serie A side dominated. Sergio Aguero did give City the lead with a fourth-minute penalty but a Roma side boasting former England defender Ashley Cole then pegged them back with slick, incisive attacking play. Sergio Aguero (right) had put City ahead from the penalty spot before Totti's equaliser on Tuesday night . Their 23rd-minute equaliser through Francesco Totti, after Maicon had earlier hit the bar, was not only brilliantly taken but thoroughly deserved. Roma had numerous other chances, notably through the impressive Miralem Pjanic, but could not force their way in front. City did finish well but David Silva was caught narrowly offside and Stevan Jovetic twice missed the target. Kompany said: 'We didn't play as well as we could, definitely. You just have to look at these games sometimes and say, 'It's a point'. 'But this is the Champions League, and if you don't perform, you shouldn't expect more from it. 'It wasn't our best performance apart from the spell towards the end. 'We couldn't even hold on to the lead - it was just not our best performance. But there is still a lot to play for. I think we can get a good share of those 12 remaining points.'

"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has hailed the improvement in striker Edin Dzeko during his time in charge. Bosnia-Herzegovina international Dzeko has enjoyed a new lease of life since Pellegrini arrived at the Etihad Stadium and was rewarded with a new four-year contract on Wednesday. Dzeko appeared to fall out of favour under previous manager Roberto Mancini but last season repaid Pellegrini's faith by scoring 26 goals. Improving all the time: Edin Dzeko has become a key part of the Manchester City team . Impressed: City's boss Manuel Pellegrini has praised Dzeko for the way he has developed his game . Nine of that tally came in City's last 12 games and proved vital to their  Premier League title success, but Pellegrini is just as impressed by his developing all-round game. The Chilean said: 'Edin has convinced himself that he can't wait as a striker just to score one goal. 'He has to play for 95 minutes every game, not always scoring but working for the team and making the movements. 'I think he is one of the players who has improved most in his attitude in the game.' Prolific: Dzeko scored 26 goals last season as City won the Premier League and Capital One cup . Dzeko, a £27million signing from Wolfsburg in 2011, underlined his value with a superb backheeled assist for David Silva's opener in Sunday's 2-0 win at Newcastle. News of Dzeko's new deal came after Vincent Kompany, David Silva, Sergio Aguero, Samir Nasri and Aleksandar Kolarov agreed fresh contracts earlier in the summer. Pellegrini said: 'I was very pleased because I think that Edin is a very important player for our squad. He is playing very well and so he deserved to renew his contract with the club.' Strength in depth: Pellegrini has also been pleased by Stevan Jovetic's performances up front for City . Another striker hoping to catch the eye this term is Stevan Jovetic, whose first season after a £22million move from Fiorentina was marred by injury and illness. The 24-year-old Montenegro international is now fully fit and, after shining in pre-season, started the season-opener at St James' Park. With last season's top scorer Aguero still not match-fit and Alvaro Negredo out injured, Jovetic is likely to continue for Monday's visit of Liverpool. Pellegrini said: 'I think Stevan is playing very well. He is in a very good moment with us and I hope he will continue in the same way because he is a very important and very good player for us. 'He is a very good finisher and we will see the real Stevan Jovetic this season.' More of the same please: Dzeko will hope to enjoy another productive campaign for City .","Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has been impressed by Edin Dzeko .

"Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson hopes the signing of Mario Balotelli quickly lifts the squad after their loss at Manchester City. New arrival Balotelli watched from the stands as the Reds were beaten 3-1 by his former club at the Etihad Stadium in the Premier League on Monday night. The controversial Italy striker had completed his £16million move to the Anfield club from AC Milan earlier in the day. New kid in town: Mario Balotelli watched Liverpool's defeat against Manchester City alongside Adam Lallana . Training day: Balotelli was put through his paces as he completed his £16million transfer from AC Milan . Boost: Midfielder Jordan Henderson believes Balotelli's arrival will be a major boost for Liverpool . The 24-year-old will now train with the Reds this week with a view to a potential debut against Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Sunday. Henderson said: 'I think everybody is looking forward to working with him. 'He is a very talented player and a very big player coming into the club. Hopefully he can give us a big lift and play some part in the next game. Outclassed: Balotelli saw his new team-mates comprehensively beaten 3-1 by Manchester City . Ominous: City were unstoppable on Monday, and Liverpool will need Balotelli to hit form straight away if the Reds are to challenge for the title . 'He was in the dressing room wishing everyone luck. It was good to see him. Hopefully he can get a good week's training under his belt and be ready for Sunday.' Balotelli has been brought in to replace the departed Luis Suarez, whose absence was felt as last season's runners-up were ultimately well beaten by the champions.

"Goalscorer Scott Arfield is convinced Burnley's performance in their season-opening loss to Chelsea bodes well for the campaign. The promoted Clarets are among the favourites for relegation from the Barclays Premier League but Arfield believes they gave a good account of themselves against one of the leading title contenders. Sean Dyche's men showed plenty of enthusiasm in the early stages at Turf Moor and took a 14th-minute lead through Arfield, only for the Blues to roar back and wrap up a 3-1 win before half-time. One up: Scott Arfield celebrates with his teammates after scoring Burnley's opening goal against Chelsea . The 25-year-old Scot said: 'To play against a top-quality team like that we knew it would be a tough game. 'It was there to see what top players they are and what a top team they are. 'We got an early goal but even after that we were under no illusions as to how tough it was going to be. 'There are definitely positives to take out of it. For us it is still a case of taking one game at a time and there is no disappointment, regardless of this result. 'We're on to the next game now. With the fans behind us anything can happen.' On target: Arfield hits a crisp strike from the edge of the box to give Burnley the lead . Arfield savoured his own moment of glory as his crisp strike from the edge of the box flew past Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Life has certainly changed quickly for the Scotland B international. Just over a year ago he was released by Huddersfield and when he joined Burnley they were expected to struggle in the Championship. Arfield said: 'I've waited a long time to play in the top division and I enjoyed it. 'On a personal level that was different class and my family were down here from Scotland to see it too. Down and out: Burnley players are dejected as they go on to lose 3-1 to Chelsea in their Premier League opener . 'They've stuck by me and they've waited a long time for that too, so it was a really special moment.' Dyche, the Clarets manager, said: 'It's a fantastic journey Scott's on. 'We plucked him from Huddersfield on a free transfer and he was arguably looking down the barrel of League One. 'We got him in for us and he was fantastic last season. He was excellent all night and that will build belief in players that they can handle this.'

"World Cup winner Andre Schurrle believes Chelsea may have found the extra ingredients needed to win titles in Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa. The new Blues duo, signed for a combined £60million this summer, made an immediate impact as the title favourites opened their Barclays Premier League campaign with 3-1 win at promoted Burnley. Former Atletico Madrid striker Costa lashed in a quickfire equaliser after Burnley had taken a shock lead while ex-Arsenal playmaker Fabregas was influential throughout and had a hand in two goals. VIDEO Scroll down to see Mourinho: Barcelona played Fabregas out of position . Firepower: Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa can fire Chelsea to titles, says Andre Schurrle . Finish: Costa struck on his debut for Chelsea to make it 1-1 against Burnley . Pass master: And Fabregas provided two superb assists for Chelsea's second and third goals . Asked if the pair could make the difference, Schurrle said: 'Yes, I hope so. It was very good. 'I think for Diego it was a perfect start. For a striker to come in and score his first goal is always important. 'He played fantastic in the friendly, and he scored. And now his first goal in competition. 'Cesc was fantastic for me as well - he always had control of the game. He was always running; two assists. 'So it was a fantastic night for them both - but it was only the first match and we have to keep going.' One of the Fabregas assists, to put Chelsea 2-1 ahead, was for Schurrle - and came out of the top drawer. After a mazy run by Eden Hazard and a link with Branislav Ivanovic, Fabregas volleyed a well-weighted first-time pass into the box for Schurrle to run on to. The German timed his run perfectly and tucked the ball home with the final touch of a move that contained 25 passes. Fabregas earned the praise of manager Jose Mourinho and after the Spaniard was linked with Manchester United and a return to Arsenal, the Blues are pleased to have him. Link-up: Fabregas and Schurrle combined superbly for Chelsea's second on the night . Pacey: The German was a threat down the right-hand side for the Blues all night . Schurrle said: 'I think a player like Cesc - every team wants him. 'So we are happy that he decided for Chelsea. We are happy that he is a Blue now. I am 100 per cent sure he will help us this season.' Schurrle himself is playing catch-up after his involvement in Germany's World Cup win meant a late start for pre-season training. The 23-year-old said: 'I've only been training for two weeks after my holidays - it was from zero to 100, directly into team training and everything. 'So there's a lot of work for me, but I'm feeling good. I'm enjoying my game, I'm enjoying being on the pitch. 'I think the whole team played well. We had a lot of control, passes, good combinations. It was a lot of fun on the pitch."" Schurrle is now in his second season at Stamford Bridge following an £18million move from Bayer Leverkusen. He has been linked with a move as Mourinho reshapes his squad but Schurrle has no intention of leaving and plans to use his World Cup experience to make a big impression. He said: 'I enjoyed the World Cup a lot, so I got out of that with a lot of confidence. 'I am hungry, I want to achieve something with Chelsea. I want to win titles with Chelsea. 'It was a good start for me but when I am 100 per cent fit, there will be more.' No 1: Thibaut Courtois was another to enjoy his Chelsea debut at Turf Moor on Monday night . Benched: Whilst previous regular Petr Cech cut something of a forlorn figure on the bench . All the goals at Turf Moor came in a 20-minute spell after Scott Arfield had rewarded the Clarets' early enthusiasm by rifling in a 14th-minute opener. Costa pounced to level three minutes later after an Ivanovic cross was deflected onto the post and Fabregas then set up Schurrle before crossing for Ivanovic from a corner. One of the main talking points was Mourinho's selection of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who has returned from a successful loan at Atletico Madrid, in place of long-time number one Petr Cech. Schurrle hopes it does not spell the end for Cech at the club. He said: 'I hope he stays of course. He is a great character and is very important for the team. 'He is a fantastic keeper, one of the best. It's his decision what he wants to do, but everyone wants him to stay and with him we have a better squad. 'We will need everyone because hopefully we will have 50-60 matches in all competitions.'

"Former England batsman Geoff Boycott believes the abandonment of Friday’s play in the fourth Investec Test against India at Emirates Old Trafford could damage the game. A sodden outfield prevented any play after a torrential downpour hit the Manchester ground early in the afternoon session. Groundstaff made considerable efforts to get the surface fit for play after the rain stopped - and the sun came out - but large puddles at the Brian Statham End proved impossible clear sufficiently. Waterlogged: The downpour in Manchester left the Old Trafford outfield looking like a reservoir . So whilst the vast majority of the playing area was ready, umpires Marais Erasmus and Rod Tucker felt they had little option but to abandon play on safety grounds following a 5.40pm inspection. Mike Watkinson, director of cricket at host club Lancashire, apologised to spectators said that recent construction work at that end had meant drainage was not as efficient as it should be. Boycott told BBC Test Match Special: 'How many cricketers would run down there? This sort of thing hurts cricket. 'The evening is set, we could easily play on. Did the groundstaff know about this? If so, they should have covered it or brought the boundary in. 'It wouldn’t have been pleasant fielding on it, but we have to get on with the game. There’s a bigger picture. People pay a fortune to watch. That’s bigger than a couple of cricketers slipping over.' The players left the field at 2.15pm amid drizzle but that quickly became heavy rain. It did not relent until what should have been the tea interval, which was still officially taken as scheduled at 3.40pm. Dark skies: The clouds stopped above Old Trafford and unleashed a rain storm down on to the outfield . Puddles formed across much of the uncovered ground but they drained well in all areas with the exception of those in front of the new media stand and hospitality area. Old Trafford has undergone a multi-million pound facelift in recent years in order to safeguard its future as a Test venue. Watkinson felt groundstaff acted with the best intentions - as supporters would expect to see work being done - but conceded attempting to alleviate the problem with motorised super-soppers was probably counter-productive. The former England all-rounder told BBC Radio Five Live: 'We apologise if people feel let down, but these are extreme circumstances. 'It was an extremely heavy downpour and most grounds would have struggled. 'It’s frustrating when you get circumstances like this that prevent maybe an hour’s play at the end of the day. 'We have an area that has some new grass, some turf that is not quite as established as the rest of the field. 'The drainage is fine, but it was used for some construction work during the off-season. The pitch drains to this side, there is a natural fall. This is where the water congregates. 'If we have got anything wrong, it’s hitting it with the waterhog and disturbing the surface. Ideally, it would drain through naturally. Delay: Joe Root (right) and Jos Buttler (left) leave the field after rain stopped play not long after lunch on Friday . 'Maybe trying to look right instead of letting the ground perform as it is designed has made it worse than it is.' The problem comes just a week after Lancashire’s T20 Blast quarter-final against Glamorgan at the same venue had to be put back a day because of rain. Watkinson added on Sky Sports: 'Last Friday evening the entire ground was under water. A lot of water held around this area, so no chance of play on Friday. 'There was a lot of rain again on Saturday morning and we made a start at 3.15pm in the afternoon. 'So it will take the water, it drains naturally, and tomorrow will be fine for a start.' Former England captain Nasser Hussain was unimpressed with the situation. Hussain said on Sky Sports: 'On a Test ground it should be possible to restart in a reasonable amount of time. It is a shame that one heavy shower has ended with the whole day called off.' England had been starting to regain firm control of the game when the players were taken off, having recovered from an indifferent morning to reach 237 for six, extending their lead to 85. Batsman Ian Bell, who had earlier been dismissed for 58, said: 'I think everyone is frustrated. 'It is disappointing, with the Test match balanced so nicely, not to be out there. 'The groundstaff have worked really hard to get us out there and it is a shame for everyone - players, supporters.' Tucker said the affected area was not safe for play. The Australian told Sky Sports: 'People want to see the cricket and we want to give them some. 'The area is still part of the playing area so it’s got to be fit, It’s a Test match, it’s not an under-12s match, so player safety is an issue.' On top: Joe Root is unbeaten on 48 for England as they lead India by 85 runs with four wickets in hand .","Former batsman said the abandonment was wrong at Old Trafford .

"The positive impact of Glasgow 2014 will be felt in the city for many years to come, according to the event's chief executive. David Grevemberg believes the XX Commonwealth Games have not only been a huge success in terms of sporting action, but their legacy will be a very powerful one. Grevemberg, an American who came to the Games organising committee via the International Paralympic Committee, has spent the past five years living in Scotland and witnessed the transformation of the city. Legacy: Commonwealth Games chief executive David Grevenmberg has praised the impact of the Games . Grevemberg said: 'The ambitions and aspirations of Glasgow 2014 were greater than the Games themselves. There is a big emphasis on legacy. 'Facilities have been built or refurbished as a result of Glasgow 2014, both sporting and communal. They're world class and community-relevant. 'It's not just been delivering 11 days of competition but working on issues like education, employability and skills development as part of this journey. 'Take the recognition and reputation of the city; the Games are changing its stereotype, redefining it. 'Come discover Glasgow - we're not a gateway to anywhere in Scotland, we are a hub of Scotland for business, entertainment, sport and creativity. 'It has given people the opportunity to discover this city and its people. The benefits of the Games will continue going forward. 'Someone said to me in passing the other day, 'I have lived here all my life, and I can firmly say Glasgow will never be the same, and in a good way. It feels like the city is going places'. Star man: Usain Bolt has been one of the main attractions for fans to the Games in Glasgow . 'I thought that was just a brilliant summing up. It will never be the same. This moment has been truly defining. It shows you the power of sport in so many ways. 'I'm delighted with the results. It is great when a plan comes together but I feel it has surpassed our expectations.' On the sporting front, the Games have attracted some critics for their perceived lack of high-quality fields. Big-name stars such as Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis-Hill and Yohan Blake have not been in attendance, while the most high-profile competitor, Usain Bolt, reportedly made derogatory comments this week. Grevemberg dismisses such negativity and prefers to focus on a Games he believes have been a celebration of sport. He said: 'In some cases here you are the victim of your own success. Brilliant: Claudia Fragapane has won four gold medals for England in gymnastics and has starred at the Games . 'We have never tried to be anything other than who we are. We are a Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. 'We have sparked conversation on where these Games fit - in terms of time, place and purpose - in the world of sport and society, and geo-politically, where the Commonwealth fits. 'We have had powerful feedback, supportive feedback from international federations. 'The IRB (International Rugby Board), for example, said in terms of rugby this was one the best sevens tournaments ever, broke records in terms of attendance, over 170,000 tickets sold, and was an enormously powerful competition. 'Athletics has been packed every single night with great athletes coming out here. 'Mo Farah wanted to be here but was not feeling well and had to make a decision. 'I think his heart was here but his body and mind said he needed to tread lightly. Smiles: David Rudisha was pipped to gold by Nijel Amos (centre) in one of the highlights of the Games . 'Usain Bolt is here, he is competing. He is enjoying his experience here and wants to be part of it. He said that in 2012 and it's nothing new. He and his team have been incredibly supportive. 'When you hear athletes talking about what these Games have meant to them, I would say the relevance of the Commonwealth Games is true to form. 'It really is a celebration of sport with a global community, with a real world-class power. This was the place to be this year.' Grevemberg moves to a new role with the Commonwealth Games Federation after Glasgow 2014 closes - a position he was always enthused about, but now has even more confidence in its relevance. He said: 'If you look back to Manchester 2002 as well as London 2012, you can see the tangible impact of both of those events in terms of legacy, infrastructure and social legacy. 'In terms of the regenerative power of major events, the UK has got it absolutely right. 'Glasgow 2014 took that to heart and wanted a bit of that gold dust as well. 'The city has been charged with that energy. It's been a wonderful symbiotic relationship that has also galvanised a bright future for the Commonwealth Games.' Home support: Scotland's David Millar came eighth in the cycling time trial and will take part in the road race .","Chief executive David Grevemberg believes 20th Games have been a success .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers remains keen to add to his squad before the summer transfer window closes at the end of the month.

"St Helens ran in eight tries to retain top spot in the First Utility Super League with a comfortable 46-22 win over struggling Bradford at Langtree Park. Saints scored 40 of their points inside the first 50 minutes as they swept the Bulls aside with tries from James Roby, Paul Wellens, Mose Masoe, seven-goal Mark Percival, Adam Swift, Lance Hohaia and Tommy Makinson. They then eased up and James Lowes' Bradford restored some pride with Luke Gale, Joe Arundel, Adrian Purtell and Jamie Foster touchdowns but Wellens had the final say in the last minute. Over the line: St Helens' Paul Wellens scores a try during the Super League victory over Bradford on Friday . Close quarters: St Helens' Mark Flanagan is tackled by Bradford Bulls' Adam Henry . The first half was scrappy but Saints were still far too strong for the Bulls who, 11 points adrift of safety with just seven games remaining, are all but condemned to the drop. Bradford felt they were harshly penalised by referee Robert Hicks - who had earlier halted play to change a faulty whistle - in the ninth minute but Saints took full advantage as Mark Flanagan sent Roby over. The Bulls did respond but Adrian Purtell failed to gather a high ball and a chance was missed. When the evergreen Wellens hit an Adam Swift pass at speed to burst through a gap and race through to score from 60 metres after 16 minutes, the game already seemed beyond Bradford. Masoe barged through several attempted tackles to add a third by the posts before Percival outsprinted the defence to score out wide after more good work by Wellens. Saints punished more sloppy work on the stroke of half-time after Matty Blyth lost possession, as quick hands from the Jon Wilkin, Wellens and Anthony Laffranchi set up Swift. Hands off: St Helens' Sia Soliola (left) is challenged by Henry as he tries to keep hold of the ball . Hug: St Helens' Mark Percival (right) is congratulated by Adam Swift after scoring a try . Percival's missed conversion from the touchline was his only wayward attempt of the match. Bradford could not stem the tide and within three minutes of the restart Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook charged through a hole and laid off for Hohaia to finish. The agony continued for the visitors as Saints swept the ball along the line for Makinson to dive over in familiar fashion on the right. With the game all but won, Saints eased off and were caught out by four quickfire Bradford tries.Gale pounced on a bouncing ball to touch down just before the hour and moments later the Bulls scrum-half launched a high kick which Swift was unable to reach. Arundel nipped in to score in the corner. Breaking free: St Helen's Jon Wilkin runs with the ball as Bradford's Adrian Purtell (right) gives chase . Party time: Wellens (left) celebrates scoring a try with Lance Hohaia as St Helens win 46-22 . Encouraged, the Bulls played a bit more expansively and pieced together a nice try for Purtell.Jamie Foster converted all three tries and with just over seven minutes remaining, found space to touch down himself on the left. It was too little too late for the visitors, but they had at least brought some respectability to the scoreline. The tries conceded may concern Saints coach Nathan Brown but Wellens, still performing brilliantly at the age of 34, wrapped up the tryscoring in the dying seconds with a poacher's finish.","St Helens comfortably won to stay top of the First Utility Super League .

"England earned a shot at gold as they reached the final of the Commonwealth Games team event with a hard-fought 3-0 win over India. Chris Adcock played a key part in the victory, featuring in two doubles successes, while Rajiv Ouseph claimed a singles win, but victory was far from straightforward. England faltered in all three rubbers but eventually pulled through to book a final clash with defending champions Malaysia at the Emirates Arena. Key player: Chris Adcock and his wife Gabrielle put in an important performance, as they often do for England, to help guide their country to a final against Malaysia . Adcock and wife Gabby laid the platform for victory as they overcame Akshay Dewalkar and Jwala Gutta 2-1. Yet after powering through the first game 21-16 and opening up a 15-8 lead in the second, the world's fifth-ranked pair were made to scrap by the newly formed Indian partnership. At one point the Indians won seven points in a row, enabling them to level the game at 16-16 and then take it 21-16. Gutta's unusual forehand serve proved particularly problematic and she later claimed the English pair 'hate playing me'. But it proved a mere scare and the Adcocks powered home 21-11 in the third. Ouseph, ranked 27, then overcame world number 22 Kashyap Parupalli 21-16 21-19 for a vital win, but he too had alarms, noticeably in losing eight out of 10 points in one run in the first game. He also surrendered a three-point lead in the second before edging back ahead. Adcock and Andy Ellis then completed the job with a 2-1 men's doubles win over Dewalkar and Pranaav Chopra, but only after coming from behind in another energy-sapping encounter. One rally in the second game contained 82 strokes as both sets of players pushed hard, but ultimately England prevailed 12-21 21-13 21-16. The final game was tense when locked at 14-14 but England edged ahead at the crucial moment and were mobbed by joyous, flag-draped team-mates as victory was clinched. Malaysia went through earlier in the day after a nail-biting 3-2 success over Singapore.

"Phil Neville and Nicky Butt will learn if they have futures at Manchester United in the coming days. The former long-serving players were both involved in the coaching set-up last season but are unsure if they will be asked to continue under new manager Louis van Gaal.

When speaking to Press Association Sport Neville said: 'I am still at United, and think my future will be resolved in the next five days. 'I am speaking to the chief executive very soon and then it will all be sorted. It might be the case that I might have to go and pursue other areas for next season. That is football.

'I thoroughly enjoyed my 12 months in coaching. It is something I really want to do and it will be something I do in the future.' Heads up: Butt rolls back the years by getting involved in the training session on Thursday . Phil Neville and Nicky Butt in action for Manchester United during their playing days . Butt, 39, worked as assistant to Warren Joyce with the under-21 side and managed the under-19s in the UEFA Youth League. The under-19 role will not be available next season as the Youth League mirrors the Champions League, which the United senior side have failed to qualify for. Butt said: 'It is a bit unstable at the minute because the manager has not been with us. 'He has had bigger things on his mind with Holland but hopefully over the next couple of weeks he will be in training and we will sit down and discuss what role, if any, I have got. 'If I have, then great. If not, I’ve had a fantastic time. I am back in training now but if there is not a job for me there is no point staying.' Pointing the finger: Neville in conversation with former Manchester United manager David Moyes and Wayne Rooney at a training session at Carrington last season . Reunited: Manchester United assistant manager Ryan Giggs with Gary Neville at a Salford FC training session on Thursday . 'They want me there, and I want to be there but it has got to be for a purpose. The only one that can make that decision is obviously the manager and the owners.' Despite that uncertainty, Butt feels United have much to look forward to under a manager who impressed in guiding Holland to the World Cup semi-finals. He said: 'It is an exciting time. I think everyone will be pleased when he finally arrives and takes his first training session and starts drilling our players like he did with the Dutch lads, because he got some great results out of them.' The pair, along with Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, invested in non-League Salford earlier this year.","Both Phil Neville and Nicky Butt were on Manchester United's coaching staff last season .

"Wales manager Chris Coleman knows his team cannot afford to become reliant on Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey. Coleman is without his two star players for this week's international friendly against Holland in Amsterdam. Bale withdrew with a leg injury after helping Real Madrid win the Champions League while Arsenal's FA Cup final match-winner Ramsey has been rested after an impressive but injury-hit campaign. Injured: Gareth Bale has withdrawn from the Wales squad for the friendly against Holland . Recovery: Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey has been rested after an injury-hit season for the Gunners . This week's game is also Holland's last friendly before they fly to Brazil for the World Cup and their manager Louis van Gaal has voiced frustration Wales are not at full strength. Coleman is also disappointed not to have the pair, but he feels the rest of the players could benefit from the experience ahead of Euro 2016 qualifying. Coleman said: 'They'd be a loss to any team in the world because they are top-quality players and you always want them in your team, but it is not to be. 'We have 10 qualifying games and we may not have them for one or two games and we have to adapt to that. 'We went to Belgium with 15 players missing and we got a super performance from the lads who were with us (drawing 1-1 last October). 'That is what we need whoever we have got. If we are missing Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey we just have to get on with it as we have a job to do. 'We are up against a world-class team and that is how it is.' Annoyed: Holland boss Louis van Gaal is irked by Wales' failure to produce a full-strength squad . Wales have a number of other senior players missing, most notably Ashley Williams and James Collins, and are travelling with an inexperienced squad. Defenders James Chester and Paul Dummett, of Hull and Newcastle respectively, could be handed first caps. Another potential debutant is 20-year-old Manchester United midfielder Tom Lawrence, who came to prominence last month when handed a surprise Premier League start against Hull by Old Trafford interim boss Ryan Giggs. Manchester City's highly-rated youngster Emyr Huws, who featured against Iceland in March, could get another chance. Cardiff defender Declan John, 18, Crystal Palace midfielder Jonathan Williams, 20, and Fulham midfielder George Williams, 18, could also be in the reckoning. The future: Chris Coleman has taken the opportunity to call up some youngsters into the Wales squad . Coleman said: 'They are all at different stages as some had their season finish three weeks ago and others earlier than that. 'But when we took this game we knew what we were doing and we knew it would be a tough game and we knew we'd have some players missing. 'We thought we would have a weakened squad but the lads who are here have been good. 'Our European campaign is two years and 10 games and every squad I've picked the one that turns up is always different. 'We need to give all of these guys experience of playing international football because you never know when you are going to have to call on them. 'No doubt in the next two years we will be calling on them so they need experience of playing at this level, playing a team like Holland, who are a top-level team. 'The only way they can get used to it is by experiencing it so we don't have any fear. 'We are full of respect of Holland but we have our own way of doing things and we will stick to that.' Coleman may be without Bale this week but he has been hugely impressed by the 24-year-old since his world record £85million move to Spain last summer. Bale scored a stunning goal to win the Copa del Rey for Real and then topped that with a decisive header in the Champions League final. Coleman said: 'To do what he has done in his first year - he had a huge input in them winning the Champions League and it doesn't get much better than that. 'They have won two cups and Madrid are that one team where the Champions League is the Holy Grail and they have achieved that. He has had a magnificent year.'

"Wales manager Chris Coleman believes the pressure will be on for Louis van Gaal to deliver at Manchester United next season. Coleman will pit his wits against the new United boss this week when his Wales side take on Holland in an international friendly in Amsterdam on Wednesday. United have turned to Van Gaal, who is stepping down as Holland coach after this summer's World Cup, to revive their fortunes after a disappointing season under David Moyes. Waiting game: Holland boss Louis van Gaal will take over at Manchester United after the World Cup . Coleman said: 'It will be interesting to see what happens if Manchester United go through next season not winning anything because there is that possibility. 'Regardless of how easy they look on the eye if they haven't won anything what are they going to do? 'They are used to winning things and bossing situations and last season they didn't do that. 'I thought it would be hard for Moysey in the first year or two and I was disappointed as a fellow manager that he only got 10 months. 'I want to see what happens next season because Louis van Gaal is a quality manager but what are we going to say next year if Manchester United have not won anything? 'Is Louis van Gaal going to be out the door because he is going to need time to bed in with his own ideas. 'You are not a magician when you are a manager. Sometimes you go in and have an immediate response and that is good but sometimes you don't and it takes time - if you get the time - to try to mould it and do it your own way. 'That was what David Moyes was trying to do and I was disappointed because he is a British manager and we want to see them do well like Brendan (Rodgers) at Liverpool. He had a season and then he got it right. 'Van Gaal with all his experience I am quite sure he can do well there but it will be interesting to see how it works.' Pressure: Wales boss Chris Coleman is convinced Van Gaal will have to deliver results instantly at United . Coleman has the highest respect for Van Gaal, 62, who has also managed - and won titles with - European giants Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Coleman is hoping his side can give the Dutch a good test in what will be a final run out for Van Gaal's men ahead of the World Cup. Holland are due to fly out to Brazil on Thursday. Coleman said: 'I've never done battle with him, so to speak, but I have been on a couple of seminars when he's been there and he is a good manager. 'He is very innovative. He is one of those managers where it is how it is, that is what he believes and you go along with the ride with him but if you don't agree then you are not on the same journey and I think you find yourself on a different journey pretty quickly. 'I have been doing this for 10 years and it is a hard industry and the ones who are the best managers, the most successful, I look at them and I have a lot of respect and admiration for them. 'He is up there because he has won all the big things and he has been at a lot of big clubs and now he is going to go to one of the biggest clubs and he is someone I respect a lot.' Axed: David Moyes was axed at United after less than a season in charge following poor results . Wales are without some of their main stars, most notably Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Ashley Williams and James Collins, but Coleman still feels the match is a useful exercise for this squad. The uncapped trio of defenders James Chester and Paul Dummett, of Hull and Newcastle respectively, and Manchester United midfielder Tom Lawrence could be among those to feature at the Amsterdam Arena. Wales' next match in September will be their opening Euro 2016 qualifier in Andorra. Coleman said: 'My point is we need to give all of these guys experience of playing international football because you never know when you are going to have to call on them.'

"Liverpool could build a case to sue Luis Suarez for breach of contract if he is banned for biting, according to a leading employment lawyer. The striker is at the centre of yet more controversy after appearing to sink his teeth into Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's World Cup clash against Italy in Brazil on Tuesday. World governing body FIFA is now investigating the matter and the 27-year-old could face a lengthy ban that could be extended to club football. Cover up? Luis Suarez holds his teeth in pain after allegedly biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini . Inhumane: Suarez appears to bite Giorgio Chiellini during the Group D showdown . Evidence: Chiellini shows the damage inflicted by Suarez that could result in Liverpool suing the striker . Nonplussed: Suarez (left) celebrates Uruguay's 1-0 win over Italy with his team-mate Walter Gargano . Dispute: Liverpool could sue their striker Suarez for breach of contract after his bite on Chiellini . Suarez has twice been banned for biting opponents in the past. Last year he was banned for 10 matches for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic while he incurred a seven-game suspension for a similar offence while at Ajax in 2010. Glenn Hayes, employment law partner at national law firm Irwin Mitchell, said: 'The general position is that Suarez's behaviour in the work environment would usually represent gross misconduct (given that it could be classified as an assault) and would usually result in the dismissal of an employee in most circumstances. 'If the matter has occurred outside of work and is not connected to it, for example in the form of a work social, the issue for the employer would usually be whether the actions of the employee had brought the business into disrepute. 'In the case of Suarez this could easily be argued - particularly as it is the second time an incident like this has happened whilst he has been with the club (and third time overall), and the Anfield club stood by the player last time despite risk to their reputation and despite his lengthy ban. Controversy: Suarez (top left) is captured biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in April 2013 . Hurt? Suarez holds his mouth after the incident with Chiellini and he could receive a lengthy ban . 'The decision for Liverpool however is not really about whether they do what a 'normal employer' may do. 'With Barcelona and Real Madrid apparently planning to make significant bids for the player after the World Cup, the decision is whether they are willing to dismiss a player and waive a potential huge transfer fee. 'Much will depend on what punishment FIFA hands down but if the ban is sufficiently long so that Suarez is unable to fulfil his contract, this so-called 'frustration of contract' could lead to claims by Liverpool for breach of contract on the part of Suarez.' The latest Suarez incident in the group match in Natal came amid growing speculation linking the PFA player of the year with a big-money move to Barcelona. Previous: Suarez received a seven game ban for biting PSV's Ottman Bakkal while playing for Ajax, 2010 . Bite: Suarez appears to sink his teeth into Italian defender Chiellini during the World Cup encounter . European champions Real Madrid have previously been linked with the player. It remains to be seen whether such apparent interest is now tempered. Liverpool have declined to comment on the matter. It is understood the club intend to let FIFA's process take its course before making their position clear. Yet with Suarez having also been involved in numerous other controversies since joining Liverpool in 2011 - most infamously a race row with Manchester United's Patrice Evra that led to an eight-match ban - there is the potential for embarrassment for the Reds. Hayes said: 'It will be interesting to see how the situation develops over the next few days and what stance Liverpool take in relation to their highest-profile and most-valued employee.'","Liverpool could build a case for breach of contract, says lawyer .

"Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho claimed the emotions almost rendered him speechless after helping his side secure the title. The Brazilian played a key role in City's second Barclays Premier League success in three seasons after joining the club from Shakhtar Donetsk for £30million last summer. A slight niggle meant the 29-year-old had to make do with substitute roles in the last four games but he was on the field as City beat West Ham 2-0 in their final match to clinch the title at the Etihad Stadium. Proud: Fernandinho described Man City's Premier League title win as amazing . Fernandinho said: 'Today was amazing, by the fans, the club, the team - everyone was concentrated to get the result. 'In that moment you don't know exactly what you say because the emotion is so high. 'To win the Premier League is amazing, and in the first season it is doubly amazing. 'I am so happy, I am so glad to help my team, and I am so proud to play for this team.' New boy: The midfielder joined from Shakhtar Donetsk last summer and has won two medals already . Fernandinho was City's top target last summer and although there was plenty of wrangling over the fee with his Ukrainian club, he feels his decision to move has been fully vindicated. Fernandinho has not only enjoyed double success with City, after the Capital One Cup win earlier in the season, but won a recall to the Brazil side in time for the World Cup. He said: 'I think I made the right decision to come to England and Man City. 'I always say in football and life you have to win the title, and Man City gave me the chance to win the title. I am so happy for that. 'The players deserved it. We worked very hard and today was the best way to win the title. 'In the game we played very good football and we deserved that.' Busy: Fernandinho will now travel with Man City to Abu Dhabi before turning his attention to the World Cup . Fernandinho will now be travelling with the rest of the squad for a short post-season trip to Abu Dhabi, but he intends to enjoy a break before turning attention to the World Cup in his homeland. He said: 'I need some days off to recover the mind and the body but I will be ready for the World Cup.' Meanwhile, defender Micah Richards has hinted that he could leave the club this summer. Richards, a regular in the title-winning side of two years ago, has been unable to reclaim a place since losing the right-back slot to Pablo Zabaleta in an injury-hit 2012-13 campaign. He does have one year remaining on his contract but, at 25, may now feel the time is right to move on. Richards tweeted: 'Thanks for everything city fans! I love u and always will u made me what I am today. 4 trophies from a struggling premier league side!'

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has promised the club will be ambitious if they decide to strengthen their squad this summer. The newly-crowned Barclays Premier League champions must limit their spending to a net £49million as punishment for breaching UEFA's financial fair play regulations. But City, who also won the Capital One Cup last season, have already insisted the European governing body's sanctions will not have any 'material impact' on their planned transfer activity ahead of next term. Confident: Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini does not believe UEFA's financial fair play regulations will affect his side's preparation or targets for next season . Target: City are keen on a summer move for Porto defender Eliaquim Mangala . So although any spending would have to total considerably less than last year's £90million outlay, Pellegrini is still hopeful of securing top targets. Asked if changes were likely, the Chilean told City TV: 'Maybe. We are going to see which is the best way to improve. 'I think one of the most important things for me is to have an ambitious mind. 'It is very important to win the title but these two titles will not be useful the next year. 'We must analyse all the good things we did, all the bad things, where we must improve, which is the best way to do it. We have a lot of work (to do).' Pellegrini's remarks come after chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak promised that any transfer activity this summer would be swift and decisive. One issue likely to be exercising the minds of officials at the Etihad Stadium is the extraordinary comments of key midfielder Yaya Toure and his agent this week. Toure has indicated that he is unhappy at the club because he feels under-appreciated and disrespected. One of his chief complaints appears to be that he felt senior figures at the club failed to acknowledge his birthday during last week's post-season trip to Abu Dhabi. Not impressed: Yaya Toure (right) is unhappy that the club failed to acknowledge his 31st birthday . Toure's stock is presently high after an outstanding 2013-14 season, in which he scored 24 goals in all competitions, including 20 in the league and a superb strike in the League Cup final. City have not commented on the situation but with the player having signed a new four-year contract just 13 months ago, their position is one of strength. It also comes just over a week after Toure addressed the crowd gathered for City's open-top bus parade of Manchester and spoke of his ambitions for the club next season. The Ivory Coast international, speaking on May 12, a day before his 31st birthday, said: 'We are looking for (more). We have the team and we have the manager. 'This (next) year is going to be tough, we know that, but with the team we have we can do it. We expect a lot, the fans expect a lot as well. We can do it again, we can win it.' Pellegrini has similar aims. The former Malaga boss enjoyed a superb first season in charge, winning two trophies and even sustaining a push for four into the second half of the campaign. Repeat performance: Pellegrini is aiming to retain the Premier League title after winning it in his debut season . Asked about his targets for next year, Pellegrini said: 'Exactly the same as this season. 'We are the team that played longer in all the competitions. For me the four competitions are important. 'We must play in the Champions League, and in the Premier League and in the cups with our squad, with rotation, because you cannot play with players every game and you cannot prioritise one competition.' Pellegrini now intends to enjoy a summer holiday but admits it will be hard to detach himself from his preparations for next season. The 60-year-old said: 'When you win the title it is very easy to enjoy the holiday, (but) also it is very difficult to disconnect absolutely, you cannot do it. ""I hope we can prepare (for) the next season with (director of football) Txiki Begiristain, with the owner and the president in the same way we did this year.'","Pellegrini is weighing up how to strengthen his squad for next season .

"Manchester City will offer Martin Demichelis a new deal to stay at the Etihad for another season.

The Argentine is out of contract next summer but looks set to agree a 12-month extension. Martin Demichelis (right, scoring against Arsenal) will be offered a contract extension at Manchester City . The Argentine centre back's current deal expires in the summer but he will be offered another season . Demichelis, 33, was restored to the City line-up in place of Eliaquim Mangala for Tuesday’s Champions League draw with Roma, but Manuel Pellegrini claims Mangala was not dropped for giving away two goals at Hull. ‘We bought Mangala for an important amount of money because we thought that we needed a centre back, but I’m very happy with the performance of Martin and Vincent Kompany also,’ he said. Meanwhile, City’s game at CSKA Moscow on October 21 will be held behind closed doors after UEFA reinforced a supporter ban on the Russians.

"Not happy: Louis van Gaal expects better from Holland when they reach Brazil . Holland boss Louis van Gaal is expecting better from his side as they head off to Brazil for the World Cup. The Dutch played out a lacklustre 2-0 win against an under-strength Wales side in Amsterdam in their final friendly before the tournament on Wednesday. The result rarely seemed in doubt, with goals in each half from Arjen Robben and Jeremain Lens securing the victory, but Wales had plenty of possession and frustrated their hosts for long spells. Holland's next match will be against champions Spain in their World Cup opener in Salvador a week on Friday and Van Gaal knows improvement is necessary. 'I hoped they would play better,' Van Gaal said. 'We played a lot of unnecessary balls, I believe, and there was too much possession of the opponent, Wales. 'We didn't get the pressure on the ball because they made the pitch very big and when they are in trouble, played a long ball. 'It is always very difficult to play against those teams.' Van Gaal again changed his formation for the game. The incoming Manchester United boss ditched the country's traditional 4-3-3 system for 5-3-2 for the recent friendlies against Ecuador and Ghana but played 4-4-2, incorporating a midfield diamond, against Wales. Van Gaal believes it is necessary to try out different approaches to ensure options are available to combat the varying tactics of their Group B rivals. Wales were chosen as opponents in the hope they could provide a test similar to the one the Dutch will face against Australia in their second group game on June 18. Holland also face Chile in the tournament. Van Gaal said: 'We scored two beautiful goals but it must be better. Double act: Jeremain Lens and Arjen Robben scored as Holland edged out Wales in a friendly . 'Previously I was able to play 4-3-3, and we might have played more attractive, but I wanted to see the benefits of the other system. 'Against Spain and Chile, I think I'm going to play 5-3-2. The 4-4-2 is less promising.' Holland left for Brazil with a slight fitness concern over leading striker Robin van Persie, who suffered a groin injury and was withdrawn as a precaution at half-time. Both player and manager stressed the problem was not serious but the 30-year-old was due to be assessed by the team doctor. Jonathan de Guzman was also due to travel with the squad despite a hamstring injury that looks likely to rule him out of the Spain game.

"Samir Nasri's girlfriend has apologised for offending anyone from France as the midfielder considers international retirement after being overlooked for the country's World Cup squad. Anara Atanes caused a twitter-storm last night after tweeting 'F*** France and F*** Deschamps! What a s*** manager'. But today she took to twitter to apologise for generalising about the nation. VIDEO: Scroll down for Up close and personal with Samir Nasri's girlfriend Anara Atanes . Defending midfielder: Atanes has hit out at the France manager Didier Deschamps after he dropped Nasri . Apology: The model said she hadn't intended to offend French people, only the football management . Retiring? Nasri is considering his international future after being left out of the squad . 'I apologize if i offended anyone from france, My tweets were not aimed at the nation as a whole,' tweeted the Brighton-born model. The Manchester City playmaker was surprisingly left out of coach Didier Deschamps' 23-man squad, and even the seven named replacements, when it was announced on Tuesday. Nasri enjoyed a superb finish to the season, including goals in the Capital One Cup final against Sunderland and the final-day win over West Ham which made sure of the Barclays Premier League title. And the 26-year-old, who was also left out of the 2010 World Cup by then-coach Raymond Domenech, told Sky Sports News: 'It's a little bit hard to accept. 'I need to take some time now to think about the national team because it's been twice now that they take away a World Cup from me. 'You can go around and ask any player if they're happy to be on the bench, nobody's going to say yes. Discontent: Brighton-born Atanes has used her Twitter account to criticise France and post pictures of herself . Decision: Deschamps says he left Nasri at home because he would not be content to sit on the bench . 'I need to think a little bit during the holiday, what will be my future in the national team, because missing two World Cups is really hard for a player.' While Nasri's absence was greeted with widespread surprise, the player himself said: 'I must confess, I knew before. 'Sometimes you have the feeling, when you call to speak to the manager and he doesn't want to speak to you, you know you're not going to go to the World Cup. 'It was a shock but I was prepared mentally. I'm okay. 'I respect his choice. He wanted to not pick me... good on him. I wish good luck to the French national team.' Former France captain Patrick Vieira has expressed his surprise at Nasri's exclusion. Vieira, a member of France's 1998 World Cup-winning squad when Deschamps was captain, has seen at first hand much of Nasri's fine campaign. The former Arsenal captain is now the coach of the elite development squad at City. Vieira tweeted: 'It is a surprise not to see @SamNasri19 on the way to Brazil. For me, the way he played his year would have put him on the plane.' Delight: Atanes and Nasri were celebrating just a few days ago when City clinched the title . Success: Nasri has been a crucial part of City's title winning team this season . Deschamps defended his decision to omit Nasri, suggesting the former Arsenal star was not an ideal squad player. Deschamps told reporters: 'Samir is an important player for Manchester City but he has not performed that well with France. 'He is a starter at City, which is not the case with France, and he has made it clear that he is not happy when he is a substitute - and I can tell you it can be felt in the squad.' City manager Manuel Pellegrini was asked about the matter at a press conference in Abu Dhabi ahead of his side's post-season friendly against Al Ain. Pellegrini said: 'I was talking with all of the players, with Samir of course, it's not good news for him.'He's a very good player and deserves to be in the national squad but all teams have managers and it's up to them to decide.' Nasri's exclusion might make it more likely that he plays against Al Ain in City's first match since securing the title on Sunday. Pellegrini had previously said that players involved in the World Cup would not feature. Back to basics: Nasri trained with his City team-mates on their post-season trip to Abu Dhabi . Popular: The Frenchman took part in a signing session for fans with team-mates Jovetic and Nastasic . Pleased to meet you: City's trip has been criticised by some with many of their players headed to Brazil . The trip has caused some consternation, with England manager Roy Hodgson expressing reservations about its timing so close to the beginning of his final preparations for Brazil. Asked about the issue again, Pellegrini said: 'All of the players who are going to the World Cup - we'll see if they play tomorrow. 'It is a risk. We are very happy to come here with the whole squad. 'Tomorrow I will ask all of them if they want to but it will be difficult for them to play.' Pellegrini will soon turn his attention to next season and one of his prime objectives will be to make further progress in the Champions League. City qualified for the last-16 stage for the first time this season after two previous failures to get out of their group. Pellegrini said: 'I think that during next week we are celebrating here in Abu Dhabi what we did last season. It was very important to win the league. 'Next week we will start working on how we can improve. 'It's important to improve every year on what we did in the last season. Safety first: Manuel Pellegrini said no players will be risked in the end of season match . 'We also want to have a better performance in the Champions League. 'To win the Champions League you have to fight with very important teams. 'This year we were very unlucky because we played with one player less against Barcelona (after Pablo Zabaleta was sent off). 'I don't know if we are going to win it next year but we will try to get at least one stage further. We must improve in all senses.'","Anara Atanes says tweets 'were not aimed at the nation as a whole'

"Burnley's strikers were going through a training drill in the sunshine at Gawthorpe on Thursday, swerving between metal dummies and hitting the back of the net from inside the penalty box with impressive regularity. Doing it for real this season has proved rather more difficult for the Barclays Premier League’s relegation favourites. They have now failed to score for 616 minutes. If Sean Dyche’s team draw another blank at Leicester City on Saturday, they will break two club records: their longest goal drought in all competitions of 651 minutes, and the longest in the league which stands at 596. Scott Arfield scores a stunner against Chelsea in Premier League opener . In their first game of the season in August, Burnley stunned title favourites Chelsea by taking the lead with a wonderful strike from Scott Arfield. Few were surprised that they failed to hold on to the lead that night, but not many expected the Clarets to draw a blank in their next five league games against Swansea, Manchester United, Crystal Palace (where Arfield had a late penalty saved), Sunderland and West Brom, not to mention a Capital One Cup tie at home to Sheffield Wednesday. The reality of life at this level has bitten hard. Injuries to Sam Vokes and Danny Ings, last season’s 47-goal strike partnership, have been a significant factor. Dyche compared that to Liverpool losing Luis Suarez to Barcelona and Daniel Sturridge to injury. But while Brendan Rodgers was given the £75million Liverpool banked from Suarez’s sale to strengthen his squad, Dyche spent just £1.5m on Lukas Jutkiewicz from Middlesbrough and another £600,000 on Bolton’s Marvin Sordell. Neither has scored yet. Burnley have not had another goal to celebrate since Arfield's strike . Lukas Jutkiewicz has failed to find net since joining from Middlesbrough . ‘Look at Liverpool with Suarez and Sturridge,’ said Dyche. ‘They’ve obviously found it tough to lose those players. We had Vokes and Ings who were flying last season. ‘But the challenge is for the next people to come in and deliver performances. ‘Brendan’s team will come good, no doubt, but they’ve spent £100m. We aren’t that type of club. We know the challenge and it’s going to be tough. ‘People were asking last week if we were too defensive. Fact: we’re three points behind Everton who bought a £28m striker (Romelu Lukaku). We haven’t been able to do that. It’s working with what we’ve got and making the best of it. ‘It’s a massive learning curve getting used to this level. It’s not just the attacking in the Premier League, the defending goes up as well. We’ve had goalkeepers who have pulled off very high-quality saves, which is another change from the Championship and the divisions below.’ Sam Vokes (centre) and Danny Ings scored 47 goals between them last season . Sean Dyche compares being without Vokes and Ings to Liverpool losing Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge . Dyche remains positive and demands the same attitude from his players. But how does he keep their spirits up when the ball just won’t go in? ‘You look to reinforce their belief systems,’ he added. ‘They’re only human. Not everyone is super- confident and some players sit on that knife-edge. ‘We reinforce the positive side of the game and the simplicity of it. Of course you hope for a goal because sometimes it alters mindsets and re-ignites confidence in people. ‘You’re waiting for the individuals to catch fire within that system and score. There are goals in people, it’s just delivering it. I believe in the players we have at the club, otherwise I wouldn’t have them here. ‘We haven’t gone obsessively into attacking but we’ve obviously tried to tweak things. We have to turn the screw and make sure those chances become goals. Can we make different types of chances than your stereotypical ones like a cross and a header? What kind of crosses, what kind of finishes, what kind of movement in the box? ‘We’re getting into the right area but the hardest thing for coaches and managers to provide is that final touch into the net.’","Burnley's only goal this season came in the opening Premier League game against Chelsea .

"Rio Ferdinand admits that he has had to completely change his mindset from enjoying a trophy-laden career at Manchester United to facing a relegation fight with QPR. The former England defender won the Champions League and six Premier League titles before leaving Old Trafford after 12 years this summer. Ferdinand has already suffered a 4-0 defeat on his return to United as QPR have dropped into the relegation zone after six games, and the 35-year-old believes that simply staying in the top-flight would rank alongside his greatest achievements. Rio Ferdinand admits that he has had to completely change his mindset . ‘Going into QPR I knew it was going to be a huge adjustment in terms of mindset and expectations,’ he said. ‘We’re not going for the Champions League places or winning the league. Staying in the Premier League is our main aim. That will be a huge achievement for me at this stage of my career. ‘It’s different. It’s not what I’m used to but I knew going in the door what the aims were going to be so I didn’t set my stall out any higher or lower than that.’ Reflecting on the highs and lows of his time at United, Ferdinand spoke about the shock of Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement and the unforgettable experience of winning the Champions League against Chelsea in 2008. Ferdinand says staying in the Premier League is the main aim for QPR . ‘It was a shock,’ he said. ‘We walked in the morning and we were all in debating it. Then a meeting got called at 9am and the manager told us. ‘He was disappointed it got leaked before he could tell us and he was looking around and seeing the lads faces and everyone saying “no chance”. I looked at Robin van Persie, who just signed from Arsenal, just won his first league title and just seeing the disbelief and the disappointment. ‘We all respected his decision, he did so much for the club and for us as individuals as well.’ On United’s penalty shootout win over Chelsea in Moscow, Ferdinand added: ‘It’s something you think is too far away to touch. You think I’ll never get there. ‘I’d lost in a semi final for Leeds, lost in quarter-finals. I just thought I’d never get close enough. Then that day was a ridiculous feeling. If you could bottle the emotions on that night you’d make a lot of money. Rio Ferdinand celebrates Manchester United winning the Champions League in 2008 . ‘I was gone (in the shootout). Giggs scored as usual. If you see the pictures from behind, I’m telling Edwin (Van der Sar) to go whichever way it was. Luckily Edwin didn’t see me and dived the other way and saved it and the rest is history. ‘I could feel my legs as if to say, “whoa, I’m next up how am I going to even walk up and take a penalty?”. I don’t know if I could have hit the ball. I was so scared and nervous.’ Giggs was caretaker boss for Ferdinand’s last game for United at Southampton in May when he was informed by Old Trafford chief Ed Woodward in the dressing-room afterwards that he would not be getting a new contract. Asked if Giggs will make a top manager in the future, Ferdinand pointed to some of the problems encountered by another of his old teammates Roy Keane at Sunderland and Ipswich as proof that success on the pitch is not easy to reproduce from the dugout. Ferdinand spoke about the shock of Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement . ‘Nothing is a given in this game,’ he said. ‘Roy Keane was a great leader, a great captain and he’s assistant manager now at Aston Villa. He had a few sticky roles in management and he’ll be looking to come back and take over a club. ‘So it doesn’t always mean you’re guaranteed immediate success. Ryan Giggs is doing it a real good way in that he’s learning, he’s played under Sir Alex and David Moyes. And now, Louis van Gaal. He’s got a great track record and learning and honing his craft. I’m sure one day he’ll get the opportunity and then he’s got to execute.’ Asked how he would like to be remembered by his teammates, Ferdinand said: ‘As a footballer when you set out you want to be respected by your teammates. ‘You want them to say yes he was a good player, he was an integral part of the team. Obviously I like a laugh so they’d probably chuck that in as well.’ Watch the full exclusive interview in The Clare Balding Show, on BT Sport 2 this Friday 3 October at 10pm.

"Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba is set to make his debut for new club Besiktas in the unlikely surroundings of Macclesfield Town’s Moss Rose ground on Wednesday night. Ba, who completed his £8million signing in Istanbul last week, has returned immediately to England to join up with his team-mates on pre-season tour. The 29-year-old Senegal star is likely to play for Besiktas against German club Mainz as manager ex-West Ham and Everton player Slaven Bilic prepares for their Champions League third qualifying round tie against Feyenoord. Back in England: Demba Ba will make his Besiktas debut at Macclesfield's ground on Wednesday night . Macclesfield’s pitch has a good reputation which is why two European teams have chosen it as a venue but the Conference club’s stadium with its capacity of 6,355 will represent a change for Ba who effectively decided the Premier League title race last season. His goal for Chelsea against Liverpool at Anfield following a slip by Steve Gerrard allowed eventual champions Manchester City to have the destiny of the title race back in their own hands. Ba will be the latest example of famous football players and managers having low-key debuts. Hitman: Ba scored 87 goals in three years at West Ham, Newcastle United and Chelsea . The first £1million footballer Trevor Francis was ordered by his Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough to make his debut for the ‘A’ team against Notts County in the Midland Intermediate League.

"Manuel Pellegrini admitted that Manchester City were simply not good enough as their Champions League hopes suffered another blow on Tuesday night. City were held 1-1 by Roma after veteran Francesco Totti cancelled out Sergio Aguero’s early penalty to become the oldest scorer in the competition at the age of 38. It leaves the Premier League champions adrift of the Italians and five points behind Group E leaders Bayern Munich, who won 1-0 at CSKA Moscow, and facing an uphill battle to qualify for the knockout stage. Next up are successive games against CSKA. Manchester City captain  Vincent Kompany and Yaya Toure show their disappointment after the Roma match . City manager Manuel Pellegrini isn't panicking but demands results in their next fixture in Russia . Sergio Aguero shows his frustration during City's draw with Roma in their Group E clash . 'We have just one point from six but also we are just three points behind Roma, so there is a lot of things (to play for),' said Pellegrini. 'We hope next game in Russia we can win and we will see what happens against Bayern Munich. ‘We didn’t play well, especially in the first half. We improved but I think the draw was the real (right) thing for both teams. Playing at home it is never good just to draw, but we played against a very strong team in a good moment. ‘In the last 20 minutes we played more like the team you usually see here. Today was not our day. ‘Maybe we were not accurate in our passing and when we lost too many balls we did not have enough midfielders to recover. I think the most problem was we lost many easy passes.’ A subdued atmosphere inside the Etihad, with lots of empty seats, did not help. Former Chelsea players Frank Lampard (top) and Ashley Cole (bottom) face each other for City and Roma . City striker Sergio Aguero buries an early penalty in the bottom corner to take the lead at the Etihad . Asked how difficult it would be to qualify for the knockout phase now, Pellegrini said: 'We don't know. It depends on the way we play the next game. 'We have 12 more points to fight (for) and we will fight to the end to try and qualify.' Although City finished the stronger of the two side, they were fortunate not to concede again. Pellegrini played down suggestions he might have been taken aback by Roma's bold approach. 'It was not a surprise for me,' said the Chilean. 'They are a team in form with great players. They made it difficult for us, it was a difficult game but I thought we could win it in the last 20 minutes.' City payers celebrate Aguero's finish as they get off to the perfect start in the Group E clash . Roma's Francesco Totti becomes the oldest Champions League goal scorer with the equaliser for 1-1 . Pellegrini refused to single out any players for blame for the equaliser, which Totti finished with a superb flick over Joe Hart after being afforded plenty of space. Pellegrini said: 'I think that when the other team scores a goal it is not just a problem of one or two players. I think that he had too much space in that play. 'Maybe it was an easy goal for them but you must have the quality and the capacity to return to your normal performance.'

"Manchester City's investment in their squad reached an incredible £175million in the space of four days when striker Sergio Aguero signed a new five-year contract with the Premier League champions on Thursday night. Aguero’s £150,000-a-week deal was confirmed in the wake of David Silva and Vincent Kompany also committing their futures to the club until 2019. City kicked off the week by paying FC Porto £32million to make Eliaquim Mangala the most expensive defender in the history of British football. Despite signing Mangala on a five-year deal worth £100,000-a-week, City are still within the transfer limit of £49m net placed on them this summer by UEFA for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations. Scroll down for videos... Blue moon rising: Sergio Aguero has become the latest player to commit his future to Manchester City . Agueroooooo! City striker has gone down in folklore for his last gasp winner that won the 2012 title . But the hat-trick of new deals for Aguero, Silva and Kompany represents a stunning statement of intent. Kompany is understood to be earning a basic £120,000 and Silva £140,000. Including bonuses, City’s financial commitment to the four players could top £200m over the course of the next five years and they still plan to offer new deals to Joe Hart, Edin Dzeko and James Milner. Aguero, 26, insisted last night that he will stay at the Etihad until the end of his new contract, and the Argentina striker hopes that it will end talk of him joining Real Madrid or Barcelona. ‘The reality seems to be that ever since I came here, during every close season, there has always been rumours suggesting that I might be returning to Spain,’ said Aguero. Hey big spenders! City's £175m investment has included the signing of Eliaquim Mangala from Porto . ‘There has always been this speculation and I certainly never pay much attention to it. But people hear this stuff flying around and they take it seriously. ‘I can tell the fans and everyone at City to relax, I’m going to be here until I see out my contract. ‘I’ve been here for three years now and fortunately things have gone fairly well so far. We’ve just got carry on in the same way, winning titles. ‘I think the club is investing well in order to be up there with the best in the world. Aguero finished last season as City’s top scorer with 28 goals despite missing much of the second half of the campaign with a succession of groin, hamstring and calf injuries. Pocket rocket: David Silva has penned a new contract to earn around £140,000 a week at the Etihad . VIDEO Silva signs new five-year City deal . He is expected to be out of first-team action for another three weeks after representing Argentina in the World Cup Finals and revealed that he now comes into training 90 minutes earlier to make sure there are no more injury setbacks. ‘That’s been happening since I got back here,’ he added. ‘I have to get in an hour-and-a-half early and start off with strength exercises. Then I work on stability in my hips and sides, and then the rest is more straightforward just to strengthen the pelvic area in order to prevent any further injuries of the sort that I’d been having. ‘So I’ll do about an hour before training, then it will be out there as normal with the rest of the group. I’ll follow that programme throughout the whole season.’ Captain fantastic: Vincent Kompany has also signed a new deal as City chase successive league titles . Aguero famously scored a last-gasp winner on the final day of the season in 2012 to snatch the title from Manchester United, and he believes that City’s neighbours will be the main threat to their crown again. ‘I think who is most worthy of having the best chance to threaten is Manchester United,’ he said. ‘They are not involved in any other competitions other than the English knockout cups and the Premier League. ‘That means they’ll get more rest between games than ourselves and some of the other teams and that will work in their favour, like it did last season with Liverpool.’ Will Aguero lead the line in your Fantasy Football team?

"Click here for your ultimate stats guide to the game, including all the heat maps ... Take two teams without a Premier League win to their name this season – in Burnley’s case one without a goal in almost eight hours of football now – and the outcome at Turf Moor was rather predictable. Sean Dyche’s side have played 470 minutes since Scott Arfield stunned Chelsea in the opening game of the season here with a strike that ultimately counted for nothing. The elation of that moment has long since faded with Burnley picking up three points from their opening five games. It's been nearly eight hours of football  for Burnley since the Clarets have scored in the Premier League, as Marvin Sordell challenges Sunderland keeper Vito Mannone .

Subs not used: Pantilimon, Jones, Bridcutt, Graham. Bookings: Rodwell, O'Shea. Referee: Anthony Taylor . Sunderland have fared little better, although they had at least scored five coming into this encounter. Both teams did their best to improve on those records and there was plenty of effort yesterday but also a distinct lack of craft. Both came agonisingly close to that first win in the closing minutes when Burnley substitute Ashley Barnes saw his effort deflected against the bar and Sunderland’s Patrick van Aanholt had a 30-yard shot turned against the post by Tom Heaton. But neither manager was particularly overjoyed with another draw, even though Dyche remains positive that Burnley will find their way in the top-flight. Their next two games are against West Bromwich Albion and Leicester City, and that first win cannot come soon enough. ‘League tables are for other people to talk about but if we keep playing like that I’m convinced there are wins around the corner,’ said Dyche. ‘I’m not naïve. I know you have to score goal to win games, but you also got to believe in performance levels and ours are very good. Over time, if you keep putting up those kind of performances it’s my belief that you will win games. ‘Overall we probably edged it. We had one hit the bar and a couple of big penalty shouts, one in the second half against Duke (Lukas Jutkiewicz). Anywhere else on the pitch that’s a foul so it’s got to be given. But it’s tough on for referees, the hardest part of the job is defining those moments.’ A Sunderland fan takes time out to poke fun at the turmoil surrounding Newcastle manager Alan Pardew and the 'Sack Pardew' campaign with his own banner .

Dyche was referring to a collision between Jutkiewicz and Emanuele Giaccherini which was ignored by referee Anthony Taylor. The Italian actually threw himself to the floor far more dramatically, perhaps forgetting that he was in his own penalty box. Leading the line in the absence of the injured Sam Vokes and Danny Ings, two strikers who contributed 46 goals to Burnley’s promotion campaign last season, Jutkiewicz was a handful throughout. Wes Brown and John O’Shea had their arms all over him at times, but even that was not enough when he broke away from O’Shea in the second half to force a fine diving save from Mannone. ‘I thought he was top drawer, a real handful,’ added Dyche. ‘If I was a centre-half I wouldn’t have enjoyed playing against him today, that’s for sure.’ Marvin Sordell, making his first league start for Burnley alongside Jutkiewicz, wasted a great chance as early as the fourth minute when he failed to connect with George Boyd’s pullback, and David Jones drilled another low effort straight at Mannone from 15 yards. Giaccherini was Sunderland’s most lively player but having failed to trouble Heaton with a 25-yard effort in the first half, his low cross in the second looked destined to present Connor Wickham with a simple tap-in at the far post before Jason Shackell intervened with a marvellous back-heeled clearance. The match came alive in the dying stages when Lee Cattermole tried to block a shot from Barnes on the edge of the area in the 86th minute and the ball looped over Mannone but came back off the bar.

Then Sunderland were inches away from claiming that elusive victory as they also hit the woodwork in added time.

Heaton’s view was impeded as it flew through a crowded box but he touched the ball against the post and was then relieved to see it deflect against his body and away to safety. Events at Newcastle will no doubt ease the pain for Sunderland, but Gus Poyet wore the look of a manager who is growing increasingly frustrated with their indifferent start. ‘We played okay, but okay is not enough in the Premier League,’ said Poyet. ‘We played the way I want for three or four minutes every now and then but not consistently enough. ‘It was a great opportunity to take the three points.

"Eliaquim Mangala has become the most expensive Premier League defender ever at £32million and Manchester City won out in a three-way battle with United and Chelsea. But despite this accolade the 23-year-old still has much to prove at the highest level. Here, Sportsmail gives you some background on the France centre half... City tried to sign Mangala and Porto pal Fernando in January but it’s taken until the summer to seal deals. Why the delay? Everything seemed ready to go last month, but negotiations stalled because a private company owned 33 per cent of his economic rights. Porto only received £23m of the £31.9m fee with the rest said to have been paid to Doyen Sports Investments. Record breaker: Eliaquim Mangala has finally signed for Manchester City for £32m .

Joleon Lescott - £22m . Everton to Man City, Aug 2009 . David Luiz - £21m . Benfica to Chelsea, Jan 2011 . But isn’t he French? He was born in Paris but moved to Belgium at five, where he started as a striker. Standard Liege converted him to a defender and sold him to Porto for £6m. He is one of four Frenchmen at City, along with Bacary Sagna, Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy. Despite his fee he couldn’t get a game for France at the World Cup and was their fourth-choice centre back. Didn’t United want him? And Chelsea. Asked about his preference in May, he said: ‘City or Chelsea? Chelsea because it’s London.’ How will he fit into City's backline? Mangala has the tools — power, pace and composure — to be the ideal partner for Vincent Kompany. And doesn't he still retain some of that striker's instinct? He does - last season he scored three times in European competition (in the Champions League and Europa League). No defender netted more. Didn’t UEFA cap City’s net spend this summer at £49m? Yes, and they’ve spent £49.9m on Mangala, Fernando, Willy Caballero and Bruno Zuculini. Sagna was free and Frank Lampard is on loan. They got £10m from Sunderland for Jack Rodwell and £12m will follow when Javi Garcia joins Zenit St Petersburg.

"Brendan Rodgers has defended Steven Gerrard’s form and fitness, insisting the veteran Liverpool captain does not need to be rested more often. Gerrard, 34, has played every minute so far this season, including three games in a week that saw Liverpool lose to Aston Villa and West Ham in the Premier League while stumbling to a Champions League win over the Bulgarian outsiders from Ludogorets when he scored a last-minute penalty. Rodgers and his coaching staff are understood to be concerned that in both league games Gabriel Agbonlahor and Stewart Downing were successfully deployed to stifle Gerrard and stop him distributing the ball from deep. Steven Gerrard looked out of sorts in Liverpool's disappointing 3-1 loss against West Ham on Saturday . Reds manager Brendan Rodgers hands out instructions to his skipper from the sidelines at Upton Park . Liverpool host Middlesbrough on Tuesday in the Capital One cup, with Grant Leadbitter (left) in great form for the North East club . Spanish striker Kike has been in excellent form for Boro and has five goals from seven starts this season . As a result, the former England skipper misplaced 11 passes in the West Ham half on Saturday and gave away possession 14 times. Steven Gerrard was poor against West Ham, as his stats from the game show. Is age finally catching up with Liverpool’s 34-year-old captain? 14 Gerrard lost the ball 14 times. Only Raheem Sterling (20) lost it more for Liverpool. 11 He misplaced 11 passes in the opposition half, more than any Liverpool player. 25% Gerrard won just 25 per cent of his duels, the worst percentage of any Liverpool player. Only six players in last year’s top six squads are older than Gerrard, and most now play bit-part roles. Rodgers has an ideal opportunity to rest Gerrard when Liverpool entertain Middlesbrough in the Capital One cup on Tuesday, although his options have been limited by fresh injuries to Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho. Asked about his captain’s form on Monday, he said: ‘There are no concerns. He is a brilliant player for us. It was a team performance that was not up to scratch. We have managed his recovery really well in the last two seasons even when Steven was playing international football. If you look at his numbers and games it has been as good as ever. ‘He is at the age where we need to treat him individually. We want him to be involved in the big games because of his experience and we will always taper that recovery to allow him to be the best he can be. ‘We will let you know  if he will be rested. Some young players will be involved in the squad.’ Rodgers admitted  his side have started poorly and new signings like Adam Lallana need time to settle . Liverpool’s run of three defeats from five Premier League games is their second worst start to a top-flight season in 77 years. And Rodgers, who made nine signings this summer, accepts that some of them are struggling to come to terms with playing for a club like Liverpool. ‘What people probably don’t get is the pressure of playing for such a big club,’ he added. ‘The weight of the jersey here is heavy for most players. Once you adapt to playing for Liverpool you become clearer in your thinking. It’s a young group and that adjustment takes a bit of time. When you have that transition there are little bumps along the way. ‘It’s not a great start by any means but that will improve and my team will get better in the second half of the season. ‘When I first came in here we had a lot of new players coming in and at that time there was a new manager as well. We got to where we wanted to be. ‘Of course it’s not all smiles, it’s not a feeling we’ve been used to. But you have to refocus and move on. You have to be able to recover quickly at this level. It’s my job to ensure confidence is retained. ‘We want to win a trophy this season, that is still a key objective for us and this competition gives us an opportunity.’ The Anfield boss leant his support to Mario Balotelli, who was subjected to racist abuse on Sunday . With Merseyside Police continuing to investigate allegations of racist abuse aimed at Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli after he posted a tweet mocking Manchester United’s 5-3 defeat to Leicester City on Sunday, no questions about the issue were permitted at Monday’s conference. But Rodgers took the opportunity to back the Italian amid the first controversy of his Anfield career. ‘Every player is different,’ he said. ‘I’ve really enjoyed working with him so far. He’s a good guy, he wants to do well for the club and he’s shown he cares enough about the club to devote that time to him. For me, he’s not complicated. He’s a football player who wants to do well in his life and career. If he continues to give everything and work tirelessly for the cause there will always be an opportunity here for him.’ Former defender Daniel Agger  criticised Rodgers but the Liverpool boss has refused to respond . Meanwhile, Rodgers refused to rise to criticism from former Liverpool defender Daniel Agger who claimed on Monday that he felt unappreciated at Anfield before joining Brondby in the summer. Agger said: ‘Let me put it this way, the manager and me were perhaps not on the same page in all of last season. For most of last season at least. I felt that he didn’t appreciate the things I contributed. When I feel that, then it’s time to move on. Where me and him maybe went wrong was that I’m very direct. I say things as they are.’","Brendan Rodgers has defended Steven Gerrard’s form  this season .

"Having scored with their first shot on target against Chelsea, Burnley have not found the net in 526 minutes since. Take two teams without a Premier League win to their name this season – in Burnley’s case one without a goal in almost eight hours of football now – and the outcome at Turf Moor was rather predictable. Sean Dyche’s side have played 470 minutes since Scott Arfield stunned Chelsea in the opening game of the season here with a strike that ultimately counted for nothing. The elation of that moment has long since faded with Burnley picking up three points from their opening five games. Gus Poyet (R) and Burnley boss Sean Dyche are both still looking for a first league win this season . Sunderland have fared little better, although they had at least scored five coming into this encounter. Both teams did their best to improve on those records and there was plenty of effort yesterday but also a distinct lack of craft. Both came agonisingly close to that first win in the closing minutes when Burnley substitute Ashley Barnes saw his effort deflected against the bar and Sunderland’s Patrick van Aanholt had a 30-yard shot turned against the post by Tom Heaton. But neither manager was particularly overjoyed with another draw, even though Dyche remains positive that Burnley will find their way in the top-flight. Wes Brown (R) hinted that Sunderland could be struggling with the mental side of their game . Their next two games are against West Bromwich Albion and Leicester City, and that first win cannot come soon enough. ‘League tables are for other people to talk about but if we keep playing like that I’m convinced there are wins around the corner,’ said Dyche. ‘I’m not naïve. I know you have to score goal to win games, but you also got to believe in performance levels and ours are very good. Over time, if you keep putting up those kind of performances it’s my belief that you will win games. ‘Overall we probably edged it. We had one hit the bar and a couple of big penalty shouts, one in the second half against Duke (Lukas Jutkiewicz). Anywhere else on the pitch that’s a foul so it’s got to be given. But it’s tough on for referees, the hardest part of the job is defining those moments.’ Dyche claims Lukas Jutkiewicz (C) could have earned a penalty after a challenge from  Emanuele Giaccherini . Dyche was referring to a collision between Jutkiewicz and Emanuele Giaccherini which was ignored by referee Anthony Taylor. The Italian actually threw himself to the floor far more dramatically, perhaps forgetting that he was in his own penalty box. Leading the line in the absence of the injured Sam Vokes and Danny Ings, two strikers who contributed 46 goals to Burnley’s promotion campaign last season, Jutkiewicz was a handful throughout. Wes Brown and John O’Shea had their arms all over him at times, but even that was not enough when he broke away from O’Shea in the second half to force a fine diving save from Mannone. ‘I thought he was top drawer, a real handful,’ added Dyche. ‘If I was a centre-half I wouldn’t have enjoyed playing against him today, that’s for sure.’ Marvin Sordell (C) missed a chance to break the deadlock on his first league start for Burnley . Marvin Sordell, making his first league start for Burnley alongside Jutkiewicz, wasted a great chance as early as the fourth minute when he failed to connect with George Boyd’s pullback, and David Jones drilled another low effort straight at Mannone from 15 yards. Giaccherini was Sunderland’s most lively player but having failed to trouble Heaton with a 25-yard effort in the first half, his low cross in the second looked destined to present Connor Wickham with a simple tap-in at the far post before Jason Shackell intervened with a marvellous back-heeled clearance. The match came alive in the dying stages when Lee Cattermole tried to block a shot from Barnes on the edge of the area in the 86th minute and the ball looped over Mannone but came back off the bar. Then Sunderland were inches away from claiming that elusive victory as they also hit the woodwork in added time. Sunderland's Patrick van Aanholt reacts after hitting the post in injury time . Van Aanholt played a freekick square across the pitch and when it was passed back to him decided to try his luck from fully 30 yards. Heaton’s view was impeded as it flew through a crowded box but he touched the ball against the post and was then relieved to see it deflect against his body and away to safety. Events at Newcastle will no doubt ease the pain for Sunderland, but Gus Poyet wore the look of a manager who is growing increasingly frustrated with their indifferent start. ‘We played okay, but okay is not enough in the Premier League,’ said Poyet. ‘We played the way I want for three or four minutes every now and then but not consistently enough. ‘It was a great opportunity to take the three points. I’ll take a clean sheet today but nothing else.'","Sunderland drew 0-0 with Burnley in Premier League clash on Saturday .

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has warned goalkeeper Joe Hart that he faces a battle to keep his place from new signing Willy Caballero this season. Pellegrini must decide who to play in Sunday’s Community Shield against Arsenal at Wembley after acknowledging that he now has ‘two No 1 goalkeepers’. Caballero, a £6million signing from Pellegrini’s old club Malaga, has primarily been brought in as back-up for Hart but on the understanding that he will offer more of a challenge to the England goalkeeper than the departed Costel Pantilimon. Safe? Joe Hart has been warned that he faces a battle to keep his place in City's starting line-up . The 32-year-old Argentine played in the majority of games on City’s pre-season tour of America while Hart recovered after the World Cup, and has made no secret of his desire to become first-choice at the Etihad. Pellegrini, who dropped Hart for seven Premier League games at the end of last year due to a loss of form, said: ‘I will make the decision who will start — not only the goalkeeper, the whole team. ‘I have two No 1 goalkeepers, I have two No 1 full backs, right and left, and in other positions. ‘Willy has settled in very well. I know him from Malaga and he’s a very good goalkeeper. That is why I say we have a stronger squad than last year. I’m sure Willy will be very important for us, but I also continue thinking we have the best goalkeeper in England in Joe Hart. ‘Top teams need two players for each position because we have to play so many games during the year. When we finish the season I can tell you if he (Hart) has had more or less opposition.’ Sticks: Manuel Pellegrini must decide who to play in Sunday’s Community Shield against Arsenal at Wembley . City’s remaining World Cup contingent — captain Vincent Kompany, Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta, Martin Demichelis, Fernandinho, Bacary Sagna and Frank Lampard — are not fit enough yet to play in the traditional curtain-raiser and some may struggle to be ready for next weekend’s opening Premier League game at Newcastle. However, it is understood that the Premier League champions are on the brink of making their fourth signing of the summer with confirmation of Eliaquim Mangala’s £32m move from FC Porto said to be imminent. Mangala’s arrival will coincide with Javi Garcia’s departure to Zenit St Petersburg after City agreed a £12m fee and £800,000 in add-ons based on the Russian club’s success in Europe. Mangala’s former Porto team-mate Fernando, who joined City from the Portuguese club for £12m earlier this summer, is sure the Frenchman will make an impact. ‘I’ve played with him for a long time, he’s a great player and a friend as well,’ he said. ‘He’s very quick and strong, very competitive. New boy: Hart faces stiff competition from new Man City signing Willy Caballero (pictured) Caballero in action durin City's pre-season friendly against Liverpool in the US . ‘With his characteristics, he might bring an element to the team that City doesn’t have.’ Fernando will challenge fellow Brazilian Fernandinho for a defensive midfield role this season and, like Caballero, is determined to fight for a first-team place. The 27-year-old watched Brazil’s humbling 7-1 defeat to Germany at the World Cup — a match in which Fernandinho was replaced at half-time — and when asked if he could have reinforced the team answers ‘Naturally’. He added: ‘I have a very strong defensive game and that is going to help us a lot because teams will take advantage of City being so attacking, on the counter-attack. I’m going to add very good value in that sense. On the move? Javi Garcia (above) look set for a £12million move to Zenit St. Petersburg . Coming in: Eliaquim Mangala’s (above) £32million move from FC Porto said to be imminent . ‘There are some great players here but I know my strengths and will work hard to make sure I’m first choice.’ Although Fernando will compete with Fernandinho for a place, they might also play together, which would present a problem for commentators. City team-mates have already devised a way to differentiate. ‘I think they’re calling Fernandinho “Fay” and me “Nando”,’ he said. Fernando was speaking at Manchester City’s Community Shield media day at Carrington, where he helped the club’s community coaches train children from local schools and sports clubs in a free soccer school.

"Eliaquim Mangala has spoken of the difficulty he had staying fit while waiting for his £31.9million move to Manchester City to go through. City made Mangala the most expensive defender in the history of British football on Monday after finally agreeing terms with FC Porto and an investment company who owned 33 per cent of his economic rights. The 23-year-old agreed personal terms and passed a medical on a visit to Manchester last month, but has been training on his own since returning from the World Cup and a brief holiday while he waited for his future to be resolved. VIDEO Scroll down to see Eliaquim Mangala score with cheeky back heel volley . Chuffed: Eliaquim Mangala poses with a Man City shirt following his move to the Etihad Stadium . Patient: He has admitted that it was hard to stay fit as he waited for the move to go through . ‘I am happy now because I will be able to start a new adventure,’ said Mangala in his first interview with City’s club website. ‘I will be able to train again. It was good to be on holidays but after a time I started to find the time quite long. ‘I went on a run every day and trained in the gym. Holidays are great but if the time is too long, it is difficult to come back. I think that I will need a bit of time in order to be 100 per cent but it is normal – it is like those who returned to training last week, but I will work hard in order to be 100 per cent as soon as possible. ‘I am really very happy to be part of the team and I will work hard because we have lots of goals and it is very important to start to work as soon as possible.’ Mangala is determined to add to his medal collection in Manchester after winning league titles in Portugal and Belgium with Porto and Standard Liege. And he promised City fans that he will bring a winning mentality to Manuel Pellegrini’s team. Pricey: He became the most expensive defender in British football history following move from Porto . Acquisition: The defender played for Porto for three seasons before signing for Manuel Pellegrini . ‘When I am on the pitch, I always give everything from the first to the last minute,’ he added. ‘I am the kind of player that comes on the pitch to win. I am not giving away anything, I always fight until the end and I hope that we will win quite a lot of titles this season. ‘I am quite a fast defender. I am good in challenges, good in the air. I have the ability to score goals and have done so in the past few seasons. I won’t score 10 goals-a-season but for a defender I get my share from set-pieces. ‘I am motivated because to be part of a team like City I have already proved that I have a certain value, but I will not stop trying to improve. ‘To be part of a squad is good but like everybody else I want to play and it will be down to the manager to make his choice. I will work hard to try to have a spot in the starting XI but the most important is that the team win the games, win titles. It is my main goal: work in order to help the team to win as many titles as possible.’ Manchester United and Chelsea were also linked with Mangala but the France World Cup defender admits that he was impressed by City’s success in recent years and the fact that they made the most effort to bring him to English football. ‘City is a big team in England and they proved it again this year by winning the title,’ he said. ‘Then it is the team that showed me the most interest. I had the opportunity to talk with the manager and the football director and it is also important to have some guarantees when you move to a new club. I had this opportunity to talk and I liked what they said so I signed with City. ‘The squad is great so it will allow me to progress again. I am also someone who likes to win titles and I know that with the squad we have we can do great things.’ Partner: Mangala is set to form a central defensive partnership with City captain Vincent Kompany . Follow on: He will join former Porto team-mate Fernando, who joined the club earlier in the summer . Challenge: And he will be fighting for his place against Martin Demichelis . Mangala is expected to form a first-choice central defensive partnership with City captain Vincent Kompany but he will face competition from Martin Demichelis. Pellegrini also has Dedryck Boyata and Karim Rekik at his disposal, although Matija Nastasic and Micah Richards are expected to move on. ‘Vincent Kompany and Martin Demichelis are two players who possess great experience,’ said Mangala. ‘Vincent is the captain of Manchester City and the Belgium national team, Demichelis has enjoyed a great career. He played for Bayern Munich and he is now at Manchester City and has a big experience behind him. ‘They are players that I can look at and from whom I will learn a lot. They will have lots of advice for me regarding what they have already experienced. It will help me to progress and I am sure that everything will be fine. They are players that have lived through a lot of big moments and have a big experience so it can only be beneficial for me.’ Mangala joins his former Porto teammate Fernando at the Etihad after the Brazilian midfielder moved for £12m earlier this summer. He also becomes the fourth Frenchman on City’s books, joining Bacary Sagna, Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy at the club. He added: ‘I was with Bacary Sagna during the World Cup so we had the opportunity to talk. There are quite a lot of French players and Fernando, who I was in touch during all the preparation because I came here earlier. ‘I had the chance to talk with him and there are some players that speak Spanish and I understand a bit of that language so I think it will be quite quick for me to settle in. The most important thing is to have a good understanding on the pitch and to all go in the same direction.’","Mangala speaks of difficulty in staying fit as he waited for Man City deal .

"He could be bang in the middle of a crisis at Newcastle but instead Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa is playing Champions League football with Roma. The 25-year-old failed to convince on Tyneside, where he was often played at full-back by manager Alan Pardew, but has been earning rave reviews on loan at Roma who want to sign him permanently in January. Newcastle paid £6.7million to Montpellier in January 2013 but may sell for £4m. The former Newcastle defender Yanga-Mbiwa impressed on his return to England for Roma . Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa makes an ungainly challenge on Edin Dzeko but was solid at the Etihad Stadium . Why did Roma go back to black? It was surprising to see a club of Roma’s stature playing without a shirt sponsor. That has been the case since last season when the Italians produced their own shirts after a kit deal with Kappa came to an end. Roma now have a new agreement with Nike but as yet no sponsor to go with it. However, that doesn’t explain why they couldn’t have worn their traditional maroon strip rather than last night’s black number. Cole is No11 in the foreign legion .

Francesco Totti's equaliser made him the oldest scorer in Champions League history at 38 years and three days, replacing Ryan Giggs who held the record on 37 years, 289 days.

"Former Liverpool and England striker Michael Owen insists the concept of 'burnout' is a myth and believes Raheem Sterling will think twice about complaining of tiredness after this week's furore. Teenage forward Sterling has come under fire this week for telling Roy Hodgson he felt tired ahead of England's Euro 2016 qualifying win over Estonia, with the national boss subsequently dropping him from the starting line-up in Tallinn last Sunday. That has sparked a public debate over whether one of the nation's most promising talents needed a break just three months into the new campaign. Raheem Sterling has been criticised for complaining of tiredness just two months into the season . Sterling was benched for England's euro 2016 qualifier in Estonia after alerting boss Roy Hodgson . Owen can certainly relate to Sterling's dilemma having broken into the senior England set-up himself as a teenager, yet the 34-year-old insists he did not dare tell either his club or national manager he could do with a rest. 'We're surmising how he was feeling but I never felt like telling the manager I was tired because I never felt particularly that I needed a rest,' said Owen, who was speaking at the National Football Museum in Manchester where he was being inducted into the English Hall of Fame. 'I know people will say, 'Well, we don't want anyone having burnout'. But I'll ask you now - can you name one player who has ever been burned out? I don't know of anyone.' Sterling played 45 minutes against San Marino before being withdrawn at the break . The ex-Liverpool, Real Madrid and Manchester United striker was plagued with injuries throughout his illustrious career but does not attribute those problems to 'burnout'. Owen added: 'People will point the finger at me but I would just say I had muscle injuries because it was hereditary. 'My dad played football for 15 years and he had loads of muscle injuries, my brothers were both older than me - they were real quick sprinters - and they both had muscle injuries and I had muscle injuries. 'I don't think it was anything to do with how much I played. I don't know of any player that's been burned out, but I might be wrong.' Michael Owen has rubbished the idea that players can suffer from burnout . Owen concedes that Gerard Houllier, who was in charge at Anfield for the bulk of his Liverpool career, would ask his players if they were fatigued but the response was always a unanimous 'no'. And Owen believes the fallout after Sterling's comments were made public by Hodgson will make the player consider whether he wants to express his feelings in future. 'It's difficult to know what to make of Raheem's individual case,' Owen said. 'I can only speak from experience of me being in that situation and we always used to have a bit of a joke at Liverpool because the manager Gerard Houllier would always come around and ask everyone if they're fine, If they're tired. Owen was inducted to the National football Museum Hall Of Fame on Thursday evening . 'You'd always be saying, 'No, no, no, I'm totally fine' because you didn't want to get rested. 'But if Raheem has asked to be rested because he felt tired than you've got to commend him for that because that's putting the team first or he could have injured himself. 'And then on the flip side you think to yourself well maybe he was just being honest with the manager, thinking he was just a little more tired than he was but still wanting to play. 'Then all of a sudden he's been put on the bench and he's thinking I don't think I'll be so honest next time.'","Michael Owen has rubbished idea players can suffer from burnout .

"The police are at the centre of a multi-million-pound expenses row after extraordinary spending binges on taxpayer-funded credit cards. Officials working for a Government policing quango used the cards to buy items such as exotic lingerie and beehives while racking up bills of more than £3 million a year. Last night the quango claimed the underwear had been used to re-enact crime scenes, while the bees were said to be necessary to fertilise an allotment at a staff training college. But MPs dismissed the defence, calling the spending, revealed under a Freedom of Information request, ‘outrageous’ and demanding an investigation. The row comes amid a battle between the Coalition and senior civil servants over the use of the 140,000 ‘procurement cards’ – credit cards embossed with the words HM Government – which have been issued to Whitehall officials and in town halls around the country. Ministers were horrified to discover that despite more than £1 billion of public money being put on the cards every year, any spending lower than £1,000 a month has not been routinely audited. And they have been infuriated by what they privately call ‘blocking tactics’ at the top of the Civil Service when they have tried to establish how many officials have been abusing the perk by using the cards to make personal purchases. Just four out of the 25 Government departments have released details of internal investigations into the card use. The disclosure of secret bank statements shows astonishing spending by the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), a £368 million-a-year outfit set up three years ago by Labour ‘to support the police service by providing expertise in areas such as serious crime analysis and the development of new policing technologies and skills’. Country retreat: The Harperley Hall police training centre near Durham, left, and right Prince Anne watches police officers practise their forensic skills at a specially constructed replica High Street at the facility . A total of 150 of the policing organisation’s 1,636 staff have been issued with the procurement cards, using them to spend an average of more than £20,000 a year. The card statements, which cover 2008 to 2010, detail hundreds of items which appear to be far removed from the world of crime detection. They include: £51.60 on designer lingerie from Figleaves.com, which specialises in luxurious ‘intimate apparel’; £28.95 on women’s underwear from the ‘beautiful, sexy and stylish’ store La Senza; £1,841 on beehives; £205 on golfing equipment; and £1,258 on a lawnmower. Boss: The NPIA is headed by Nick Gargan . £1,289 went on sightseeing with London Duck Tours; £55 on karaoke gear; £828 on judo outfits – and 69p at sandwich shop Pret A Manger, believed to be on a packet of crisps. Over the two years, the card holders billed the taxpayer for a total of £1,386,534 on travel, £672,588 on hotels, £26,779 on leisure, £27,917 on restaurants and bars, and £18,196 on ‘garden services’. The statements show the NPIA’s total spending on the cards was £2,869,611 in 2008-2009, rising to £3,625,405 in 2009-2010. Last night Tory MP Anna Soubry called for an investigation. ‘Now we know where all the money went under the last Labour Government,’ she said. ‘What on earth are they doing spending money on beehives and lingerie? It’s outrageous.’ Nick Gargan, chief executive of the NPIA – which will be phased out next year as part of the Government’s cull of quangos – admitted the bills could lead to a ‘perception of wastefulness’, but said all spending had been legitimate. Mr Gargan, former Assistant Chief Constable of Thames Valley Police, said the lingerie had been bought to simulate a scene of sexual assault at Harperley Hall, the country retreat at Crook, County Durham, where police are trained in crime-scene investigation techniques. He defended the purchase of beehives as necessary to help sustain a market garden at the police staff college at Bramshill, Hampshire, and said other items such as ‘golfing equipment’ had been used as part of first aid training exercises. ‘It is important to make the training as realistic as possible,’ said Mr Gargan. ‘But lessons are being learned. If we were buying lingerie as props today, I think we would probably walk into Primark to get them. ‘The beehives were bought to cultivate the kitchen garden which grows fruit and vegetables at the police staff college in Bramshill. It is better than flying in food from around the world. And you need bees to make a kitchen garden work.’ He said the lawnmower had been bought to help maintain the college’s gardens, the karaoke equipment had been used in the student lounge at Harperley Hall, and the Duck Tours had been laid on for international policing officers who attended training courses – with the costs met by the course fees, not the taxpayer. Mr Gargan said: ‘We have significantly reduced the amount spent through the use of the procurement cards by 33 per cent, from £3.6  million in 2009-10 to £2.48  million in 2010-11.’ Ministers have been alarmed by the seemingly lax approach to auditing card use. The cards, introduced in 1997, the year Tony Blair entered Downing Street, were designed to be a convenient way to pay for low-value work expenses such as travel tickets and office supplies. But unlike many company credit cards, which dock the sums spent from employees’ pay and refund it if the claim can be justified, the bills are settled directly by finance departments out of taxpayers’ funds. Suspicions have been raised by the number of items on the bills that appear to cost just less than £1,000 – the minimum amount that was usually checked by finance directors. Labour set up the National Policing Improvement Agency in 2007, saying the quango would boost police expertise in serious crime analysis, training, operational support and developing new technologies and skills. With a staff of 2,174 – now down to 1,636 – and a budget of £368million, it is funded by the Home Office, with a leadership drawn from the Police Service. Since last year, it has been headed by former Thames Valley Assistant Chief Constable Nick Gargan.Ironically, given the revelations about officials’ credit card spending, the NPIA – which reports to the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Police Authorities and the Government – was given responsibility in 2009 for making ‘efficiency improvements’ to forces’ spending on goods and services. Shortly after coming into power, the Coalition Government said it would shut the NPIA as part of its programme of public spending cuts, and hand its responsibilities to other organisations. The move has been condemned by Labour. Settling up: Most cards are black, but senior staff might have a gold or silver one . Over the 14 years since it was developed, the Government Procurement Card (GPC) has spread to every corner of officialdom. Dubbed the ‘Gold Card on the taxpayer’, a total of 71,000 are used in Central London, with the remaining 69,000 issued by councils and quangos. They are billed as a convenient way to pay for low-value work expenses such as travel tickets and office supplies, with all bills settled directly by departmental finance departments, but have instead been used far more widely. A 20-page manual declares in bold type that: ‘Deliberate or negligent misuse of the GPC may result in the suspension or withdrawal of your card. Serious misuse could result in disciplinary or criminal action being taken against you.’ The manual explains that each card owner has a set ‘single transaction limit’ and monthly limit. Most cards are black, but card holders at the top of the Civil Service pecking order are issued with silver or gold cards that ‘do not have the single transaction or categories of spend constraints that the black cards have . . . and the full monthly credit limit may therefore be used in one transaction if required’. The rules say the cards can be used ‘for official business purposes only’. They cannot be used for obtaining cash, alcohol or fuel. Attempts to discover how many officials have been disciplined for breaking these rules have met with resistance from the Civil Service. Just four departments, the Treasury, Business, Health and Education, have disclosed their figures, which showed 22 incidents had been uncovered, of which eight led to the dismissal of a member of staff. The offences included using cards at Tesco and PC World. The cards were supplied by Visa before other companies, including American Express and Mastercard, pitched for the contracts. Last night, Visa said the Government could do more to regulate the cards’ use. ‘Departments have the ability to set controls on point-of-sale transactions to enable them to limit the type of merchants where money is spent,’ a spokesman said. ‘All transactions are transparent and information can be accessed by those in charge of monitoring expenditure.’","Quango claim the underwear was needed to 're-enact crime scenes' and bees were essential to fertilise an allotment .

"Two men have admitted a string of pet cruelty charges after being caught sending live fish in the post. Mark Freed started an online pet delivery business from his home in Greenhithe in Dartford, Kent, along with friend Mustafas Bodour, a court heard this week. Dartford magistrates heard on Tuesday how Freed, 28, posted animals in watertight bags placed inside boxes marked 'fragile' using a private delivery firm. Nondescript: One of the boxes used by Mark Freed and Mustafas Bodour's business to send live pets to customers. The 'fragile' tape was the only indication of the package's contents . The pets sent out to online buyers included terrapins, lizards and Siamese fighting fish. Freed and Bodour, 24, of Greenhithe - but now living in Holland - were arrested last year after a delivery worker from TNT discovered a fish in a package. When the RSPCA sent an officer to Freed's address, they found another courier leaving with a parcel containing live fish. Both men were charged with causing unnecessary suffering to animals and Freed was also charged with failing to provide reasonable care to Siamese fighting fish. Risky: These two terrapins were sent in the post with little more protection than a watertight bag . The court heard how the exotic pets were sent in 'clear plastic bags containing water', and after a search of Freed's home RSPCA officers found more animals in bags ready for transportation. Andrew Wiles, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said although none of the animals had died they would have suffered from being posted to customers in boxes. He told the court: 'Apart from having the label ""fragile"" on it, it had no information that it contained live animals. 'It was opened and there was some newspaper and some bubble wrap and the terrapins were in a clear plastic bag.' The court heard how Bodour invested £1,500 in the business, but left the day-to-day running to Freed. Exotic pet: Mark Freed admitted failing to provide reasonable care to Siamese fighting fish after the RSPCA caught him sending them via couriers . Wayne Crowhurst, defending Freed, said his client had been 'looking after animals since he was seven' and would never deliberately harm them. Both men pleaded guilty to five counts of causing unnecessary suffering to animals and Freed also pleaded guilty to failing to provide reasonable care to Siamese fighting fish. Bodour was banned from owning aquatic animals for 10 years and ordered to pay £3,130 in court costs, as well as receiving a three-year conditional discharge. Freed was released on bail and will be sentenced on April 24. He was warned a custodial sentence could not be ruled out.","Online exotic pet business also posted lizards and terrapins .

"Rupert Murdoch was today criticised for describing David Cameron's late son Ivan as 'retarded' during his testimony at the Leveson Inquiry. The 81-year-old casually used the word, which is now deemed offensive, for the disabled boy as he explained how much admiration he had for the Prime Minister's kindness towards his children. The media tycoon was telling the hearing about his relationship with David Cameron during the period when the Prime Minister became the opposition leader of the Conservative Party. David Cameron tenderly kisses his son Ivan's cheek at home in 2004. Ivan needed round-the-clock care and died in 2009 aged six . 'Unfortunate': Rupert Murdoch referred to David Cameron's late son Ivan as 'retarded' during his testimony at the Leveson Inquiry in London today . Mr Murdoch said: 'I first met him once, maybe even twice, at family picnics at weekends at my daughter's house in the grounds of Blenheim Castle (Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire) where he came with his family. 'We were overrun with children, there were no politics. 'But I was extremely impressed at the kindness and feeling he showed to the children, particularly to his retarded son. 'And I came away talking about this - what a good family man.' Ivan Cameron suffered from severe epilepsy and cerebral palsy and died in 2009 aged six. He had needed round-the-clock care. The chief executive of the London Centre For Children With Cerebral Palsy today criticised Mr Murdoch's 'unfortunate' language. Caring: David Cameron and his wife Samantha with their late son Ivan, who suffered from severe epilepsy and cerebral palsy, in 2008 . David Cameron talking to Rupert Murdoch at the wedding of Rebecca Wade to Charlie Brooks in June 2009 . Marc Crank, the organisation's chief . executive, said: 'It's an unfortunate turn of phrase. Using it is very . much of a certain age and 81-year-olds do tend to use words that we . wouldn't use today. The word 'retard' originated in the late 15th century and comes from the French word 'retarder', which itself derives from the Latin 'retardare' meaning backwards or slow. After centuries of being used as an official medical adjective to describe a mentally disabled person, it has become increasingly offensive to use the word in recent decades. By the late 20th century, the word had become slang for describing someone who had done something idiotic or foolish. But it wasn't until 2006 that the term 'mental retardation' was dropped by the American Association on Mental Retardation and the organisation was renamed American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities . In 2008, a poll by the BBC concluded that 'retard' was the most offensive disability-related word. 'We would hope that people now would be more enlightened that to use such negative terminology.' Meanwhile . Mark Gale, campaigns and policy officer for learning disability charity . Mencap, said: 'From Mencap's point of view, the use of the word is . completely outdated and it is quite shocking that someone of Rupert . Murdoch's standing, who is supposed to be close to public views and the . public opinion, would be so careless in his choice of language. 'Mencap campaigns against the use of this sort of language and really wants a positive representation of disabled people and while high profile figures are continuing to use this sort of language we know that is never going to happen. 'We want people to be aware of how damaging this language is and move beyond the use of that word.' In a written statement, Mr Murdoch . said: 'Mr Cameron, since his election as Prime Minister, I have met . principally in social settings, where little of substance was discussed. 'I . do recall that, shortly after his election, Mr Cameron invited me in . for tea at No 10 Downing Street. He thanked me for the support of our . papers. David and Samantha Cameron pictured with their children including Ivan, left, who died in 2009 aged just six. They have since had another daughter, Florence . 'I . congratulated him and told him that I was sure our titles would watch . carefully and report whether he kept all of his campaign promises. The . meeting lasted at most 20 minutes.' But . the tycoon denied any involvement in the appointment of former News of . the World editor Andy Coulson as Mr Cameron's communications chief in . May 2007. The Camerons' first child, Ivan was born in 2002 with a rare form of cerebral palsy and severe epilepsy. Though the couple were initially told by doctors he was suffering a kidney malfunction, Ivan was eventually diagnosed with Ohtahara syndrome - a rare neurological disorder characterised by seizures. Doctors told the couple that some children with Ohtahara syndrome die in infancy, while others live for years but with profound disability. Mr Cameron ensured Ivan was christened at the 'earliest opportunity' because of the lack of clarity about his prospects. Genetic experts told the couple there was a one in 20 chance of future children being born with the condition, though happily Nancy and Arthur are healthy. The Camerons had to adapt their home in West London to accommodate Ivan, who needed a special lift to get him in and out of his bath. Though his condition meant he could not move his limbs or speak, the Camerons drew strength from the fact that he appeared to respond to their love and care. 'I was just as surprised as anyone else,' he told the hearing. Mr Murdoch . also recalled how an 'unbalanced' Gordon Brown 'declared war' on his . media empire after switching sides to support the Tories at the last . election. But he said claims that Mr Brown had ‘roared at him for 20 minutes’ were a 'colourful exaggeration'. He went on to recount in detail the conversation he had with the former Prime Minister. Mr Murdoch recalled how Mr Brown . asked: ‘Do you know what's going on here?,’ when the front page of the . Sun was published declaring support for David Cameron in September 2009. Mr Murdoch said he replied: ‘I was . not warned of the exact timing, I'm not aware of what they're saying, . but I'm sorry to tell you Gordon we will support a change of government . if there is an election.’ He . then said Mr Brown responded: ‘Well, your company has declared war on . the government. We have no alternative but to declare war on your . company.’ He replied: ‘I'm . sorry to hear that Gordon.’ The call ended. Mr Murdoch said today: 'I . did not think he was in a very balanced state of mind.' During today's hearing Mr Murdoch faced repeated questioning . over whether he sought to influence the politics of Britain through the . power of his numerous newspapers. But at each turn, speaking . deliberately and slowly, he denied ever seeking favours, and at one . point thumped the table to say: 'In ten years of his power, I never asked Tony Blair for anything, nor indeed did I receive any favours.' In addition, Mr Murdoch said that he admired, and still does admire Margaret Thatcher - but denied he was 'one of the main powers' behind her leadership and denied consulting with her . regularly on important policy matters. He again insisted: 'I've never asked a Prime . minister for anything'. He also denied ever talking to Mr Cameron about the £8bn BSkyB bid. Mr Murdoch said it was ‘pure coincidence’ that the BSkyB bid was launched a month after Mr Cameron took power. The inquiry - . which also saw one person ejected by police for refusing to sit down - . heard that Mr Murdoch visited Downing Street by the back door weeks . earlier on 10 May 2010 to congratulate Mr Cameron on winning the . election.","Media tycoon criticised for his 'unfortunate' language .

"A Japanese airline was forced to apologise today for an advert which critics claim racially stereotyped Westerners as having big noses and blond hair. All Nippon Airways (ANA) said Monday it was modifying the TV commercial, but insisted they had meant no offence. ANA started airing the new 30-second television advertisement on Saturday, aimed at promoting its beefed up schedule of international flights from Tokyo's Haneda airport in March. Scroll down for video . 'This is OK?!' A Japanese airline has apologised for an ad which critics claim racially stereotypes Westerners . Offensive? The commercial talks about changing the image of Japanese people as one of the characters is now featured wearing a large rubber nose and blond wig . In the commercial, two Japanese men in ANA uniform discuss in English how they might boost the image of the airline as an international carrier. One of them says: 'Let's change the image of Japanese people.' 'Sure,' replies the other, who is now wearing a blond wig and an improbably long rubber nose. White westerners are often believed in Japan to have big noses, blue eyes and blond hair, characteristics generally thought desirable among Japanese. The ad caused a stir among English-language users of social media in Japan. 'I've just seen the new ANA advert...Really? ANA think this is OK?!' Angela Fukutome said in a message posted on ANA's Facebook page. 'If you are a foreigner and have planned to come to #Japan do not choose an openly racist airline like #ANA! Watch their Japanese commercial,' tweeted @sibylleito on Twitter. Apology: Westerners are often believed in Japan to have big noses, blue eyes and blond hair, characteristics generally thought desirable among Japanese, but the portrayal has still attracted criticism . ANA spokesman Ryosei Nomura said the carrier wanted to express the importance of the planned expansion of international services from Haneda and to call on Japanese to go out to see the world. 'But we have received opinions different from the message that we wished to convey. We will modify part of the advertisement and will release the second version soon,' he said. The original TV spot was initially aired for Saturday through Monday and has now been pulled for now, he said. Earlier, an ANA spokeswoman acknowledged the carrier 'has received calls from customers, mostly foreigners, complaining about the ad.' 'We apologised to each of the customers for having caused uncomfortable feelings and also thanked them for bringing up the issue,' she told AFP. Japan is largely racially homogenous, with relatively small immigrant communities.","Commercial talks about 'changing the image of Japanese people'

"Britain may arm Syria's rebels, William Hague said yesterday – as he warned the UK cannot afford to 'sit on the sidelines' of the bloody conflict. The Foreign Secretary, who is expected to announce further assistance to the rebels this week, suggested weapons could also be sent if the conflict continues, saying: 'I don't rule out anything for the future.' Mr Hague hit out at Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, describing him as 'delusional' for his claim in an interview yesterday that Britain is fuelling the two-year-old conflict that has claimed 70,000 lives. Ruling nothing out: Foreign Secretary William Hague suggested weapons could be sent to Syrian rebels is the conflict continues . And he said Britain would continue to step up support for those trying to force Assad from power, despite warnings some rebel groups are linked to Al Qaeda. Mr Hague acknowledged past reluctance to arm the rebels was partly because of the danger that weapons could fall into the hands of Islamist extremists. Ministers have also been concerned at the risk of possible negative public reaction if Britain is dragged into another war in a Muslim country, ten years after the American-led invasion of Iraq. But Mr Hague yesterday suggested the calculation about whether to arm the rebels was changing. Jihadist: Business graduate Ibrahim al-Mazwagi has become the first British-born jihadist killed in Syria . He told Sophie Raworth on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: 'These things are a balance of risk. You can reach the point eventually and the loss of life is so great that you have to do something new to save lives.' He went on: 'The longer this goes on, the greater the danger that extremism takes hold, the greater the danger of destabilising neighbouring countries, and the greater the extreme humanitarian distress involved. So we cannot just sit on the sidelines and watch this. 'We will be doing more and we will have to steadily do more if there is no diplomatic or political breakthrough. The situation in Syria now is too dangerous to the peace and security of that entire region and thereby to the world to ignore it. I don't rule anything out for the future. 'If this is going to go on for months or years and more, tens of thousands of people are going to die and countries like Iraq and Lebanon and Jordan are going to be destabilised. It is not something we can ignore. These are the reasons why we can't just sit it out in Syria.' Armed: Syrian rebels have been fighting government forces in the country for for two years . Senior Tory Edward Leigh has demanded a 'categorical assurance that no British taxpayers' money is finding its way to jihadists through indirect means'. Speaking in a House of Commons debate last week, he said it was 'essential that we do not send, or countenance sending, indirectly or directly, any arms into Syria. That would make the situation far worse.' President Assad yesterday launched his outspoken attack on Britain. In a rare interview he described the UK as an 'arsonist' which was aiding 'terrorists' in the country. He said Britain's stance was 'naive, confused and unrealistic'. 'To be frank, Britain has played a famously unconstructive role in our region on different issues for decades, some say for centuries,' he said.

"The mother of a 10-year-old boy who died after a sand dune collapsed on top of him at a beach desperately tried to revive her son after digging him out. Byron Gordon, from Wyndham on the far south coast New South Wales, was digging a hole in the sand alongside his four-year-old brother when the dune collapsed and trapped him at Terrace Beach near Eden, on the far south coast of NSW. When the small dune collapsed, Byron's brother ran to their mother, Lia, a trained nurse who tried to revive her boy. She pulled her son out from beneath the sand, after  she could only see his legs and began to perform CPR on him just after the dune collapsed on Monday afternoon, according to Nine News. Scroll down for video . Byron Gordon, from Wyndham in southern NSW, died on Monday afternoon . The boy was digging a hole in the sand alongside his brother at Terrace Beach . The 10-year-old died after after a sand dune collapsed on him at Terrace Beach in Ben Boyd National Park . Paramedics arrived at the remote and unpatrolled beach at Ben Boyd National Park at around 2.45pm where they tried to treat him at the scene. Byron was then rushed to Pambula Hospital in a critical condition, after suffering from a cardiac arrest according to an ambulance spokesperson, where he later died. Police are still investigating the incident, however Detective Superintendent Peter O'Brien told the ABC that the 'most likely scenario is that there was a collapse of some sand onto him causing him to be trapped under the sand and unfortunately unable to breathe'. He had been digging in the sand when the dune collapsed, trapping him inside and causing him to suffer a cardiac arrest . 'They were just doing what all kids do on the beach: digging holes and mucking around in the sand which is an occurrence that would be happening everyday on any beach in Australia,' Supt. O'Brien said. Peter Guenthroth, a friend of the family, told Nine News that Byron was known to be a keen explorer. 'To me it sounds like he was digging head first into the sand dune and got carried away like a kid would, digging a little hole like a little cave,' Mr Guenthroth said. 'He was into exploring caves and doing all natural things.' Peter Guenthroth, a friend of the family, told Nine News that Byron most likely 'got carried away' while digging a 'little cave' to explore . Bega Valley Mayor Bill Taylor said the close-knit community would be reeling. 'We can only struggle to comprehend how family and friends are coping today. We can't even imagine what they are going through,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'It's every parent's nightmare that something like this might happen. A child doing something so innocent and the next minute you have a tragedy on your hands.

"Chased: Gedling Borough Council spent £200,000 pursuing Trevor Evans for a £2000 council tax bill . A 'blinkered and aggressive' local authority spent £200,000 chasing a schizophrenic pensioner over an unpaid council tax bill after 'ignoring' the fact he was mentally ill. Gedling Borough Council splashed out £50,000 in legal costs alone pursuing vulnerable Trevor Evans for a bankruptcy order over the unpaid bill of less than £2,000. The Nottinghamshire local authority wrongly ignored the fact Mr Evans, 80, was schizophrenic and has dementia in chasing him over the payment, a judge ruled today. The ruling means Gedling Borough . Council now have to pay trustee fees of £70,000 and pay Mr Evans's legal . costs, which solicitors estimate will amount to a further £80,000. Those . figures takes the total council spend to an astonishing £200,000 - more . than a hundred times what Mr Evans owed in council tax. A District Judge ruled the authority did not show compassion towards Mr Evans in pursuing the 'disproportionate' legal action. District . Judge Jane George said in her ruling that Alistair Townsend, the . council's tax manager, had 'demonstrated a lack of understanding' when . he said in a statement that there was 'no indication that Mr Evans was . suffering from a mental illness' and he was 'under no duty to make . detailed inquiries about Mr Evans' health'. The judge added: 'The court is satisfied that it is more likely than not that when the bankruptcy order was made, Mr Evans was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and vascular dementia and that by reason of those mental disorders he lacked capacity. 'The council could have shown compassion for him [Mr Evans] even if it did not accept the legal arguments advanced on his behalf. 'Purely on economic grounds it is not proportionate to have pursued Mr Evans for £1,909 and to have incurred what is likely to be in excess of £100,000 of costs and expenses.' Legal representatives for Mr Evans had previously argued that Mr Evans's illness made it very difficult for him to deal with his own financial matters. The pensioner, who lives in Bestwood Village in Gedling, Notts, was made bankrupt in 2004 after his debt problems mounted when he neglected to pay a council tax bill totalling £1,900. Barrister Margaret Griffin, representing Mr Evans, said at a previous hearing that Gedling Borough Council showed a 'blinkered and aggressive' attitude in pursuing the debt and pushing for the bankruptcy order. The council insists its insurance will cover the costs and the taxpayer will not be affected. It does admit that its insurance premium has gone up, but says this is by a 'negligible' amount. A council spokesman said: 'The council now accepts that Mr Evans lacked capacity at the time he was made bankrupt and apologises to him for any distress caused. 'At that time, the council was not aware of any issues surrounding Mr Evans's mental health, and if it had been made aware of these issues, it is unlikely that the action would have been pursued.' The council says it has put in place measures to prevent known vulnerable people facing similar problems. But a spokesman added: 'The council is concerned about the implications of the judgement, because it has no means to assess the mental health of debtors where it is not told that there is a problem. 'The council has been advised that there could be grounds for a positive appeal on this basis but has decided not to take this step because of the potential cost to the public purse and the further distress and uncertainty this may cause for Mr Evans.' Matthew Hill, solicitor for Mr Evans, said: 'The council's decision to make Mr Evans bankrupt, for such a relatively small sum of money, and to carry on with this case for so many years demonstrates a worrying attitude towards vulnerable individuals. 'Mr Evans was lucky that help found him. However, I am sure that there are many other at-risk people who just slip through the net. 'This case should act as a stark warning to others, including other local authorities, who might seek to make people bankrupt.'","Gedling Borough Council 'aggressive' in chasing Trevor Evans, 80 .

"The devil is in the detail – literally hidden. When a British couple discovered a concealed, almost lifesize mural of Henry VIII while redecorating their 16th-century Somerset home a couple of years ago, they could not have been more excited, particularly when an expert spoke of its national importance. But husband-and-wife Angie and Rhodri Powell were unnerved by a further chance discovery. Diabolical: When the portrait of Henry VIII (left), found by Angie and Rhodri Powell, is turned upside-down, it is transformed into the head of the devil . When the portrait of Henry on his throne is viewed upside-down his features transform into the devil, with horns and goats’ eyes. The devil appears too when the mural is viewed through a glass. The mural is in the couple's drawing-room in the village of Milverton, the former Great Hall of the summer residence of 16th-century archdeacons of Taunton including Thomas Cranmer. While Henry’s portrait would have been an expression of loyalty, the hidden message suggests it was commissioned by someone with quite another view of a monarch who established himself as head of the Church in England in place of the Pope. Mrs Powell, a bestselling children’s author who writes under the name Angie Safe, and Mr Powell, a former publisher, came across the devil by accident. The painting of Henry VIII was discovered when some plaster was removed from a wall in house in Milverton, Somerset . The house was once the summer residence of the Archdeacons of Taunton . A portrait of Henry VIII (1491-1547) aged 49 in 1540, oil on panel by Hans Holbein . They were relaxing upstairs by an open . fire one evening when they noticed that a postcard of the mural which . they had printed had fallen on the floor upside-down – revealing the . portrait’s sinister side. Mrs . Powell recalled: 'It was fairly low light. My husband noticed the . face…We were both very spooked. It’s quite an unpleasant image. I was . bit horrified… I realised it was the devil.' Thomas Cranmer was one of the most influential religious leaders during the English Reformation and his influence spanned the reigns of three monarchs – Henry VIII, Edward VI and Mary I. It was during the reign of Mary, a staunch Catholic, that Cranmer was put to death. Historians believe it was Cranmer who suggested to Henry VIII that he should get the theological support of the Protestant universities of Western Europe in his quest for a divorce from Catherine of Aragon. In 1533, the academic was offered the position of Archbishop of Canterbury. In an era when few dared to oppose a decision of the king, Cranmer accepted and was propelled into high politics. Now one of the leading religious figure in the land, Cranmer started to develop his religious views. He wanted to see Protestantism embedded in England – a view more extreme that Henry in 1533. However, Cranmer kept on the right side of Henry by preaching his unswerving support for monarchical absolutism, which he justified by his support for the doctrine of divine right of kings. Along with Thomas Cromwell, Cranmer worked out marriage proposals and divorces when required by Henry. Over the next years of Henry's reign, Cranmer and the king developed a very close relationship. During Mary's reign, Cranmer was charged with treason and imprisoned in the Tower of London in November 1553. In March 1554, his religious views were declared heretical. On March 21, 1556, he was burned at the stake. They were so unnerved that they did not venture downstairs that evening. The next morning, they 'very gingerly opened the door', and were reassured to find Henry with the 'same old benign expression', Mrs Powell said. As they peered more closely, they . realised how skilfully the dangerous image had been concealed. The . king’s narrow shoulders become the devil’s pointed chin and oddly-shaped . sleeve-cuffs were satanic eye-sockets. The mural, which is thought to date from around the 1530s or 1540s, is almost six foot high and 20 foot wide. Dr Kathryn Davies, a wall paintings specialist with English Heritage who is researching the mural, said: 'It does look quite evil… Hold a glass up to it, it's bizarre. You get quite an eerie picture.' Professor Diarmaid MacCulloch, a specialist in the history of the church at Oxford University and Cranmer biographer, said that there was tremendous interest in optical illusion at the time, as shown by the distorted perspectives in Holbein's famous painting of The Ambassadors and William Scrots's portrait of Edward VI. 'So there’s no reason why it shouldn’t be true,' he said. He noted that one of the then archdeacons felt 'very equivocally' about Henry VIII’s Reformation: 'It's just possible that, for a private joke, he put it in because you could only see it through an optic. I imagine that, in the privacy of his own dining-room… it could be enjoyable.' For obvious reasons, the painting is unsigned. Conservator Ann Ballantyne, who is working on the mural, noted that it was painted at a time when the king was behaving 'excruciatingly badly'. The Powells are no longer frightened. Mr Powell said: 'This was really…a delightful piece of satire.' As the old proverb goes: 'The devil is not so black as he is painted.'","Angie and Rhodri Powell found mural in their 16th-century Somerset home .

"A lesbian athletic director fired a popular male gym teacher who was married with kids because she disapproved of his traditional family status, he has claimed. Gregory Kenney, 51, taught gym at Trinity School, an exclusive private school in Manhattan's Upper West Side, for 16 years before he was sacked in 2012. The father-of-three claims in a lawsuit that the athletic director, Pat Krieger, took a disliking to him for being straight when she arrived in 2009 and treated the young, single women employees far better. Krieger allegedly made Kenney coach three sports, even though his contract required him to coach two, and when he complained about it, she was unsympathetic, according to his suit. Lawsuit: Pat Krieger, left, the sports director at Trinity School in Manhattan and a lesbian, allegedly helped fire Gregory Kenney, right, because she disapproved of his traditional family status and commitments . After Kenney told Krieger that he couldn't working extra, she reported him to the headmaster but when a young, single female teacher had the same complaints, she accommodated her, the suit said. He claims she 'routinely favored other single, younger females without children and discriminated against [him] because of his gender, sexual orientation, ""traditional family status"" and age'. 'I love the school. I love my job. I enjoyed the kids I was with and the classes I taught, but I have a wife and family. I'm not 16,' Kenney told the New York Daily News. 'He felt ostracized because of his family,' Kenney's attorney, Steven Morelli, told The New York Post. Kenney, who coached soccer, basketball and golf at Trinity, added that on at least one occasion he was dissuaded from going to school events 'because he was a heterosexual, married male with children, who wouldn't fit in with [Krieger's] ""culture"",' the Post reported. Ostracized: When Kenney complained that extra work conflicted with time with his wife Suzanne, right, and their children, Krieger allegedly gave him no sympathy - whereas she went easier on younger, female staff . Then he claimed Krieger's attack became even more personal when she accused him of illegally subletting his Trinity Tower apartment and leaving students unsupervised, the suit says. He claims that her accusations were false. 'It was very stressful and difficult,' Kenney told the Daily News. He was fired as a result and said that three other married coaches with children also lost their jobs. Kenney and his wife, who is also a gym teacher, complained to school officials about his treatment but nothing was done, he said. School: He had worked at the exclusive Upper West Side school for 16 years before being fired . After losing the job, Kenney, who has seven-year-old twin girls and a nine-year-old son, was replaced by a lesbian teacher, according to court papers. He is seeking unspecified damages in the suit. A spokesman for Trinity did not immediately comment. The school, which was founded 300 years ago and costs parents as much as $41,000 a year per student, counts Truman Capote, Ivanka Trump and John McEnroe among its alumni.","Gregory Kenney, a father-of-three, was fired from Trinity School after 16 years when Pat Krieger took over as the athletic director .

"A four-year-old was hit and killed by a train at a level crossing because her grandmother could not see the dim warning lights. A year-long investigation was launched after Emma Lifsey's death at the junction near Finningley in South Yorkshire on December 4. Today, a report presented to the government ruled the road traffic signals - known as wig-wags - were well below the specified brightness. Emma Lifsey was four when her grandmother drove over a level crossing into the way of a 60mph train . The girl's 67-year-old grandmother told a panel she did not notice the lights and barriers at the automatic crossing until she was driving past them in her silver Volvo. The pair, from Haxey, North Yorkshire, were crushed by an East Midlands train going at 60mph. Local residents rescued them from the wreckage. Although Emma was taken to a specialist unit Sheffield Children's Hospital by air ambulance, she died from her injuries that night. Her grandmother survived with severe neck injuries, treated at Doncaster Royal Infirmary. No one on the train was hurt. Local residents rescued the girl and her grandmother from the wreckage in Finningley, South Yorkshire . Today's report from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) blasted Network Rail for failing to notice the discrepancy. It states the weather was sunny at the time of the lunch-time collision but there had been rain showers earlier and the road surface was wet, leading to glare from the low winter sun. The report went on: 'The RAIB took the wig-wag units and arranged for testing in an optical laboratory. 'It was found that they were fitted with 36W lamps and an obsolete design of red lens unit. 'Their light output was measured to be well below the specification for lights of this type. 'Network Rail had no plans in place to replace the light units with brighter ones and had no process to identify that such replacement was necessary.' The RAIB said infrastructure managers should make it a priority to determine which level crossings are fitted with weak 36W lamps and draw up plans to replace them with a new 'brighter' type of LED wig-wag. Change: The government will now consider bringing in new laws for the method of blocking level crossings . A method should also be devised to assess the risk of a bright background and glare obscuring wig-wag signals, the report added. The report came on the same day as the publication of a joint study by the Law Commission of England and Wales and the Scottish Law Commission. It makes recommendations to for law changes that will clarify rights of way across railways. The report also suggests devising a new way of closing level crossings and improving the general safety regime. Speaking after the incident, Emma’s parents, Mark and Zoe Lifsey, aged 40 and 38, said: 'Emma meant the world to us. She was our . much-loved daughter and a baby sister to her 11-year-old brother Jack. 'We . are still trying to come to terms with the terrible incident on Tuesday . afternoon and there are no words that can properly express how utterly . distraught we are. 'We would like to thank everyone for the many messages of sympathy and support we have received.

"'Outrageous': The Eco Garage on Holland Road, West London was selling diesel at 177.9p a litre . Millions of Britons will begin their Easter getaway tomorrow under the shadow of the fuel panic fiasco. Drivers will face congestion, roadworks and record prices to fill up their tanks. Petrol is at a record 141.79p a litre and diesel at 147.71p – although many garages are charging much higher prices. Chelsea Cloisters Services in . Knightsbridge, West London, was yesterday charging an incredible 174.9p a . litre for petrol, while the ECO filling station in Kensington’s Holland . Road was selling diesel at 177.9p a litre. AA . president Edmund King said: ‘These prices are absolutely outrageous and . beyond the pale. Some garages are clearly cashing in and profiteering . from the panic at the previous pumps.’ The RAC said petrol was 6p a litre more expensive than at Easter last year and more than 24p compared to Easter 2010. Diesel is now averaging 147.71p a litre compared with 141.69p at Easter 2011 and only 117.6p at Easter 2010. RAC patrol ambassador of the year, Kevin Andrews, said: 'Although the high cost of fuel is likely to put many off travelling this Easter it's still important for people to plan their journeys before setting off to avoid getting lost and wasting precious fuel. 'Allow plenty of time for your journey particularly if you're heading for a popular resort or travelling at peak times.' Talks aimed at resolving the fuel tanker drivers dispute and head off the threat of strikes are currently underway. Conciliation service Acas are acting as mediator between Unite, the union representing tanker drivers, and seven distribution companies. The dispute over terms and . conditions and health and safety has been brewing for more than a year . but flared up last week when Unite announced that workers in five of the . firms had voted to strike. The Government advised motorists to top . up with fuel, leading to chaotic scenes at garages across the country as . people queued for petrol. Unite announced on Friday it would not be . striking over Easter as it engaged with Acas over the peace moves, and . would have to give seven days notice of any industrial action. Unite General Secretary Len McCluskey said: 'For nearly two years, we have been trying to persuade the fuel distribution sector to work with us to defend best practice across the industry. 'It is vital that common, minimum standards on safety, training, wages and pensions are agreed to put a floor of best practice in the sector.' No fuel: Garages across the country have seen their fuel supplies dry up after the Government sparked a frenzy of panic buying at the pumps ahead of a potential tanker strike . Waiting game: Drivers caused a backlog of traffic in some areas last week as they queued up for petrol and diesel while sales of jerry cans soared . The chairman of the body which represents thousands of independent petrol stations has called for urgent discussions with ministers over Britain’s transport fuel crisis. In a letter to Energy Secretary Ed Davey, Brian Madderson of the Retail Motor Industry Federation (RMI) predicted that fuel shortages caused by last week’s panic buying could continue until at least the Easter weekend and possibly beyond as petrol stations struggle to restock. He also said the confidence of independent fuel retailers had been 'abruptly shaken' by the Government’s 'perceived inability' to manage the issue of a potential strike by tanker drivers. Can she fix this retail crisis? Even the Queen of Shops Mary Portas spent 30 minutes queuing for fuel at a petrol station in west London . Ongoing misery: Brian Madderson of the Retail Motor Industry Federation predicted that fuel shortages could continue until at least the Easter weekend and possibly beyond as petrol stations struggle to restock . 'Beyond the pale': Edmund King, the president of the AA, accused garages of profiteering from the fuel panic . However, Allan Davison, divisional director of . Hoyer, said he was 'very hopeful' a solution to the dispute would be . found and the strike would be headed off. 'It’s not in anyone’s . interest to have a strike - for ourselves, for the drivers, for the . members of the public and everyone else - so we’re hopeful we can get to . some sort of resolution,' he told ITV’s Daybreak programme. He also offered assurance that plans had been made for coping if a strike did go ahead. 'It . could be damaging but we along with other companies are looking at . contingency plans,' he said, adding: 'We’re working with the military to get . trained drivers in and that process at this point in time is working . very well for us.' The . Highways Agency said tomorrow night – Maundy Thursday – and Easter . Monday afternoon were likely to be the busiest over the Bank Holiday . weekend, especially on the main holiday routes, as people set out and . return from short breaks or day trips. Drivers and rail passengers also face delays and disruption from roadworks and engineering works, though both highways and rail bosses say this will be less than usual as repair work has been lifted. Several major rail routes will have restricted services, with engineering works taking place at London Liverpool Street and the main West Coast mainline shut at various times between Crewe, Liverpool or Preston and further north between Carlisle, Glasgow and Edinburgh. But train bosses say there will be fewer instances of buses replacing trains on the rail network this Easter compared with last Easter. On the roads, roadworks, lane restrictions and temporary speed limits will remain in place on 22 busy routes, including stretches of the M1 and M25. Just the beginning: This was the scene on the M40 on the first day of the Easter Getaway at the weekend. The Highways Agency said tomorrow night and Easter Monday afternoon were likely to be the busiest over the Bank Holiday weekend . But the Highways Agency said it had completed or suspended 90 per cent of roadworks on England’s motorways and major A-roads. Sites where roadworks will remain ‘for safety reasons’ include 22 miles of the M1 near Luton in Bedfordshire, an 11-mile stretch of the M25 near St Albans in Hertfordshire, 11 miles of the M4 near west London and 23 miles of the M62 near Leeds. Traffic information company INRIX said motorists heading for the West Country were likely to face the worst delays. In one piece of good news for travellers, planned strikes by ground staff at Stansted Airport over Easter were called off after peace talks.","Acas talks aimed at resolving fuel tanker drivers dispute start today .

An international man hunt was launched but Du managed to evade capture in Morocco - despite being arrested just five days after the killings. Moroccan police let him go because British police failed to let Interpol know he was a wanted man, it was claimed at the time. He was finally caught after the owner of the building site saw his picture in a local newspaper and called police. Mr Du's extradition was approved by the Moroccan Ministry of Justice and the Home Office in the UK and he was flown back from Casablanca yesterday afternoon.

"Settle back into a cosy chair and switch on the TV at 5.30pm tonight for a nine-hour knitting extravaganza. Norway is live streaming the prime-time hobby show in their attempt to air more sedate programs for their audience and British viewers will be able to tune in too. In an attempt to beat the world 'sheep to sweater' record, a team of Norwegian knitters will shear a ewe on live TV before spinning its wool and knitting a jumper in the shortest possible time. Knitting: Norway is live-streaming a nine-hour program on knitting with a four-hour segment solely on the hobby and a world record attempt . The previous record, held by Australia, is four hours and 51 minutes. Viewers can build up to the thrilling challenge by watching four hours of knitting know how before the record attempt. 'We'll just broadcast as long as they keep going. It should be a hit.' Rune Møklebust, head of programming at Norwegian public service broadcaster NRK said. This latest easy-watching TV program is the latest in the Norwegian concept of 'Slow TV' which was launched in 2009 when NRK showed the view from the roof of a seven-hour train ride from Bergen to Oslo, the Telegraph reports. 'It was the 100th anniversary of this route and we'd planned a couple of documentaries,' says Mr Møklebust. 'Then someone said, ""why not film the whole trip?"" We thought it would be something completely new … and cheap.' Jumpers: The program will include a 'sheep to sweater' world record where Norwegian yarn enthusiasts will attempt to beat the four-hour record set by Australia . Although he initially thought it was a good idea, Mr Møklebust did have second thoughts while it was being aired as it was on a Friday night and up against stiff competition like the X Factor and the Norwegian version of Have I Got News For You. But the mundane programming proved a hit. He explained: 'Miraculously, we got more viewers. All these people wrote in to say, ""I only meant to tune in for a minute but I watched for hours.""' Inspired by this success, Mr Møklebust subsequently positioned 11 cameras on the side of a cruise ship and broadcast the views throughout a five-and-a-half day journey along the Norwegian coast in 2011. The show attracted 3.2 million viewers and a 36 per cent share of Norway's TV viewing market. Since then, the channel has shown a 24-hour salmon fishing special, a 12-hour show about a fire being built and lit, and a 379-hour boat trip. Arve Hjelseth, a Sociologist from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, said: 'We're increasingly urban dwellers, so the mountains, fjords and coastline remind many Norwegians of where they come from. We're more stressed these days, too, so it's a time to relax as well as an antidote to modern TV, where camera angles shift every second. So called ""Slow-TV"" is strangely calming.'

"A US-led operation has disrupted an international crime ring that infected hundreds of thousands of PCs across the globe with malicious software that stole more than $100 million from businesses and members of the public since 2011. The Justice Department announced on Monday that anywhere between 500,000 and 1 million machines worldwide were affected by the virus's known as Gameover Zeus which stole banking passwords and Crytolocker, which encrypted files and blackmailed the users for their release. Among the victims of the cyber-attacks were Pittsburgh based Reinforced Plastics of Erie, which lost $373,000 in one money transfer and the Swansea, Massachusetts police department, which paid a $750 ransom after their computers were infected. Scroll down for video . Threat: U.S Deputy Attorney General James Cole announces two global cyber fraud disruptions of the Gameover Zeus and Cyrptolocker programs at the Department of Justice in Washington on June 2, 2014 . Other victims included a Florida bank that lost nearly $7 million through an unauthorized wire transfer. Authorities in nearly a dozen countries worked with private security companies to wrest control of the network of infected machines. 'These schemes were highly sophisticated and immensely lucrative, and the cyber criminals did not make them easy to reach or disrupt,' said Leslie Caldwell, who heads the Justice Department's criminal division, to a news conference. But while the grip of those behind the 'malware' has been weakened by the counter attack, computer experts said users must take this opportunity to install anti-virus software and update their operating systems to the latest versions to stop it regaining its hold. 'The criminals effectively held for ransom every private email, business plan, child's science project, or family photograph - every single important and personal file stored on the victim's computer,' Leslie Caldwell, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said at a news conference. Those who fail to do so risk having their valuable data, including precious photographs, music and personal files held to ransom. In the worst cases, victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained by the criminal network. The Gameover Zeus software, has spread worldwide but has been temporarily disabled by the international effort by law enforcement agencies. Potential victims can protect themselves but have only a short time to do so before the hackers rebuild the network. Hackers will be able to install new ones, but it is thought that there will be a window of opportunity of at least two weeks for computer users to protect themselves. Many of those whose computers have already been infected will be contacted by their internet service providers. The software installs itself on a computer when the victim clicks on a link in an unsolicited email or via a website. It then sends out more emails to lure further victims, without the knowledge of the computer users, and spreads quickly across the internet. In the worst cases, victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained . Could Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, pictured, be the behind the global cyber virus pandemic? He is the man suspected of being behind a gang that has sparked a global cyber virus pandemic. But the FBI has already spent years looking for Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev who uses the online names ‘lucky12345’ and ‘slavik’. The 30-year-old is already wanted for his alleged involvement in a ‘racketeering enterprise’ that installed malicious software known as ‘Zeus’ on victims’ computers. The software was used to capture bank account numbers, passwords, personal identification numbers, and other information needed to log into online banking accounts. The FBI believes Bogachev knowingly acted in a role as an administrator while others involved in the scheme conspired to distribute spam and phishing emails, which contained links to compromised websites. Victims who visited these web sites were infected with the malware, which Bogachev and others allegedly used to steal money from the victims’ bank accounts. This online account takeover fraud has been investigated by the FBI since the summer of 2009.Starting in September 2011, the FBI began investigating a modified version of the Zeus Trojan, known as Gameover Zeus (GOZ). It is believed GOZ is responsible for more than one million computer infections, resulting in financial losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars. On August 22, 2012, Bogachev was indicted under the nickname ‘lucky12345’ by a federal grand jury in the District of Nebraska on a number of charges including Bank Fraud, Conspiracy to Violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and Aggravated Identity Theft. On May 19, 2014, Bogachev was indicted in his true name by a federal grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania on charges of Conspiracy, Computer Fraud, Wire Fraud, Bank Fraud and Money Laundering. Then just days ago on May 30, a criminal complaint was issued in the District of Nebraska that ties the previously indicted nickname of ‘lucky12345’ to Bogachev and charges him with Conspiracy to Commit Bank Fraud. He is described as white with brown hair (though his head is usually shaved) and brown eyes. He is 5ft 9ins tall and weighs around 180 pounds (82kg). Bogachev was last known to live in Anapa, Russia. He is believed to enjoy boating and may travel to locations along the Black Sea in his boat. He also owns property in Krasnodar, Russia. The virus lays dormant until it spots an opportunity to steal personal details such as online banking information and passwords. It then transmits this information back to the criminal network who use it to drain the victim’s accounts. In a further twist, if the user is not a ‘viable’ victim then the software locks the information on the computer and holds it to ransom. Last night, the U.S. Justice Department filed papers accusing a Russian named Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev as being the leader of the gang behind the software. U.S. officials said Bogachev was last known to be living in the Black Sea resort town of Anapa. A civil suit in Pennsylvania helped authorities get court orders to seize parts of the infected network, and on May 7, Ukrainian authorities seized and copied Gameover Zeus command servers in Kiev and Donetsk, officials said. Potential victims can protect themselves but have only a short time to do so before the hackers - whose attempts have been temporarily thwarted - can rebuild their network. The US Department of Homeland Security urged users to install anti-virus software on their computer and ensure that the latest operating systems were also installed on their computers. If systems do not offer automatic updates, people should enable it, the department said. It also advised changing passwords, as original passwords may have been compromised during the infection. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security set up a website to help victims remove the malware, www.us-cert.gov/gameoverzeus. From that website, computer users can download tailored anti-virus software which has been provided for free. Experts have also warned users to back-up all valuable data. Many of those whose computers have already been infected will be contacted by their internet service providers. He faces criminal charges in Pittsburgh, where he was named in a 14-count indictment, and in Nebraska, where a criminal complaint was filed. He has not been arrested, but Deputy Attorney General James Cole said U.S. authorities were in contact with Russia to try to bring him into custody. Russia does not extradite accused criminals to other countries, so Bogachev may never be arrested. 'The criminals effectively held for ransom every private email, business plan, child's science project, or family photograph - every single important and personal file stored on the victim's computer,' Leslie Caldwell, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said at a news conference. The FBI called the alleged ringleader, 30-year-old Evgeniy Bogachev, one of the most prolific cyber criminals in the world and issued a 'Wanted' poster, pictuted, that lists his online monikers and describes him as a boating enthusiast . Officials say the case is another stark reminder of the evolving cybercrime threat, though it's unrelated to the recently unsealed cyber-espionage indictment of five Chinese military hackers accused of stealing trade secrets from American firms. Both sets of hackers relied on similar tactics - including sending emails to unsuspecting victims that installed malware - but the Chinese defendants were government officials who sought information that could bring companies in their country a competitive advantage. Bogachev's operation, prosecutors say, consisted of criminals in Russia, Ukraine and the United Kingdom who were assigned different roles within the conspiracy.

"Clinics are employing a ‘no questions asked’ approach to gender abortions, a Tory MP claimed yesterday. Sarah Wollaston accused a leading provider – the British Pregnancy Advisory Service – of misogyny for refusing to condemn doctors who help parents seeking to get rid of a girl. Dr Wollaston, who is also a GP, said: ‘This is about equality. It’s very harmful and we must be very clear that it’s illegal.’ ‘We should not be colluding with an attitude which says that having a girl, or in some cases having a boy, could in any way force someone to become mentally ill. Accusation: Dr Sarah Wollaston (left) accused Ann Furedi (right) of misogyny in her article last month . 'If I was seeing a patient who was in a distressed state because they felt they were under pressure from their family to abort a female foetus, I would be very concerned for them. ‘I certainly wouldn’t be colluding in a view that it was the right thing to do for them to go ahead with the termination.’ Ann Furedi, chief executive of BPAS, caused a storm last month by saying doctors are legally free to  terminate pregnancies when the parents are unhappy with the sex of their unborn child. Writing on the website Spiked, Mrs Furedi said: ‘A doctor agreeing to an abortion on grounds of rape would be breaking the law no more and no less than a doctor who agrees an abortion on grounds of sex selection. ‘While it is true that the sex of the foetus is not a legal ground for abortion, nor is rape, or incest, or being 13 years old.' Her comments followed the decision not to prosecute two doctors who agreed to arrange abortions – as part of a newspaper probe – for women who said they did not want girls. The Director of Public Prosecutions said there were grounds for charges but it would not be in the public interest to proceed. Mrs Furedi said that in ten years at BPAS, she had ‘never heard of a woman walking into clinic and  simply saying I want to have an abortion because I don’t want a girl or I don’t want a boy’. ‘Women who come into the clinics have a whole complex set of reasons why they may want to end the pregnancy and it may very well be that the circumstances of the pregnancy are very much a part of that, for whatever reason,’ she added. Pressure: Dr Wollaston warns a 'no questions asked' policy ignores the nuances of a woman's feelings . ‘The law at the moment works  reasonably well. So if a doctor believes that the woman’s request for an abortion for any reason is best for her, then the doctor can make that referral. ‘Now that to me makes sense, because the doctor believes that she is perhaps so distraught, so strung out, so completely distressed that it is better for her mental health for the doctor to refer her for an abortion.’ Speaking to the Mail, Dr Wollaston said: ‘No woman walks into a clinic and says I want to abort my child because of the sex. But there are times when you can get the sense that a woman is under pressure. ‘If you take a “no questions asked” view, then you are not going to understand that.’","Dr Sarah Wollaston, a Tory MP, blasted the CEO of British Pregnancy Advisory Service for condoning abortions on the grounds of gender .

"Achievement: Fred Butler, 106, was awarded his honorary diploma on Monday during an emotional ceremony attended by school officials, state lawmakers and Beverly Mayor Bill Scanlon . Fred Butler was married for 65 years, raised five children, served in the Army during World War II and worked for years for the local water department, but the fact he never earned a high school diploma always bothered him. Not anymore. The 106-year-old, from Beverly, Massachusetts, was awarded his honorary diploma on Monday during an emotional ceremony attended by school officials, state lawmakers and Beverly Mayor Bill Scanlon. 'I thank everybody who is responsible for this,' he said, wearing a mortar board hat and tassel and holding the prized document in his hands. 'I certainly appreciate it.' Butler dropped out of school before the ninth-grade to accept a full-time job at a print shop to support his mother and five younger siblings. Daughter-in-law Cathy Butler says he regretted dropping out and always emphasized the importance of education to his children and grandchildren. A grandson, Mike Calabro, said Butler gave him $5 for every A on his report card. Cathy Butler launched the effort to get her father-in-law his diploma as a way to raise his spirits following the death of his wife, Ruth, last year. Fred Butler's only concern was that he hadn't earned it. Scanlon put that concern to rest. 'It's a long time to wait for your diploma,' Scanlon said, 'but you've obviously earned it very well.'","Fred Butler from Beverly, Massachusetts, was awarded his honorary diploma on Monday .

"A wife staged two bank robberies in a bid to raise cash after hiding the loss of her job from her husband, a court heard today. Nicola Lehair took out pay day loans to cover her lack of income and made out to her husband Joel that she was still working. But she found herself under increasing pressure to pay back the loans and out of desperation hit on the idea of robbing a bank. Nicola Lehair, pictured, took out a series of payday loans so she would not have to tell her husband that she had lost her job . Lincoln Crown Court heard how she tried to hide her identity by putting a black cloak over head before walking up to the counter of the Yorkshire Bank in Grantham. Then she handed a note to the cashier which read 'Give me all the money from behind this counter. Don’t speak to anyone. Don’t look at anyone. Just give me the money. I do have a gun and will use it if necessary.' The female cashier initially thought the incident was a joke but when she realised that Lehair was serious she handed over a bundle of notes. Lehair, who did not utter a word throughout the raid, then made off with the £2,375. Lehair entered the Yorkshire Bank in Grantham wearing a black cape, left, and handed a note over to the cashier to hand over all the cash as she was armed, before calmly walking out of the branch with £2,375, right . Lehair claimed in the note handed over to a cashier that she was carrying a gun and would use it if necessary . Andrew Scott, prosecuting, said that 15 days later Lehair tried to carry out a second raid on a branch of Santander Bank in Grantham. Mr Scott said 'She wore sunglasses and a dark, peaked cap. She calmly waited her turn in the queue. When she reached the counter she handed over another note.' She again demanded money and threatened she had a gun but when the cashier hesitated she picked up her bag and walked out. Once outside she changed her top and removed the cap and sunglasses but we she was caught just 200 yards from the bank after an alert police officer spotted her carrying the distinctive drawstring bag she had while carrying out the hold-up. Mr Scott said 'She is of previous good character. These were pre-planned bank robberies which included the threat of lethal force targeting large sums of money. There were some efforts made to disguise her appearance.' Lehair,28, of Grantham, Lincs, admitted robbery on 30 April and attempted robbery on 15 May. She was jailed for two years. Lincoln Crown Court heard that 15 days later Lehair tried the same trick at the Santander branch in Grantham but left empty handed . Recorder Patrick Upward QC told her 'Offences of this kind inevitably lead to a prison sentence. 'I bear in mind you are a woman of good character and you were under considerable pressure. No weapon was used or produced.' Mark McNeil, defending, said: 'She had a good relationship with her husband but there were various issues. 'They ran their finances separately. He was responsible for certain  items and she was responsible for others. 'She lost her job in January but she maintained the impression she was still working by taking out a pay day loan. Her husband thought there was an income coming in and the pay day loan company was exerting pressure on her. 'She was looking on the internet at ways of making money and initially she put this idea out of her mind. 'This is out of character. She felt so desperate financially. She didn’t tell her husband. She felt in despair.' 'The money went towards paying off her debts. She is deeply remorseful. She knows she is going to lose her marriage and is going to lose her liberty.' Mr McNeil said that nine days after her arrest Lehair was offered a job as a book keeper for an organisation which runs care homes but that came too late to help her. 'Had she managed to keep herself going she would have been able to pay off her debts.' Det Insp Pete Grayson of Lincolnshire Police said “In 20 years as a police officer I have never dealt with a woman bank robber. It is rare to get someone with no previous convictions committing an offence as serious as this. 'I know she had financial pressures but millions of people in this country have financial pressures and they don’t resort to bank robbery.'","Nicola Lehair did not want to tell her husband that she had lost her job .

"A New Jersey police officer who helped a pregnant woman deliver her baby had the honor of having the child named after him. Cranford Police Officer Nelson Hearns went to assist 31-year-old Jody Copier who was in labor, five weeks from her due date. By the time he arrived she had passed out on the living room floor with the baby seconds away from being born. Scroll down for video... Hero: Officer Nelson Hearns helped a pregnant woman deliver her baby and had the honor of having the child named after him . Welcome to the world: Kace Nelson Kraft was born at 9:11 a.m on Sunday morming, weighing in at 4 pounds 1 ounce, in his parents living room! Ready to pop:  31-year-old Jody Copier was in labor by the time officer Nelson Hearns arrived on the scene . Quick delivery: The officer positioned and reassured Copier, and even grabbed a pillow and several towels to make sure she was comfortable. Within seconds, the baby was delivered . 'I was so early, I didn't think I was going to deliver a baby,' she told NBC News at the hospital. Officer Hearns, who has more than 11 years experience, saw that the baby's feet were coming first in a breech birth and the officer jumped right into action. He positioned and reassured Jody even grabbing a pillow and towels to make sure she was comfortable. Working with the baby's father, Scott Kraft, the newborn was delivered within seconds. Help at hand: Emergency medical technicians arrived within moments of the birth and transported the family to Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston . Jody Copier: I don't know what we would have done if Officer Hearns didn't get there so quick . Husband Scott Kraft and wife Jody: Kraft says he can't thank the officer enough . 'He sat right on the floor, and we started crying,' said Jody's husband, Scott Kraft. 'He had his eyes open, he was blinking.' 'I would never have expected to bring my little boy into my living room,' he said. 'For being here so early, and breeched birth, I just can't believe how strong and perfect this kid is.' Officer Hearns said he relied on his experience to recognize that the baby was in position for a breech birth, a rare and potentially dangerous delivery. 'Within 45 seconds he pulled the baby out,' Scott said. 'While I pushed, he pulled. It was nuts,' he told NJ.com. An ambulance arrived soon afterwards and took the family to Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston. He weighed 4 pounds 1 ounce. The boy, weighing 4 pounds 1 ounce, was named Kase Nelson Kraft, the middle name in honor of the officer who delivered him . Officer Hearns was excited to assist with the birth and happy that Kace will share his name . The family originally planned to give Kace the middle name William but decided the circumstances called for something special — the baby’s middle name is Nelson, in honor of the police officer who helped bring him into the world. 'He deserves it, without a doubt,' said Scott. Jody added, 'I don't know what we would have done if [Hearns] didn't get there so quick.' Cranford Police Chief James Wozniak had plenty of well wishes for the family and praise for his officer. 'This is a great job all around, and I’m thrilled that the result is a happy, healthy baby boy. This is the kind of thing my officers train for,' he noted. 'It is still rewarding to see the actions of a Cranford police officer having a positive impact on someone’s life. I’m incredibly proud of Officer Hearns and everyone else who was present.' The baby and mother are doing well, Kraft said. She is due home later today, and little Kace is out of an incubator and off intravenous fluids. Cranford Police Chief James Wozniak had plenty of well wishes for the family and praise for his officer. 'This is a great job all around, and I¿m thrilled that the result is a happy, healthy baby boy.' Though doctors originally said Kace could be in the hospital for months, they now plan to send the baby home in 10 days. Husband Scott says he can't thank the officer enough. 'He brought my new best friend into this world, and he is gonna be with me forever,' he said. 'It’s an honor and a blessing to be part of something special in their lives,' Officer Hearns said.","Officer Nelson Hearns was called to assit woman who was about to give birth in her living room .

"Updated: . 13:18 EST, 11 May 2012 . On the football pitch Thierry Henry was famous for his ability to exploit even the smallest weakness in the most fearsome defence and find the back of the net. And now it seems the same can be said for his off-field prowess after the ex-Arsenal player scored a last-minute winner over opponents of his dream home. Local planners have given the green-light to the French international’s plans to demolish his £6million mansion in order to rebuilt it with a giant three-storey fish tank. Footballer Thierry Henry's new house plan has angered his neighbours but now the plan for an aquarium (bottom left) will not go ahead . Actor Tom Conti, who is a neighbour of Henry's in Hampstead, north London, had led the attack. But the star skilfully defended the plan in documents presented to council bosses. And Camden council’s planning . committee voted nine to two in favour of Henry in the final few moments . of a meeting that lasted for more than three hours. Henry - the Gunners’ record goalscorer who now plays for the New York Red Bulls - did not attend the meeting. Camden councillor Jonathan Simpson . described the designs as ‘fantastic’, adding: ‘It is an outstanding . contribution to the borough.’ Flash home: Conti, whose garden backs on to . Henry's home, and seven others have urged planning officials halt the . proposal saying 'If someone wants a larger house why do they not just . buy one somewhere else?' Celebrity battle: Henry, left has been urged by neighbour Tom Conti, right, . to move out of his £6 million London home rather than demolish it for a . larger house to accommodate a monster 40ft fish tank . Mr Henry, 34, will now go ahead with . demolishing his current house and replace it . with the new design that will have a £250,000 fish tank holding 5,500 . gallons of water. Conti, the 70-year-old actor best known for his portrayal of Greek taverna owner Costas in the film Shirley Valentine, claimed the building of the house would cause massive disruption and was not suited to the area. Henry argues that his house, built in 1999, has aged badly and is not fit for purpose as a family home. ‘Its interior spaces are cramped, . deteriorated and commercial in feel, with low ceilings, narrow rooms and . poor daylight,’ according to papers submitted to the council by Montagu . Evans, the agents acting on his behalf. The row in leafy Hampstead has been brewing since February, when French footballer Henry applied for planning permission. Plans: Henry intends to rebuild his Hampstead home, although the original architect Sir Richard MacCormac is opposed to the demolition . Made up of four separate containers, . one for each storey of the house, his proposed £250,000 tank would take . 5,500 gallons of water to fill, house 300 fish and cost £12,000 a year . to run, making the super-size aquariums owned by the likes of Madonna, . the Beckhams and Premier League footballer Stephen Ireland look like . tiddlers. The French footballer – who fronted . the ‘va-va-voom’ TV adverts for car firm Renault – is the latest in a . long line of celebrities to take an interest in flashy fish tanks. Madonna, the Beckhams, Cher and . Premier League footballers Stephen Ireland, Joe Hart and Micah Richards, have all splashed out on opulent fish tanks. Ireland has reportedly spent more . than £100,000 on his 13ft aquarium, and is now believed to be planning a . shark tank under his kitchen floor. It has been suggested that the celebrity obsession with aquariums may not be just about a fondness for fish. One tank designer, who asked not to be . named, said: ‘Our client list tends to be male-dominated and they are . looking for status symbols and showpieces.’ Henry bought his house in 2001 when he was married to model Claire Merry. The couple divorced in 2007. But he is understood to be keen to . maintain his London base to be close to their young daughter, Tea. His . new home would also include a swimming pool and gym.

Henry’s new home is expected to take . about six months to complete. Before news of the successful planning application Mr Conti said: ‘They’ll be drilling into the basement and it’ll go on for months and months. 'There are a lot of retired people round here or people like me who work from home – I write – and it’s a terrible disturbance.‘Why do they have to knock it down? I’ve never met Thierry Henry and I’ve got nothing against the man at all. I’m sure he’s a very nice man and he’s welcome to build whatever he likes. But please not here, not next to me, with all the noise.’ Conti added: ‘This used to be a wonderful place to live, but in the last ten years there’s been endless, endless building.’They’ll be drilling into the basement and . it’ll go on for months and months. Trading is only permitted under strict Government regulations. The house’s original architect, Sir . Richard MacCormac, a former chairman of the Royal Institute of British . Architects, opposed Henry’s application. He said the house has ‘good daylighting and is in good condition but appears not to have been well maintained’. Influential civic group the Heath and . Hampstead Society had also called for the application to be thrown out, . saying the design of the new house ‘has no style or elegance’.","Planners have given ex-Arsenal striker green light to demolish his £6million mansion in .

"A 'devastated' couple were forced to remove a 6,000 gallon pond from their garden after 200 of their prized fish worth a total of £10,000 were eaten by an otter. Linda and Alan Brown, both 60, said the huge pond in the garden of their home in Thetford, Norfolk, which contained about 150 goldfish and 50 other fish, was the talk of the local neighbourhood. Wildlife including ducks, herons, kingfishers, frogs, newts and even snakes would visit the pond, and children would feed the goldfish, koi carp, mirror carp and ghost carp - some weighing up to 25lbs. Removed: Linda Brown (centre in white top and brown trousers) looks at the pond in Thetford, Norfolk, where children would feed the goldfish, koi carp, mirror carp and ghost carp - some weighing up to 25lbs . But when the couple returned home after a month-long visit to see their daughter in New Zealand last week they found that an otter had treated itself to a free meal. Their neighbour had been left to clear up the half-eaten, rotting fish that were left sprawled on the decking around the pond, which has now been removed to avoid giving the otter any more to eat. Mrs Brown said: ‘People would come and bring their children to see all the fish and the wildlife. It was devastating for us because they were so beautiful and had been a part of our life for 25 years. ‘We had a good fence around the pond, a net over the top, but there is no way you could stop an otter getting in. We will not see the same wildlife visiting our garden anymore.

But Mrs Brown felt that not enough was done to let people know about the cash and she feels that more needs to be done to educate other pond owners.

We need proper protection. ‘Otters are cute, they really are, especially when they are lying on their backs and playing with the fish.

"David Cameron’s former university college has been hit by an outbreak of mumps, it has emerged. Students at Brasenose College in Oxford started to fall ill with the virus last week, just as summer exams began. This afternoon, the University has said 17 students at the college - where Prime Minster David Cameron studied - have been affected. Students at Brasenose College in Oxford (pictured) started to fall ill with the virus last week, just as summer exams began, and it is thought at least 30 students have been affected by the highly infectious virus . A university nurse confirmed the outbreak . by sending a message to all undergraduates warning about the highly . infectious virus - which causes painfully inflamed glands and swelling. In some cases, mumps can lead to viral meningitis if it moves into the outer layer of the brain. It can be especially dangerous for men - as it can cause swelling of the testicles which can affect fertility. Despite the outbreak, the Junior College Room still held a boozy ‘bop’ - a party at the hall for around 100 students on Saturday. College entertainment officer Liam Langley sent an email to all the students reminding them about the party. His email was sent just two days after College Nurse Kate Tempest warned students about the mumps outbreak. Mr Langley’s email said: ‘Hey everyone. Just a reminder that despite the mumps situation the arts week bop will still be taking place tonight [Saturday]. ‘The theme is literary characters and as usual proceedings will start dtb [down the bar] before moving over to the new Babylove, the castle tavern, at around 11. ‘It promises to be a great end to arts week and I hope to see you all there!’ A university nurse sent a message to all undergraduates warning about the highly infectious virus - which causes painfully inflamed glands and swelling - last Thursday . One third-year English student, who asked not to be named, described the outbreak as a ‘crisis’. They said: ‘It’s absolutely ridiculous. ‘We got an email from the college nurse telling everyone to be wary of mumps and then two days later we had a massive party. ‘This place is like a ghost town - so many people have either gone home because they don’t want to get sick, or are lying in bed ill. ‘This is exam season - these are the most important exams of my life, so I really don’t want to get ill. Prime Minister David Cameron is just one of many famous former Brasenose students . ‘It’s so irresponsible for the JCR not to cancel the bop on Saturday night. ‘I didn’t go but I know quite a few people that went and have now come down with mumps. ‘There are about 200 people at the college and I reckon at least 30 are already ill. ‘It’s a crisis - if any final year students get ill now, they may have to wait a year to take their final exams. ‘I don’t want to have to do that - we should have a quarantine, rather than more parties.’ Cases of mumps have also been confirmed at St Hilda’s and Corpus Christi colleges, both in Oxford. In an email to Corpus students, the welfare dean Judith Maltby wrote: ‘It has been brought to our attention that there are several cases of mumps within the University and there have been two confirmed cases within Corpus. ‘If it is confirmed that you have the virus you will be encouraged to go home (where possible) for five days.’ Oxford University said today: 'There have been 17 cases of mumps reported at Brasenose College, Oxford, over the last five days and all students are being cared for at home or in the College. 'The College is working with the college nurse and doctors and taking advice from Health Protection Agency to ensure that the best advice and information is provided to students, including the signs and symptoms to look out for. 'The College is advising any students who suspect they might have mumps-like symptoms to stay in their room and phone the college nurse or GP for advice.' They refused to comment on about the party organised by the JCR mumps-hit Brasenose College. The Prime Minister is just one of many . famous former Brasenose students who also include Monty Python comedian . Michael Palin and Olympic rower Andrew Lindsay. Mumps, as well as measles and rubella, . is vaccinated against using the MMR jab. A full course of the MMR . vaccine requires two jabs. The . vaccine was first introduced in the UK in 1988 as a single injection . for children under the age of one - with the necessity for a second . injection only becoming apparent eight years later in 1996. The second jab is administered between the ages of three and five. Taking this in to account, this means some of the older students at the college are at a heightened risk of getting mumps. In . 1998, a paper claiming there was a link between the vaccine and autism . was published by Dr Andrew Wakefield. A . great number of parents therefore decided their children should not . receive the vaccine. Their children would be around the age of 16 now. According to statistics released by the Health Protection Agency, the percentage of MMR uptake in the UK fell from 88.3 per cent in 1998 to a low of 79.9 per cent in 2003. Andrew . Wakefield's work has since been completely discredited, however. He has . been struck off the register as a medical professional in the UK in 2010. Studies since have not found any such link between the vaccine and autism or bowel disease.","Outbreak of highly infectious mumps virus at Brasenose College in Oxford .

Dated May 30 1915 - it was written to his brother Frank, the day before he was due to land in Gallipoli . But Lennon never saw Dublin again. He was killed in action almost exactly one month later. The ceremony was held in the only First World War cemetery to honour the fallen from both sides, St Symphorien military cemetery near Mons. Historian Dan Snow narrated as a series of readings and poetry were delivered to honour the fallen from British, Irish, Commonwealth and German forces. He said: 'One hundred years ago today – on the 4th August 1914 – Britain and Germany were at war. 'Now, a century later, we gather in peace to commemorate this anniversary, and to remember the cost of war.'

Within weeks of Britain declaring war on Germany, the two nations' forces clashed outside Mons, leading to some 1,600 British casualties and 2,000 German. The land at St Symphorien was gifted to the German army by a Belgian landowner, with the proviso that both sides be treated with equal respect.","Letter by Private Michael Lennon, of 1st Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers to his brother Frank .

"Ross Campbell allegedly made one student bend over his knee as he spanked him and told him he had been 'a naughty boy' A professor of music at one of Britain’s top drama schools spanked students and asked one to call him daddy during private tuition lessons for his own sexual kicks, a court has heard. Ross Campbell allegedly made one student bend over his knee as he spanked him and told him he had been 'a naughty boy', and was said to have reduced another to tears after thrashing his buttocks following a poor rendition of Being Alive from the musical Company. The 56-year-old head of music at the prestigious . Guildford School of Acting (GSA), is accused of sexually abusing three . adult male pupils who had come to his home for one-to-one singing . tuition between 2003 and 2011. He denies four counts of indecent assault and a further seven counts of sexual assault while working at GSA, which is linked to the University of Surrey - and whose alumni include Brenda Blethyn OBE, Michael Ball and Bill Nighy. Prosecutor Brian Stork told the jury of seven women and five men that Campbell was one of the most senior tutors with a great deal of responsibility. He explained that he had links to the Royal Academy of Music and had performed both in this country and abroad. Mr Stork said: 'Students trained with Ross Campbell because he had a reputation, a reputation of being an outstanding teacher, somebody very skilled in his art, somebody in who students placed a great deal of trust, somebody with whom they hoped to enjoy a professional relationship.' 'The difficulty we suggest is that this defendant overstepped the mark somewhat and allowed the personal to overlap the professional. 'Somebody who engaged in a number of practices that he may say were intended to help students develop either personally or as a singer or a performer but which we say reached a point of sexual abuse. 'This gentleman over-powered three individuals to enable himself to get a kick for his own sexual gratification, employing certain methods that were wholly inappropriate.' The court was told that Campbell was the 'go to' teacher for singing and it was known that if students wanted to develop their skills they could approach him for private tuition. Mr Stork told the jury that it was not uncommon or unusual for singing teachers to touch students’ anatomy during a lesson but would ask the student first. He said that one victim described Campbell’s technique as 'unusual' and 'rather touchy-feely.' The school's well known alumni include actor and singer Michael Ball and Bill Nighy . The court heard that during one . tuition session he touched the man’s bottom while hugging him and in . another grabbed his backside while accompanying him on the piano. 'That is not part of giving a singing lesson,' Mr Stork told the jury. 'That is not part of appropriate behaviour for teaching an adult male student.' On . another occasion it is claimed that the same student, who cannot be . named for legal reasons, was taking part in a private lesson when . Campbell told him he was a 'naughty boy' and said he deserved to be . punished before inviting him to bend over his knee and be spanked. He . later sent the same student an email of a young boy screaming as he was . being spanked while wearing little clothing, it was said. The man said the teacher . told him to call him 'Daddy' and also offered to give him a massage - . but that he needed to be completely naked. Campbell allegedly made the comments after inviting the student - then aged 19 or 20 years - to his home for lessons. Actress Brenda Blethyn - who currently stars in ITV's detective drama, Vera - also attended the prestigious college . The . student said at first he laughed off the spanking comments but even as . the situation developed and he believed his teacher was being . inappropriate, he went along with it because he trusted Campbell. He . said the inappropriate touching started when he began taking classes . with Campbell in his second year at the school, in 2003, when Campbell . would touch him to demonstrate the muscles used to support breathing. His previous teacher had not done anything of the kind. In . his interview the man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, told . officers: 'Looking back I think of how things started, how he would . always say: ""You’re quite naughty. You need to be spanked"". 'I thought he was just joking. I just laughed at it. 'He mentioned that a few times. I never thought he was going to spank me. 'It looks foolish, looking back, because he would ask me to lay over his lap. 'I asked: ‘""Why would you want me to do that?"" and he said: ""Because you are naughty and you need to be spanked"". 'I trusted him. I thought he knew what he was doing.' He . said when he went to Campbell’s home for the lessons he would find the . teacher had prepared dinner, which he would eat because he did not want . to appear rude. Campbell . would mention his naughtiness and spanking and would also talk to him . about his home life and his difficult relationship with his father. 'That’s how I let my guards (sic) down,' he said. 'We would talk about our private lives. He would ask me to give him a hug. 'At times I would ask him ""why would you want me to hug you?"" and he would say something like ""it’s just affection. It’s ok"". He was grabbing my a*** some of the time, which I didn’t feel comfortable with.' The 56-year-old head of music at the prestigious Guildford School of Acting (GSA), in on trial at Guildford Crown Court (pictured) accused of sexually abusing three adult male pupils who had come to his home for one-to-one singing tuition between 2003 and 2011 . He said Campbell would appear reluctant when he tried to get him to give him the planned singing lesson. 'He would ask me to come closer to him and would take advantage to smack my bottom,' the man told police. Despite his reservations the student continued to trust Campbell but would not comply with all of his requests. He said: 'At one point he would say I need a massage and I needed to be totally naked and he would massage me. 'I refused and I remember him saying I was wrong to refuse, that it was totally wrong. 'That was the last time I went to his house because it made me feel really, really uncomfortable. 'If you were asking somebody to be totally naked, you are heading somewhere quite obvious.' He denies four counts of indecent assault and a further seven counts of sexual assault while working at GSA, which is linked to the University of Surrey . The . man said that seven years later, as he completed a Master’s Degree, he . had once again gone to Campbell’s home and he said the teacher told him . he needed to be spanked over the dinner table. He said he told Campbell that it was totally unrelated, which Campbell accepted, and then they moved on to another subject. The alleged victim recalled asking others in his class about spanking as a method used in singing coaching. A . classmate told him it would be completely inappropriate. The course . leader, Chris Palmer, heard of the conversation and called him to her . office to discuss it, he told police. He . said: 'She asked me how I mentioned spanking in class and where I had . that perspective (from) and whether it was Ross Campbell who taught me . this. 'I said: ‘Yes, that’s the only teacher who did this to me’. 'She made it absolutely clear it was inappropriate and was an act that could be considered sexual abuse.' Mr Stork said that when Campbell was arrested police found material on his computer relating to spanking and corporal punishment. The second victim told police that Campbell had put his hands inside his trousers during a singing lesson, without permission. The final middle-aged alleged victim was urged to take private lessons with the snowy-haired defendant after being accepted on a Masters Degree course in the Practice of Voice & Singing. It is claimed he told this student that he was going to have to work exceedingly hard if he was going to achieve anything and he would require a great deal of discipline. 'What he wasn’t expecting was that the discipline would include some pretty painful spankings,' said Mr Stork. As part of the sessions Campbell was constantly putting the vulnerable student down and belittling him, said the prosecutor. The jury was told that he thrashed the man with his hand across the buttocks after a particularly poor performance of the song Being Alive from the musical Company. The spanking was quite painful and the victim started to cry. On another occasion Campbell touched him inappropriately during a session. The student initially did not report what had happened over fear that he would be thrown off the course. When Campbell, of Farnborough, Hampshire, was arrested he made no comment in interview and handed officers a prepared statement. He denied doing anything wrong and claimed that he had not done anything without the consent of the other party or that was not a legitimate singing technique. He denied at any point being turned on or aroused sexually. The trial in front of Judge Neil Stewart at Guildford Crown Court is expected to last seven days. Campbell sat in the dock following proceedings with the help of a hearing loop. The trial continues.

"He said in an interview: 'What funds greyhound racing and horse racing? Retail betting' The boss of William Hill has conceded that clusters of betting shops can cause harm and alienate local communities. Ralph Topping, chief executive of Britain’s biggest bookmaker, said he understood why people objected to new shops opening on their high streets and had seen ‘stark examples’ of their impact. He has even proposed giving licensing authorities extra powers to block new shops if they believe there will be a damaging ‘cumulative impact’. It appears to be a significant concession to the growing chorus of campaigners and MPs calling for new regulations for the sector amid fierce criticism of casino-style gaming machines. Dubbed the ‘crack cocaine of gambling’, these machines, called fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTS), allow punters to spend £100 per spin on roulette games. They generate around half the total revenue of betting shops and have been blamed for an escalation in problem gambling and allegations of aggressive tactics to market them at new customers. Campaigners say clusters of betting shops in one area make it easier to circumvent the rules which only allow four FOBT machines per shop - by opening another shop next door. Mr Topping, who has spent 40 years at the firm, made the admission as industry leaders are under pressure to make proposals to the government this week for how to increase player protection from gaming machines. He said in an interview: ‘I’m against betting shop clustering on social grounds. I can see for myself some pretty stark examples of this and I can see why people might raise localised objections. ‘Betting shops have always been part of the community, but when the situation starts to alienate communities the industry needs to listen and politicians need to act. We think a ‘cumulative impact’ test would be lawful and could be sensibly applied by licensing authorities.’ Anti-gambling campaigners are pushing for ministers to go much further by slashing the stakes for these machines from £100 to £2, but the bookmakers are anxious to head off such a move. But Ralph Topping, the boss of William Hill, Britain's largest bookmaker, has defended them on the grounds that the money they make supports other, more traditional types of gambling . Mr Topping, who earned £1.9million last year, told the Racing Post he ‘totally rejects’ restricting particular products. He claims it would ‘do nothing to reduce gambling-related harm’ and the resulting closures of betting shops would have a major impact on horse racing. Until the 2005 Gambling Act was passed, betting shops were subject to a ‘demand test’ - under which they had to convince licensing magistrates there was an unsatisfied demand for a new bookmakers by getting locals to back their application. 'Epidemic': Ed Miliband has demanded more powers to crack down on betting terminals . Labour’s Ed Miliband has called for local authorities to have powers to review existing licences and allow communities to decide to reduce the number of FOBTs - which first appeared in 2001. He said they are ‘spreading like an epidemic’ on Britain’s high streets. In Newham, London, there are 87 betting shops with 348 machines. In Liverpool there are 153 betting shops with around 559 FOBTs. David Cameron said he shared concerns over the machines. Mr Topping, backed by Betfred chairman Fred Done, is now backing a new ‘cumulative impact’ test, similar to the one used for alcohol licensing. This would allow shops to be rejected by planners if they cause ‘social, economic or community concerns.’ But it is understood Paddy Power, which has 150 shops in the UK but is planning to expand heavily, is not in favour, saying it would be anti-competitive. William Hill have 2,400 of the 9,000 existing betting shops. Adrian Parkinson of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling said Mr Topping was ‘trying to fool people’. He said: ‘Companies of the size of William Hill, Ladbrokes and Betfred would not be bothered by a new test. It would only increase the value of their betting shops in an area as no one would be able to open in competition to them. ‘It also wouldn’t solve the problem of local authorities who want to reject a betting shop facing the threat of expensive legal action from the bookmaker. 'William Hill in particular is the cause of clustering in many areas. What Topping is proposing is a watered down measure that would not provide any greater powers to local authorities. It shouldn’t even be considered.’","Chief executive Ralph Topping said he understood objections .

"A motorist narrowly escaped death after a lightning bolt sent part of a tree hurtling towards the spot he was stood just five seconds earlier.

"James Coney, Money Mail editor and Southampton supporter, assesses the rise-and-rise of the South Coast club, third in the Premier League table, after seven games. I admit it, if I look back to the state Southampton were in over the summer, I was desperate. Mauricio Pochettino had quit, Rickie Lambert was gone already, Adam Lallana was following Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers was practically out of the door and Morgan Schneiderlin was at the centre of a transfer tug-of-war. ‘Where was the message of hope and stability from the board?’ I cried. The previous season where the side had finished eight playing glorious passing football had finished full of optimism. The new one would start full of dread. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Koeman praising Pelle impact . Graziano Pelle and Ronald Koeman are presented with the player and manager of the month awards . Pelle celebrates after scoring against Newcastle in their thumping 4-0 win back in September . Saints fans were split. Many thought as I did, others pleaded for calm - though quite what shred of hope they were clinging on to other than blind footballing loyalty was beyond me. So it’s barely credible that 60 days later Saints are sitting third in the table and to top it all striker Graziano Pelle has been handed the player of the month award and Ronald Koeman is manager of the month. If ever there was a moment things should fall apart, this is probably it! Per game Southampton have conceded fewer goals, made more tackles and more crosses than any other team in the league. Only Arsenal have had fewer shots against them. Saints run of games has helped. Liverpool on the opening day was followed by West Brom, West Ham, Newcastle, Swansea and QPR. Victor Wanyama is mobbed by team-mates after scoring at Newcastle. The Saints are third in the league table . Morgan Schneiderlin wanted to leave in the summer, but his decision to stay was monumental for the club . The only black mark was the disappointing capitulation at White Hart Lane. Koeman’s appointment was a masterstroke. People talk of ‘The Southampton Way’ – a focus on developing youngsters and playing attractive football. But he’s added a self-belief, possibly passed on from his own legendary reputation as a player, which has given the team more grit than last year. Alongside him has been the addition of some excellent players, particularly the Serb Dusan Tadic. I’m delighted for Pelle – his match-winning overhead kick against QPR was the kind of spectacular finish that has been a rarity on the south coast since Matt Le Tissier retired. VIDEO Koeman praises Pelle impact . Koeman has added a self-belief likely to passed on from his own legendary reputation as a player . But it’s the more defensive players that deserve much of the praise, not least Schneiderlin. His decision to stay was monumental, if a little controversial. He was the heart of the team last year, and has proved the right person to build the new look side around. Competition for places has helped, too. Schneiderlin, Jack Cork (who I remain convinced is the most-underrated player in the country), Victor Wanyama, Steven Davis and, when fit, James Ward-Prowse are battling it out for limited midfield places. Nathaniel Clyne has developed into the player Saints fans knew he would, scoring goals and forcing himself in to the England squad. And they’re saying it quietly down at St Mary’s, but things could get even better. New signing Saido Mane seems a bit of a maverick, but one with bags of potential still to be seen. There is more to come from centre back Toby Alderweireld, and it barely seems possible that all this has been achieved without Jay Rodriguez, who will be like having a new signing when he returns from a long injury lay-off. The real test of what kind of season will be what happens at the end of November when over nine games Saints face Manchester United and Arsenal twice, Chelsea, Man City and Everton. Everything is rosy on the south coast – if only we’d beaten Pochettino’s Spurs side a fortnight ago, things would have seemed very sweet indeed!","Southampton fans had little hope at the start of the season .

"Married Catholic couples who attend church at least once a week have better sex than other demographics, according to the Family Research Council. The Council, which is a socially conservative Christian group, presented its findings in a talk entitled  'Porn in the Dorm: The Impact of Pornography on College Campus Life' at the Center for the Advancement of Catholic Higher Education Wednesday in Washington DC. The revelation was heavily based upon a 1992 University of Chicago study, the National Health and Social Life Survey, as well as other data. Wedded bliss: A Christian group says that Catholic married couples have more frequent and fulfilling sex . The 21-year-old study actually found that the most enjoyable and most frequent sex occurring among married people was between those who attended church weekly (any church, not only Catholic) and people who had the least sexual partners. 'Those who worship God weekly have the best sex,' said Patrick Fagan, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council and a former George H.W. Bush official at the event. 'I want to see this on the cover of Playboy sometime.' US News reports that an audience member . asked Fagan whether it's dangerous to be guaranteeing Catholics great . sex if they abstain until marriage. Guilt-free: According to recent studies, Catholics feel a distinct lack of guilt about having sex before marriage . Fagan replied that married Catholic couples will have the best sex of their lives - because it's the only sex they'll ever know. Or is it? According to a recent YouGov study, when British Catholics were polled on whether they would feel guilty about four different sexual activities - premarital sex, extramarital sex, using pornography and using contraception - only 14 per cent of the Catholic respondents said they would. This compares to 16 per cent of all religious people (of any faith) and three per cent of non-religious people, according to the survey, which was commissioned for the 2013 series of the Westminster Faith Debates. Big family: Despite the Catholic Church's teaching 12 per cent of Catholics would not feel guilty about using contraception . Catholics have long touted their sexual superiority, and due to the Pope's stance on contraception, they've got the families to prove it. However, the YouGov study found that only 12 per cent of practising Catholics would feel guilty about using contraception. Sex and religion: Catholics are feeling less guilty about perceived 'sins' surronding sex than ever before . An Amazon search on the subject of Catholic sex search brings up 2,552 results (however, many among them are about Catholic church sex abuse scandals), among them Holy Sex!: A Catholic Guide to Toe-Curling, Mind-Blowing, Infallible Loving by Gregory K. Popcak PhD, Sex: The Catholic Experience by priest Andrew Greeley and The Catholic Girl's Guide to Sex by Kathleen Murray. Greeley's book, written in 1994, also contains some interesting statistics about the sex lives of Catholics. According to Greeley, despite the Church's teachings, 80 per cent of devout Catholic women approve of sex for pleasure alone. Nine out of 10 don't think contraception is wrong and 66 per cent of single Catholics have sex, compared to 57 per cent of Protestants. These figures don't quite support the conservative Family Research Council viewpoint. The Council cautioned its Christian audience on Wednesday that some of the side effects of sexual deviance, such as watching pornography, include poverty, domestic abuse, crime, drug addiction and losing your job. The US News reports that Fagan invoked some ancient history to support his case against couples using pornography: 'What we have here is a pagan sexuality. Homosexuality, infidelity, euthanasia, infanticide - these were all common sexual practices of pagan Rome. Christians were for being very different, for being monogamous, faithful.' The Family Research Council, which lobbies against LGBT rights, abortion, divorce, embryonic stem-cell research and pornography, was classified as an anti-gay hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2010. Fagan told the audience members that the group is trying to gather more recent data on religious sexual enjoyment.","A Christian group says married Catholic couples have better sex than other demographics .

"The Vatican has renewed its opposition to assisted dying as parliament considers giving the terminally ill a right to end their lives. On Friday, former Labour Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer's Bill on the issue will come before the House of Lords for a second reading. The Bill proposes allowing doctors to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to terminally ill patients judged to have less than six months to live. Despite acknowledging the motives behind the idea were 'on the surface, compassionate', senior Catholics today warned against the move. Pope Francis has said ill health is not a reason to 'eliminate a person' and his views were reiterated today . Vatican spokesman Father Thomas Rosica (left) made the latest comments before a Bill by former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer (right) is due to go before the House of Lords . Deputy Vatican spokesman Father Thomas Rosica said in a statement: 'The terrible truth is that it is the strong who decide the fate of the weak; human beings therefore become instruments in the hands of other human beings.' He warned that legalising assisted dying would put pressure on those who are no longer economically productive and said exaggerated consumerism had 'infiltrated' society. He added: 'Ageing populations, especially in the west, and resulting smaller workforces are now creating a market push towards euthanasia.' Quoting Saint John Paul II, he said: 'A right to die will inevitably give way to the duty to die.' Earlier this year Pope Francis denounced of the 'tyranny' of capitalism, which he said risks creating a 'throwaway culture' where the economically unproductive people like the elderly and disabled are no longer valued. He said: 'In our society there is a tyrannical dominance of an economic logic that excludes and at times kills, and of which nowadays we find many victims, starting with the elderly'. 'Poor health and disability are never a good reason to exclude or, worse, eliminate a person,' he said. The Church of England appears divided over the issue, with current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby (left) voicing opposition while former church leader, Lord Carey (right), saying the move is not 'anti-Christian' The issue has being widely discussed in Britain since former Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Carey, wrote that helping someone who is in great pain to die was in keeping with Christian beliefs. He said it was not anti-Christian to believe terminally ill people should be allowed to die with dignity. But the current Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has voiced his opposition to the bill to legalise assisted dying. Archbishop Welby spoke of his fears that it would leave a 'sword of Damocles' hanging over the elderly, putting them under pressure to end their lives. Sir Chris Woodhead, the former chief inspector of schools who is now a quadriplegic, has given  his backing to Lord Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill. He believes the proposals are ‘about right’ and in tune with public opinion. He said the Falconer law would allow doctors who help suffering patients to die to be free from the threat of prosecution or career disaster. Sir Chris Woodhead supports Lord Falconer's Bill . He said: 'They would have the option and they would know that they were not going to be prosecuted under any circumstance.' Sir Chris made his reputation challenging the educational establishment over school standards in the 1990s. He was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2006 and subsequently told he has cancer and other complications. He told Sky News this week that the decision to end one’s life 'must be a matter for consideration within the family and arguably with close friends as well'. ‘I wouldn't dream of proceeding with the decision to kill myself or to have my death assisted without the acceptance of those who are nearest and dearest to me,’ he said. He added that the Falconer proposals are 'about right, given the range of public opinion on this issue' and said the alternatives are 'bleak'. 'It would be far better if I could have my death assisted in a peaceful, dignified way so that my suffering wasn't prolonged,' he said.","Bill to allow doctors to end lives of terminally ill due to be discussed .

"England midfielder Fabian Delph may need surgery after suffering a shoulder injury during a freak training ground fall. Paul Lambert will be without his key player for the trip to Everton and medical checks are being undertaken to determine whether he misses the next two games for Roy Hodgson as well. England play Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley on November 15, then welcome Scotland three days later in a friendly. Fabian Delph, seen pictured challenging for the ball with David Silva, will miss Aston Villa's trip to Everton . Delph impressed in midfield during England's narrow win in Estonia last week . Lambert was unable to say if Delph had dislocated his shoulder, which usually takes four weeks to heal, but described the blow as a ‘nightmare’. ‘Nobody was near him when he did it,’ said the Villa manager. ‘He fell on his shoulder and we need to get it checked out.’ Lambert could not rule out the possibility that Delph might have to need an operation once his medical team have established the extent of the injury. He added: ‘We don’t know how bad it is or whether resting it for a couple of weeks is enough.’ Asked if surgery could be required, Lambert said: ‘We don’t know. That’s up to the medical people.’ Injury-hit Christian Benteke has not featured for Aston Villa since last season . Villa skipper Ron Vlaar is expected to return to the starting line-up for the game at Everton . The accident is untimely for Delph, who has been in excellent form this season and established himself in the national side. More positive news for Villa is that captain Ron Vlaar looks certain to be fit to start at Goodison. The Holland international has missed the last four games with a calf problem but is set to win his race against time to face Everton. Lambert desperately needs him back after Philippe Senderos suffered a thigh injury on international duty with Switzerland. Christian Benteke is close to starting his first match in six months on Saturday having had no reaction as he recovers from his ruptured Achilles. The Belgium striker had 20 minutes as a substitute against Manchester City and played in a behind-closed-doors friendly against Leicester during the international break. 'He’s feeling a lot healthier after a long time out,’ said Lambert.","Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert described the incident as an 'awkward fall'

"Dominique Strauss-Kahn slept with the mother of a woman who claims the former IMF boss tried to rape her, it emerged yesterday. Anne Mansouret admitted that  she had sex with Mr Strauss-Kahn in 2000, saying her fellow socialist ‘took me with the vulgarity of a soldier’  while they were both supposed to  be working. Miss Mansouret, 65, is the mother of 32-year-old writer Tristane Banon, who has alleged that Strauss-Kahn assaulted her in 2003 as she tried to interview him. 'Tryst': Dominique Strauss-Kahn 'had brutal sex' with former colleague Anne Mansouret, the mother of attempted-rape claimant Tristane Banon . The latest revelation in one of the most squalid cases in French political history emerged in the country’s press. The alleged sexual encounter happened . in the offices of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and . Development, where Strauss-Kahn, now 64, was working as a special . adviser. Miss Mansouret’s claims were made to . police last week when she was interviewed as a witness in her daughter’s . allegations of attempted rape against Strauss-Kahn. 'Rutting chimpanzee': Tristane Banon claims Strauss-Kahn tried to rape her . She is said to have told officers that she and Strauss-Kahn had ‘consensual but brutal’ sex. Miss Mansouret, a radical feminist . with three marriages and scores of lovers in her past, has admitted that . she was happy to have sex with a man known in France as the ‘Great . Seducer’. However, she admitted, she ‘never wanted to repeat the experience’. She told police: ‘He doesn’t try to please women, but simply to possess them.’ Miss Mansouret, a socialist party . regional official, is said to have kept the encounter secret until her . daughter told her in February 2003 that Strauss-Kahn had tried to rape . her when she went to interview him for a book she was writing. Miss Mansouret said she was so . ‘incensed’ that she went to see  Strauss-Kahn’s former wife Brigitte . Guillemette, who later challenged him over the attack. Strauss-Kahn is then said to have . admitted: ‘I don’t know what came over me. I slept with the mother, I . lost it when I saw the daughter.’ According to Miss Mansouret, . Strauss-Kahn then met her for a glass of wine in a bistro, and he . apologised for trying to attack her daughter. Attempted rape carries a sentence of . up to 15 years in France – more if there are aggravating circumstances . such as the use of violence. In a 2007 TV programme which is still . accessible on the internet, Miss Banon gives a graphic account of the . alleged attack in which she compared Strauss-Kahn to a ‘rutting . chimpanzee’ and claimed he tried to unfasten her clothes. She said that she was dissuaded from . filing charges at the time by her mother, who is still a regional . councillor in Strauss-Kahn’s Socialist party. The violent but consensual sex . between her mother and Strauss-Kahn is now being put forward as the . reason why Miss Banon took eight years to go to the police about the . alleged attack on her, claimed L’Express magazine. It also emerged . yesterday that Strauss-Kahn’s daughter Camille has been questioned by . police over the alleged attempted rape of Miss Banon. The 26-year-old student, who is a friend of Miss Banon’s, was questioned on Monday. Arrested: Strauss-Kahn appeared in court earlier this year after a maid at a hotel in New York claimed that she had been sexually-assaulted by him . In response to Miss Banon’s claims, Strauss-Kahn has denied the attack and begun legal action against her for libel. His Paris lawyer Henri Leclerc said: ‘Her claims are imaginary. It never happened.’ Strauss-Kahn, the disgraced former . head of the International Monetary Fund and once a possible presidential . candidate in France, is currently awaiting trial in New York, accused . of raping a hotel maid. That case has been adjourned until . next month and looks likely to be dropped because of his victim’s . alleged links with criminals. But Strauss-Kahn faces an investigation . for the attempted rape of Miss Banon as soon as he returns home to . France. All of the women involved in the . French allegations are well known to Anne Sinclair, Strauss-Kahn’s . current wife who, despite his non-stop philandering, is standing by . him. The French Socialist Party has been . torn apart by the latest revelations, but some senior figures are still . arguing that Strauss-Kahn should be allowed to run for  president next . year against Nicolas Sarkozy. In another dramatic development . yesterday it emerged that Francois Hollande, the current frontrunner to . stand as Socialist presidential candidate next year, is set to be . questioned by police about allegations that he knew about the alleged . attempted rape of Miss Banon as far back as 2003, but did nothing about . it. Mr Hollande denied that he had acted . improperly, saying: ‘I’ve nothing to hide and nothing to feel uneasy . about but I will not allow this case to be exploited politically.’","'He took me with the vulgarity of a soldier', says former colleague Anne Mansouret .

"A Spanish biker has filed a formal complaint over a traffic accident involving Michael Schumacher weeks before the F1 star’s horror ski crash. Schumacher is accused of knocking the motorcyclist off his bike after failing to give way at a roundabout in Bormujos near Seville. The unnamed Spaniard is claiming compensation for the broken wrist he suffered and damage to a watch, his clothes and his motorbike in the accident on November 17 last year. VIDEO Scroll down for fans', Hamilton's and investigators' reactions after Schumi's accident . Michael Schumacher is being sued by a Spanish motorcyclist after the F1 star allegedly knocked him off his bike when failing to give way at a roundabout while driving an Audi rental car weeks before his ski accident . Schumacher, who has been named in the complaint along with the company that hired him the rented Audi A4 he was driving and its insurers, has been in a medically-induced coma since suffering a head injury in a French Alps fall on December 29 last year. A trial will only take place if insurers contest the claim and the 45-year-old German would not be obliged to attend. Police have said in their accident report the seven-time F1 champion, who was on a private visit to Spain, failed to respect his alleged victim's right of way. Poor lighting on the approach to the roundabout has also been blamed. Last week, Schumacher's family were given the smashed helmet he wore on the day of his ski accident. Schumacher (pictured with his wife Corinna) has been in a medically-induced coma since suffering a head injury while skiing in the French Alps on December 29 last year . Doctors caring for him have rebutted claims his injuries may have been worsened because the helicopter that took him from the ski resort of Meribel to Grenoble hospital made a stopover at a smaller hospital en route. Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm has said Michael is making progress. She said at the start of the month: 'He shows moments of consciousness and awakening. 'We are on his side, together with the team of the hospital in Grenoble, and we keep remaining confident.' She also rubbished claims his wife Corinna had plans to build a medical suite for him at their Swiss home.
