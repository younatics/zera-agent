"Michael Bloomberg's youngest daughter has revealed that she is due to give birth to a baby boy on Christmas Day. Georgina, 30, a professional . equestrian first announced she was pregnant with Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s first grandchild in June. But she said she was not planning to marry her boyfriend Argentinian equestrian Ramiro Quintan anytime soon. Due date: Michael Bloomberg's youngest daughter Georgina, 30, has revealed that she is due to give birth to a baby boy on Christmas Day. On the circuit: The father is her boyfriend Ramiro Quintana who is a fellow equestrian . Speaking at a party to celebrate her . Hamptons Magazine cover she said, 'I live with my boyfriend, but I never . want to get married. I’ve always been non-traditional. My father hasn’t . pressured me to get married. He respects my decision. 'I . will have the baby in New York and then move to Florida, where I spend . the winter. I am reading baby books and looking at names, but we haven’t . decided yet,' she told the New York Post. She said despite the pregnancy, she will ride in the upcoming Hampton . Classic Horse Show, although it will be her last show. By dad's side: Georgina has said that her father is not the best with kids so he will likely not be babysitting often . Georgina competes on the same horse racing circuit Ramiro Quintana. Although . her spokesman previously said that the family was very happy when the . pregnancy was announced, other sources say that her father is upset . about how fast her relationship with the reported ladies’ man has . escalated. This will be the New York City Mayor's first grandchild as his older daughter Emma, 34, has been married for eight years but does not have a child. 'Georgina is pretty excited about the baby, but her dad isn’t too happy about it. It’s so sudden,' an unidentified source in Wellington, Florida told Gossip Extra. Georgina splits her time between New York and Florida as there are a number of horse races in Wellington in the winter months. 'Georgina can do better when it comes to men. The guy’s known for his roving eye and partying as much as his riding,' the source continued. Georgina, pictured left and . right, said despite the pregnancy, she will ride in the upcoming Hampton Classic Horse Show, although it will be her last show . The New York Post reports that she and Quintana have been . 'quietly dating for a while' and Gossip Extra specifies that they had . been together for six months when the pregnancy was revealed. She previously dated fellow show jumper Cian O'Connor and is also believed to have had a relationship with speed skater Joey Cheek. Mr Bloomberg, 71, has indulged his daughter's passion for equestrian and paid for at least six horses, which she keeps on estates in North Salem, New York, and Wellington, Florida. The family also have a lavish property portfolio including neighboring waterfront homes in Bermuda for Miss Bloomberg. The Bloombergs are amongst the richest people in America and Mr Bloomberg has an estimated personal fortune of $18.1 billion earned through his eponymous financial information company. But their personal lives were thrown into the spotlight two years ago when Miss Bloomberg published her novel 'The A Circuit.' The book concerns Wall St billionaire Rick Aaronson, his two daughters and their family squabbles. His eldest daughter Camille went to an Ivy League colleague and wants to move into politics. His youngest daughter Tommi is an award-winning horse rider who refuses to do what her father tells her. 'She wasn't afraid to say no to her father,' Tommi says in the book. 'Even if half of Wall Street was.' By coincidence, Miss Bloomberg's sister Emma went to Princeton and now works with her father City Hall in New York. Another parallel is Miss Bloomberg's own interest in horses.","Georgina, 30, is pregnant by boyfriend equestrian Ramiro Quintana .

"A Miami Beach police officer has been reinstated after testing positive for drugs by successfully arguing he unknowingly absorbed the drug through a sex cream he was given by 'an old Cuban guy.' After detective Reinaldo Casas tested positive for cocaine he was fired from the department, but launched a union grievance days later insisting that the drug had been unwittingly absorbed into his blood through an erection-enhancing cream he applied to his genitals. His defense worked. Drug test: Reinaldo Casas claims his positive drug test was due to a sex aid cream that he used because his sexual prowess was failing . An arbitrator this week ordered Casas, . who was fired last year because of this positive drug test, be . reinstated with complete back pay. 'There is no evidence in the record to show that (Casas) was aware the cream contained a controlled substance,' according to the arbitrator’s report released Thursday. By law, Miami Beach police must comply with the ruling. The decision caps an embarrassing saga for Casas, who was a homicide investigator when he was fired in February 2013. Casas had failed a random drug test administered by the police department. 'Having never knowingly used cocaine, I was baffled, perplexed and confused,' Casas wrote in his grievance. At a grievance hearing, Casas testified that a buddy, Idilio Godinez, gave him the cream 'with the advice that it would help him in his sexual liaisons.' Godinez testified that he got the sex-enhancement cream from 'an old Cuban guy' as a gift for giving him some political campaign signs. Godinez claimed he did not know what was in the cream, but had tried it himself and it worked. Grievance report: The former Miami Beach cop says he was 'baffled, perplexed, and confused' over the results of the drugs test . The substance, which resembled Vaseline, was contained in a series of unmarked purple containers and appeared to be homemade. The city insisted that Casas’ story was 'incredible' and he should have known what he was ingesting his body. The arbitrator . disagreed and ordered Casas returned to duty with back pay — he earns . $74,745.84 a year. Casas . has had a rocky career with the police force and was reprimanded in the . past for making ‘conflicting statements’, missing court appearances, . ‘excessive sick-time usage’, and ‘gross negligence’, according to Miami New Times. He said that he had come to his conclusion that the cream was to blame after ‘heavy deliberation and the insight of others’. ‘The sexual aid cream was provided to me by a friend to assist my sexual performance,’ he stated in the report. Casas claims he was involved in a rollover crash in 2002 which had ruined 30 per cent of his memory, according to the Times. When cops looked into his claim that he'd lost 30 per cent of his memory in July 2005, they came up with nothing. They also found he had lied about whether any allegation against him had ever been sustained while he was employed at the Hialeah Police Department. Back to work: Casas will return to the Miami Beach Police Department after more than a year off the job . His conduct had been ‘highly inappropriate’, a police investigator found, and Casas was suspended for two days. In 2006, he was cited for ‘gross negligence’ and ‘gross inefficiency’ in a case involving a rental van, which he allowed a tow truck to take away, even though it had more than $1,000 worth of goods inside. Casas, who was making over $122,000 a year, according to Miami Beach Exposed, claimed ‘there was no property in the van’ when it was towed. One year later, Casas missed a court appearance saying it was because of a dental appointment, but Miami Beach Police had no record of that purported telephone call, according to internal police records. It was his second unexcused absence in a year, according to the Times.","Reinaldo Casas was fired from the Miami Beach Police Department in February 2013 .

"Mosque congregations around Britain were given a 'call to action' yesterday to tackle grooming by individuals in the Muslim community - in the week that seven men from a paedophile gang in Oxford were jailed. A sermon, entitled Tackling Street Grooming in the UK, was made in Friday prayers in around 500 mosques, . It highlighted the responsibilities of Muslims to shun 'all forms of indecent and immoral behaviour' as taught by the Koran. Brothers Akhtar Dogar (left) and Anjum Dogar (right) were each given a . life sentence with a minimum of 17 years at the Old Bailey . Mohammed Karrar (left), 38, was given life with a . minimum of 20 years for the 'dreadful offences' he committed against . the girls. His brother Bassam Karrar (right), 34, was also handed a life . sentence with a minimum of 15 years . Kamar Jamil (left), 27, was jailed for life with a minimum of 12 years while Assad Hussain (right), 32 was sentenced to seven years in prison . Zeeshan Ahmed, 28, was jailed for seven years for two counts of sexual activity with a child . The move comes after five members of a . seven-man sadistic paedophile ring found guilty of grooming vulnerable . underage girls were given life sentences at the Old Bailey. Two other . defendants were both jailed for seven years. The midday prayer, called Jummah . Salah, said: 'Today I will speak to you about the subject of 'Sexual . Grooming' that has been in the news a lot recently with many cases . involving mainly men of Pakistani or South Asian background in Derby, . Rochdale, Telford, Oxford and West Yorkshire who have been convicted of . this wicked and evil crime. The sermon states that with 'so many . individuals from a Muslim background involved in such crimes, we have a . responsibility to condemn this. 'We wholeheartedly condemn the . disgraceful actions of those involved in these cases and welcome the . convictions in the cases that have been through the courts.' It was said publicity of cases of . sexual grooming involving Pakistani and South Asian men, and coverage of . the forthcoming trial of Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale on . charges of killing Lee Rigby would present the Muslim community with a . 'major challenge'. The sermon, which was part of the . Together Against Grooming campaign, was unusual because it is often seen . as a taboo to discuss such topics inside mosques. Hate: The Woolwich murder has been exploited by the anti-Islamic English Defence League led by Tommy Robinson (pictured) The murder of Drummer Lee Rigby by Islamic extremists will create a 'major challenge' for the Muslim community in Britain . But the Muslim groups which support . the campaign hope that discussing the topic openly may prevent further . similar instances from happening. The sermon said: 'We need to continue . to speak against and oppose this crime and make sure that there is a . high level of awareness of this issue among our community. 'We need to tackle some of the root . causes, which are quite often linked to criminality in some sections of . our community and quite often connected to drugs. Together Against Grooming spokesman . Ansar Ali said the campaign was born out a feeling of 'natural . responsibility' to condemn and tackle sexual grooming. He said: 'The Koran and traditions of . our Prophet exhort us to act against evil and injustice, and create just . societies. This is the start of what will be a nationwide project in . which we seek to work with others to eradicate this practice from all . communities. 'The June 28 Together Against Grooming . campaign is unprecedented - we have brought together mosques and imams . from all over the UK, irrespective of differences to collectively . deliver a hard-hitting sermon on a single issue. 'We are united in our stand against sexual grooming and, as Muslims, we are leading the effort to rid society of this crime.'","Faith faces a 'major challenge' after paedophile ring and death of Lee Rigby .

"A tweet from Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry's verified account on Sunday night included a disparaging image of the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of his criminal indictment on charges of abuse of power. The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account that disavowed the post. The earlier tweet posted an unflattering mock image of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013. Perry vetoed funds to her office when she refused to resign, which led to a grand jury in Austin this month indicting Perry — who is a potential 2016 presidential candidate. The caption on the tweet reads: 'I don't always drive drunk at 3x the legal blood alcohol limit ...' The Associated Press reported that the bottom of the caption of the tweet read 'but when I do, I indict Gov. Perry for calling me out about it. I am the most drunk Democrat in Texas.' Lehmberg's office did not lead the grand jury investigation against Perry. It was handled by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio-based special prosecutor who was assigned by a Republican judge. Scroll down for video . Tweet: This image appeared on the verified Twitter account for Gov. Rick Perry . 'Unauthorized':The post was removed and Perry claimed it was 'unauthorized' Charged: Gov. Rick Perry, seen in this file photo, has pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy . 'A tweet just went out from my account that was unauthorized. I do not condone the tweet and I have taken it down,' the later post said. Perry aides did not immediately return messages seeking comment from the Associated Press. Although the tweets were sent from Perry's verified account, it was unclear who does the actual posting for the feed. Perry has pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy. His high-powered legal team has asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the law being used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutionally vague.

Meme: The image posted to Perry's Twitter account seemed to use Lehmberg's April 2013 booking photo for drunk driving . Second message: Rick Perry's authorized Twitter account posted this message after the mock image of Rosemary Lehmberg appeared . Perry cut off $7.5 million in state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit — which is based in Travis County and prosecutes public corruption in Texas — when Lehmberg refused to resign. That veto drew a formal complaint from a left-leaning watchdog group. Perry's verified account is updated frequently — and sometimes famously. After finishing in fifth place in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry addressed speculation that he might call it quits with a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, and the words, 'Here we come South Carolina!'","A tweet from Republican Texas Gov.

"The harrowing stories of women and children locked up for so-called 'moral crimes' in Afghanistan's notorious female prison have been revealed after cameras were allowed inside. Mariam has been in Badam Bagh prison for three months after she shot a man who just raped her at gunpoint and then turned the weapon on herself - but she has yet to been charged. Nuria has eight months left to serve of her sentence for trying to divorce her husband. She gave birth in prison to her son and they share a cell together. Scroll down for video . Nuria was jailed for trying to divorce her husband. Her son is one of 62 children living at Badam Bagh prison . Mariam shot her a man who raped her at gunpoint and then shot herself. She is locked up but has not been charged with a crime . He is one of 62 children trapped in prison because of their mother's sentences for 'crimes' such as refusing an arranged marriage or being with a man of their choice. Some women are serving up to seven years for leaving their husband. Six people often share a cell and inmates attend a variety of . classes during the week, ranging from basic literacy, to crafts and . sewing, with the intention of giving the women a skill once they leave . the prison. Despite some new laws being introduced . when the Taliban were ousted 12 years ago, activists say very little has . changed for women in Afghanistan in the past decade. Mariam fled to Kabul, the country's . capital, from her home in the northern Kunduz province after the . increasingly vicious beatings from her husband became too much to bear. Alone in a strange city, she called the only person she knew, her husband's cousin. He surprised her by saying that he would help her but was too busy to pick her up so sent a friend. That friend took Mariam to 'some house' and raped her. She shot him after he left the gun on a table and casually turned to watch TV. She then shot herself in the head and woke up three days later in hospital. The authorities moved her to Badam Bagh within days. Adia, 27, is serving a seven year sentence but is seven months pregnant and will have her baby in jail . Cells at the prison are full and six people often share a room and sleep on bunk beds pushed against the wall . Nuria went to court to demand a divorce from a husband she was forced by her parents to marry. She said: 'I wanted to get a divorce . but he wouldn't let me go. I never wanted to marry him. I loved someone . else but my father made me. He threatened to kill me if I didn't.' Nuria said she pleaded with her father before her marriage but he would not relent. 'When . I went to court for the divorce, instead of giving me a divorce, they . charged me with running away,'she said. The man she wanted to marry was . also charged and is now serving time in Afghanistan's notorious . Pul-e-Charkhi prison, one of the country's largest prisons that has a reputation for the maltreatment of inmates. The baby she gave birth to is her husbands and he has even offered to have the courts set her free if she returns, but Nuria has refused. 'He wants . me to come home now because I have his son but I said no. I will wait . until my sentence is up', she said. Adia is seven-months pregnant and will have her baby in prison after she left her drug addict husband. She returned to her parents' home but they wanted her to return to him. Instead she escaped with another man. Sixty-two children live in the prison in Kabul that houses 202 women . Activists say that 12 years after the Taliban were ousted from the country, very little has changed for women . Adia, 20, said: 'It wasn't a romance. I was desperate to . get away and he said he would help me but he didn't he just left me. I . went to the court. I was angry. I wanted him charged and my husband . charged but instead they charged me and sentenced me to six years. 'I . went back to court to appeal the conviction and this time I was . sentenced to seven and a half years.' The Taliban's ousting in 2001 ended five years of rule and regressive laws. But despite some new laws and schools opening for girls, activists say life for women is almost the same. Even President Hamid Karzai began making statements that harkened back to the Taliban rule saying women really should be accompanied by a man while outside their home. A new law was enacted called the Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW), but its implementation is erratic and rare, says the United Nations Assistance Mission on Afghanistan. Most of the women inmates are serving time for 'moral crimes' such as leaving their husbands . The prisoners are given daily lessons as the authorities want them to have a skill when they leave . While it might not be against the law to run away or escape a forced marriage, the courts routinely convict women fleeing abusive homes with 'the intent to commit zina (or adultery)' which are most often simply referred to as 'moral crimes,' says a UNAMA report. ""Perceptions toward women are still the same in most places, tribal laws are the only laws followed and in most places nothing has changed in the basics of women's lives. 'There are policies and papers and even laws but nothing has changed,' said Zubaida Akbar whose volunteer Haider organization fights for women's rights and sends lawyers and aid workers to the women's prison to defend the inmates in court. Zubeida, the women's activist, said despite what she calls a veneer of change, little is different for most Afghan women. 'We . have the appearance of everything, but when you dig in deep down below . the surface nothing fundamentally has changed. It has been tough. It has . been really tough,' she said.","Most of the 202 Badam Bagh inmates are jailed for so-called 'moral crimes'

"French journalist Ivan Rioufol is to be prosecuted using 19th century press laws . A French journalist is facing a criminal trial under the country’s strict press laws for remarks made during a radio debate about the influence of Islam. Ivan Rioufol, 61, believes the way he is being treated is an example of how writers are criminalised when the state is able to control the media. He was summoned to court under strict press laws which date back to the 19th Century following a complaint from a pressure group called the Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF). ‘In seeking to undermine liberty of expression, a sacred principle of our civilisation, the Collective against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) takes the risk of appearing like a menace to democracy,’ said Mr Rioufol. ‘This is essentially what I hope to be able to explain in court, because I will have to appear in a few months before the 17th Criminal Court in Paris.’ Mr Rioufol, who has written for Le Figaro newspaper for almost 28 years, made some allegedly defamatory remarks on November 15th 2012 during an RTL radio programme called ‘We Reshape the World.’ Mr Rioufol particularly objected to a CCIF poster campaign which showed pictures of predominantly bearded and veiled Muslims under the slogan ‘We are the Nation’. The journalist said that this was against the spirit of France’s inclusive, secular republic – something which CCIF objected to. Mr Rioufol said that France’s 1881 Press Law was being used to ‘penalise criticism, intimidate journalists, censor the media’ and even ‘to reintroduce the offence of blasphemy’. We Are The Nation: The poster by the Collective Against Islamophobia In France, which Mr Rioufol referred to in the radio debate . Ivan Rioufol will seek to prove that his words were true, as a defence against the defamation charge . The 1881 law was nominally meant to guarantee the ‘freedom of the press’ but in fact criminalised a range of journalistic behaviour. So called ‘press offenses’ ranged from insulting the President of France, to defaming private citizens through comment. Mr Rioufol said about the case’s first hearing: ‘The judge reminded me that he himself had no opportunity to verify the existence of the alleged offense, the procedure - Press Law 1881 -  leading automatically to court, where the case will be considered on its merits.’ Mr Rioufol said the law was ‘easily manipulated’ by those who wanted to persecute journalists. A spokesman for CCIF said it had a duty to challenge ‘Islamophobia’ and the press laws were a logical way of challenging journalism it objected to. 'Mr Rioufol will in court seek to prove that his words were true – one of the defences against defamation.'","Ivan Rioufol was summoned to court under France's strict press laws .

"More bad news for the Secret Service today as a government investigation has found more conduct they deem 'problematic.' Operation Moonlight, which happened three years ago, had agents removed from their posts in Washington D.C. and heading almost an hour outside the city to settle a dispute between an agency employee and her neighbor. On at least two of these occasions, President Obama was in residence. Scroll down for video . A government investigation uncovered an operation that had Secret Service agents tasked with guarding the White House travelling an hour outside the city to help a coworker with a dispute with a neighbor, something agency deputy director A.T. Smith (above) was aware of . No one's watching: Two of the times that agents from the Prowler unit were away, President Obama (above) was in residence . The agents sent out were part of the Prowler unit, tasked with responding to suspicious people and situations in and around the White House and national capital area. The report by the Homeland Security Department's inspector general calls the conduct 'problematic,' and says that the employee's friendship with high-level Secret Service officials creates the appearance it was motivated by personal relations 'rather than furthering official government functions.' A Secret Service employee who worked as the assistant to then-director, Mark Sullivan, was involved in a dispute with her neighbor, who was harassing her and assaulted her father. This 'resulted in the loss of several of her father's teeth,' the report says. Local police arrested the neighbor, and the employee, identified as Lisa Chopey, sought out a protective order. But it didn't stop there. She told investigators that Keith Prewitt, then the deputy director of the Secret Service, was a family friend. And when he heard her story, Prewitt told A.T. Smith, then the assistant director for investigations, that the Secret Service should do something to help her out. Smith directed one of his managers to have agents drive out to Chopey's home in La Plata, Maryland, to check on her. The report says that Sullivan, the agency director who's since retired, was made aware of that decision. This is all happening just a few weeks after Julia Pierson stepped down as head of the agency over numerous lapses in security . Utah's Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who is leading investigations of the Secret Service as chairman of an oversight subcommittee, said that Smith should be fired . Prowler teams are not part of the presidential protective division, and agency personnel interviewed for the report insisted that their protective function was not compromised. The mission was over before long - five days of visits are documented, with the longest lasting eight hours. But the report notes that during those times, 'the Prowler team would have been unable to respond to exigencies at the White House.' Several of the people named in the report, including Chopey, have retired or moved on from the Secret Service, but Smith is now the agency deputy director. Utah's Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who is leading investigations of the Secret Service as chairman of an oversight subcommittee, said that Smith should be fired and called the agency's actions 'inexcusable.' This all comes just weeks after Julia Pierson resigned as Director of the United States Secret Service following numerous security lapses involving the agency.","A government investigation into the Secret Service found an incident three years ago when agents were an hour from the White House while on duty .

Trainor, a district supervisor who worked for the company for 41 years . before being fired last weekend over the protests. 'He's just a . tremendous human being that puts people above profits. He can walk . through a store, and if he's met you once, he knows your name, he knows . your wife, your husband, your kids, where they are going to school.' Meat manager Dave Fillebrown wipes down largely empty shelves at a Market Basket supermarket in Haverhill, Mass. Earlier Friday, board members said they will consider an offer Arthur T. made this week to buy the company. 'Consistent . with its fiduciary obligations, the Board will evaluate and seriously . consider this proposal, along with any other offers previously received . and to be received,' the board said. The board also decried what it called the 'negative behavior' of some current and former employees. 'It . is now clear that it is in the interests of all members of the Market . Basket community for normal business operations to resume immediately,' it said. As the board met, up to 10,000 . employees, customers and supporters attended another protest rally at a . Market Basket store in Tewksbury. Employees . said they believe the fight between the family members loyal to Arthur . T. and Arthur S. is largely over money and the direction of the company. They say Arthur S. and his supporters have pressed for a greater return . to shareholders. Arthur T. and his supporters have focused on keeping prices low. Many . employees are distrustful of Arthur S. and two co-chief executives who . were brought in from outside the company: Felicia Thornton, a former . executive of the grocery chain Albertsons, and Jim Gooch, former . president and chief executive at RadioShack Corp. Arthur S. has not spoken publicly about his ouster or the striking workers supporting him . The company statement Friday acknowledged 'the strain this change of leadership has placed on our associates.' Valerie Burke, a worker in the West Bridgewater store, said she's worried about her job. 'It's . a great company to work for now, but we are worried it won't stay that . way,' she said as she picketed outside the store Tuesday. Arthur S. has not spoken publicly, while Gooch and Thornton have communicated only through prepared statements. Steve . Paulenka, who started in 1974 as a bag boy and rose to facilities and . operations manager before being fired last weekend, said he sees no end . to protests unless Arthur T. is reinstated. 'A . big part of me doesn't like what's going on - it's like breaking your . favorite toy on purpose,' he said. 'But we'll get through this.'","A .

"A school at the centre  of an alleged takeover plot by Islamist hardliners could now face strict government sanctions following a snap Ofsted inspection. Park View Academy in Birmingham has been condemned in recent weeks for increasing ‘Islamisation’, hosting extremist preachers during assemblies and apparently encouraging girls to cover their hair. Yesterday it emerged that the Education Funding Agency had launched a separate probe into the school over the misuse of public funds to pay £70,000 for playground loudspeakers to summon pupils to Islamic prayers. Park View Academy, where Lindsey Clark is executive head, allegedly spent £70,00 on speakers to summon pupils to Islamic prayer . Whistleblowing teachers have claimed . the school is in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the . governing body, forcing non-Muslims out and replacing them with . hardliners. Earlier this . month a letter was circulated referring to a ‘Trojan Horse’ plot for . Muslim extremists to take over the running of schools. The authenticity . of the letter is unclear but its very existence led to a flood of . allegations from staff at schools in the city. Following . the Ofsted inspection, Park View – previously rated ‘outstanding’ – . will be downgraded to ‘inadequate’. This enables Ofsted to place the . school, in the inner-city suburb of Alum Rock, in special measures, . giving the watchdog the power to remove the governing body. Meanwhile, . according to the Sunday Telegraph, pupils at Oldknow Primary in Small . Heath were led in anti-Christian chanting by a teacher in assembly. Oldknow, . which like Park View has many Muslim pupils and its own madrasa – or . Islamic school – has organised at least three trips to the holy city of . Mecca, subsidised from public funds, and requires all pupils to learn . Arabic. Its respected . non-Muslim head-teacher, Bhupinder Kondal, recently left her post for . resisting this increasingly radical agenda, according to fellow . teachers. Mrs Kondal is among four of the school’s six-strong senior . management team who have left in the past six months. Park View School in Birmingham, It is currently under investigation by the Department for Education . Last . week it emerged how other teachers were forced out by hardliners in a . similar way after opposing plans to ban sex education and stop the . teachings of other religions. Michael . White, a former associate headteacher at Park View, described the . latest action taken by Ofsted as ‘a step in the right direction’. But . he condemned Birmingham City Council for ‘failing to take action at the . time’. Mr White said the council and Government have been ‘too afraid . to upset communities, choosing to sweep things under the carpet’. It . is not known whether the decision to retire by Park View’s current . head, Lindsey Clark, is related to pressure from Islamists on the . governing body. Khalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham’s Perry Barr, . urged the Department for Education to replace the governing body at the . academy. Calling for a full . inquiry, he said: ‘Local council officers have taken their eye off the . ball. The council has allowed these governors to take over these schools . under the radar.’ At . another successful primary school, Springfield, similar tactics are . being used according to the Sunday Telegraph. Headteacher Christopher . Webb is under ‘non-stop attack’ by radical members of the governing . body, teachers said. Similar . techniques were used to oust former head Noshaba Hussain 20 years ago. Mrs Hussain said she was ‘an example of how the plan worked perfectly’.","The school claimed sum, but the equipment is worth far less, it is alleged .

"It has been billed as high-minded prosecution to uphold the strict rules of Shariah law. But MailOnline can reveal that the real reasons why a pregnant woman in Sudan has been sentenced to death for being a Christian are all too human. Jealousy and greed drove Meriam Ibrahim’s own family to file a lawsuit against her alleging apostasy and adultery which led to the criminal charges she now faces, it is claimed. Scroll down for video . Hang: . Meriam, a eight-months-pregnant doctor, was sentenced to death last . week for marrying Daniel. Authorities rule she is Muslim because her . father - who abandoned her when he was six, worshiped Islam, even though . she was brought up by her Christian mother . Her half brother and half sister - who had not seen her for decades - tracked her down so they could get rid of her and take over her successful general store, Meriam’s lawyers alleged. The legal team for Meriam, whose husband is an American citizen, are being paid for by Justice Centre Sudan, a US-based non-profit that campaigns for human rights in the African country. A spokesman for the organization said: ‘We believe the family filed the lawsuit because they want to gain control of the business. ‘If Meriam stays in jail she could lose everything and they could be the ones to benefit.’ Heartbreaking: This image captures the first time Daniel Wani was allowed to see Martin and Meriam a few weeks ago. He has hardly been allowed to see her . The spokeswoman added that if Meriam is forced to leave Sudan then her half brother and half sister may well take over the business as well. It is not clear if, under Sudanese law, such a scheme would work as intended, or if a business owner would be allowed to sell it on. But it gives a disturbing new insight into the reasons why an eight-months pregnant woman has been thrown in a prison cell in shackles with her 20-month old boy whilst expecting her second child - and become the center of an international outcry. The heartbreaking situation was illustrated by exclusive pictures obtained by MailOnline which showed Meriam’s husband Daniel, who is in a wheelchair, holding Martin under the close watch of prison guards with rifles slung over their shoulders. Rotten . care: Martin is given a drink by prison guards. Daniel is not allowed . to take custody of Martin because the authorities have ruled that the . toddler is Muslim . Desperate: Daniel and Martin sit with their lawyer, Mr Mohand, during a visit. Daniel is wheelchair bound as he suffers from muscular dystrophy . He had flown in from his home in Manchester, New Hampshire in a desperate bid to free his wife and son from their terrible fate. Meriam, 27, was thrown in jail in September and earlier this month was sentenced to death for adultery for marrying Daniel, a Christian who has US citizenship. The visit to the Khartoum prison was was the first time that Daniel was able to see his wife since she was imprisoned in September. Judges in the city have sentenced Mariam to death and 100 lashes as the Sudanese court refuses to recognize her 2011 marriage to Daniel because her father was a Muslim. The Justice Centre Sudan spokeswoman said: ‘When Meriam’s father left her mother when she was six he went to another part of Sudan and had another family. ‘Meriam did not know about this. She did not even know her father had died until many years after the event. Nor did she know he was a Muslim. ‘Meriam’s mother died in 2012 and by then she had still not heard from her half brothers and sisters. ‘There were years and years that went by when that side of the family did not want a relationship with her. Adultery: . Meriam has also been sentenced to 100 lashes because the court did not . recognize her marriage to Christian Daniel Wani, a naturalized U.S. citizen, who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire . Outrage: More than 50 protesters gathered outside the Sudanese court last week where Meriam was sentenced . ‘Recently Meriam has been running a successful business in Khartoum. It’s a general store in a shopping mall and she has been selling some Ethiopian items as her mother was from there. ‘They’ve been doing really well and the business was growing and Daniel has been helping her out. ‘Her half brother and half sister must have heard about this and worked out she was a relative of theirs because of her name. ‘The first thing Meriam knew about them was when her half brother and half sister filed the lawsuit. ‘She was arrested from her home and thrown in jail with no warning.’ This comes as John Kerry faced renewed calls to act on behalf of the American citizen whose heavily pregnant wife, son and unborn child are locked up in jail in Sudan - as MailOnline reveals the family’s emotional reunion behind bars. Cruel: . Martin, above, is pictured biting his lip unaware of the terrible fate . his mother, Meriam, faces after being sentenced to hang for refusing to . consider herself a Christian. His family claim he is American because . his father has been granted U.S. citizenship . Love: . Meriam and Daniel met and married in Khartoum. He was planning to bring . her back to their modest home in Manchester, NH, last year but the . paperwork was held up and she was arrested . Two senators have sent the Secretary of State a second letter demanding that more be done to help Daniel Wani and Meriam Ibrahim, who is awaiting a death sentence for marrying her Christian husband. New Hampshire's Senator Kelly Ayotte and fellow Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri said they are concerned that the government is wasting time with bureaucracy. In their letter to Kerry they said that the holdup was ‘preventing needed high-level engagement’ and that he had to intervene personally. The senators had already written a first letter but have grown frustrated and demanded Kerry do something again. Meanwhile in exclusive pictures obtained by MailOnline, Daniel, who is in a wheelchair, can be seen holding Martin under the close watch of prison guards with rifles slung over their shoulders after he flew from Manchester, New Hampshire in a desperate bid to free the 20-months-old and his wife from their terrible fate.

"A gruesome new beer brewed with goat brains has launched, paying homage to the hit zombie show The Walking Dead. The Dock Street Brewing Company in Philadelphia says the animal organs - which are cooked over hot coals before being added to the liquid mix - add an 'intriguing, subtle smoke' flavor to the American pale stout. The 7.2% alcoholic beverage will debut on Sunday March 30 to coincide with the season finale of The Walking Dead and has been named the 'Walker' after the series' wandering corpses. Punchy pint: As a liquid tribute to the hit zombie show The Walking Dead, The Dock Street Brewing Company in Philadelphia has crafted a beer using goat brains . Along with brains, the beer also contains cranberries, which apparently add a 'sinister, bloody hue' and 'slight tartness.' Other more common ingredients in the ale include malted wheat, oats and flaked barley and fuggle hops. Head brewer Justin Low said that he and many of the staff at Dock Street are loyal fans of The Walking Dead and they would spend Monday shifts recapping the previous night's episodes. Long process: The goat brains are smoked in a fire before being added to the beer mix . Fancy a sip? Along with brains the beer also contains cranberries, which apparently add a 'sinister, bloody hue' and 'slight tartness.' The show, set in Georgia, premiered in 2010 on the AMC network and was renewed for a fifth season last fall. As well as serving up its brain-infused beer, Dock Street will also show the season four finale on a big screen. While the venue is excited about its latest creation, others aren't as enthused. 'Yuck. Nasty,' one commenter wrote after learning about the Walker beer. 'Mmmmmm,' another added suspiciously. Dock Street isn't the first to brew with meat. Hit zombie show: The Walking Dead season finale will air on Sunday March 30 . Last year, Denver’s Wynkoop Brewing . Company made national news by launching the Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout, . a beer made with roasted bull testicles. It was described as an 'assertive foreign-style stout, slightly viscous, with a deep brown color. 'It has equally deep flavors of chocolate syrup, Kahlua, and espresso, along with a palpable level of alcohol and a savory umami-like note.It finishes dry and roasted with a fast-fading hop bite.' Wynkoop's head brewer Andy Brown added: 'We've been making ballsy beer for the past few years, and this is great proof of that.'","The Dock Street Brewing Company in Philadelphia says goat brains give an 'intriguing, subtle smoke' flavor to its American pale stout ."
"In any totalitarian regime, if you upset the dear leader then you become a non-person – literally. Even if, as in the case of  North Korea’s Jang Song Thaek, you are that leader’s powerful deputy and uncle. As these pictures show, the unfortunate Jang yesterday found himself erased from history, his image removed from previously published official photos and videos. North Korea has released images of the moment Kim Jong Un's uncle was dragged from a meeting by police following his dismissal from government for 'criminal acts that baffle imagination'. Scroll down for videos . Ousted: Footage allegedly of Jang Song-Thaek being dragged out from his chair by two police officials during a meeting in Pyongyang was aired on national television . 'Renegade dreamer': Insisting the recently-dismissed uncle, Jang Song Thaek, had failed to toe the Party line, the government, in an astonishingly frank and poetic revelation, said he had 'dreamed different dreams' Purge: The removal of Jang (left) is thought to be part of 32-year-old Kim's intention to surround himself with a younger cabal . In the originals he is seen cheerfully accompanying his nephew Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s despotic young leader. In the new versions Jang has been either cropped out of the image or digitally moved so that his face cannot be seen. The hermit state has reportedly . 'thrown the book' at Kim's former second-in-command, Jang Song Thaek, . accusing him today of a string of crimes including womanising, alcohol . abuse and 'living a depraved life.' Insisting . Jang had failed to toe the Party line, the government, in an . astonishingly frank and poetic revelation, said he had 'dreamed . different dreams'. Such a . public dismissal is extraordinarily rare for the hideaway state, which . normally goes to extreme lengths to keep its internal affairs secret . from the international community. Removed from film: It had already become clear that Jang (circled) was out of favour - his face was blurred out or he was completely hidden in a propaganda documentary featuring Kim Jong-Un, whereas previously his presence was obvious . And . within days of his dismissal, Jang was already beginning to be erased . from the country's history as a previously recorded documentary about . Kim was released with the disgraced statesman airbrushed out of every . scene. And to cap his public humiliation, state television reportedly aired footage of Jang being arrested by uniformed police officers during a high-profile meeting in Pyongyang in front of hundreds of stony-faced colleagues. Jang was said by South Korea's . intelligence agency last week to have been removed from the number two . position in the leadership, but there was no official confirmation of . this from the North at the time. Airbrushed out: In this still from documentary ""The Great Comrade"", re-broadcast on North Korean state broadcaster KCTV on December 7, Jang appears to have been completely airbrushed out from the original (top) Now it has come - and far more robustly than North Korean watchers had ever expected. 'Jang . and his followers committed criminal acts baffling imagination and they . did tremendous harm to our Party and revolution,' said the official . KCNA news agency. Issuing . the dismissal confirmation following a meeting of the ruling Workers' Party, the agency said Kim Jong-Un was present and, despite family ties, . made it clear that Jang's behaviour made it imperative that his uncle . should be removed from office. The . news agency said that among Jang's indiscretions was mismanagement of . the country's finances. One of Jang's aides, holding many of his . secrets, recently defected to South Korean agents in China. KCNA said Jang had also been found to have indulged in 'womanising',  corruption and abusing alcohol and drugs. Cropped out: In this grab taken from the documentary, Jang (circled) has been simply cropped out of the shot taken during a trip to a museum . Erased: In the original (top) Jang can be seen accompanying Kim on another official visit but in the edited version he is nowhere to be seen . 'Jang . pretended to uphold the party and leader, but was engrossed in such . factional acts such as dreaming different dreams and involving himself . in double dealing behind the scene,' said KCNA. 'Affected by the capitalist way of living, Jang committed irregularities and corruption and led a dissolute and depraved life.' It has not been revealed what Jang's punishment is, but the worst two sentences are death or life in a harsh labour camp. Family: Kim Jong-Un (right) was reportedly present at his dismissal and, despite family ties, made it clear the behaviour of Jang (left) made it imperative that his uncle should be removed from office . Womanising: KCNA said Jang (far right) had also been found to have indulged in 'womanising',  corruption and abusing alcohol and drugs . News spreads: South Korean people watch a news program about the alleged dismissal of Jang Song-Thaek at a railway station in Seoul . Unconfirmed reports suggested Jang may already have been executed. The removal of Jang is thought to be part of 32-year-old Kim's intention to surround himself with a younger cabal. North Korean watchers suggest that the defection of Jang's aide recently has particularly angered Kim. Two other highly respected aides were shot down by a firing squad although just what they had done wrong has not been revealed.","Jang Song Thaek was accused of daring to 'dream different dreams'

"Captain Leslie Skinner, one of the first army chaplains to make it ashore on June 6, 1944, kept fascinating diaries, describing how he cared for his sick and wounded comrades . This is the face of the brave army chaplain who risked his life to care for his sick and wounded comrades as they fought their way out from the Normandy beachhead on D-day. Captain Leslie Skinner, a Methodist minister, who served with the Sherwood Rangers Yeomnary, was one of the first chaplains to make it ashore on 6 June 1944. Now his meticulously-kept diaries - which include an entry about the D-day landings - have been unveiled, as part of an exhibition to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the historic day. The fascinating diary entries show how the army padre saw it as his duty to find the bodies of his fellow men, who were killed as the tanks of his regiment advanced. He even refused to allow other tank crew members to help with the harrowing work, not wanting them to see how their comrades had died. Captain Skinner - who travelled all over the front line talking and giving guidance to troops - also describes in the diaries how he helped medical staff care for the sick and wounded. He talks of snipers with chest wounds, witnessing the deaths of his comrades and dodging rifle fires while digging graves, to ensure his fellow men were buried with dignity. In the entry on 6 June 1944, Captain Skinner wrote: 'Up 0500 hours; cold, wet, sea rough. This is it. Running for beach by 0700. 'Under fire by 0710. Beached 0725. Man either side of me wounded. One lost leg. I was blown backwards onto Bren Carrier but OK. 'Made it to beach, though I had hell of pain in left side. Bed on ground about 0130. Dead beat. Fell asleep beside half-track.' In another entry on 8 June 1944, Captain Skinner wrote about seeing a sniper suffering chest wounds. He wrote: 'Late evening Lt Verner brought in, sniper wound to left chest – serious. 'Doctor dressed wound and I helped evacuate Verner to Advanced Dressing Station riding on rear door and bumper all way, holding bottle giving blood drip – nearly five miles of rough going.' In an entry the following day, he writes about finding out that Captain Keith Douglas, who was known for his WWII war poetry, had been killed by enemy mortar fire while the regiment was advancing from Bayeux. He said: 'Spent day touring all medical units back to beach area in search of regimental casualties. News of death of Captain Keith Douglas on Fwd slopes pt 102…Forward on foot and found bodies of Keith Douglas and Lt Pepler. 'Buried separately near to where each lay. Occasional rifle fire while digging graves.' Nearly a . year after Captain Skinner landed on the beach in Normandy, the . war in Europe came to an end. In that time, the Sherwood Rangers . Yeomanry lost 153 men, with six reported as missing. But Captain Skinner's tireless work to locate the bodies of those that had been killed won him the . praise and respect of the soldiers with whom he served. It also meant the padre - who often wrote to the fallen soldiers' families after their deaths - had to deal first-hand with the stark realities of warfare. Captain Skinner, a Methodist minister, is pictured here with a private, both smoking as they wrap the body of a dead soldier in sack cloth in a British forward area of Normandy during World War II. The cigarettes were supplied as an antidote to the smell of the decomposing bodies . On 25 June 1944, he wrote: 'In burst of machine gun fire I dived into slit trench on top of young soldier. 'It was his first show and he was all alone. I assured him that the machine gun fire was way up in the air…he picked up a ration box lid and held it above ground. 'Burst [of fire] cut it in two. It shook me. When firing stopped I moved out. He, poor devil, had to stay. About 11:30…Shrapnel got me acrossforehead and knocked me out. Lots of blood but soon conscious.' In 4 August 1944, Captain Skinner wrote about the 'nasty business' he encountered while finding the bodies of dead soldiers. He wrote: 'On foot located brewed up tanks. Only ash and burnt metal in Birkett’s tank. Searched ash and found remains pelvic bones. At other tanks three bodies still inside…Unable to remove bodies after long struggle – nasty business – sick.' In the following diary extract from 17 August 1944, Captain Skinner explains why he would not allow tank crews to help him in his quest to recover bodies from inside the armoured vehicles. Captain Skinner shown conducting a funeral for a serviceman in a British forward area of Normandy during WWII on 14 August 1944 . He wrote: 'Place absolute shambles. Infantry dead and some Germans lying around. Horrible mess. 'Fearful job picking up bits and pieces and re-assembling for identification and putting in blankets for burial. No infantry to help. 'Squadron Leader offered to lend me some men to help. Refused. Less men who live and fight in tanks have to do with this side of things the better. My job. This was more than normally sick making. Really ill – vomiting.' As well as picking up the bodies, Padre Skinner made it his mission to methodically record the location and personal details of Sherwood Rangers men killed in action. He located all but six of the fallen men and only missed out on recording the details of these men as he was away from the regiment at the time, recovering from wounds he had suffered himself. His commanding officer had to stop him from venturing onto the battlefield in search of one of the missing men. In his diaries, Captain Skinner also describes how the German forces were respectful of the burials of Allied servicemen. On 2 September 1944 he wrote: 'Left driver and truck, entered village via ditch…Made way to village parsonage. 'Bodies of Sgt Cribben and Trooper Sharp beautifully laid out in white shrouds having been washed. I stitched the bodies up. 'Cure [priest] in robes led funeral cortege down street. The Germans had watched the funeral procession and seen the service from their tank without interference.' Captain Skinner also spent a lot of his time writing heartfelt letters to the relatives of the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry men who had been killed. Sometimes, it started a chain of correspondence which continued for many years after the war. The padre was also comforted by regular letters and parcels from his wife Etta, as his diary entry from 11 October 1944 shows. He wrote: 'Wrote Etta. During morning parcel [arrived] from Etta with coffee. Rain stopped and sun shining. 'All afternoon doing follow-up Casualty Letters. Feeling tired after sad job. Another letter came late from Etta. Wrote replies and thanks for parcel.' After the war,  Captain Skinner served as a parish priest and remained in the Territorial Army (TA). He ended his career as Deputy Assistant Chaplain General TA for the London district, with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, the highest rank a TA chaplain could hold in peacetime. The Padre’s Trail is on display at the Normandy . Experience in the Land Warfare exhibition at IWM Duxford, Cambridge, from Friday 16 May 2014.","Captain Leslie Skinner was one of the first army chaplains to land on the coast of Normandy on 6 June, 1944 .

"'I have had my last Guinness and Sam Adams. Heineken was always slop': Catholic League president Bill Donohue (pictured) called for a boycott of the companies that supported LGBT groups by pulling out of Monday's St. Patrick's Day Parade in New York . The president of the Catholic League has called for a boycott of the beer companies that pulled out of Monday's St. Patrick's Day Parade and blames LGBT 'bullies.' Bill Donohue posted to his organization's website Tuesday and called for all his followers to immediately stop drinking Heineken, Sam Adams and Guinness. Though some will be more difficult than others. 'I have had my last Guinness and Sam Adams. Heineken was always slop, so there is no sacrifice there,' writes Donohue. 'I urge Catholics, and all those who believe in tolerance, diversity, and the First Amendment, to join with me in boycotting these brews.' Donohue says the companies are 'discriminating' Irish Catholics everywhere by declining to sponsor the parade, which has for decades refused to allow gay groups to march under banners that designate them as such. 'None of these companies believe in diversity. No gay person has ever been barred from marching in any St. Patrick’s Day parade, anymore than the parade bans pro-life Catholics or vegetarian Catholics,' he wrote. The hard-line religious leader even tried to characterize the issue as a constitutional one. 'The bullies also have nothing but contempt for the constitutional rights of Irish Catholics,' he writes. 'I urge Catholics, and all those who believe in tolerance, diversity, and the First Amendment, to join with me in boycotting these brews.' Guinness dropped out of the New York . City St Patrick's Day parade to support gay rights, just a day before . the 250-year-old event was set to take place. Constitutional? The hard-line group's leader characterized the corporate move as a violation of over 'the constitutional rights of Irish Catholics' Came as a shock? Guinness announced it would be pulling its sponsorship of the 250-year-old parade just a day before it was held . The Irish beer company decided to pull sponsorship from the parade after the owners of legendary New York gay bar The Stonewall Inn threatened to stop serving the draught. A Guinness spokesperson said the company was hoping the organizers would reverse their exclusionary policy in time for the Monday parade, but since the rules weren't changed the company decided to withdraw participation. 'Guinness has a strong history of . supporting diversity and being an advocate for equality for all...We . will continue to work with community leaders to ensure that future . parades have an inclusionary policy' the statement read. Following the statement, The Stonewall Inn said it would continue to serve Guinness. Guinness . was the third beer company to drop sponsorship of an American St . Patrick's Day Parade this year in support of gay rights. Demonstrators protested as members of the NYPD marched during the St. Patrick's Day parade, which was short three beer sponsors, in New York . About one million spectators streamed into New York on Monday for its St. Patrick's Day Parade, which was even boycotted by Mayor Bill de Blasio . Days before, both Sam Adams and Heineken pulled out of the parade citing the exclusionary policies and Mayor Bill DeBlasio broke with decades of tradition when he announced he'd support the LGBT community by enjoying the Irish celebration elsewhere. Currently Ford is the last major American company to continue its sponsorship of the parade. In a statement issued to CNBC last week, the motor company said it sponsors a 'wide range of events' across teh country and that no one event 'reflects Ford's views on every issue.' New York City St. Patrick's Day Parade is one of the U.S.'s oldest Irish traditions. It marched for the first time more than 250 years ago, on March 17, 1762 - 14 years before the Declaration of Independence.","Heinken as well as Sam Adams and even Guinness dropped out of New York's St. Patrick's Day parade in support of banned LBGT groups .

"Ben Bernanke used to run America's central bank. Now he's making bank - charging financial gurus across the world millions to share his insight and experience. Bernanke used to make $200,000 a year during his eight years as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. He can make that in a single hour now on the international speaking circuit. He left office in February. By March, he was making up to three stops a week around the world. Bernanke is walking a well-worn path of former policy makers who leave power. Former presidents, former cabinet officials and former members of Congress have all turned their experience in public service into millions. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has hit the speaking circuit since leaving office in February - raking in millions in just a few months . Bankers from New York to Houston, Texas, . to Singapore and Johannesburg, South Africa, are lining to pay Bernanke . hundreds of thousand of dollars for private appearances. But not everyone thinks his time is so valuable. The New York Times reports that Goldman Sachs and UBS both decided his fees were too high for what he was offering. Indeed, guests at his private lectures have said most of his economic insight is simply a repeat what he said for eight years while he was in office. 'You can spend $250,000 for Bernanke’s time at a private dinner, or you could just sit down and read what people like (new Fed Chairwoman) Janet Yellen and (Bank of England governor) Mark Carney have to say,' David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff, told the New York Times. 'You can actually do that for free and pretty much draw the same conclusions.' Most bankers, though are willing to pay Bernanke's fee - and trade on the insight he gives. Michael E. Novogratz, a principal of Fortress Investment Group told the Times that Bernanke has reinforced the idea that the economy and inflation are going to grow much more slowly than previously thought. Investors responded by buying up fixed-income investments. Bernanke's post-Fed speeches, Mr Novogratz says, are responsible for part of the recent surge in demand for government bonds. 'I think that the markets and investors will put more credence on what Bernanke says,' Mr Rosenberg told the Times. 'There is a pervasive belief that Bernanke and Yellen are joined at the hip.'","Ben Bernanke made $200,00 a year as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Now he makes that in a single hour .

"In the latest blunder for an Obama administration ambassadorial nominee, prolific Democratic campaign fundraiser Noah Mamet admitted Thursday that he has never been to Argentina – the nation where he wants to represent U.S. interests as America's top diplomat. The White House has tapped him to be the U.S. ambassador to the South American country. 'Mr. Mamet have you been to Argentina,' asked Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio during the Californian's confirmation hearing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ambassador: Noah Mamet has never been to Argentina, but he's President Obama's pick to be the U.S.' next ambassador to the South American nation . 'I haven't had the opportunity yet to be there,' he admitted, ashen-faced. 'I've traveled pretty extensively around the world, but I haven't yet had the chance.' Mamet, like other ambassadorial nominees, raised copious amounts of campaign cash for President Obama – at least $500,000 during the 2012 campaign cycle, and another $500,000 or more in 2008 according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. There's nothing new about fundraisers being rewarded with cushy posts overseas, but they usually have some genuine qualifications for directing U.S. foreign policy in the country where they end up. Mamet's embarrassing showing comes after a similar face-palm moment from George Tsunis in January who told Arizona Sen. John McCain that he, too, had never visited the country where he asked to be posted. 'Mr. Tsunis, have you been to Norway?' McCain asked. 'I have not,' Tsunis admitted. Norway: George Tsunis has never been to Norway, and doesn't know much about it - but he's our new Ambassador . The Long Island hotel magnate who has bundled and contributed at least $1.3 million to Obama and other Democrats, proceeded to deliver what one Scandinavian newspaper called a 'faltering, incoherent performance,' saying among other things that Norway has a 'president.' The nation is actually a constitutional monarchy, much like the United Kingdom, with both a King and a parliament. Tsunis also gaffed when he described the Progress Party, an anti-immigration political group with seven cabinet ministers among its members, as a part of 'fringe elements' that 'spew their hatred.' 'Norway has been very quick to denounce them,' he said, before McCain corrected him and pointed out that they are an integral part of Norway's coalition government. Tsunis once contributed $50,000 to McCain's Senate campaign before defecting to the Democratic side and collecting more than $1 million to send Barack Obama to the White House. Hungary: Soap opera producer Colleen Bell doesn't know what the U.S. interests are in Hungary - yet, she's the new ambassador . He won Senate confirmation this week, as did Max Baucus, a former U.S. senator who is to be the U.S. ambassador to China. Faced with a tough question last week during his confirmation hearing about Chinese military provocation against Japan in the East China Sea, Baucus said plainly, 'I'm no expert on China.' The prize for ambassadorial cluelessness, though, may go to Colleen Bell, an Obama bundler who put $800,000 in play for Democrats. She's trading in her work as producer of the soap opera 'The Bold and the Beautiful' to become ambassador to Hungary. Asked by McCain to describe America's strategic interests in that nation, she launched into a rambling response worthy of a teen beauty pageant contestant. China: Newly crowned Ambassador to China Max Baucus freely admits that he's 'no real expert' on the Asian nation . 'Well, we have – our strategic interests, in terms of what are our key priorities in Hungary,' Bell began, 'I think our key priorities are to improve upon, as I mentioned, the security relationship and also the law enforcement and to promote business opportunities, increase trade ... Our strategic interests are to work collaboratively as NATO allies.' 'To work to promote and protect the security, both – for both countries and for – and for the world,' she rambled on, 'to continue working together on the cause of human rights around the world, to build that side of our relationship while also maintaining and pursuing some difficult conversations that might be necessary in the coming years.'","Noah Mamet bundled at least $1 million in campaign donations to President Obama's two presidential election campaigns, and now he's in line to be the U.S. ambassador to Argentina .

"In a stunning speech on the Fox News Channel, commentator Greg Gutfeld predicted that if a bank taxation scheme like the one that shocked Cypriots should come to America, gun owners would aim at government officials -- and shoot to kill. 'While Cypriots can own guns, it’s a bear to get them,' Gutfeld noted on the popular talk show The Five. 'There is no . gun culture there, which then allows the government to wonder of its . docile populace: ""What are they gonna do -- shoot us?""' 'Well, in America,' he sniped, 'yes, we will shoot you.' Scroll down for video . The cast of Fox News Channel's The Five includes (L to R) Andrea Tantaros, Bob Beckel, Eric Bolling, Dana Perino and (far right) The Joy Of Hate author Greg Gutfeld, who predicted 'war' if US government officials ever levied taxes on existing bank accounts . Gutfeld, who also . hosts the late night news-comedy show Red Eye, is author of the . snark-filled book The Joy Of Hate. Americans learned Monday that Cypriots would be subject to a 6.75 per cent tax on bank accounts of €100,000 ($129,500) and below. Amounts above €100,000 will incur a 9.9 per cent tax, which goes up to 15 per cent for balances over €500,000 ($647,000). 'The wholesale robbery has caused citizens to rush to get their money out. The response? The banks closed. So how can a government assume that it can get away with this? Because they assume they can get away with this.' 'Gun control advocates mock gun owners over their belief that guns will protect us from government tyranny,' said the popular Fox News host. 'But ask yourself this: What would happen if the government here tried to take over your bank account? War. It would be on.' The Second Amendment to the US Constitution guarantees that 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.' But new gun . control measures have popped up at the state and federal level in the wake of the December Newtown, Connecticut school shooting, which left 20 children and six adults dead. Among the advocates of tighter restrictions on guns is Vice President Joe Biden, who claimed during a Feb. 19 Facebook event that women could protect themselves from attackers by firing a loaded shotgun into the air. Gutfeld isn't impressed. Gutfeld said Americans would revolt with their firearms and shoot government officials if the US economy ever needed a bailout like the one that the EU has extended to Cyprus. That plan requires a tax on all bank accounts in the country, seizing as much as 15 per cent of account holders' money . With a holstered gun on his side, David McElroy (left) participates in an anti-Obama administration protest rally in defense of the US Constitution's Second Amendment. Vice President Joe Biden (right) has supported bans on the sale of high-powered rifles, telling women they should fire shotguns into the air to scare off attackers . 'Cyprus just proved that Joe Biden's notion of ""all you need is a shotgun"" is deeply flawed,' he said. 'Sadly, though, this ""steal from the rich"" mentality is alive and well in America. Remember Occupy Wall Street? And how different is the Cyprus solution from the class warfare rhetoric that demands your wealth gets spread around? 'The defense against this toxic ideology isn't only reason, but it's reason with a rifle. So, yeah, it'll never happen here. And you have the good sense of our founding fathers to thank for it.' Biden's advice about firing shotgun warning-shots became the subject of a YouTube parody video, showing women knocked backward by the force of firing a shotgun. It quickly racked up 1.6 million views.","EU bailout will force Cypriots to sacrifice up to 15 per cent of their savings .

"A Utah-based gun manufacturer has turned down a $15 million deal to supply Pakistan with precision rifles over concerns they could eventually be used against U.S. troops. Mike Davis, sales manager at Desert Tech, said the company was on a short list for a contract with Pakistan, but spurned the opportunity because of unrest in Pakistan and ethical concerns. It was a difficult decision because of the amount of money involved, he said, and the sale of rifles to Pakistan would have been legal. Scroll down for video .

The company, based in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Valley City, was founded in 2007 on the principle of keeping America and its allies safe, he added. 'As a business owner you always want to be successful, but I think ethically and morally you want to go about it the right way and stick behind your founding principles,' Davis told KSL.

"Hillary Rodham Clinton, a likely Democratic Party standard-bearer in the 2016 presidential contest, staked out her military-related positions in the 2008 race based on how they would play politically, according to a former secretary of defense who served in both the Obama and Bush administrations. Describing a 'remarkable' exchange he witnessed, Robert Gates writes in a book due out next week that 'Hillary told the president that her opposition to the [2007] surge in Iraq had been political because she was facing him in the Iowa primary.' Obama, too, 'conceded vaguely that [his] opposition to the Iraq surge had been political,' Gates recounts. 'To hear the two of them making these admissions, and in front of me, was as surprising as it was dismaying.' And Gates recounts how, as the . president lost faith in Gen. David Petraeus' handling of hostilities in . Afghanistan, he – Gates – lost faith in Obama's commitment to . accomplishing much of anything. 'As . I sat there,' he recalls, 'I thought: The president doesn’t trust his . commander, can’t stand [President Hamid] Karzai, doesn’t believe in his . own strategy and doesn’t consider the war to be his.' 'For him, it’s all about getting out.' Scroll down for video . Hillary Clinton staked out her Iraq policy in late 2006 not on a military calculation, but based on how she could aid her soon-to-come presidential campaign, according to Gates' memoir . U.S. President George W. Bush authorized a troop surge in Iraq, a move that most Democrats criticized at the time -- including Barack Obama and other prominent liberal presidential contenders . Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has given Republicans something to wave around in 2016, with new revelations about President Obama's war rationale and Hillary Clinton's preference for politics over principle . Gates . puts on paper his reflections about Obama's own troop surge, a move of . 30,000 armed personnel into Afghanistan meant to stabilize the country . in advance of a final all-out troop withdrawal. The commander-in-chief, he says, was 'skeptical if not outright convinced it would fail.' 'I never doubted Obama’s support for the troops,' Gates insists, 'only his support for their mission.' Ultimately, Gates nearly quit over Obama's hand-wringing about Afghanistan, he writes. The Bush administration hold-over reveals in his memoir that he was 'deeply uneasy with the Obama White House’s lack of appreciation – from the top down – of the uncertainties and unpredictability of war.' Describing a contentious day when Obama evaluated his Afghanistan strategy, Gates recalls: 'I came closer to resigning that day than at any other time in my tenure, though no one knew it.' Mrs. Clinton's cameo in the book is more brief but equally damning. Hillary Clinton's portrait as first lady hangs in the White House, but she wants a 'Madame President' version to accompany it -- a goal that's complicated by her past political record . Gates describes Obama as a feckless commander-in-chief who was less interested in winning wars than in taking political advantage of withdrawing America from them . While a U.S. senator and former first lady, she announced in the . days leading up to her entry in the 2008 White House race that that she . opposed the George W. Bush administration's 'surge' of 20,000 troops in . Iraq. At the time, she . proposed a freeze in the number of active military troops there, and . suggested instead that more U.S. forces should be sent to Afghanistan to . protect against a feared Taliban offensive. In late 2006, nearly two years before . the Democrats' nominating convention, Clinton could not afford to be . seen as hawkish when other Democrats – especially Obama, her presumed . principal opponent – were blaming President Bush for putting ever-more . boots on the ground in the Middle East. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates' memoirs will go on sale January 17 . In . the Senate, she had voted in favor of an October 2002 use-of-force . resolution that put the United States on war footing against Iraq, . following allegations that the dictator Saddam Hussein possessed weapons . of mass destruction. Gates praises Clinton elsewhere in his memoir, titled 'Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War.' The Washington Post published the first preview of the book on Tuesday. She . struck him, he writes, as 'smart, idealistic but pragmatic, . tough-minded, indefatigable, funny, a very valuable colleague, and a . superb representative of the United States all over the world.' Gates has harsh words for the sitting vice president as well. Joe Biden, he writes, 'has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.' And the veep, he says, spent his time and attention 'poisoning the well' against Pentagon leaders in order to influence Obama toward leaning more on his domestic political advisers hen tough military decisions had to be made. And he described in a Wall Street Journal essay adapted from his book that he resented the Obama White House's National Security Staff (NSS) for its habit of interfering in military affairs. 'Most of my conflicts with the Obama administration during the first two years weren't over policy initiatives from the White House,' Gates declares, 'but rather the NSS's micromanagement and operational meddling, which I routinely resisted.' 'For an NSS staff member to call a four-star combatant commander or field commander would have been unthinkable when I worked at the White House – and probably cause for dismissal. It became routine under Obama. I directed commanders to refer such calls to my office.' 'The controlling nature of the Obama White House,' says Gates, 'and its determination to take credit for every good thing that happened while giving none to the career folks in the trenches who had actually done the work, offended Secretary Clinton as much as it did me.' Obama, shown during a 2010 trip to Afghanistan, doubted that his own troop surge in that country would meet with any success, Gates writes, but he ultimately decided to pull out of the country in order to help his re-election chances . Gates writes that Biden was 'wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades' -- but the White House rushed to the VP's defense . In a short statement Tuesday evening from the White House, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said President Obama 'disagrees with Secretary . Gates' assessment.' 'Joe Biden has been one of the . leading statesmen of his time,' Hayden said, 'and has helped advance America's . leadership in the world. President Obama relies on his good counsel . every day.' But Obama had nothing specific to say about Gates' accusation that he was a cynical and ineffective commander-in-chief whose foreign policy positions were more about politics than principle. 'Deliberations over our policy on Afghanistan have been widely reported on over the years,' the statement continued, 'and it is well known that the President has been committed to achieving the mission of disrupting, dismantling and defeating al Qaeda, while also ensuring that we have a clear plan for winding down the war, which will end this year.' Gates sees things differently, writing that during his tenure at the Pentagon Obama 'simply wanted to end the ""bad"" war in Iraq and limit the U.S. role in the ""good"" war in Afghanistan.' But the president's stated reasons for pulling out of Iraq and Afghanistan, he claims, 'conflicted with his own pro-war public rhetoric (especially during the 2008 campaign), the nearly unanimous recommendations of his senior civilian and military advisers at the Departments of State and Defense, and the realities on the ground.' Ultimately, he concluded, Obama was 'inexperienced' yet 'determined to change course – and equally determined from day one to win re-election.' 'Domestic political considerations would therefore be a factor, though I believe never a decisive one, in virtually every major national security problem we tackled.'","Robert Gates, secretary of defense under Barack Obama and George W.

"The Xbox Kinect has proven to be extremely good at recognising the human body. Only last week, a group of Japanese researchers used the sensor to create a device that can translate sign language. Now one writer has discovered that Kinect can see human anatomy far better than first thought. Perhaps, a bit too well. Scroll down for video... Mr Wilson noted that the Kinect hardware/software was so effective at distinguishing the bumps and folds of clothing that it could pinpoint a man's package . ‘I noticed, alongside the intricacies of a hoodie and jeans--and there’s no graceful way to put this--a dong,’ said Mark Wilson of Fastco Design. Mr Wilson noted that the Kinect hardware/software was so effective at distinguishing the bumps and folds of clothing that it could pinpoint a man’s package. He made the discovery while testing Microsoft's new and improved Kinect sensor which is due to come out on 22 November. Microsoft unveiled its new Kinect sensor as part of its Xbox One event in June. The sensor will be sold with the new console and both are available from 22 November. It can read up to six skeletons at once, compared to the current two, and its 'small object detection' is said to be two-and-a-half times better. The second-generation Kinect sensor is also able to see faces, track eye movements and detect expressions. It is additionally said to be better at recognising features and body movements in the dark and dimly lit rooms because it uses what's called active infrared (IR). IR works in a similar way to thermal imaging and is used in night-vision goggles, for example. As well as the heart rate monitor, Microsoft's sensor has an increased 'field of view' that is now 60 per cent wider than the current Kinect. The new sensor is also able to see faces, track eye movements and detect expressions. It is additionally said to be better at recognising features and body movements in the dark and dimly lit rooms because it uses what's called active infrared (IR). The filming in the above video was done on the Kinect’s topographical view, which is accessible to all gamers but not often used. ‘The new Kinect certainly isn’t malevolent; it’s just engineering that works a bit too well, and is sharing that a half step more socially than we might want it to be,’ said Mr Wilson. Mr Wilson said that it raises the question of whether Xbox should be censoring some of its images. ‘I’ve learned one thing in 31 years of masculinity, it’s that nobody ever wants to see my placket-racket flopping around in the living room,’ he added.

"Almost 13,000 patients die needlessly from severe infections every year, experts warned yesterday. A study found that opportunities to save lives lost to sepsis are missed because of delays in diagnosis and treatment. The care failures are not only lethal, they cost the NHS more through longer hospital stays, according to research by the Health Service Ombudsman. Sepsis, which is similar to septicaemia, happens when the immune system overreacts to an infection attacking organs such as the heart and liver. Nearly 13,000 patients are dying needlessly from severe infections, say medical experts . It causes fever, inflammation and blood pressure and clotting problems that can lead to multiple organ failure. The ombudsman’s report, published today for World Sepsis Day, looked in detail at ten cases in which patients died through medical failures in the critical first few hours. Problems included lack of early diagnosis, failure to recognise the severity of the illness, delays in treatment, and delay in control of infection. Julie Mellor, who was made health ombudsman in January 2012, said: ‘In the cases in our report, sadly, all patients died. In some of these cases, with better care and treatment, they may have survived. ‘It is time for the NHS to act to save lives by improving the care of patients with sepsis.’ Grandmother Hilary Lovell (right) lost her battle with sepsis on Christmas Day three years ago. She had been feeling poorly the week before, but was diagnosed with flu by her GP. On Christmas Eve  Mrs Lovell, 64, from Embsay, North Yorkshire, became delirious and an ambulance was called. She was immediately diagnosed with  sepsis by the medics. The inflammation caused the grandmother-of-eight to have a heart attack and she died on Christmas morning, two days before her granddaughter Chloe’s first birthday. Her daughter Rhiannon Oliver said: ‘All our lives changed that day. For me, I’d lost my mum and my best friend, my husband had lost a surrogate mum. My children’s loss was the most wonderful and devoted Nanny. All in the space of six days. ‘I’d never heard of sepsis before and I only wish I knew then what I know now. Perhaps then my mum would still be here.’ Mrs Oliver said she believes more should be done to raise awareness among the public and the medical profession. She added: ‘Both the public and the medics need education and awareness of the condition. If I’d have known what symptoms to look for the alarm bells would have rung and we could have sought help quicker. ‘All medics should receive training on entry at medical school. When an estimated 37,000 people a year are dying drastic action really is needed.’ Ron Daniels, of the UK Sepsis Trust, said at least 12,500 lives could be saved a year if hospitals improved their procedures. ‘The best hospitals have achieved better outcomes from sepsis by adopting a simple set of life-saving measures, collectively known as the Sepsis 6, and ensuring that a culture of awareness around sepsis has been created,’ he added. ‘We now need to spread this awareness to other health professionals and to the public. ‘The UK Sepsis Trust welcomes this excellent report from the ombudsman, which exposes common themes where care has failed.’ According to the Royal College of Physicians a doctor should not leave severe sepsis cases until antibiotics have been administered. Intravenous antibiotics are the first line of treatment, along with oxygen, fluids and medication to increase blood pressure, but in many cases patients are not referred in time to critical care facilities. Dialysis for kidney failure and breathing support for respiratory failure are necessary for the worst cases. Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘This report shows the tragic consequences of sepsis and raises an important issue for everyone in health care. ‘It is vital that all staff are provided with training and support to enable them to recognise the signs and symptoms of sepsis, and crucially to know how to act quickly when sepsis is diagnosed.’ Experts say sepsis is becoming more common, partly because of a rising number of elderly people with weakened immune systems or underlying diseases such as cancer. The illness accounts for 100,000 hospital admissions each year, with around 37,000 people dying. The most common causes are pneumonia, bowel perforation, urinary infection and severe skin infections. Mike Durkin, who is director of patient safety for NHS England, said: ‘We all need in every setting to understand the importance of identifying deterioration in both adults and children, in reducing the admission of full-term babies to neonatal care and identifying problems in vulnerable older people in the first 48 hours of acute illness.’ Sepsis is different to septicaemia in that the infection is not limited to the blood and can be caused by a viral or fungal source as well as a bacterial one.","The delays are causing almost 13,000 deaths a year, say experts .

"Needing help: More than 2,100 women have been treated in London hospitals since 2010 for female genital mutilation injuries . More than 2,100 victims of female genital mutilation have been treated in London hospitals since 2010, it emerged today. Almost 300 women needed surgery to help them recover from the brutal ritual, new figures have revealed. Among those treated in the capital's hospitals included 12 children, including one girl who had been left with an 'open wound' following the criminal act. Despite being illegal in the UK, female . genital mutilation is on the rise with an estimated 66,000 women . dealing with the after-effects and more than 20,000 young girls thought . to be at risk. The procedure is associated with communities in Africa, particularly Mali, Somalia, Sudan and Kenya, as well as some parts of the Middle East. Many girls living in Britain are taken to these countries for be 'cut', and some will be as young as five. But it is becoming more prevalent in the UK and  experts say today's figures are 'truly shocking' but there are 'far more victims' than the data shows. In the majority of cases the clitoris is removed because it gives sexual pleasure. A total of 2,115 FGM patients were seen between 2010 and now, the Evening Standard has revealed. Dr Comfort Momoh, a specialist in dealing with these injuries at St Thomas’ Hospital, said: 'These statistics show a very significant number of women are being . treated for FGM. 'But there are still lots out there who are not being . identified because they don’t know where to go for help, aren’t being . referred by GPs or are too scared to come forward.

I was scared and instinctively started running. When I was caught, I was taken into a room filled with instruments I didn't recognise,' she said. 'The woman I was so afraid of was there waiting for me. She scolded me for running away, telling me how difficult it was to obtain equipment like this; how ungrateful I was. 'I blacked out before she started cutting. I'm still not sure whether it was the anaesthetic or pure fear'. When Ali woke, she was . in agony with her legs bound together.

"The girlfriend of one of the three men brutally killed in a Waltham, Massachusetts apartment in 2011 has revealed that she told police soon after the murders that Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been a frequent visitor to the apartment. The woman, who hasn’t been named, was the girlfriend of Brendan Mess, 25. On Sept. 11, 2011 she found his dead body along with those of Erik Weissman, 31, and Raphael Teken, 37. Earlier this week Chechan immigrant Ibragim Todashev, 27, was killed by FBI agents but not before he implicated himself and Tsarnaev in the 2011 triple slaying. Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, left, was implicated earlier this week in the 2011 murder of Brendan Mess, right . A homicide investigation into the 2011 slayings had appeared to have stalled until friends and relatives of Mess reported a possible link to Tsarnaev after his picture was released as a suspect in last month bombings. The woman, an African immigrant, also revealed that prior to his death, Mess had kept a handgun in his apartment but that police had told her after the bodies were discovered that it was missing. It is believed that Mess’s missing gun was the same weapon Tsarnaev used when he shot MIT police Officer Sean Collier dead on the night of April 18 and wounded other officers shortly afterwards in the shoot-out in Watertown, Boston. Tsarnaev and Mess had been close friends, so when the woman identified the bombing suspect to police it had been as someone who was a frequent visitor to the apartment, rather than as a possible suspect in the triple homicide. Murdered: Raphael Teken (left with a friend) and Erik Weissman (right) were also killed in the 2011 triple slaying . Police did not ask her about Tsarnaev after she gave them his name, she said. 'But if they questioned everyone whose fingerprints were in the apartment, I’m sure Tam’s fingerprints had to be there,’' she told the Boston Globe. In the weeks before the killings, the woman said Mess had Tsarnaev had told Mess that the FBI had placed him on a terrorist watch list. 'Brendan said, ""The FBI is watching him; they think he’s a terrorist,""' the woman said. 'We laughed about it. We never took it seriously.’' It was Mess' girlfriend who had found . the victim's bodies, their throats had been slit, they have been . covered with marijuana and there was also $5,000 cash in the home. 'I just can’t believe Tam would back . stab Brendan like that,' she said. 'It’s so painful to me, because . Brendan was so open and loving with Tam.' Confession: Todashev had allegedly admitted to being involved in the 2011 slaying and that he was preparing to sign a written statement based on his confession when he turned violent and was subsequently shot dead earlier this week . Investigation: An FBI evidence response team enters an apartment after an agent shot and killed Ibragim Todashev who was questioned in connection with the Boston Marathon bombings . 'They were pretty peaceful people, but I know Brendan had one gun,' his girlfriend said. 'I think it was for protection. I don’t understand why he couldn’t have used it' during the deadly assault. Todashev was fatally shot by an FBI . agent at his condo near Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida just after . midnight on Wednesday. He had allegedly turned violent as he . was preparing to sign a written confession to his and Tsarnaevs involvement in the 2011 . triple homicide, said authorities.

Police troopers, and other law enforcement personnel were interviewing . an individual in connection with the Boston Marathon bombing . investigation when a violent confrontation was initiated by the . individual,' the FBI said in a statement.

Investigators said Todashev had implicated himself and Tsarnaev in the . gruesome triple slaying in which three men were found on Sept. 11, 2011 . with their throats cut and marijuana covering their bodies. Law enforcement sources told NBC that the two men carried out the 2011 killings when a drug deal that turned violent.

"The older of the two Boston Marathon ‘bombers’married his Muslim convert wife in a quickie ceremony in a cramped office above a mosque in front of just five friends and family, MailOnline can reveal today. Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Katherine Russell exchanged vows and were given an Islamic blessing in June 2010 as they stood in front of a cluttered desk with a dusty filing cabinet to their side. The few onlookers squeezed into the 8-foot-by-12foot room and would have had to move a patio chair outside so they could all fit. It is not clear if their parents even attended the 15 minute service which did not end with the bride and groom kissing but instead concluded with a simple handshake from the Imam. Cramped: This is the tiny office in the Masjid of The Quran Mosque in Dorchester, Massachusetts, where Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Katherine Russell were married . Quickie wedding: Tsarnaev called the imam at the mosque and asked 'out of the blue' if he would perform the wedding ceremony . Secret? It's unknown whether either Tsarnaev's family or Ms Russell's family knew about the wedding or approved of it at the time . The unlikely location of the mosque - a 15 minute drive from the home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that the couple were sharing - suggests they may have wanted to avoid the scrutiny of their families as they ‘just wanted to get married’. It is also not clear if their mothers and fathers approved of the wedding - Tamerlan’s mother Zubeidat arranged marriages for his two sisters - but by that stage Katherine may have already been pregnant with their child, now aged around three. A few months earlier she had quit her communications degree at Suffolk College near the end of her third out of four years. Tamerlan set up the wedding by phoning Imam Taalib Mahdee at the Masjid al Quran mosque in a run-down area of Dorchester, Massachusetts, out of the blue and asking him to officiate. The ceremony took place in his third floor office above the mosque which is up a creaky and badly lit set of wooden stairs. Legally wed: Tsarnaev and Ms Russell filed the paperwork to get married on  June 21, 2010. Ms Russell may have already been pregnant with the couple's daughter . Handshake: Imam Taalib Mahdee performed the 15-minute ceremony in his office. It ended with him shaking the hands of the bride and groom . Inside there is just enough room for a desk, a bookcase at the back and a dust-covered TV on the floor. The two windows are covered with gold curtains with patterns on them and there is a coat stand on which Imam Mahdee keeps his ceremonial white robe. The service took place on June 21 2010. Speaking to MailOnline, Imam Mahdee said: ‘I only saw him for 15 minutes. ‘His wife asked if I could marry them and I said as long as you have your licence I will be able to marry you. They got the licence and I married them and that was it. I didn't know him before.’ Imam Mahdee said that he recalls giving a blessing about ‘the importance of the institution of marriage, being respectful of each other and the vows you take, you take a sacred vow to live under the banner or shade of God.' There were about five people present and witnesses but he could not recall if any of them were parents. The imam condemned the bombing of the Boston Marathon and said he never could have foreseen that Tsarnaev would commit such an act . He said: ‘They were happy to get married. ‘We opened up with a prayer, the first chapter of The Koran. We would recognise what they were doing and the sacred bond of marriage, they gave their vows and that's it. ‘Some people want a 30 minute marriage, some people want an hour marriage. They just wanted to get married, so it was a 15 minute marriage.’ It is not clear if Katherine had already converted to Islam at that stage as, under Muslim law, a Muslim man can marry somebody from outside the religion so long as he is a believer. Imam Mahdee said there was no kiss for the bride at the end of the service. He said ‘We don't have that as part of the ceremony. After they took their vows, we gave each other the greetings and left. ‘We said As-Salamu Alaykum, or peace be upon you, shook hands and left.’ The . wedding certificate, which MailOnline has obtained, lists the groom as . Tamerlan Anzorovich Tsarnaev and Katherine Osborn Russell as the bride. He was born in Kalmykia in Russia and she lists her place of birth as El Paso, Texas. Tamerlan’s . job is listed as a driver whilst Katherine says she is a student. She . later became a healthcare assistant working 80 hours a week whilst he . stayed at home with their child. Attention: Ms Russell has received large amounts of national attention since it was revealed that she converted to Islam and married Tamerlan Tsarnaev . Tsarnaev is believed to have 'self-radicalized' over his hatred of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and his feeling that he needed to 'defend Islam' Two months later the newlyweds took their wedding certificate to a registrar who signed it off and put her own signature on it, making it official in the state of Massachusetts. Asked what he thought about the Boston Marathon bombings, which Tamerlan allegedly carried out with younger brother Dzhokhar, 19, Imam Mahdee said it was ‘terrible’. Tamerlan died in a hail of bullets as the pair tried to flee police and Dzhokhar sustained serious injuries. He has now been charged over the deaths of three people and the injuries sustained to more than 180. Imam Mahdee said: ‘When somebody hurts people for political reasons, it's a terrible circumstance. ‘I don't think any religion can justify the things that people do todayunder the guise of religion. ‘When someone is asking to get married you're not looking into the future. ‘You're looking at that time that you're with that couple. You expect that that couple that's in front of you will live a good God-conscious life. ‘You don't perceive what happens (later).’","Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Katherine Russell were married in the small office of an imam at a mosque in Dorchester, Massachusetts, in 2010 .

"An award-winning novelist says doctors should be allowed to help terminally ill patients to die without the threat of prosecution, it was reported today. Julian Barnes, whose wife, literary agent Pat Kavanagh, died of cancer four years ago, said: ''I've always been in favour of suicide. I always thought it was every human's right to kill yourself if you want to.' Barnes, 67, won the Man Booker prize for his 2011 novel The Sense of an Ending about a man's investigation into the mysterious suicide of a friend. Couple: Man Booker prize novelist Julian Barnes in 2005 with his wife Pat Kavanagh who died of cancer in 2008 . He criticised British laws which force terminally ill patients to travel to the Swiss suicide clinic Dignitas to take their own lives - putting their families at risk of prosecution. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph ahead of the paper's sponsored Hay Festival in Cartagena, Colombia, he insisted he would rather kill himself than go to Switzerland. Award-winning: Author Julian Barnes who says doctors should be allowed to assist suicides . 'I view it is as a human right rather than . a sort of slippery slope which will end with people knocking off granny . because she's got a cottage that they might inherit,' he said. The novelist claimed that 'in the good old days' doctors used to 'knock people off all the time'  to end the patient's suffering. He said he had heard of a doctor who had ended the life a colleague dying of cancer with a fatal drug overdose. Currently, assisted suicides are illegal in Britain, but a recent guidelines mean that families can escape charges if they are found to have acted purely on compassionate grounds. Barnes, who has a new book due to be published in April, told the Telegraph that doctors should be trained how to tell families that their loved ones are terminally ill. Speaking to writer Matthew Bayley he said: 'Doctors are really not . trained to do it. Anyone who has had experience of hospitals knows the . curious combination of technical brilliance and human inadequacy and . lack of human training.' Barnes is the latest author to back a change in the law to allow assisted suicide following demands from Martin Amis and Ian McEwan . Amis caused controversy in 2010 when he called for 'euthanasia booths' for the elderly so they could kill themselves with a 'martini and a medal'.","Julian Barnes hits out at British laws which force patients to travel to Switzerland to take their lives... and put families at risk of prosecution .

"The Christian calendar is based on a blunder by a sixth-century monk who was several years out in his calculation of Jesus’s birth date, the Pope has claimed. Benedict XVI blames the ‘mistake’ on Dionysius Exiguus, who is credited with inventing the modern calendar based on the Anno Domini (AD) era. The Pope’s views are revealed in the final part of his three-volume work on the life of Jesus, published yesterday. Calculations: Pope Benedict XVI (left, pictured yesterday) said the Christian calendar is based on a blunder by a sixth-century monk. The claims were made in his new book (right), The Infancy Narratives: Jesus of Nazareth . ‘The calculation of the beginning of our calendar - based on the birth of Jesus - was made by Dionysius Exiguus, who made a mistake in his calculations by several years,’ he writes. ‘The actual date of Jesus’s birth was several years before.’ Academics have long disputed when Jesus was born, with many believing it was probably between 6BC and 4BC. The Pontiff’s intervention is certain to fuel the debate. The leader of the world’s one billion Catholics is also likely to raise eyebrows with his claim in the book that donkeys and other animals do not have a place in the traditional nativity scene. Not like this: The leader of the world's one billion Catholics is also likely to raise eyebrows with his claim in the book that donkeys and other animals do not have a place in the traditional nativity scene . St Peter’s Square in the heart of the . Vatican City regularly has a large Christmas scene with an array of . animals, but the Pope is certain their inclusion is historically . inaccurate. ‘In the gospels, there is no mention of animals,’ he writes. 'The calculation of the beginning of our calendar - based on the birth of Jesus - was made by Dionysius Exiguus, who made a mistake in his calculations by several years. The actual date of Jesus’s birth was several years before' Pope Benedict XVI . He believes that they were probably a pre-Christian Hebrew invention, as outlined in the Old Testament Book of Habakkuk, considered by some to predict the nativity. The Pope, 85, also says angels never sang to shepherds to proclaim Christ’s birth, as celebrated in the carol Hark! The Herald Angels Sing. Jesus of Nazareth: The Infancy Narratives hit bookshops in 50 countries yesterday, with more than a million copies planned for the initial print run. In it, the Pope interprets the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, which describe the months just before and after Jesus’s birth.","Pope Benedict XVI blames 'mistake' on .

"It has withstood the Earth's elements for more than 150 years and yet this spectacular church remains the tallest wooden structure in the world. The magnificent building is made entirely of wood, from the frame to the rivets and the stunning exterior, and shows just how resilient this construction material is. Standing at 123 feet tall (37.5m), it is believed to still be the world's tallest entirely wooden building - a record it has kept its entire existence. Incredible: This impressive Kizhi Pogost church, on Kizhi island, west Russia, is not only the world's tallest entirely wooden building , but it is also more than 150 years old . Stunning: Bathed in the sun, the aged wooden domes of the incredible church look silver and decadent . Craftsmanship: The sheer scale of the skill involved in creating such an enormous, beautiful snd purposeful wooden building is only fully appreciated up close . The Russian Orthodox Church buildings, called Kizhi Pogost, are 150-miles east of the Russian border with Finland. After pleas from churchgoers, the wooden buildings have undergone some renovation, but still without using any other materials. The impressive domes of the two churches tower over the surrounding countryside and were designed to attract the Christian community of this remote wilderness to one spot on a small island called Kizhi on the waters of Lake Onega. The churches were built in the 18th century and the complex was finally finished without hammering a single nail or other metal fastener in 1862 when the bell-tower was completed. The vast size of the church is only appreciated once set against the tiny figures, beside the entrance on the left . Design: Few wooden structures have since been built to such intricate and eye-catching designs . To this day, the fully-wooden buildings on the small island of Kizhi, serve as a Russian Orthodox church for the surround rural communities . Topped with 22 domes called cupolas and an internal vault shaped like a pyramid there are 102 religious icons from the 17th and 18th centuries displayed inside the structure. The bell tower was created by visionary carpenter Sysoj Osipov and the larger northern Church of Transfiguration was a mecca for pilgrims of the eastern Orthodox Christian Church. The Kizhi Pogost is such a rare example of religious architecture that the churches, which are still regularly used, were listed as a world heritage site by UNESCO . Little appears to has changed on the inside of the church in the last 150 years, where basic needs are served for in basic ways . The tallest wooden structure in the world is said to be the 600-foot-tall ATLAS-I (Air Force Weapons Lab Transmission Aircraft Simulator) near Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA. However this Cold War structure uses metal parts to hold together its huge wooden frame.

"A T-shirt with a joke about the child abuse allegations surrounding disgraced DJ and TV presenter Jimmy Savile and Gary Glitter is being sold on auction site eBay. The T-shirt shows paedophile former pop star Gary Glitter wearing the once-iconic 'Jim Fixed It For Me' medallion that Savile handed out to youngsters who appeared on the hit show Jim'll Fix It. Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, is alleged to have raped a 13-year-old girl in Savile's BBC dressing room in the 1970s.The 68-year-old former pop star, who was convicted of possessing child porn in 1999 and found guilty of molesting a pair of girls aged ten and 11 by a Vietnamese court in 2006, may face arrest over the accusations, according to a source quoted in The People. Is that supposed to be funny?: The shirt sells for £8 on auction site eBay. The NSPCC has condemned it as 'distressing' For sale: The T-shirt's listing on eBay. Four people have already bought the £8 item of clothing . The £8 T-shirt, available on eBay from seller blludog, has been purchased by four people already. Another T-shirt has a picture of Savile with the 'a' in his name replaced with an 'o' to read 'So Vile'. Other items available on the auction site include an authentic 'Jim Fixed it for Me' medallion, which has attracted two bids with an asking price of £79.99, badges, a soap on a rope, autographs and signed photos. Children's charity NSPCC has criticised the shirt and believes it will cause 'distress'. An NSPCC spokesperson said: 'It’s hard to believe that anyone would make jokes about child sexual abuse. We hope that most people would not purchase such a T-shirt due to the distress it is likely to cause. 'It takes a lot of courage for the victims of child abuse to speak out and the NSPCC is here 24 hours a day to provide help and advice on 0808 800 5000.' Last week Karin Ward made claims that she was abused at 14, along with two fellow pupils of Duncroft Approved School for Girls, the Surrey school where Savile is accused of preying on under-age girls. Allegations: A still from Glitter's appearance on Jim'll Fix It in 1991. A woman claims Glitter and Savile sexually abused under age girls at the same time in Savile's dressing room at the BBC . Karin Ward told a documentary maker she saw Gary Glitter have sex with an underage girl in Jimmy Savile's dressing room . She told ITV News the three girls were taken to Savile’s dressing room at BBC Television Centre after being invited to London by the DJ in the 1970s. There she claims to have seen Glitter have sex with the teenager. A joint police and NSPCC inquiry into Savile called Operation Yewtree is underway to investigate the torrent of claims which coincided with the screening of an ITV documentary on Savile, who died last year. Police have already formally recorded eight criminal allegations – two rapes and six of indecent assault - and have identified at least 30 victims. Yesterday it was announced that the BBC will draft in an ‘independent’ troubleshooter to lead an inquiry into the Savile scandal.

"A couple have been arrested after allegedly locking three of their adopted children in a bedroom and starving them - before enjoying a Thanksgiving feast downstairs with their biological son. The alleged treatment at the hands of Larry and Nikki Russell was uncovered when their eldest adopted son escaped  at their Terre Haute, Indiana home on Friday after breaking a window. Wandering barefoot and weighing just 93 . pounds, the 17-year-old boy was picked up by a motorist and taken to Union Hospital, . where staff called police and the Department of Child Services. He told officials the couple doused him and his adopted brothers in urine, bound them to their bed posts, locked them in pitch-black rooms and regularly left them without food and water. 'Abusers': Larry and Nikki Russell, pictured, have been arrested for allegedly abusing their adopted children by tying them to their beds, confining them, starving them and dousing them in urine . Police found five children at the home ranging between 10 and 17 years old, the Indianapolis Star reported. The teenager told officers that, while his adopted parents tucked into dinner alongside their son and another adopted child, three of the boys were left two microwave burritos and half a glass of water. After their Thanksgiving feast, the parents allegedly bound the boy and smacked him across the face, leaving his nose and ear to bleed. He also claimed they shoved balled up socks in his and his adopted brothers' mouths, which were then covered with duct tape. Scene: On Thanksgiving, three of the adopted children were allegedly tied upstairs while the family had dinner . Escape: One boy smashed through a window and a motorist took him to hospital, where staff alerted police . In order to be considered to adopt in Indiana, would-be parents undergo a criminal background check and are fingerprinted for a federal background check. They are then linked with a social worker or a home study agency to undergo a home study. Finally, they complete 16 hours of training into 'birth family issues' and 'adoptive parenting'. To foster, they would undergo 10 hours of training. The Indiana Department of Child . Services said Larry and Nikki Russell had been cleared to become foster parents and adopted the four children earlier this year. They added they cannot comment specifically on the case but will help with the investigation. One neighbouring parent, Kristi Cundiff, has eight adopted children. 'There are good case workers out there that do an awesome job and go above and beyond what they should be doing for children. And there're case workers that aren't so good,' she told News 10. Cundiff said case workers are required to visit the home once a month when the children are in foster care. But visits are not required once the adoption is complete - and are only made when a concern of neglect is filed. But he said the treatment was not an isolated incident; he claimed he and the other children were often doused with urine and left without food or water. He said the couple tied him and two of the other adopted boys to their beds with duct tape and rope, and locked them inside the room, which had boarded-up windows and no light. One boy told police about a horrific incident where Larry Russell allegedly forced another boy to apply IcyHot - a pain relieving heat rub cream - to his genitals and rectum. Police said the alleged abuse apparently came as punishment for stealing food or bladder problems. In another occasion, the parents allegedly taped a 'pull-up' diaper to one of the boys. During his interview with police, the teenager said he had escaped and planned to walk to the courthouse so he could get help. 'In my 19 years with the police force, I've never seen before what's been described by these children, the injuries they sustained and the condition in which they lived,' Assistant Police Chief Shawn Keen said at a press conference. Larry Russell, 39, and Nikki Russell, 35, now face charges of child neglect and criminal confinement. They are being held in Vigo County Jail on $100,000 bond each. Terre Haute Detective Travis Chesshir said the couple acknowledged some of the boy's allegations, but denied others - and blamed much of the alleged abuse on each other. Shock: At a press conference, Assistant Police Chief Shawn Keen called the case the worst he'd seen . Chesshir added that he saw abrasions on the teenager's wrists and ankles that seemed consistent with claims he had been tied to a bed. He also noted blood in the boy's nose and ear. Investigators added that they found duct tape on the boys' beds, yellow rope and locks at the home. DCS spokeswoman Stephanie McFarland confirmed the Russells had been foster parents and had adopted the children earlier this year. The children are now in the care of the state. The couple will appear in Vigo Superir Court on Wednesday.","Four children adopted by Larry and Nikki Russell earlier this year .

'I like to go into a series from the beginning and this is the second series,' he shrugs. 'I don't know what's going to happen to my character but it was fun to film; I got to spend a few weeks in Cape Town with my friend Toby Stephens, who's also in it.' Normally at this time of year Rupert, 43, whose mother is To The Manor Born's Angela Thorne and whose father Peter Penry-Jones was an actor too, would be filming Whitechapel; but that was axed by ITV at the end of last year. He admits he's still surprised and a little bit angry that the channel didn't let the gory detective drama have a fifth and final series. Rupert and his wife Dervla Kikwan in January . 'There was such a great storyline in the last series that it was a shame not to let us finish it off properly,' he says. 'Even if it was just a two-parter to explain what series four was all about it would have been good.' When it began in 2009, Whitechapel attracted ratings of over 8 million but series four last year got just over 3 million, and Rupert wonders whether it was simply because people didn't want to watch grisly goings-on while it was sunny outside. 'ITV put the last series out at the end of the summer holidays; if I was a viewer I wouldn't want to watch Whitechapel then,' he says. 'So we didn't get off to a great start and with ITV it's all about the viewing figures.' We meet not at ITV, but at the BBC's swish central London HQ to discuss the new series of courtroom drama Silk. It's Rupert's first day at work for a while - he's been 'resting' as they say in the business. Not that it sounds that restful. He's taken over childcare duties while his wife Dervla Kirwan appears in West End play The Weir, which means doing the school run for their children Florence, ten, and Peter, seven, every day. When I last spoke to him he told me he can be a little obsessive about tidiness, saying, 'I enjoy cleaning and tidying, Dervla's more chaotic. I think anyone would have OCD if they lived with my wife.' Today he admits he struggled to adapt to the way she ran the house. 'To begin with it was a nightmare. It took me about two or three weeks to get into it and now I feel like the house is running correctly. What was wrong before? Well, we have completely different styles of running the house. I just didn't understand how she did it that way. Let's leave it at that.' On to Silk, the third series of which got off to an explosive start last week when Rupert's character Clive finally made QC and then declared his love for his rival Martha, played by Maxine Peake. Rupert Penry-Jones plays Clive Reader in Silk which got off to an explosive start last week when he declared his love for Martha Costello, played by Maxine Peake (right) Clive's changed a bit over three series, and Rupert says he approves. 'He's a bit more grown up and doesn't want to go to bed with everything that moves. He spends the first half of the new series in love with Martha, then he starts to realise it's not going to work and he has to get on with his life. He also gets more emotionally involved with some of his cases; it's something I asked for. I felt that if Clive never gets involved with them there's not much drama in it. He's a little bit less cut-throat but he still has that edge to him.' This year there are two new characters; his old Spooks friend Miranda Raison plays strong-willed office manager Harriet Hammond, who's determined to conflict with clerk Billy, and bright new trainee barrister Amy Lang, played by Jessica Henwick. There's also a real battle going on within the chambers; between those who want it to become a prosecution-only practice and those who want it to retain its defence work. Rupert was surprised and angry when Whitechapel was axed by ITV last year . The intelligent courtroom drama regularly attracts audiences of over  5 million but - perhaps bitten by his Whitechapel experience - Rupert says he worries this could be the last series. 'I love the show - the cast members and the fabulous dialogue - but it feels a bit like the writer Peter Moffat has thrown a bomb in at the end. It could go on, but it feels like everyone is blasted in different directions and no one knows where each other is. We don't know whether it's been written this way because he wants to finish it off, or whether he thinks it can still continue. None of us knows.' 'If you stay in the same show for too long . you might never get another one because people will only think of you . in that role. It's taken years for people to stop calling me Adam Carter' But Rupert says that, regardless of the writer's intentions, he isn't sure whether he'd come back for a fourth series. 'It would depend partly on what Peter says, but three years is a long time to stay in one role. If you stay in the same show for too long you might never get another one because people will only think of you in that role. It's taken years for people to stop calling me Adam Carter (his Spooks character, and the role that made his name) and it can hold you back.' He sits back and mulls over the dilemma all actors face; whether to take the job and risk being pigeonholed, or not take the job and struggle financially. 'I'm holding off for something different and new and good,' he sighs. 'When offers come in your insecurity comes through, especially when you have a family. You need to make sure you can pay the bills. But I'd like to play something completely different. I'd like to not have to wear a suit.'

"Carefully tiptoeing almost 3000ft above Rio de Janeiro on a thin wire got a bit too much for this adrenaline junkie - so he decided to have a lie down. Fearless Brian Mosbaugh is so used to the perilous heights he decided he deserved a short break and relaxed over the famous Brazilian city. Balancing his whole body on the wire, he lies completely horizontal on the precarious rope before getting back up and strolling across the rest of the highline at Pedra da Gavea.

"They may cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build, but the U.S. Navy is parting with one of its aircraft carriers for a penny, for the second time in two years, . The Navy announced Thursday it’s paying ESCO Marine of Brownsville, Texas, one cent to take the former USS Saratoga off its hands for dismantling and recycling.

'It is emotional in that we who served on ‘Sara’ feel that our ‘surrogate mother’ is passing from our lives,' Sammy King, secretary of the USS Saratoga Association, told FoxNews.com in an email. 'We owe her a lot. We went aboard as ‘snot-nosed kids’ and left as ‘men.’ Some of us are very sad and some are very angry at the decision to scrap her.' The carrier's aircraft flew sorties in the Vietnam War, in Operation Desert Shield and over the states of the former Yugoslavia in 1992. In 1985, fighters from the Saratoga helped capture terrorists who hijacked the cruise ship Achille Lauro in the Mediterranean, forcing a jetliner carrying them to land at an air base in Sicily. After the hijackers surrendered to Egyptian authorities, F-14 fighters launched from the carrier intercepted the Egyptian airliner carrying them to Tunisia and forced it to land at a NATO base in Italy. The carrier was also part of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and air operations over the Balkans in 1992, 1993 and 1994, according to Navy records.

In addition to its pivotal role in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, the USS Saratoga saw duty in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam War and launched the first strikes of the Gulf War against Iraq. It was pulled from service in 1994 and towed to Rhode Island for use as a museum ship, a plan that was never realized because of local funding issues. It is now at Naval Station Newport in Rhode Island and is expected to be towed to Texas in the summer, the Navy said. The Saratoga will follow the former USS Forrestal to dismantling in Texas. That ship was towed to All Star Metals of Brownsville earlier this year, with the Navy paying a penny to the ship recyclers under a contract awarded last October.

Muammar Qaddafi had called the 'Line of Death' USS Saratoga during NATO Operation Strikeback (1957) 'The price reflects the net price proposed by ESCO Marine, which considered the estimated proceeds from the sale of the scrap metal to be generated from dismantling,' the Navy said. 'This is not a sales contract, it is a procurement contract -- $0.01 is the lowest price the Navy could possibly have paid the contractor for the towing and dismantling of ex-Saratoga.' The recyclers make money from selling the metal they salvage from the warships. It's expected the job to dismantle the ship will take about 18 months.

"She was born into a poor family, in a terrible town at the start of the Great Depression, but Irene Triplet can still manage to crack a smile. The 84-year-old, who has lived in an institution since she was 13, is the last child of an American Civil War soldier who is still receiving benefits linked to the conflict and the keeper of an incredible personal story. As the MailOnline revealed last year, each month she is paid $72.13 in VA benefits - totaling $876 a year, thanks to her father, Pvt. Moses Triplett, taking part in the war that ended in 1865 - but more about Irene's tale has been uncovered by the Wall Street Journal. Irene's father, PVT. Triplett, was branded a traitor for fleeing the Confederates and going to fight for the Unionists. Irene Triplett, 84, is the last child of an American Civil War soldier still receiving benefits linked to the conflict, this is her in 2010 along with . historian Jerry Orton . Moses was 83-years-old when he fathered . Irene, following the death of his first wife in the 1920s and a fast . wedding to his second. His new bride, Elida Hall, was nearly 60 years his junior and suffered from a mental disability. Such an age gap was not uncommon at the . time - the women got a good pension and a reliable source of income and . the men got a younger wife who would care for them in their old age. Irene was born prematurely in Wilkes County, North Carolina, on January 9, 1930. She also suffered from some mental disabilities. Pvt. Triplett was just shy of his 87th birthday when Elida gave birth to a son, Everette. Irene and Everette Triplett were born into poverty - a tiny log cabin in the mountains surrounded by illegal distilleries. Ms. Triplett said she didn't drink moonshine, but she got hooked on tobacco in first grade. 'I dipped snuff in school, and I chewed tobacco in school,' Ms. Triplett told The Journal. 'I raised homemade tobacco. I chewed that, too. I chewed it all.' Irene said her teachers beat her with an oak paddle. Her parents continued the beatings at home. 'When you got a whooping in school you'd be getting tore up when you got back in those mountains,' she said. At school, children would taunt Irene about her father the 'traitor'. He died when she was eight, before dropping out of school after sixth grade, unable to read or write proficiently. Of her parents, she said: 'I didn't care for neither one of them, to tell you the truth about it. 'I wanted to get away from both of them. I wanted to get me a house and crawl in it all by myself.' Suffering disabilities and unable to look after herself, Irene has spent the past 70 years living in a facility . In 1943, 13-year-old Irene and her mother, unable to fend for themselves, moved into the Wilkes County poorhouse, a desolate two-story brick building on the outskirts of town, littered with mice and rats. The facility included a 'colored ward' and jail for black prisoners, while residents with tuberculosis were housed separately in the TB hut. Though just 10 years old, Everette ran away rather than live in the poorhouse. Everette made his way to Roxboro, N.C., and found work in a saw mill. He became a bulldozer operator and died in 1996. Irene and Elida Triplett remained at the county home for 17 years. The facility shut down in 1960, and Irene and her mother moved into a new private nursing home. The women didn't get along and had to have separate rooms. This illustration shows the capture of North Carolina's Fort Fisher. Moses served in B Company of the 3rd North Carolina Mounted Infantry between October 20 1864 and August 8 1865 . According to Everett’s oldest son Charlie Triplett, 59, Moses - or ‘Uncle Mose’ as he was known - was quite the character. Moses had been married before Elida . and a picture of him with his first wife shows him with a rattlesnake . around his neck and a long mustache coming below his chin, in the style . of Wyatt Earp. Charlie said: ‘He used to sit on his . porch shooting acorns out of trees. He owned lots of land and his . neighbors were scared of him. ‘There was one time when he lost all . his savings when the bank he kept it with shut down. He went down there . and stood on a car shouting at everyone like some kind of preacher. ‘After that he kept all his money in a big bag. ‘There was another time when he saw a black man on his property so he thought he was a slave. This newspaper clipping from the Wilkes Journal Patriot in 1938 reports the passing of Irene's father Moses, known locally as 'Uncle Mose' 'I didn't play around,' Irene said of her time in the homes. 'I mowed the grass. I washed dishes, made up beds, washed and ironed. They had hogs. They raised hogs up there. I raised eight hogs.' Once a month, the two women would cash their VA pension checks, which helped pay for their care. Under the terms of her father's benefits package, because Irene was disabled under the age of 18 - she had deformities at birth - she would get financial assistance for the rest of her life. At one point, Irene's brother, Everette, invited her to live with him, but she had grown accustomed to institutional life and declined. Elida Triplett died of cancer in 1967. The certificate was presented to Irene Triplett in 2011 and proves that she is the daughter of a soldier who fought in the civil war . Irene Triplett lived in the nursing home for more than half a century until she broke her hip last year and moved into the Wilkesboro skilled-nursing facility. Medicaid pays her expenses at the home, supplemented by the VA pension her father earned her in 1865. She said she likes the facility more than anywhere else she has lived. She gets very few visitors, but enjoys working on crafts and watching TV. She is bound to a wheelchair but still chews tobacco religiously. The local genealogical society article painted a picture of Irene’s life that was unrelentingly harsh. It said she does ‘not recall much of her childhood and does not have any recollection of Moses’. She has ‘virtually no memories of fun, presents, neighbors or such as they lived so isolated and she had to work on the farm each day’ where they raised chickens and pigs. Military records which prove that Irene's father Moses Triplett served in the 53 Regiment of the North Carolina Infantry in 1862 . Irene was tracked down by the dedicated research of Lorraine Orton, the former national historian for the Women’s Relief Corps until her death in November last year. Her husband Jerry, from Syracuse, New York, was also involved in the research and has been handling matters since then. Mr Orton told MailOnline: ‘I know Irene and I have visited her. She’s not as old as you think. ‘Irene is illiterate and never really learned to read or write. She grew up in the Appalachians and was very poor. ‘She has autism and when she was born they did not really have the resources to help people. ‘She can take care of herself but her cognitive abilities were impaired when she was born. ‘She took 30 years to track down - I wrote to her and other children whose parents had fought in the Civil War and she was the only one that wrote back. I’ve visited her twice and we’ve written a few times. ‘It was her birthday in January and I . know that people do send her money. She can’t have any more than than . $2,000 in her checking account or she won’t be entitled to her . benefits.’ MailOnline spoke to Jerry Orton at his Syracuse home. He has meet with Irene several times in recent years . Asked if . Miss Triplett had ever spoken about the fact she is still benefiting . from the Civil War, he said: ‘She doesn’t really have any memories of . her father. Because of her condition, visits with her last 10 minutes . then you know the visit is over. ‘The man who runs the facility is very sympathetic to her because he is a veteran himself. ‘One time I asked her what she wanted more than anything else and she jokingly said: ‘Money!’ ‘Irene . is the only person who is receiving benefits from the federal . government. It’s possible that there are some who are getting benefits . from individual states, but she is the only one getting federal money. ‘Her father actually fought for the Confederate and the Union side. I’ve seen other cases like this but the federal government is still paying her benefits. ‘When we spoke to the United Daughters of the Confederacy (which represents daughters of Confederate soldiers) about her, they called her a traitor - and they meant it’. Some 4,038 widows, sons and daughters get monthly VA pension or other payments. The government's annual tab for surviving family from those long-ago wars comes to $16.5 million. Spouses, parents and children of deceased veterans from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan received $6.7 billion in the 2013 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. Payments are based on financial need, any disabilities, and whether the veteran's death was tied to military service.","Irene Triplett was born into rural poverty in North Carolina in 1930 .

"Jimmy Savile’s nephew has said he is now convinced the majority of the allegations of sex abuse against his uncle are true. Roger Foster who described Savile as a 'friend and mentor' said he had not believed the allegations at first, but so many had surfaced he was now 'convinced that the vast majority of them are true.' Mr Foster said the scandal had shattered his family, who knew nothing about the late star’s ‘darker side’. Appalled: Sir Jimmy Savile's family pictured, from left, Michael Johnson (nephew) with partner Phanu Kapur, Roger Foster (nephew) and Janet Humble (niece) with partner Ronald Matthews, seen at his grave stone,  are reeling from the allegations . In a statement yesterday, they said: ‘Our feelings are in turmoil as we await the next turn of events. ‘We, as his closest family, have to endure further revelations on a . daily basis. We were proud of him. Proud of his achievements and the . help he had been able to give to others. We knew nothing of the . firestorm of allegations to come.’ Their comments came after police revealed they believe the BBC presenter and DJ could have abused as many as 300 people over a 40-year period. Last month, retired headteacher Mr Foster said he was ‘sad and . disgusted’ that claims had been made about his uncle when he was no . longer around to defend himself. But following weeks of ‘very serious’ allegations, yesterday he admitted . the family had been forced to doubt their ‘own feeling towards our . uncle’. The statement added: ‘How could the person we thought we knew . and loved do such a thing? ‘Why would a man who raised so much money for charity, who gave so much . of his own time and energy for others, risk it all doing indecent . criminal acts? ‘How could anyone live their life doing the “most good and most evil” at the same time?’ Mr Foster said the  family have watched ‘with horror’ as the scandal has . unfolded, adding: ‘We became aware of the programme that was being made . with allegations of a darker side to him that we knew nothing about. ‘Like everyone else we asked the question, why now? We couldn’t find an answer. This wasn’t the man we knew and loved.’ The family also sent out  a message of sympathy  to those alleged to have suffered at Savile’s hands. Mr Foster said: ‘We recognise that even our own despair and sadness does . not compare to that felt by the victims. Our hearts go out to them  and . we offer our sympathy and understanding in  their anguish.’ Jimmy Savile's nephew Roger Foster says the family have been left shattered by the allegations about the disgraced DJ . In a BBC interview Mr Foster said he . could also not understand how his uncle, who did so much charity work, . 'could have such a dark side to him'. He said : 'I have this memory of what the man was like, what he meant to me as a person. 'I . still have part of me proud of him, not proud of the way things have . turned out, but proud of the things that he did in trying to help other . people.' He went on to add that he was 'absolutely devastated and disappointed that this dark side is the side that he will be remembered for.' Mr . Foster, who organised Savile's funeral - where he described his uncle as his friend, his mentor and very much like a father to him - says the family had . been proud of all of Savile's achievements, including the millions of . pounds for charity. But they say the 'firestorm of allegations' have left them deeply shocked and initially they could not believe the claims. He insisted the family had known nothing about the predatory side of the DJ. The shocked nephew said the ITV documentary which exposed Savile as an alleged abuser made them all recoil in horror. The family have already acted in a move to 'respect victims' by removing the elaborate headstone on Savile's grave. They said they had it ripped out of the cemetery in Scarborough to avoid it becoming a target for vandals and to also respect those who claim they were molested by the disgraced star. 'The decision was a difficult one to make but we knew it was the right one,' Mr Foster said. Caroline Robinson (right) claims her grandmother (left) knew about Savile's abusive ways but ignored them for financial reasons . Previously Savile's great niece sensationally revealed how her grandmother knew he had abused her but kept quiet to 'preserve his fame'. Speaking on ITV's This Morning Caroline Robinson, 49, said she was molested twice by her great-uncle, once aged 12 and again three years later. But she said her grandmother Marjorie Marsden, Savile's elder sister who died in 2006, knew he had abused her and believes she was well aware he was a prolific and predatory paedophile. She said her grandmother refused to confront her brother because she knew that if the DJ were brought to book, the comfortable lifestyle he provided for her would end. Peter Watt, director of the the NSPCC helpline, said of the Savile case: 'The NSPCC helpline has never dealt with so many allegations against one individual.' Calls about Savile were 'still coming in thick and fast and show little sign of slowing down', he added.Since the allegations about Savile emerged, the children's charity said, it had received 190 calls directly relating to him, which have been passed to police. A year ago our uncle, Sir Jimmy Savile, passed away. It was a shock when it happened as I had only seen him the week before and although seeming under the weather, I had no concerns over his wellbeing. A week later he was dead and my cousin and I were left with the task of organising his funeral. We were proud of him. Proud of his achievements and the help he had been able to give to others. We knew nothing of the firestorm of allegations to come. We set out to organise the funeral knowing that he was well respected by many, many thousands of people. We knew that the funeral was going to grow because so many people wanted to be a part of the celebration of his life. We felt so honoured that so many wanted to remember him and mark his passing. As time passed, the grieving process enabled us to come to terms with his death. By the time summer arrived we were getting ready for the auction of his possessions so that, as he requested in his will, the money could go to his charities. It was a great success. We became aware of the programme that was being made with allegations of a darker side to him that we knew nothing about. I watched the programme in horror and could not believe that these allegations were about our uncle. This wasn’t the man we knew and loved. Like everyone else we asked the question, Why now? We couldn’t find an answer. The allegations kept coming and were beginning to overwhelm us. Media were chasing us asking for interviews as family members. The allegations are very serious and we began to have doubts as to our own feeling towards our uncle. How could the person we thought we knew and loved do such a thing? Why would a man who raised so much money for charity, who gave so much of his own time and energy for others risk it all doing indecent criminal acts? How could anyone live their life doing the ‘most good and most evil’ at the same time? We became more aware of the outrage that many members of the public were feeling. We began to think that his headstone, which we had only unveiled a couple of weeks earlier could become a target for people wishing to show their emotions. The dignity of the cemetery, the people who are buried there and the relatives who tend the graves had to be respected. We took the decision to remove and destroy the headstone so that it couldn’t become a focus for malicious people. The decision was a difficult one to make but we knew it was the right one. A vilification of his name, his achievements and everything he stood for followed. People are moving as quickly as possible to disassociate themselves from him. His charities, which he was so proud of, debated the prospect of removing his name from their title. The trustees have since decided that this wasn’t enough and that the charities will have to be wound up and the monies given to other charities working in a similar field. Records of all his efforts and the good work he had done, have been, or are in the process of being removed. We recognise that even our own despair and sadness does not compare to that felt by the victims. Our thoughts and our prayers are with those who have suffered from every kind of abuse over so many years and we offer our deepest sympathy in what must have been a terrible time for all of them. We can understand their reluctance to say anything earlier and can appreciate the courage it has taken to speak out now. Our hearts go out to them and we offer them our sympathy and understanding in their anguish. Where will it all end? Who knows? The repercussions of this scandal are enormous. We, as his closest family, have to endure further revelations on a daily basis. Our feelings are in turmoil as we await the next turn of events.","'We offer them our sympathy': Despair of Savile's family as they break silence, claiming paedophile claims have left them in 'turmoil'

"FBI agents have begun questioning members of the mosque where one of the suspected Boston bombers attended services. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in a shoot-out with police on Friday, was still going to prayer services at a Cambridge, Massachusetts, mosque just weeks before the bombing. Mosque spokesman Yusuf Vali said the 26-year-old had previously caused disturbances there, and imams had threatened to ban him following a confrontation during a prayer service. Place of worship: A banner reading 'United We Stand For Peace on Earth' stands outside the Islamic Society of Boston mosque in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Tamerlan Tsarnaev attended . Mr Vali told NBC News that as soon as they learned of Tamerlan's alleged involvement 'we immediately called law enforcement and said: ""Listen, we've got folks who knew him and if you need any information, we're here.""' 'Those folks have already met with the FBI,' he added. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a police shoot-out on Friday following a manhunt to track down those responsible for bomb attacks at the Boston Marathon finish line which killed three and injured a further 264. His younger brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was tracked down and charged on Monday with using a weapon of mass destruction to kill. He could face the death penalty if convicted. Suspects: Tamerlan Tsarnaev, left, was killed in a police shoot-out on Friday. His younger brother Dzokhar, right, was charged on Monday with using a weapon of mass destruction to kill and could face death if convicted . Family members have said that in recent years Tamerlan Tsarnaev had fallen under the influence of a new friend who steered the previously apathetic young man toward a strict strain of Islam. Under the tutelage of a friend known to the Tsarnaev family only as Misha, Tamerlan gave up boxing, stopped studying music, and began a religious makeover, his family said. This new-found radicalism came to a head at a Friday prayer service at the  Islamic Society of Boston mosque in Cambridge three months ago. Tamerlan was reportedly thrown out of the mosque after sparking a 'shouting match' with an imam who had held up assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr as an example of a man to emulate. He was eventually readmitted, but one member of the congregation, who gave his name only as Muhammad, told the LA Times: 'He had an anger inside ... I can’t explain what was in his mind' The moment of the explosion at the Boston Marathon finish line: Three people were killed and a further 264 injured in the two blasts, which happened last Monday afternoon . Mr Vali, the mosque's spokesman, elaborated on the story. He said that as the imam had begun speaking of Dr King, Tamerlan stood out and accused the speaker of being a 'non-believer' and a 'hypocrite'. 'The congregation yelled back, ""You need to leave"",' Mr Vali said. 'And then the leadership had a conference with him and told him, that you need to stay silent or you are not welcome here.' He eventually returned to the mosque, and continued to attend services there until recently. No one has come forward to claim the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, it has been revealed, as investigators continue to piece together his movements prior to the attack .","Spokesman says they contacted authorities as soon as they heard Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a suspect .

"BBC presenter Sally Jones says her 'close encounter' with Jimmy Savile remains one of the worst 'Eeee-eww!' moments of her life . As growing numbers of Jimmy Savile's victims come out of  the woodwork with increasingly shocking stories of the abuse and intimidation they suffered at the hands of him and other celebrities, a picture is emerging of a climate of routine sexism at the BBC during the Seventies and Eighties. Already, well-known journalists and presenters including Liz  Kershaw, Miriam O'Reilly and  Vivien Creegor have told of their experiences of sexual harassment and discrimination, while the upper echelons of BBC news desperately attempt to close ranks and claim, (unconvincingly, given the natural curiosity hard-wired into most top journalists) to have shown absolutely no interest in the nitty-gritty of potentially explosive allegations made against one of their most  celebrated talents. I have my own Savile story – a story with a difference, as I was not some impressionable 14-year-old at the time, but an experienced TV journalist in my early 30s who had already reported on some dangerous situations including the Brixton and Handsworth riots. My 'close encounter' with Jimmy Savile, however, remains one of the worst 'Eeee-eww!' moments of my life – leaving me teeth-suckingly embarrassed rather than mentally scarred. Newly arrived at BBC TV Centre in the late Eighties as a sports presenter on Breakfast Time, I found myself alone in a lift with him. We had met previously in Leeds while I was covering cricket for Channel 4 News, and when I helped out on one of his charity walks. But he was not a close friend and I had always found him a weird, self-conscious attention-seeker, even creepier than the rest of his fellow DJs. I exchanged uneasy banter with him out of politeness, only to find him snuggling up for a smooch, complete with oddball sunglasses and wreathed in cigar smoke. 'It's our Sal,' he crowed. 'How about a kiss for Uncle Jimmy?' Bemused and a bit embarrassed, I proffered my cheek in gingerly fashion, only for him to grab my chin and thrust his tongue into my mouth. The acrid taste of cigar smoke almost made me retch and I froze, cringing, as he ran one hand up from my waist and fumbled for my breast. Anger took over. 'Don't be so absolutely ridiculous,' I hissed. 'Take your hands off me and don't you ever touch me again!' I peeled him off and pushed him away. He backed off grumbling that it was just a bit of fun, that I couldn't take a joke and was probably frigid. I bolted out of the lift furiously, wiping my mouth, trying to rid myself of the taste of him. I felt dirty, as though I had somehow 'asked for it' and replayed the admittedly slightly smutty conversation in my mind. After the incident in the lift with Savile Sally Jones confided what had  happened to her friend Jill Dando, herself a recent arrival and already  a popular newsreader . Yes, it was laden with innuendo, but on a fairly innocent level and no worse than any of the joky exchanges that were commonplace in most workplaces, particularly television in that era. I dashed into the Breakfast Time office and confided what had  happened to my friend Jill Dando, herself a recent arrival and already  a popular newsreader. 'Of course you didn't ask for it,' she reassured me, admitting that she had had to fend off plenty of unwelcome advances herself. 'He's just a dirty old perv – half the DJs are like that.' I decided to keep quiet for the sake of my career – Savile was then one of the biggest names in showbiz. I regarded myself as a serious reporter and I certainly didn't want to be stereotyped as casting-couch fodder or a namby victim who could not stand up for herself. There was quite a divide in the late Eighties between the TV presenters and reporters who were university-educated trained journalists – Kate Adie, Kirsty Wark, Sally Magnusson – and the 'old guard' of former actresses and beauty queens such as Jan Leeming, Debbie Greenwood and others who had been picked for their  winsome looks. Sally Jones, left, with BBC Breakfast Time presenters Frank Bough, Francis Wilson, Bob Wilson, Jeremy Paxman and Sally Magnusson in the eighties . The latter, however capable they really were, tended to be patronised and treated like airheads by the thrusting young Turks then running the newsrooms. This was why, when I started in TV, as a sports-mad, relatively prudish single woman from a no-nonsense, God-fearing family, I had deliberately portrayed myself as straight-laced and head-girlish. In the late Eighties and early Nineties, attitudes to women seemed to be changing rapidly, but yes, there were superstar 'dinosaurs' like Savile (whose paedophile tastes I was unaware of) and for some, John Peel in particular, it seemed a matter of pride to sleep with as many willing and naive girls and women as they could get their hands on. An older, established presenter at the BBC was known for groping women he considered less than  his equals. I believe that it is important not to demonise the BBC root and branch, by equating the horrors of Savile's criminal and manipulative targeting of young, vulnerable children over 40 years, with the sort of low-level, undignified harassment suffered by professional women such as Kershaw, O'Reilly and me. There is no comparison between the two. Despite the humiliation and annoyance of our treatment, we adults were essentially capable of looking after ourselves. When the hysteria has died down and the requisite number of broadcasting mandarins have fallen on their swords, the furore should, with luck, ensure that throughout the media, there is no longer any room for either paedophilia or sexual harassment – however famous the perpetrator.","Sally Jones' 'close encounter' with Jimmy Savile remains one of the worst 'Eeee-eww!' moments of her life .

"Tom Goodman-Hill was still married when he started a relationship with Jessica Raine . As prim and proper midwife Jenny Lee, she spends her days dealing with her patients’  family dramas. But off-screen, it seems actress Jessica Raine has plenty of her own complications to deal with. The Daily Mail can reveal that the Call The Midwife star met her partner, actor Tom Goodman-Hill, while he was apparently happily married. Months later the 44-year-old suddenly left his wife and two children, before embarking on a relationship and later setting up home with Miss Raine, 30. In fact, he had already arranged and sent out invitations for a surprise 40th birthday party for his wife, Kerry Bradley, when he dramatically cancelled everything and announced their 20-year relationship was over. Mr Goodman-Hill, who is currently playing a middle-aged adulterer in ITV period drama Mr Selfridge, now lives with Miss Raine in a love nest ten minutes away from his estranged wife and their teenage children. The divorce is yet to be finalised, and he continues to pay more than £20,000 a year in private school fees. Miss Bradley, now 42, has told friends of her deep shock over being dumped so suddenly – and anger at her errant husband and his new younger woman. She has also commented on the irony that Mr Goodman-Hill met Miss Raine when they starred in a National Theatre play about children being let down by older generations. The fateful show was Earthquakes In London, which opened to rave reviews in August 2010. It featured Mr Goodman-Hill as an anguished husband going through a mid-life crisis as his marriage falls apart, while Miss Raine plays a hedonistic young student enjoying a ‘whirlwind of sex’, who even danced topless on stage. Tom Goodman Hill''s wife Kerry Bradley is said to be shocked at his actions . Jessica Raine has been praised for her starring role as Jenny Lee in BBC's Call the Midwife . One scene featured ‘a splendidly spunky Jessica Raine’, as one review described her, dancing provocatively in front of her future lover with ripped tights and her bra showing as she waggled her skin-tight hotpants inches from his face. In photographs of the scene Mr Goodman-Hill seems almost oblivious to her beauty – but later he evidently could not get her out of his mind. Three months afterwards  he was arranging a surprise 40th for his wife at the Rivoli Ballroom in Brockley, South East London, where they had married a few years earlier, when  he horrified all their friends and family by cancelling at the last minute. Telling everyone the party was off, he admitted his marriage was over, saying ‘It’s all my fault’. A friend said: ‘We were appalled to hear that Tom was leaving. In the end he was pretty unceremonious about going. ‘Everyone assumed they were so in love – and that’s clearly what he wanted everyone to think when he began arranging Kerry’s surprise birthday party. Kerry has been very brave, but two years later she’s still recovering. She’s furious not just at Tom but at Jessica too for being with her husband, and now getting to know her kids too. Ms Raine at the Bafta's last week (left) and as Jenny in Call the Midwife. (right) Ms Raine denies being with Mr Goodman-Hill before his marriage ended . ‘And she can’t help observing the irony of how Tom first met Jessica – when he was playing a husband having a mid-life crisis, and Jessica was playing a wild young temptress.’ Miss Bradley works as a set designer for plays and television shows, including Footballers’ Wives, and is also a college lecturer. She continues to live in the marital home in West Norwood, South London, a £500,000 four-bedroom Edwardian terrace which she owns jointly with Mr Goodman-Hill. The long-term couple married in 2005. Miss Bradley was too upset to comment. Last night Miss Raine’s agent Kate Bryden said: ‘Jess and Tom worked together on Earthquakes in 2010, he separated from his wife the same year, and he and Jess are now a couple. ‘Tom and Jessica did not get together until well after he and his wife were separated.’ Mr Goodman-Hill declined to comment. Miss Raine has won praise for her starring role in Call The Midwife, her first major television part. Recently, describing her life with Mr Goodman-Hill, former comprehensive schoolgirl and Rada graduate Miss Raine has said – without naming him – that they had been together for ‘a couple of years’. She added that he was an actor who works ‘in theatre, television and film. We are both working in London at the moment so that’s great, but I like not having a routine because it keeps our relationship fresh and exciting. ‘I am not massively interested in getting married, to be honest – we live together and that’s fine.’","Call the Midwife's Jessica Raine met her partner Tom Goodman-Hill before he had left his wife .

"The SS Terra Nova, the ship that carried Captain Robert Scott on his doomed expedition to the Antarctic a century ago, has been discovered off Greenland. It was discovered by a team from a US research company using a hi-tech underwater vehicle after they spotted an unusual object while testing their sonar equipment. Scott and his party set off from Cardiff aboard the Terra Nova in 1910 with the aim of becoming the first expedition to reach the South Pole. The US team discovered Scott's ship while testing sonar equipment.  This sonar image shows part of the wreck on the sea bed . Terra Nova anchored off the ice foot near Cape Evans in January 1911. The legendary piece of Scottish maritime history was discovered by US firm Schmidt Ocean Institute during an exploration exercise . A crew from the Schmidt Ocean Institute discovered the Terra Nova . whilst testing echo-sounding equipment aboard its flagship vessel - the . R/V Falkor. One of the scientists noticed an unidentified feature during sonar mapping of the sea bed. Team members then noted that the 57m length of the feature matched the reported length of the Terra Nova. Researchers then sent a remote camera called Shrimp to film the wreck. Bridge supports are still visible on the desk of the Terra Nova . Railings were also spotted on the ship's deck by the camera, known as Shrimp. Brave Captain Scott before his ill-fated journey . Camera tows across the top of the target showed the remains of a wooden wreck lying on the seabed. Footage from the Shrimp also identified a funnel lying next to the ship. Taken together, the features of the wreck closely matched historical photos of the Terra Nova, leading to the identification. Brian . Kelly, an education officer from the Discovery Point museum in Dundee, . where the ship was built, told the Daily Record newspaper: 'The Terra . Nova has such a story. 'She went through a lot in her lengthy history and really was the pinnacle of Scottish wooden shipbuilding. 'It . is incredible that one of the most famous ships in history has been . found 100 years after the race for the pole and in the year . commemorating the event.' The Terra Nova was built in 1884 for the Dundee whaling and sealing fleet. In 1910, it came under the command of Scott, who chose the ship for his quest to reach the South Pole. In .

"The war veteran who successfully campaigned for a medal to honour the Arctic Convoy heroes of the Second World War has died at the age of 93. Commander Eddie Grenfell was the leading force in the  17-year fight to award a medal to 70,000 sailors whose service on what Churchill called ‘the worst journey in the world’ to Russia went unrecognised when the conflict ended. His death comes just three months after the survivors were finally presented with their Arctic Star medals by David Cameron. Honoured: Commander Eddie Grenfell, who passed away just three months after his Arctic Star Medal was presented to him after a 17-year campaign . The retired naval officer passed away at his daughter Trudie’s home in Portsmouth yesterday.  She said: ‘I want to pay tribute to his determination, his tenacity and strength. He was a legend. He was an unstoppable force who fought for what he believed in and what was right.’ Cdr Grenfell, a radar operator, was serving on SS Empire Lawrence when she was torpedoed during one of the supply missions to ship arms to the Soviet Union in 1942. He was blown more than 30ft clear of the ship in the blast, then survived more than ten minutes in the freezing seas before he was rescued. Trudie, 65, said her father had been in poor health and in and out of hospital for the past 18 months after he suffered a heart attack. ‘He was a wonderful, wonderful gentleman with true spirit,’ she added. After the war, he was stationed at the British Embassy in Bonn, West Germany, and used his supreme naval knowledge to advise and rebuild the nation’s navy along British lines. Awarded: Cdr Grenfell was surrounded by his family when he was presented with a medal after campaigning for the last survivors of the 70,000 soldiers of the Arctic Convoy . The Peterhead-born sailor spent 35 years living in Germany, before returning to the UK in the late 1970s. In the meantime, he had built up quite a following travelling Germany giving lectures in schools about Henry VIII’s Tudor warship, the Mary Rose, and his beloved adopted home of Portsmouth. As an early volunteer for the Mary Rose Trust, Cdr Grenfell was instrumental in driving Portsmouth’s burgeoning tourism industry and was lauded by civic leaders. However, efforts to get him awarded an OBE never materialised. In the mid-1990s, Cdr Grenfell became president of the now-defunct Russian Convoy Club and was elected by fellow veterans to start a campaign for their own Arctic Star medal. The war heroes, who faced a gauntlet of German U-boats and warplanes during the icy supply missions to Murmansk, were aggrieved that their efforts were lumped in with the separate Atlantic Campaign. Some 3,000 sailors lost their lives in the vital missions, which were dubbed ‘the worst journey in the world’ by Winston Churchill. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was felt that time had come for an Arctic medal to be struck. The campaign thrust Cdr Grenfell into the spotlight, and he attacked the mission with typical military vigour. He often spent up to 18 hours a day writing letters to politicians, and inundated Downing Street with facts, figures and arguments outlining the veterans’ injustice. His quest was strongly supported by his local newspaper The News in Portsmouth, which obtained a 46,000-signed petition and organised for 500 convoys survivors to march on Whitehall to call for a medal. Hero: The Chief of Defence Staff General Sir David Richards presents Cdr Grenfell with the first Arctic Star medal at a special ceremony . At one point, the octogenarian was given his own office in the paper’s print room. Despite numerous setbacks, the Labour government relented under public pressure and awarded an Arctic Star emblem badge in 2006. However, the lapel badge was far from an official medal and Cdr Grenfell fought on. His campaign received renewed vigour in 2010 when the Coalition Government came to power. Previous . Conservative leaders Michael Howard and Iain Duncan Smith had backed . the cause, and made public promises that a Tory government would finally . strike a medal. However, . now aged 91 years, Cdr Grenfell still had to fight for another two and a . half years before the campaign was finally won. During . that time, he clashed publicly with the armed forces minister Andrew . Robathan and accused David Cameron of betraying to Tory party’s medal . promise. It was typical of the man, whose soft Scottish voice belied the fire which burned ferociously in his belly. Finally, after an independent Whitehall review, Mr Cameron announced last December that a new Arctic Star would be struck. Cdr . Grenfell was by this time in rude health following his heart attack and . could not travel to Downing Street to be given his medal. Civic . leaders instead honoured him with a special event held at Portsmouth . Guildhall earlier this year, which was the last time Cdr Grenfell was . seen in public. The Chief of Defence Staff General Sir David Richards paid tribute to Cdr Grenfell yesterday. The UK’s most senior military officer presented Cdr Grenfell with his Arctic Star at a ceremony at Portsmouth Guildhall in March this year. General Sir David Richards said: ‘I was delighted and truly humbled to be able to present Commander Eddie Grenfell with his Arctic medal in Portsmouth in March. ‘Eddie was a young sailor when he endured the hardships of the Arctic convoys which Winston Churchill called the worst journey in the world. ‘It is in great part through his tireless efforts that the achievements and endurance of those involved in the convoys have been recognised.’ The Second Sea Lord Vice-Admiral David Steel said: ‘I was greatly saddened to hear Cdr Eddie Grenfell has passed away. ‘He fought bravely for our country in the Second World War, especially on the Arctic Convoys, and he fought just as valiantly to gain the recognition for his comrades, who endured the terrible hardships of those convoys, that they so richly deserved. ‘I am thankful that he was able to receive his Arctic Star from the Chief of Defence Staff back in March before his passing. ‘On behalf of the Royal Navy, I would wish to pass my sincere condolences to his family.’","Commander Eddie Grenfell dies three months after recognition .

The letter came with a birth certificate attached 'demonstrating that he is the son of Fred Trump, not an orangutan. Please remit the $5 million to Mr. Trump immediately,' according to Yahoo News. Rather than choosing to donate the money to 'Hair Club for Men' or 'The Institute for Incorrigible Douchebaggery' as Maher suggested, Trump indicated he wants to give $1 million each to charities for the Hurricane Sandy Victims, The Police Athletic League, The American Cancer Society, The March of Dimes and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Maher was of course mocking Trump's much maligned YouTube announcement in October that he would donate $5 million of his own money to charity if President Obama would release his college records. Creating feverish anticipation in October, Trump declared that he had 'something very, very, big concerning the president of the United States' that could 'possibly' change the election. Demands: Donald Trump has called on Bill Maher to quickly pay up on the $5 million that he offered as a challenge on Monday night after he was referred to as the child of an orangutan (right) by the comedian . Evidence: Lawyers for Donald Trump were swift to issue the property billionaire's birth certificate - releasing it the day after Maher's challenge . Speculation in the hours before Trump revealed his challenge was rife that he may indeed have discovered scandalous information about Barack Obama, who released his own birth certificate to the public following massive media pressure led by Trump himself. 'Barack Obama is the least transparent president in the history of this country,' said Trump in his YouTube video released in October. 'I'm very honored to have gotten him to release his long-form birth certificate or whatever it may be. 'If Barack Obama opens up and gives his college records and application and if he gives his passport applications and records, I will give to a charity of his choice - inner-city children in Chicago, American Cancer Society, AIDS research, anything he wants - a check immediately for $5 million.' At the time, Barack Obama was not concerned and joked to Jay Leno himself on the 'Tonight Show' that the bad blood between himself and Trump stems back to an argument 'when we were growing up together in Kenya.' Appearing on the 'Tonight Show' on Monday night, Maher was openly mocking Trump's failed attempt in October (right) to persuade President Obama to release his college and passport records . LOL: Following Donald Trump's offer to pay $5 million to a charity of his choice, President Obama laughed off any suggestion that he reveal his college or passport records . On Monday night though, firebrand Maher was massively outspoken about Trump while appearing on Leno's show. Comparing Trump to an orangutan, Maher was drawing a comparison between the famously sandy hair of the New York billionaire and the great ape that roams the jungles of South East Asia. In addition to calling Trump the son of an orangutan, Maher labeled Trump a 'liar' and a 'racist' and a 'douche bag' as he reacted to some derogatory tweets that Trump had posted online about him.","On Monday's 'Tonight Show with Jay Leno', Maher, said that he would donate $5 million to the charity of Donald Trump's choice if he released his birth certificate .

"He had been a lifelong fan, patiently sticking with his Cleveland football team through thick and thin. But it would appear that loyal Scott E. Entsminger had one last wish for the Browns - and saved it for his obituary. The season ticket holder said he: 'He respectfully requests six Cleveland Browns pall bearers so the Browns can let him down one last time.' He got the last word! Scott Entsminger, a lifelong Browns fan, shares his last request in his obituary . The team will present a Groza No 76 jersey with Entsminger's name printed on the back to the family . The 55-year-old, of Mansfield, Ohio, died on July 4 at his home - but not before penning a song every year to send it to the Cleveland Browns as 'as well as offering other advice on how to run the team', his online obituary at The Columbus Dispatch said. And he certainly got the last word in with his request that six of the team carry his coffin to his funeral. In the obituary, his family asked everyone to wear their Cleveland Browns clothing to the service in honor of the General Motors worker. The Colombus-born father was described as a 'fun loving, kind and caring man who enjoyed gardening and fishing but his greatest enjoyment was spending time with his family'. The Browns had a dismal start to their 2012 season by losing their first five games, and fans are used to losses from the team . Dejected Cleveland Browns fans have branded the team's stadium the 'factory of sadness' When the Browns heard about Entsminger's last request, they contacted his widow, Pat, and discovered that Scott's favorite player was Hall of Fame entrant Lou Groza, the NFL reported. The team will present a Groza No 76 jersey with Entsminger's name printed on the back to the family today. The Browns haven't enjoyed the most stellar of results lately. Their own fans have branded their stadium the 'factory of sadness', and recently endured some humiliating losses. The Browns had a dismal start to their 2012 season by losing their first five games. Having lost their last six games to end the 2011 season, this marked an eleven-game losing streak, tied for the longest in team history with the 1974–75 teams.","Scott E.

"Internet trolls who poisonously mock sportsmen behind a screen of anonymity take note - you're not as safe as you think you are. Ex-footballer turned boxer Curtis Woodhouse was so incensed by the vitriolic comments he received from one Twitter user he offered a cash reward for the man's address and drove to confront him on his doorstep. The 32-year-old ex-Birmingham City and Hull City centre, who took up boxing at 26, lost his English light welterweight crown to Shayne Singleton on a controversial points decision last week. Counter punch: Boxer Curtis Woodhouse tracked down an internet troll who posted vitriolic comments after he lost his title after offering his followers a cash reward for an address . He was enraged when he was branded a 'disgrace', a 'waste of s****' and was urged to retire by Sheffield-based user Jimmyob88, so Woodhouse offered £1,000 to anyone who could help him find him. A Twitter follower supplied him with an address and the sportsman, from Driffield, near Bridlington, kept his 18,000 Twitter followers updated yesterday as he drove 70 miles to 'give him a right pasting'. 'Just on my way to Sheffield to have a little chat with a old friend, get the kettle on', he wrote. Ill-advised: Jimmyob88's tweets that landed him in hot water with the light welterweight boxer . Uh-oh: Mr Woodhouse announces his arrival on the troll's street. Sensibly, the troll refused to come out and talk to him . Fighter: Curtis Woodhouse battles with Frankie Gavin in 2011 . Woodhouse later tweeted a picture of a street sign said to be the road on which the target of his anger lived. 'Right Jimbob im here,' he wrote. 'Someone tell me what number he lives at or do I have to knock on every door #it'sshowtime.' Woodhouse keeps his Twitter followers up to date with his journey . Realising his perilous plight, Jimmyob88 tried to make amends. 'I am sorry it's getting a bit out of hand,' he tweeted. 'I am in the wrong. I accept that.' Backtracking frantically, he claimed he thought Woodhouse would take the abuse 'as a joke', calling it a 'bit of harmless fun'. Woodhouse, unable to find his prey, finally admitted defeat and went home. 'Jimmyob88 never came out to play so I'm going,' he tweeted. 'Maybe a bit daft what I did today but sometimes enough is enough.' And Woodhouse later appeared to have seen the funny side, writing: ""Just found out you can block people. Could have let me know earlier, I could have saved 20 quid in petrol.' Among many cheering on Woodhouse was footballer Joey Barton, no stranger to abuse on Twitter: 'Brilliant mate. You're my hero. Wish someone had a hidden camera in his room right now.' Former heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis also applauded Woodhouse for his antics, tweeting: 'Ha! I LOVE this story about @woodhousecurtis paying a visit to a #keyboardwarrior on Twitter.' The boxer played 48 times for Birmingham City between 2001 and 2003 after signing from Sheffield United in a £1million deal. He is also  former England under-21 international.

"Ask and they shall deliver! After releasing a photo of President Obama skeet shooting, the predictions of his former advisor David Plouffe came true when the picture turned into the basis for the latest meme. Creative Photoshop users changed it so that rather than having the President taking aim at small birds, they added in thought bubbles, flowers, and political context to make alternative versions. On Saturday morning, the White House released the photo of Obama shooting at clay pigeons at the presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland. Political statement: Some pranksters changed it so that the President would be 'taking aim' at the Second Amendment, which is the one that specifies the right to bare arms . Comical? Some internet pranksters swapped out bullets for flowers, and had alternate clothing options . Different setting: This version has the President as a character in the video game Grand Theft Auto . Mr Plouffe couldn't resist mocking those who might claim the photograph of President Obama shooting was fake and tweeted: 'Attention skeet birthers. Make our day - let the photoshop conspiracies begin!' White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer also joined in the teasing and tweeted the picture of the President with a shout-out to the 'skeeters' - namely people who might claim the image is false. Both men received a large amount of online abuse for their attempts at humor. The image of President Obama shooting at clay targets was released at a time when he is pushing a package of gun-control measures in response to the Newtown, Connecticut school shooting. Guns a blazing: The White House released this picture, taken on Aug. 4, of the president skeet shooting after skeptics questioned Mr Obama's claim that he enjoyed shooting at Camp David . Former White House senior adviser David Plouffe took to Twitter to mock those who might claim the photograph of President Obama shooting a firearm is fake . White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer joined in the teasing by posting the Obama pic from his official Twitter account . The National Rifle Association, which has rejected Obama's proposals, scoffed at the photo. ‘One picture does not erase a lifetime of supporting every gun ban and every gun-control scheme imaginable,’ said Andrew Arulanandam, the organization's spokesman. Two days before President Barack Obama's first trip outside Washington to promote his gun-control proposals, the White House tried on Saturday to settle a brewing mystery by releasing a photo to back his claim to be a skeet shooter. Making the message clear: President Obama has previously been criticized for his use of drones . Old school: An older Ninetendo version was also produced . Target practice: This one mentions the Republican majority leader by name . President Obama had set inquiring minds spinning when, in an interview with The New Republic magazine, he answered ‘yes’ when asked if he had ever fired a gun. The admission came as a surprise to many. ‘Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time,’ Obama said in the interview released last weekend, referring to the official presidential retreat in rural Maryland, which he last visited in October while campaigning for re-election.","The White House has released a picture of President Obama shooting at the Camp David range .

"Defense Secretarey Chuck Hagel admitted he was 'embarrassed' that the current government shutdown had caused death benefits for the families of fallen military to be suspended - as one of the fathers of the dead soldiers said that he was couldn't believe that members of Congress are still getting paid during the shutdown. Attending a ceremony at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware on Wednesday marking the return of the bodies of four U.S. soldiers killed by insurgents in Afghanistan on Sunday, Hagel stood in silence as the impasse between the White House and Congress shamed leaders on both sides. 'I am offended, outraged, and embarrassed that the government shutdown had prevented the Department of Defense from fulfilling this most sacred responsibility in a timely manner,' Hagel said in a statement. Scroll down for video . Sad sight: Pfc. Cody Patterson's body was brought back to the United States after being killed in Afghanistan on October 6, when his family was told the benefits payout was at risk . Respect: The Pentagon has now agreed to pay the charity back after the shutdown is lifted and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was at Dover Air Force Base when Patterson's body arrived . 'If Congress were trapped in a car that sunk down in a river, I would swim to the window, and I would look them all in the eye and say, ""Suck water,""' said Randall Peterson, the father of 24-year-old PFC Cody Peterson who was killed in the field. Earlier on Wednesday, the White House said President Barack Obama was 'very disturbed' when he heard about the lapse and had directed lawyers at the Defense Department and White House budget office to find a way to immediately resume the payments. Under the agreement, Fisher House Foundation will advance the death benefit to military families using its own funds until the Pentagon can reimburse it once the shutdown ends. Relatives of the four soldiers killed by a Taliban bomb attack gathered at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Wednesday to attend the solemn ceremony commemorating the return of the remains of their loved ones to the United States. They included 24-year-old Sergeant Joseph Peters of Springfield, Missouri. 'It is upsetting because my husband died for his country, and now his family is left to worry,' NBC quoted his widow, Ashley Peters, as before the Pentagon announcement. 'My husband always said if something happened to him we would be taken care of.' Republican Senator John McCain said on Tuesday that members of Congress should be 'embarrassed' and 'ashamed' for the lapse. Victims twice over: The relatives of Sgt Patrick . Hawkins (left) and 1st Lt Jennifer Moreno (right) are now being denied . survivors benefits from the military because of the federal shutdown . Anger: PFC Cody Patterson's (left)  father is . outraged at Congress, and Marine LCPL Jeremiah Collins (right) was the . youngest of the fallen at only 19-years-old . The House voted unanimously on Wednesday for a resolution that would ensure that death benefits to families of fallen troops will be disbursed during the government shutdown. On Tuesday, the House passed an act ordering that all military pay and allowances - including the death benefit - would continue to be disbursed. Even with death gratuity payments resolved, the impact of a prolonged government shutdown could still be felt acutely by veterans throughout the country, U.S. officials say. Father: Special Agent Joseph Peters, 24, leaves behind a wife and 20-month-old son . Those injured in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are among those who could see monthly disability and other benefits cut-off from November 1 due to projected cash crunch, the Department of Veterans' Affairs warned Congress on Wednesday. More than 5 million people are expecting payments next month and all of them are threatened, it said. 'It's not a game,' VA Secretary Eric Shinseki told the hearing. 'There are veterans and service members, families, children counting on this. And they expect us to deliver.' On Wednesday, Washington scrambled to tamp down a controversy over suspended death benefits for the families of fallen military soldiers, and the White House has announced that a charity would pick up the costs of the payments during the government shutdown. `The Fisher House Foundation will provide the families of the fallen with the benefits they so richly deserve,` Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a statement, adding that the Pentagon would reimburse the foundation after the shutdown ended. Hagel said Fisher House, which works with veterans and their families, had approached the Pentagon about making the payments. The Defense Department typically pays families about $100,000 within three days of a soldier's death, but officials say the shutdown was preventing those benefits from being paid. A senior defense official said the government could not actively solicit funds from private organizations, but could accept an offer. Determined: Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner has tried to submit a bill approving the payment of 'death benefits' to military families but Democrats don't want to take a piecemeal approach to the budget approval process . The failure to make the payments has stirred outrage both on Capitol Hill and at the White House. Obama spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday that the president was `disturbed` when he found out the death benefits had been suspended and demanded an immediate solution. `The commander in chief, when he found out that this was not addressed, he directed that a solution be found, and we expect one today,` Carney said before the Pentagon announced the agreement with Fisher House. The House unanimously passed legislation Wednesday to restore the death benefits but it's unclear whether the Democratic-led Senate will take up the measure or whether Obama would sign it. Obama has threatened to veto other legislation passed by the House in recent days that would reopen individual funding steams, arguing that a piecemeal approach was unacceptable and the entire government must be reopened. The names of the five soldiers who were killed have been released-Sgt Patrick Hawkins, Special Agent Joseph Peters, Patterson, Marine LCPL Jeremiah Collins Jr, Lt Jennifer Moreno- and Fox News reports that they are all under the age of 25 years old. 'After losing a loved one in service . to our nation, these families should not have to endure more pain as the . result of political squabbling,' said Ken Fisher, the head of the . military-focused charity that stepped up. Mr Patterson was not the only grieving family member to speak out, and a number of others have come forward. ‘The . government is hurting the wrong people,’ Shannon Collins, who lost her . son, Marine Lance Corporal Jeremiah M. Collins Jr., over the weekend in . Afghanistan told NBC News. ‘Families shouldn’t have to worry about how they’re going to bury their child,’ she added. ‘Families shouldn’t have to worry about how they're going to feed their family if they don’t go to work this week.’ Sgt Hawkins was on his fourth deployment to Afghanistan, he died rushing to the aid of another dying soldier. ‘Sgt. Patrick Hawkins was a brave and incredibly talented Ranger,’ Lt. Col., . Patrick J. Ellis, the commander of the 3rd battalion, told NBC News. ‘His actions that night were in keeping with the epitome of the Ranger . Creed: ‘I will never leave a fallen comrade.’ First Lt. Moreno was a nurse assigned to the cultural support team, it was her first combat deployment. ‘Our unit mourns the loss of 1st Lt. Jennifer Moreno,’ Lt Col. Ellis told NBC News. Lance Cpl Collins was out of high school for just over a year when he died in what NBC News termed ‘murky circumstances.’ Denied . what they rightfully deserve, the families of these heroes should soon . receive their benefits, according to Speaker Boehner. ‘Tomorrow, . the House is going to act specifically on this and I hope the president . will sign it,’ he said during a Tuesday press conference. The . payment of the so-called 'death benefits' has become a political issue . on its own as Republican Speaker John Boehner has blasted Democrats for . failing to support his bill to fund the payouts before the budget is . approved fully. 'I think it's disgraceful that they're withholding these benefits,' he said. The . seemingly obvious move to pay the benefits is steeped in political . motivations, however, as Boehner and the Republicans have repeatedly . tried to push through smaller single-issue funding appropriations . without agreeing to end the shutdown by approving an entire budget. President . Obama was reportedly 'disturbed' to find out that it would take longer . than the standard three days to get the 'benefits' to the relatives and . press secretary Jay Carney said that a solution would be found . Wednesday. 'It is . upsetting because my husband died for his country, and now his family is . left to worry,' Ashley Peters, the wife of Joseph Peters, told NBC. 'My husband always said if something happened to him we would be taken care of. 'I'm a stay-at-home mom, which is what my husband wanted. He wanted me to take care of our son.' The five soldiers whose funeral payments are being fought over are far from the only ones who face financial letdown. Continued rhetoric: President Obama gave a press conference on Tuesday saying that he would not negotiate under threat but Republicans want certain services funded before approving the entire budget . About . 3.8 million veterans will not receive disability compensation next . month if the partial government shutdown continues into late October, . Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki says. Some 315,000 veterans and 202,000 surviving spouses and dependents will see pension payments stopped. Shinseki . is spelling out some of the dire consequences of a longer-term shutdown . in testimony Wednesday for the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. The . short-term consequences have meant that disability claims production . has slowed by an average of about 1,400 per day since the shutdown began . October 1, and that has stalled the department's efforts to reduce the . backlog of disability claims pending for longer than 125 days. In all, more than $6 billion in payments would be halted with an extended shutdown. 'In some areas, like health care delivery, there are fewer adverse effects. In others, such as reducing the claims backlog, we have already seen a negative impact,' Shinseki says in written testimony obtained by The Associated Press in advance of the hearing. The House has passed legislation that would provide veterans disability, pension and other benefits in the event of a prolonged shutdown, but the White House has pushed against the piecemeal approach. Shinseki plans to make that case as well, saying it's not the best solution for veterans. He'll note that even if the VA were fully funded, some services to veterans would suffer.","Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel attended a repatriation ceremony on Wednesday for four soldiers killed in Afghanistan over the weekend .

Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood said the austerity drive has not gone far enough and stressed it will continue for years. He said there was a ‘very long way to go’ before the economy returns to the same level as before the 2007 recession. ‘This is not a two-year project or a five-year project. 'This is a ten-year project, a 20-year  generational battle to beef up the economy in ways that we have not seen for many, many decades,’ he said. Sir Jeremy’s remarks were made to Civil Service Live, a convention for mandarins in west London. He told them: ‘There is a very, very long way to go. We were reminded only last week that the economy as a whole remains about 4 per cent below the size that it was in 2008. ‘Five years on from the bottom of the recession we have still not even near recovered all the output we lost in that terribly deep recession that we suffered in 2007-08. ‘Those are really daunting numbers that just show the size of the challenge; there is no alternative.’ He added: ‘There have been years of austerity, years of pay freezes, of pay restraint; every part of government has been told by ministers — and rightly so — to hunt out waste and tackle inefficiencies. ‘But despite all these efforts we have made over the last three years … our debt/GDP ratio is still rising, debt interest payments are rising. ‘There is still an enormous amount of work to get that deficit down to a balanced level to get the debt/GDP level falling rather than rising.’ He also warned that steering the economy away from financial services towards manufacturing was ‘much easier said than done’. Praise: Sir Jeremy described the new Bank of England governor Mark  Carney as 'the world's most impressive central banker' His gloomy prediction contrasts with recent market data which showed that UK manufacturing saw its strongest growth in two years in June. The UK economy also grew by 0.3 per cent  in the first three months of the year. This week, Bank of England figures also showed the highest mortgage approval rates for three and a half years. Sir Jeremy had more positive predictions for the new Bank of England governor Mark  Carney. He said the Canadian was ‘the world’s most impressive central banker’. He added: ‘We will give him every support he needs.’","Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood said the austerity drive has not gone far enough .

"Funerals don't always have to be sombre occasions as this group of musicians shows. In Taiwan families are taking a different approach to saying goodbye to their loved ones - by hiring all-female marching bands to perform during the service. Complete with white Go-go boots and matching uniforms, the women twirl batons and play instruments while marching around the dead body. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Funerals may be a maudlin affair here in Great Britain. But in Taiwan some people choose to liven up the occasion with an all-female marching band. The service, which lasts two to three hours, has been set up by Yuan-Rong Life which has a popular marching troupe called 'Xiu Juan Female Music Band'. For small services Yuan-Rong recommends less than eight band members - costing £27 each - but for larger memorials more. In New Orleans, upbeat tunes are often played at Jazz Funerals including popular songs like When The Saints Go Marching In. It is not the first time Taiwan has raised a few eyebrows with their taste of funeral ceremonies. Strippers are sometimes hired who dance for the deceased. Lively: Complete with white Go-go boots and matching uniforms, the women twirl batons and play instruments while marching around the dead body . For a modest fee the scantily-clad women arrive on the neon-lit back of a diesel truck, dubbed an Electric Flower Car, to gyrate erotically in front of the departed and his mourners. The Taiwanese phenomenon is labelled by some as scandalous, but many hail it as an important part of the grieving process - and the perfect way of sending off their loved ones with a smile. Authorities were trying to crack down on the mainly rural practice documented by anthropologist Marc L Moskowitz in his 40-minute documentary which sheds light on the folk tradition. Different: Each band member costs £27 and performances can last up to three hours . Members of an all-female marching band perform during a funeral service in Taiwan . Celebration: A band member performs during a funeral service in Taiwan proving ceremonies don't have to be sad occasions . He admitted he had not seen any 'full stripping' himself because they knew he was filming, but everyone he spoke to had seen complete nudity. The working-class associated Electric Flower Cars came to the fore in Taiwan, apart from in its northern capital Taipei, in the early 1980s. During his research, Moskowitz said he heard several explanations as to why people hired them for funerals. One theory is that strippers were used to bribe mourners to turn up to funerals so there would be more people in attendance and therefore more honour given to the deceased. He also believed that it could simply be popular because it was the only form of live entertainment for many of the rural poor community.","Women wear white Go-go boots and twirl batons around the body .

"A retired U.S. general who served in the Pentagon's upper echelon is under investigation for allegedly leaking classified information about a covert cyber attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, according to media reports. Retired Marine Gen. James 'Hoss' Cartwright, a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has been told he is a target of the probe which investigates who leaked the source of the Stuxnet virus, NBC News and The Washington Post reported Thursday. A 'target' is someone a prosecutor or grand jury has substantial evidence linking to a crime and who is likely to be charged. Investigation: Retired General James E. Cartwright, pictured while serving as the vice chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, is under investigation for allegedly leaking classified information about a covert cyber attack on Iran's nuclear facilities . The Justice Department referred . questions to the U.S. attorney's office in Baltimore, where a . spokeswoman, Marcia Murphy, declined to comment. The investigation of the leak about the Iran cyber attack is one of a number of national security leak investigations that have been started by the Obama administration, including ones involving The Associated Press and Fox News. In June 2012, the New York Times reported that Cartwright was a crucial player in the cyber operation called Olympic Games, started under President George W. Bush. Bush reportedly advised President Barack Obama to preserve Olympic Games. According to the Times, Obama ordered the cyber attacks sped up, and in 2010 an attack using a computer virus called Stuxnet temporarily disabled 1,000 centrifuges that the Iranians were using to enrich uranium. Congressional leaders demanded a criminal probe into who leaked the information, and Obama said he had zero tolerance for such leaks. Republicans said senior administration officials had leaked the details to bolster the president's national security credentials during the 2012 campaign. U.S. President Barack Obama, pictured during his visit to Senegal, has said he has 'zero tolerance' for security leaks . The Times said Cartwright was one of the crucial players who had to break the news to Obama and Vice President Joe Biden that Stuxnet at one point had escaped onto the Internet. An element of the program accidentally became public in the summer of 2010 because of a programming error that allowed it to escape Iran's Natanz plant and sent it out on the Internet, the Times reported. After the worm escaped onto the Internet, top administration officials met to consider whether the program had been fatally compromised. Obama asked if the program should continue, and after hearing the advice of top advisers, decided to proceed. Cartwright, a four-star general, was cleared in February 2011 of misconduct involving a young aide. An anonymous accuser had claimed Cartwright acted inappropriately during a 2009 overseas trip on which the aide traveled as a military assistant. Several sources confirmed that the former aide was a young woman. The Pentagon inspector general quickly cleared Cartwright of the most serious allegations, which involved claims that he may have had an improper physical relationship with the woman. The report did find that Cartwright mishandled an incident in which the aide, drunk and visibly upset, visited his Tbilisi, Georgia, hotel room alone and either passed out or fell asleep on a bench at the foot of his bed. Cartwright denied any impropriety and was later cleared of all wrongdoing. Cartwright, once considered the leading candidate to become Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, resigned from the military in August 2011. NBC said Cartwright did not respond to request for comment and that his attorney, former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig, said he had no comment.

"Endangered bats are being killed by wind turbine blades because the air currents are similar to those near tall trees, a study shows. It’s feared the legally protected mammals are dying while hunting insects that are attracted by the heat generated by the spinning blades. Thousands of bats have been killed by wind turbines causing a population decline that could cost the farming industry billions each year. Bats are being killed by wind turbine blades because the air currents are similar to those near tall trees . Bats are killed by the turbine blades while hunting insects that are attracted by the heat they generate . The nocturnal creatures are welcomed by farmers across the world as they eat large numbers of insects that usually damage crops. This reduces the amount that farmers have to spend on pesticides and saves millions of new plants that could be obliterated by the creepy crawlies. Over 600,000 bats were killed by wind turbines across the U.S. in 2O12 alone and in the UK the number of bats in areas where they are put up have fallen by 54 per cent. The researchers say tree-roosting bats suffer higher fatality rates at the sites than other species and peak during low wind conditions. They used thermal surveillance cameras situated on the ground, near-infrared video, acoustic detectors and radar to monitor bat behaviour at a wind farm in Indiana over several months. During periods of low wind more bats were sighted near turbines than during gales. The frequency with which they approached from a downwind direction increased with increasing wind speeds - but only when the blades turned slower than normal. Over 600,000 bats were killed by wind turbines across the U.S. in 2O12 alone and in the UK the number of bats in areas where they are put up have fallen by 54 per cent . When the blades moved freely the bats approached less frequently from a downwind direction as wind speeds increased. The results published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggest bats orient toward turbines by sensing air currents. Around three quarters of British bat species are known to roost in trees. The remaining species tend to favour human-made structures because of a lack of suitable and available tree habitat. Trees provide shelter and attract a diverse range of insect species for bats to feed on. Since bats are not able to bore holes or make nests they use whatever gaps are available. The researchers believe tree-roosting bats are attracted to turbines because air currents are similar to those around tall trees that harbour insects on their downwind sides or provide sheltered roosting sites. The findings could explain why they are more vulnerable to wind farms than non-tree-roosting species. Dr Paul Cryan, of Fort Collins Science Centre in Colorado, and colleagies said: 'Bats are dying in unprecedented numbers at wind turbines but causes of their susceptibility are unknown. 'Fatalities peak during low-wind conditions in late summer and autumn and primarily involve species that evolved to roost in trees.' He added: 'We discovered previously undescribed patterns in the ways bats approach and interact with turbines suggesting behaviours that evolved at tall trees might be the reason why many bats die at wind turbines.'","Over 600,000 bats were killed by wind turbines in the U.S. in 2012 .

"The Treasury raked in £3.4billion in inheritance tax last year, up £1billion since 2009. Most of the money came from levies imposed on transfers of wealth when people died. It comes amid a growing political row about the taxes which should be levied on people when they die. David Cameron is under pressure to deliver on his pre-election promise to increase the level when inheritance tax kicks in. Under pressure: Prime Minister David Cameron, who yesterday invited Brownies into Number 10 to mark their 100th anniversary (pictured), promised to increase the inheritance threshold before the last election but it was dropped when the coalition was formed . In 2007 the Tories said they would raise the threshold to £1million at the next election. But the promise was quietly dropped when the coalition with the Lib Dems was formed in 2010. New figures yesterday showed that in 2013-14 the Treasury clawed back £3.4billion in inheritance tax, up 10 per cent in a year. Since the financial crash in 2008, the amount has soared by 20 per cent or £563million. Increase: New figures from HMRC yesterday showed £3.4billion was raised from inheritance tax, the highest figure since before the financial crash . Britain has . an inheritance tax threshold of £325,000 but an increasing number of . people are having the value of their assets diminished as the threshold . hasn’t been kept in line with house price rises. Earlier . this year the Office for Budget Responsibility warned that the . proportion of estates hit by death duties was set to double from almost . one in 20 to nearly one in ten during the next five years. A new political row emerged this week over plans to impose additional taxes on estates to pay for social care. Speaking out: Labour peer Lord Glasman said recently: 'It's good to tax the dead as they don't vote' Lord Glasman, a former guru of Labour leader Ed Miliband, recently joked that Labour should introduce a ‘death tax’ to pay for long-term care – because the dead can’t vote. Lord Glasman spoke out in favour of plans mooted by the party which could see everyone charged up to 15 per cent of their estate to pay for rising care bills. The academic, who was given a peerage by the Labour leader, said: ‘It’s good to tax the dead as they don’t vote’. At the same conference, the party’s spokesman for civil society, Lisa Nandy, said she thought a compulsory levy on people’s estates was a ‘reasonable idea’. The Tories have accused Labour of wanting to resurrect a ‘death tax’ to pay for social care. Health Secretary Andy Burnham has often said he would like to see a compulsory levy to pay for elderly care. Last month he told another Fabian Society conference that he wanted Labour to ‘embrace’ a system where social care is funded by a tax on estates when people die. Mr Burnham said Labour was holding ‘internal discussions’ about the tax, which it is understood would be levied on top of the 40 per cent inheritance tax. He said a tax on estates would act as ‘insurance’ for people who fear punitive care costs when they get older. He said it would only be possible . However, Labour insists it is not party policy to increase levis on people at death. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘People who save all their lives deserve better than a secret tax bombshell if Labour were ever to get in. ‘Our priorities are different: legislation to protect people from sky-high care costs and sensible incentives to encourage people to save for their own needs.’ Homebuyers paid more than £5billion in stamp duty last year, with Londoners and those on the outskirts of the capital footing most of the bill. Of the £5.1billion which Nationwide estimates homebuyers spent in 2013/14, Londoners paid £2.2billion and those who bought in the ‘Outer Metropolitan’ area £962million. ‘Outer Metropolitan’ includes places such as Windsor, Maidenhead, St Albans, Slough, Reading, north Surrey, south Essex, Hertfordshire and the Chilterns. Controversial tax: Homebuyers paid more than £5billion in stamp duty last year, with Londoners and those on the outskirts of the capital footing most of the bill . By comparison, the total paid in the North was £69million, £70million in Wales and £148million in both Yorkshire and the Humber. Figures released separately yesterday by Revenue and Customs also show two-thirds of homebuyers are paying the controversial tax. The two sets of figures highlight the Government’s failure to increase stamp duty thresholds – the level at which the tax is charged. Until 1997, stamp duty was charged at just one per cent on all homes sold for £60,000 or more. Today it is charged at one per cent only on properties between £125,000 and £250,000 and three per cent on those worth up to £500,000. Rates continue to rise to a maximum of seven per cent on homes worth more than £2million. If the thresholds had been increased at the rate at which house prices are rising, the three per cent band would begin at £645,000, rather than £250,001. The report also reveals the huge disparity between the number of homes bought in each area compared to the amount they are paying in stamp duty. Of the 830,000 properties bought in England and Wales in 2013/14, 14 per cent were in the capital, but Londoners paid 42 per cent of all the money paid in stamp duty. Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide, said: ‘Variation in house prices has a strong impact on how much stamp duty is paid across different regions of the UK. ‘Some regions contribute a much greater share of the total stamp duty revenues than their share of housing transactions might suggest.’ Overall, Nationwide said the average house price is £188,949 after rising 0.1 per cent in July. Paul Smith of estate agents Haart said: ‘House prices are not falling off a cliff. They are currently having a welcome “pit-stop”.’","Amount raised rises by £1billion since 2009, HMRC figures show .

"There is something about the subject of Joe Hart that is guaranteed to get under the skin of Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini. Perhaps, after naming him as a substitute for the 3-0 defeat by Arsenal in the Community Shield at Wembley, he just doesn’t really fancy him. It has always felt that way. Pellegrini picked Willy Caballero to play in goal ahead of Hart as the countdown to City’s title defence gets under way. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pellegrini refuse to back Joe Hart as his number one . Playing for keeps: Joe Hart and Willy Caballero will compete to be Manchester City's No 1 this season . ‘All 22 players we have in our squad must demonstrate who is No 1 in all positions,’ claimed Pellegrini. ‘Joe finished last season playing well. We will see next Sunday who starts at Newcastle.’ On Sunday, Caballero, the Argentine keeper who worked with Pellegrini at Malaga, looked no better than Hart. Priced at £6million, he looked ordinary. In a head-to-head, Hart has won two Premier League titles with City and is the established first choice England keeper (not that that says very much). At 32, Caballero’s last big trophy win was the Copa Libertadores with Boca Juniors in 2003. He was so far off the radar of Argentina coach Alex Sabella he didn’t even make their World Cup squad. Pellegrini, though, is a title-winning coach with City and his views, difficult to comprehend on this matter, ought to be respected. He knows what Caballero is capable of, even if we saw no evidence of it during a disturbing performance from the champions. Average: Will Caballero failed to impress on his competitive debut in the Community Shield . No protection: Willy Caballero was not helped by a second string Manchester City defence in front of him . Hart, who won his second Premier League medal last season, played 90 minutes against Olympiacos in the Guinness Challenge Cup last week and got half a game against Liverpool on July 31. Even taking into account an extended break since the World Cup, he has not spent enough time in goal during City’s pre-season. ‘Hart only arrived 10 days ago and the other players have been working for longer,’ said Pellegrini. ‘Aguero, Zabaleta, Demichelis, Kompany, Sagna and Fernandinho only arrived seven days ago. We will see who is ready and who is not next week.’ City looked anything but ready on Sunday. To be fair to Caballero, the four defenders in front of him — Gael Clichy, Dedryck Boyata, Matija Nastasic and Aleksandar Kolarov — were a huge disappointment. Captain Vincent Kompany and new signing Bacary Sagna were in the stands to watch their team pulled all over the pitch by this fluid Arsenal team. ‘Sagna, what’s the score?’ crowed Arsenal’s supporters and they had every right to have a dig. Based on this, he made the wrong choice. Glove and war: Joe Hart has hardly been involved in manchester City's pre-season after an extended break . In April 2011, just as Manchester City were about to really get going under Sheik Mansour, the Wembley experience was something special. Roberto Mancini’s players posed for selfies before kick-off and went souvenir hunting after beating Manchester United 1-0 in the FA Cup semi-final. Everything, from the smell of the freshly-cut lawn at the national stadium to the Molton Brown soap dispensers in the industrial-sized dressing rooms, was unique. On Sunday, the champions of England, on their sixth visit to the Wembley since that victory in the semi-final, played like they didn’t want to be there. It was a chance for Pellegrini to show that this team is ready for the challenges ahead. Instead they couldn’t get out of the place quick enough. VIDEO My team weren't ready . Second best: After trading barbs, Arsene Wenger got the better of Manuel Pellegrini at Wembley . Jose Mourinho counts his Community Shield success with Chelsea in 2005, plus equivalent Super Cup win with Inter Milan and Real Madrid, as a trophy. So should City. This is the start of the season, an official fixture that is broadcast around the world. Perhaps they are getting a bit too casual, too familiar with that walk into the Wembley dressing rooms now they are a major force again.

"The slopes of a huge Martian volcano, once covered in ice, may have been home to one of the most recent habitable environments to be found on the red planet. Geological landforms discovered on Arsia Mons, the Mars’ third tallest volcano, suggest that lakes could have existed on the planet 210 million years ago. Researchers believe the lakes may have been home to bacteria and other single-celled organisms which evolved at the same time as dinosaurs began appearing on Earth. Heat from a volcano erupting would have created lakes of liquid water on Mars in the relatively recent past. Pictured in the inset are channels created by water flows emerging from the edge of glacial deposits roughly 210 million years old. The main image shows the Arsia Mons volcano with the colours indicating elevation . Nearly twice as tall as Mount Everest, Arsia Mons would have produced intense heat from eruptions that melted massive amounts of ice to form englacial lakes. These are bodies of water that form within glaciers like liquid bubbles in a half-frozen ice cube. The ice-covered lakes of Arsia Mons would have held hundreds of cubic miles of meltwater, according to calculations by Kat Scanlon, a graduate student at Brown University in New York. And where there’s water, there’s the possibility of a habitable environment. ‘This is interesting because it’s a way to get a lot of liquid water very recently on Mars,’ Ms Scanlon said. Pictured is the giant Arsia Mons volcano on the Martian surface. Scientists believe the heat from Arsia Mons’ eruptions would have melted massive amounts of ice to form englacial lakes. These are bodies of water that form in glaciers like liquid bubbles in a half-frozen ice cube . While 210 million years ago might not sound recent, the Arsia Mons site is much younger than the habitable environments turned up by Curiosity and other Mars rovers. Those sites are all likely older than 2.5 billion years. The fact that the Arsia Mons site is relatively young makes it an interesting target for possible future exploration. ‘If signs of past life are ever found at those older sites, then Arsia Mons would be the next place I would want to go,’ Ms Scanlon said. Scientists have speculated since the 1970s that the northwest flank of Arsia Mons may once have been covered by glacial ice. This is because the terrain around Arsia Mons looks strikingly similar to landforms left by receding glaciers in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica. The ice-covered lakes of Arsia Mons would have held hundreds of cubic miles of meltwater, according to calculations by Kat Scanlon, a graduate student at Brown University in New York. Pictured is an artist's impression of what this may have looked like on a warmer, wetter Mars . Parallel ridges toward the bottom of the mountain appear to be drop moraines — piles of rubble deposited at the edges of a receding glacier. A group of small hills in the region also appears to be debris left behind by slowly flowing glacial ice. Working with the Lancaster Environmental Centre, Ms Scanlon found evidence that hot volcanic lava may have flowed in the region the same time that the glacier was present. Data from Nasa’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter revealed pillow lava formations similar to those that form on Earth when lava erupts at the bottom of an ocean. She also found the kinds of ridges and mounds that form on Earth when a lava flow is constrained by glacial ice. The pressure of the ice sheet constrains the lava flow, and glacial meltwater chills the erupting lava into fragments of volcanic glass, forming mounds and ridges with steep sides and flat tops. Ms Scanlon calculated that two of the lava deposits would have created lakes containing around 25 cubic miles (40 cubic kilometres) of water each. Even in the frigid conditions of Mars, that much ice-covered water would have remained liquid for a long period of time. Ms Scanlon’s back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests the lakes could have persisted or hundreds or even a few thousand years. That may have been long enough for the lakes to be colonised by microbial life forms, if such creatures ever inhabited Mars, the researchers said. Super bugs from Earth could . soon hitch a ride into space, arrive on the red planet and trick . scientists into thinking they are Martians. This . is according to Nasa researcher, Dr Kasthuri Venkateswaran, who has . expressed serious concern that microbes may beat humans in the race to . colonise Mars. Dr . Venkateswaran highlights recent research that shows some bugs are more . resilient than first thought and could use protective mechanisms to . survive deep space flights. Currently, . spacecraft landing on Mars or other planets where life might exist must . meet requirements for a maximum allowable level of microbial life. These . acceptable levels were based on studies of how various life forms . survive exposure to the challenges associated with space travel. ‘If . you are able to reduce the numbers to acceptable levels, a proxy for . cleanliness, the assumption is that the life forms will not survive . under harsh space conditions,’ Dr Venkateswaran said. However, . spores of Bacillus pumilus have shown high resistance to techniques . used to clean spacecraft, such as ultraviolet radiation and peroxide . treatment. When researchers exposed this hardy . organism to a simulated Mars environment that kills standard spores in . 30 seconds, it survived 30 minutes.","Evidence comes from landforms found on the flanks of Arsia Mons volcano .

"It's been frequented by two former presidents, and now South Korea's longest-running dog meat restaurant is set to close. Tourists and locals have eaten at Daegyo – which serves boshintang or dog stew – for 33 years. But, chef and restaurant owner Oh Keum-il will serve her last bowl on Friday. Owner Oh Keum-il of Daegyo, the dog meat restaurant, shows how she cooks at her eatery in Seoul . Oh stands outside of her restaurant in Seoul. There is no official data on the dog meat industry, but people who raise dogs as livestock or supply dog meat to diners say its consumption is in decline . The 58-year-old's lifelong experience with a food eaten for centuries in Korea is about to become history. In her twenties, Oh travelled around North and South Korea to learn dog meat recipes from each region. She went to Pyongyang and tasted a dozen different dog dishes, from dog stew to dog taffy, all served lavishly at the Koryo, one of the North Korea's best hotels. She adapted famous dishes to include dog meat, replacing beef with dog in South Korea's signature dish bibimbap. Opposite views on dogs as either for eating or petting have co-existed in the country's recent history, feeding a controversy that becomes most bitter in the summer. A man plays with his his best friend at a dog cafe in Seoul. Young South Koreans grow up watching TV shows about raising puppies and other pets, which sapped appetite for dog meat, said Oh . On three 'dog days,' which are among the hottest times of the year, many South Koreans queue for the dish of shredded dog meat and vegetables in hot red soup, believing it gives strength to bear the heat. Animal rights activists protest nearby, urging people not to eat man's best friend. The closure of Oh's restaurant, dubbed by a local newspaper as the 'Holy Land of boshintang' shows one view of dogs is gaining more traction among young South Koreans. Most young people eat chicken soup on a dog day and even those who eat dog tend to refrain from talking about it openly, according to Moon Jaesuk, a 32-year-old researcher who enjoyed eating dog meat before he moved to Seoul. 'It's not easy to talk about eating dog when there are a lot of people,' he said. Young South Koreans grow up watching TV shows about raising puppies and other pets, which sapped appetite for dog meat, Oh said. A dog meat dish from Daegyo, a restaurant which has been serving the Korean delicacy for 33 years . 'There is too much generational gap in boshintang,' said Oh. 'There are no young customers.' Her restaurant used to sell as many as 700 bowls of dog stew a day in the 80s. These days it is less than half that. Young Koreans also enjoy a diverse dining culture unlike previous generations that came of age amid the poverty that followed the 1950-1953 Korean War. Sometimes the differing perceptions of dogs become a source of family tension. Kim Dongyoung, 30, said she gets into fierce arguments with her grandfather over her lap dog. 'Whenever he saw my dog at home, he would say it's the size of one bowl of hot soup,' Kim said. She recently pulled out of signing a lease for an apartment when she saw it was in the same building as a dog stew restaurant. When she was in her twenties, Oh traveled around South Korea to learn dog meat recipes from each region . There is no official data on the dog meat industry, but people who raise dogs as livestock or supply dog meat to diners say its consumption is in decline. Butcher Shin Jang-gun who supplies dog cuts to restaurants said the number of merchants in the dog meat trading business has shrunk to half of what it was. He keeps a list of between 700 and 800 restaurants in Seoul, some current and others potential clients, and believes there was once more than 1,500 . His father sold only dog meat for several decades. After Shin inherited the butcher shop in southern Seoul in 2002, he added goat meat to offset declining dog meat sales. 'Dog is not an industry with a long-term future,' Shin said. 'New generations don't eat a lot.' Choi Young-im, secretary general of an association of dog farmers, said dog meat which used to be popular, has been overtaken by duck but will remain a fixture on menus. Choi estimated between 2 million and 2.5 million dogs are consumed in South Korea each year.","Approximately 2.5 million dogs are consumed in South Korea each year .

"Claims: Aurelie Filippetti, 40, France's glamorous Culture and Media Minister alleges that her relationship with Thomas Piketty came to a violent end . His glamorous media image and radical ideas have seen him dubbed the ‘rock star’ economist. But Thomas Piketty – whose bestselling book, Capital In The Twenty-First Century, has been hailed by Unite union boss Len McCluskey and Ed Miliband’s most trusted adviser, Stewart Wood – is actually a woman beater, a ex-lover has claimed.

Aurelie herself spoke about them often in private. She was desperate to . bring Thomas to justice. ‘It was one of the darkest periods of her life.’ Although the pair have both attempted . to keep their private lives a secret, records show that on February 6, . 2009, Ms Filippetti attended a Paris police station to lodge a complaint . about an attack. Soon . afterwards Mr Piketty was investigated for ‘violence between domestic . partners’ – a crime that carries a jail sentence of up to 14 years. At the time, Ms Filippetti was  a spokeswoman for the Socialist Party, then in opposition, which Mr Piketty was also advising on economic policy. Both were close to Segolene Royal, the party’s 2007 presidential candidate and the mother of president Francois Hollande’s four children. An investigating officer confirmed: ‘The . complaint was examined very thoroughly. The accuser was in a very . distressed state on the day she attended the police station and did not . leave until close to midnight.’ Arrested: Thomas Piketty confirmed he had been arrested and held in custody but disputed the allegations . Police also confirmed  that the accusations included Ms Filippetti ‘having been hit’ and that she had  a medical examination. Mr Piketty was formally charged on March 17, 2009. But the politician then asked for the charges to be dropped – apparently because she did not want her daughter Clara, now 15, to hear details of the claims. Mr Piketty – a professor at  the Paris School of Economics – originally described the claims  as ‘stories from the gutter’. A . spokesman for Ms Filippetti said: ‘Mr Piketty has recognised the facts . of the violence against Ms Filippetti  and apologised, so in the . interests of the families  and children she did  not proceed.’ Last . night Mr Piketty confirmed he had been arrested and held in custody but . disputed the allegations: ‘The case closed five years ago. There was no . factual or legal basis to pursue it.’ Economist: Thomas Piketty's bestselling book, Capital In The Twenty-First Century, has been hailed by Unite union boss Len McCluskey and Ed Miliband¿s most trusted adviser, Stewart Wood .","Aurelie Filippetti claims her relationship with Piketty came to a violent end .

"A suit that can help some disabled people walk again has been approved for home use. The first-of-a-kind set of robotic leg braces act like an exoskeleton for people paralysed from the waist down, allowing them to stand and walk without assistance. At the heart of the system are a series of motion sensors attached to leg braces, as well as motorised joints that respond to subtle changes in upper-body movement. A RoboCop-style suit that can help some disabled people walk again has been approved for home use. The first-of-a-kind set of robotic leg braces act like an exoskeleton for people paralysed from the waist down, allowing them to stand and walk without assistance . A harness around the wearer’s waist and shoulders keeps the suit in place, and a backpack holds the computer and rechargeable battery. Crutches are used for stability. The ReWalk exoskeleton, launched two years ago, has already helped countless people walk again, but getting hold of one was always difficult. The 'robotic trousers' were first cleared for personal use in the UK in 2012 and have been available throughout Europe since that time for around £45,000. Now the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given full approval for its use in the U.S - and it will be sold for around $69,500. A harness around the wearer's waist and shoulders keeps the suit in place, and a backpack holds the computer and rechargeable battery. Crutches are used for stability . As well as the ability to stand and walk independently, clinical studies of ReWalk show health benefits to the user, on both a physiological and psychological level . The device was developed by Amit Goffer, the founder of Israel-based Argo Medical Technologies, who was paralysed following a car crash in 1997. Radi Kaiof is an Israeli who is trained to use the device. He lost the use of his legs while serving in the Israeli army. 'For me it is amazing, the freedom, to be told I can walk after I thought I could never walk again is brilliant,' he said. It only took five two-hour sessions for Radi to be completely trained on the system. Rather than forcing the user into motion the system gives them complete control of the device. From a watch, Radi selects what he wants to do - such as stand, sit, walk and ascend - and then uses his body movement to control it. After choosing to walk, all he needs to do is lean forward, and to stop he simple leans upright. As well as the ability to stand and walk independently, clinical studies of ReWalk show health benefits to the user, on both a physiological and psychological level. According to the company, there are potential improvements in cardiovascular health, loss of fat tissue, building of lean muscle mass, and improved bowel function. ReWalk users have said it also helps with better pain management, fewer medications, and reduces hospital visits. ‘ReWalking is much more than walking,' says Jeff Dykan, Argo’s Chairman of the Board. 'ReWalk provides paralysed individuals with the ability to stand and walk, to look someone in the eye, to hug and be hugged. ‘These are simple acts which many of our ReWalkers thought they would never be able to do again.’ A radical new suit for the firefighter of the future has been revealed that could give them superhuman strength. The . exoskeleton would allow firefighters to easily rescue and carry people . out of fires, or take heavy equipment up flights of stairs inside a . burning building. It can be . fitted with a range of gadgets for different missions, including a high . pressure water hose that clips onto the arm. 'Each . year, an estimated 15,500 high-rise structure fires cause 60 civilian . deaths, 930 injuries, and $252 million in property loss,' said Melbourne . designer Ken Chen. 'High-rise . buildings can hold thousands of people well above the reach of fire . department aerial devices, once the fire is above the operational reach . of aerial ladder or elevating platforms the chance of rescuing victims . is near zero.'

"A Texas man is battling for custody of his first-born daughter after his wife successfully gave her up for adoption without telling him - to a family who now refuses to return the girl. Terry Achane, 31, a drill instructor in South Carolina, says it was just days after he left his pregnant wife for his new job out of state that she quietly signed over their unborn baby to a family of seven in Utah. His newborn baby, whom he had wanted to name Teleah, was given to Jared and Kristi Frei, who now say the girl is theirs and won't give her back without a fight. Custody: Teleah was put up for adoption by her birth mother in 2011 without her father's knowledge or consent . Mr Achane says that he and his wife, Tira Bland, were having marital problems not long after learning she was pregnant in 2010, leading to her decision and his now spiraling struggle today despite a judge ordering the girl returned to him last October. The now ex-husband says Ms Bland had suggested having an abortion or giving their child up for adoption - fearing she would end up as a single mother - but he said no, encouraging their daughter's birth. It was just months later in February of 2011 that Mr Achane found himself sent to Fort Jackson in South Carolina for work, believing he’d leave and come back a new dad. Ten days after his move, however, his wife went gave birth to a premature baby and signed away their child before cutting all contact with her husband. 'I was like, ""Utah? Where is Utah?"" I’d never been to Utah. She's never been to Utah,'"" Mr Achane told the Salt Lake City Tribune of the moment he first heard the bizarre and horrifying news. Sent to live with Jared and Kristi Frei, who had spent . the last few years struggling to naturally expand their family of five . children, the baby found herself in the city of Spanish Fork. New home: Days after Tia Bland gave birth to her daughter while her husband was working out of state, Kristi Frei, a Utah mother of six others welcomed the baby into her home . 'We knew that we were not done having children, but after years of sudden infertility and several miscarriages … we discovered somewhere down the line that Kristi had advanced endometriosis, and would not likely conceive or carry another child again,' the Frei family write of their struggle in a blog aimed at raising money for their court battle. Turning to adoption, in early 2009 the Frei family grew their family by one more with a baby boy named James. Desiring to add one more child - 'a close, similar sibling' for James as they write - they found Mr Achane's daughter, whom they named Leah. 'Since that eventful day, we have, as a family, come to know that this dream was a righteous desire blessed to fruition by God, and that Leah would be that child - and yet, little did we know the challenges and trials that awaited us in finding and fighting for this little girl,' they write. The adoption agency Adoption Center of Choice told the new family that Mr Achane wasn't aware of his daughter's placement with them and he would most likely contest it if he had found out. The Tribune reports that Ms Bland had given the adoption agency Mr Achene's former address in Texas for contact, knowing full well at the time that he was not living there. Scared: The baby's mother, Tira, pictured, told the family in Utah that she was alone and scared during her baby's birth and wasn't sure if her marriage would last . With the judge's recent ruling  he noted the Freis family acknowledging the risk of the father's upset but 'decided they wanted to proceed forward with the adoptive placement anyway.' Kept in the dark throughout this with months of being unable to reach his wife, Mr Achane asked a friend to visit her home in Texas who reported that the house appeared vacant. Feverishly calling anyone who may know where his wife could be, while fearing she may have carried out the abortion she once threatened to do, he learned from a family doctor that his wife was no longer pregnant but they could not legally disclose what had happened to the baby. An ounce of relief only came to the horrified man when his wife finally called him in June, telling him she had signed away their baby to the Frei family. ‘I believe she felt guilty at that point because she just made a call out of the blue,' he said of his ex-wife’s phone call. Once he learned of his daughter's fate, he immediately tried to track his little girl down but upon contact with the adoption center they refused to disclose any information on her whereabouts. The agency told the court in October that it was standard procedure to not share any information with a father of a potential adoptive child when asked. Missing: The baby's mother admitted to giving the adoption agency an incorrect address for her husband to use as contact, preventing him from finding out about his little girl's whereabouts for months . 'I am not a very religious person,' Mr Achane has since told the Tribune, 'but thou shalt not steal.' Speaking of the drawn out legal battle, he said: 'If they prolong it, that is more time away from my daughter. There are precious moments I can’t get back. ... It has been a year and a half now. There is no court order saying they have the right to my child. I just won the case. I want to get my daughter and raise my daughter,' he said. Judge Darold McDade berated the Adoption Center of Choice's handling as 'utterly indefensible.' 'This is a case of human trafficking,' Mr Achane's attorney Mark Wiser told the Tribune. 'Children are being bought and sold. It . is one thing what [adoption agencies] have been doing with unmarried . biological fathers. It is in a new area when they are trying to take a . child away from a married father who wants to have his child.' When an attorney for the Frei family contacted Mr Achane, asking him to consent to the adoption, he said no and demanded his little girl returned to him - to the Frei family's complete surprise. 'Over the last 19 months, despite the law requiring that a father show interest in his child and at least attempt regular communication to establish a bond, the father has never shown any interest in Leah other than to hire an attorney,' the family writes in their blog. Despite a judge's order to return the child within 60 days, the family now asks that his parental rights granting him custody of her be terminated. They accuse him of abandoning both the mother and baby during her pregnancy and therefore demonstrating no capability for raising the girl. 'The right of a fit, competent parent to raise the parent’s child without undue government interference is a fundamental liberty interest that has long been protected by the laws and constitution of this state of the United States, and is a fundamental public policy of this state,’ said Judge McDade. He added that there is no law requiring the father to 'prove himself' as fit to father his own child. 'Once Mr Achane contacted the Adoption Center of Choice ... to let them know he opposed the adoption and wanted his daughter back, that should have been the end of this case,' said Mr McDade. Not going down without a fight, the Freis vow to appeal the judge's decision, asking friends and family to support their case financially through their blog. They note having paid for 'two already expensive adoptions (each costing around $25,000),' with a continuing fight only requiring more money. Their online petition has since raised more than $20,000. A hearing has been set for January 16 of next year on the child's transition back to her father.","Texas couple were experiencing marital trouble when husband took a job out of state leading to the quiet adoption .

"A filmmaker and scientists believe a 'huge' super shark could have eaten a three-metre great white shark that was being tracked in a satellite program. The tracking tag washed up on a Western Australia beach with signs it had been bleached by stomach acid and its data showed rapid changes in depth and a rise in temperature reflecting the animal that ate it. Filmmaker Dave Riggs was part of the crew documenting the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's white shark satellite tagging program in 2004 when the three-metre animal was identified about four months before the tag washed up in the Bremer Bay area. Scroll down for video . The three-metre great white shark being tagged before it disappeared off the Western Australia coast in 2004 . 'There was no algae growth and it (the tag) was white - it looked like it had been bleached in stomach acid,' he told MailOnline. The tag showed an abrupt 580-metre-deep fall down a continental shelf and huge temperature rise, indicating the shark had become prey to a much larger creature. 'The data contained on the shark showed at least the tag had been ingested with an animal with the internal temperature of 26 degrees,' Mr Riggs said. After talking to sperm whale hunters in the Bremer Bay area, Mr Riggs learnt of sightings off of an animal about 10-and-a-half metres long and others that were tracked travelling at up to 4.5 knots but did not surface. The graph shows the change in depth as the animal moved down a continental shelf off the Western Australian coast . Filmmaker David Riggs has been trying to solve the mystery of what killed the shark . Through crowd funding, Mr Riggs has been completing expeditions to an area 60 kilometres off the Bremer Bay coast where the shark was tagged. He has invited scientists to go with him and said none had discounted his theories. Mr Riggs believes it is most likely that the shark was eaten by another large shark of the mackerel species. 'But by the same token, I'm not 100 per cent convinced,' he added. 'Looking at the profile of the animal that ate it, 26 degrees, that's pretty high but not enough to be a mammal but it's something seriously huge to sustain that temperature - the larger the animal, the more capable it is of an elevated temperature,' he said. Mr Riggs added that based on the tag data, the animal that ate the device had a stomach area at least one-metre wide. Mr Riggs believes another massive shark could have eaten the three-metre animal . There have been reports of a 10-and-a-half metre animal in waters near where the shark vanished . 'The notion of gigantismis well documented in species, to me that plausible,' he said. But Mr Riggs said he was not alluding to some mythical creature. 'I'm not going down to notion of a prehistoric beast roaming out there,' he said. 'This is nature at work and we are just trying to get to the bottom of something that happened years ago.' 'I don't know that we will ever know what happened to that animal, but if the reports are true (from the whalers) we may get a glimpse at what they saw.' With the mystery sparking Mr Riggs' interest, he sought production funding with his project partners to create The Search for the Ocean's Super Predator for the ABC, which has recently been re-cut for the U.S. audiences. The shark disappeared about 60 kilometres off Bremer Bay on the Western Australia coast . For about eight years Mr Riggs observed the area, 60 kilometres off Bremer Bay, Western Australia,  where the shark was believed to have been taken. The filmmaker observed large numbers of killer whales and also a deep sea hydro carbon system leak in the same area. He also noticed a large aggregation of animals, including sperm whales, pilot whales, blue fin tuna, oceanic sun fish and other species of shark in the area during summer. 'I started joining the dots - it appears to me likely that the incident has something to do with this multi-spieces aggregation,' he said. But Mr Riggs questioned the likelihood of the shark being eaten by a killer whale, because the mammal has a similar temperature to a human and too high for that recorded by the tag. But the filmmaker did develop a theory that the impact of the hydro carbon leak and that it was fertilising the ocean canyon where the shark went missing. 'There's something happening out there that's causing the aggregation of life - there are 36 underwater canyons between Western Australia and South Australia but this is the only one located with this intensity of life,' he said. He hopes to be able to complete a sequel to the original documentary in the future. The great white shark is found on all of Australia's coastline and can range between three-and-a-half to five metres long and weigh on average 1,300 kilograms .","A three-metre great white shark was tagged off the WA coast .

"Forget global warming, the ice sheets of Antarctica face a different and a potentially more imminent threat in the form an active volcano buried deep beneath. Researchers from Washington University discovered the volcano - which is yet to be named - by accident in the Marie Byrd Land region of West Antarctica. Swarms of tremors were detected in January 2010 and February 2011 and ash found trapped in the ice suggest it has been active for around 8,000 years. The new volcano was found buried beneath an ice sheet in West Antarctica, close to the Executive Committee Range of mountains, pictured. While trying to establish the weight of the ice sheet in the region, seismometers measured two swarms of tremors suggesting the volcano is active . The as yet unnamed volcano buried beneath the ice sheet in Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica is believed to be located close to the Executive Committee Range of extinct volcanoes. The Range is made up consisting of five major volcanoes which were found by the United States Antarctic Service expedition in 1940. It is named after the Antarctic Service Executive Committee. The mountains are called Mount Sidley, Mount Waesche, Mount Hampton, Mount Cumming and Mount Hartington and are named after members of the committee. Further mountains, thought to be extinct volcanoes, were discovered in East Antarctica in 1958. This range is called the Gamburtsev Mountain Range and is covered by around 6 kilometres of snow and ice. It is thought to be similar in size to the Alps. Like with the new volcano, and the Executive Committee range, it is unclear exactly what caused these mountains to form. Scientists now believe that a large eruption could cause the ice sheet to melt faster than first thought and cause sea levels to rise. In January 2010, a team of scientists from the St. Louis-based university set up two crossing lines of seismographs across Marie Byrd Land in West Antarctica. Doug Wiens, professor of earth and planetary science at Washington University, and his team wanted to weigh the ice sheet to help create a picture of Antarctica's climate history. Like a giant CT machine, the seismograph array used disturbances created by distant earthquakes to make images of the ice and rock deep within the region. The technology found two bursts of seismic events between January 2010 and March 2011, which Wiens' PhD student Amanda Lough believed were caused by a previously unseen volcano buried over half a mile (1 kilometre) beneath the ice sheet. ‘I started seeing events that kept occurring at the same location, which was odd,’ Lough said. ‘Then I realised they were close to some mountains - but not right on top of them. ‘My first thought was, ""Okay, maybe it’s just coincidence."" But then I looked more closely and realised that the mountains were actually volcanoes and there was an age progression to the range. 'The volcanoes closest to the seismic events were the youngest ones.’ The tremors were weak and very low frequency, which Lough said suggested they weren't caused by movements in tectonic plates, associated with earthquakes. The tremors beneath Marie Byrd Land, pictured, were low frequency suggesting they weren't caused tectonic plates moving. Low-magnitude tectonic tremors typically have frequencies of 10 to 20 cycles per second. The shaking discovered by Lough was 2 to 4 cycles per second making it more like volcanic activity . For example, low-magnitude seismic tremors caused by tectonic movement typically have frequencies of 10 to 20 cycles per second, continued Lough. The shaking she discovered was in frequencies of 2 to 4 cycles per second. Lough then used a global computer model of seismic speeds to find exactly where the seismic events were taking place. It is thought that the newly discovered volcano is near the Executive Committee Range of extinct volcanoes. The researchers also found that almost all of the events happened between 25 to 40 kilometres below the surface. In January 2010 a team of scientists from St. Louis set up two crossing lines of seismographs across Marie Byrd Land in West Antarctica, pictured bottom left on this map of the region. The researchers wanted to weigh the ice sheet to help create a picture of Antarctica's climate history and the volcano was found by accident . Lough said this is ‘extraordinarily deep - deep enough to be near the boundary between the Earth's crust and mantle, called the Moho.’ This suggested to Lough that the tremors weren’t caused by shifting ice or glacial movement. It also further ruled out the tectonic theory. ‘A tectonic event might have a hypocentre 10 to 15 kilometres deep, but at 25 to 40 kilometres, these were way too deep,’ Lough said. This led Lough and her colleague to conclude the tremors and the waveforms they created looked like Deep Long Period earthquakes, or DPLs, which occur in volcanic areas. The seismologists also talked to Antarctica experts Duncan Young and Don Blankenship from the University of Texas. ‘Their best guess is that it came from Mount Waesche, an existing volcano near Mount Sidley. But that is also interesting because scientists had no idea when Mount Waesche was last active, and the ash layer sets the age of the eruption at 8,000 years ago.‘ . ‘Most mountains in Antarctica are not volcanic,’ Wiens said. ‘But most in this area are. Is it because East and West Antarctica are slowly drifting apart? We don't know exactly. But we think there is probably a hot spot in the mantle here producing magma far beneath the surface.’ Mount Sidley, pictured, is part of the Executive Committee Range in Marie Byrd Land and is the last volcano in the chain to rise above the surface of the ice. The group of seismologists detected the new volcanic activity beneath the ice around 30 miles north of Mount Sidley . ‘People aren't really sure what causes DPLs,' Lough continued. ‘It seems to vary by volcanic complex, but most people think it's the movement of magma and other fluids that leads to pressure-induced vibrations in cracks within volcanic and hydrothermal systems.’ Lough added that the volcano will ‘definitely’ erupt in the future but can’t be sure when. Such a subglacial eruption would cause enough heat flow to melt a substantial part of ice sheet. ‘The volcano will create millions of gallons of water beneath the ice - many lakes full,’ said Wiens. This water will cause surrounding streams and sea levels to rise. Lough added, though, that only an enormous eruption - one that released a thousand times more energy than a typical eruption - would be strong enough to breach the ice above the volcano. The findings are published in the Nature Geoscience journal.","The volcano is buried 1km beneath the ice sheets of West Antarctica .

"On the day Mikel Arteta was made club captain at Arsenal Jack Wilshere provided the perfect answer to his critics while also responding to his manager Arsene Wenger's call to assume more responsibility at the club. The 22-year-old has been heavily criticised since being caught on camera smoking on holiday in Las Vegas earlier this summer, but the England midfielder was quick to accept the consequences for his actions and drew a line over the incident.

"A prceless horde of artefacts has been recovered from the site of the first ancient naval battle ever discovered. The find - including helmets, weapons and ancient bronze battle rams - has been rescued from the seabed off the Sicilian coast where they had lain undisturbed for more than 2,000 years. They are the remnants of The Battle of the Egadi Islands - the last clash from the first Punic War - which pitted the Romans against their enemies the Carthagnians and propelled the Romans to Europe-wide domination. Turn back time: Researchers study a rusted helmet that was discovered in the depths of the sea . It looks a little battered! The remnants of a battering ram were amongst the horde of artefacts found . A tablewear jug (left) and amphora-bottle (right) were rescued from the seabed off the Sicilian coast where they had laid for more than 2,000 years . Experts say the finds - which were scattered over some five kilometres and submerged beneath up to 100 metres of sea - represent the first ancient naval battle site ever discovered. British archaeologists hailed the find a 'major discovery' and are now leading the efforts to survey every inch of the nautical battlefield. Jon Henderson, an underwater archaeologist at the University of Nottingham, has been using cutting edge technology aboard a ship aptly titled Hercules to survey the battlefield. He said: 'There has never been an ancient whole battle site discovered before, which is quite surprising when you consider how important sea power is in the Mediterranean. 'It is a major discovery. This is the first major naval battle between the Romans and the Carthagnians. Because the Romans won they were set on the road to Empire and control of the Mediterranean. 'The historical significance is huge, but what is so important is that we are finding battle sites because of changes in underwater technology. 'We are at the cusp of an exciting range of new discoveries.' The finds, including this anchor, were scattered over some five kilometres and submerged beneath up to 100 metres of sea . British archaeologists hailed the find a 'major discovery' and are now leading the efforts to comb the seabed for more . On March 10th, 241BC, the two ancient heavyweights clashed in a huge naval battle off the coast of Sicily. The two powers had been warring for more than 20 years, as the Romans battled for a foothold in the all-important Mediterranean sea. While the Carthagnians were much more powerful on the water, the cunning Romans lay in wait trapping the Carthaginians and blocking off their sea route in a sudden victorious attack. Up to 50 Carthagnian ships were sunk in the bloody attack, killing up to 10,000 men. Around 70 more ships were captured along with their crews, while the rest fled. A project to find the lost battlefield was set up 10 years ago by the Soprintendenza del Mare in Italy and RPM Nautical Foundation. But underwater mapping of the battlefield has just begun. The project has already uncovered some prized artefacts. So far some 11 bronze battering rams used by ships to pummel each other have been fished out of the water, along with bronze helmets and armour. Dr Jon Henderson has been using cutting edge technology aboard a ship to survey the ancient battlefield . So far researchers aboard the ship have found some 11 bronze battering rams used by ships to pummel each other have been fished out of the water, along with bronze helmets and armour . The Battle of the Aegates Islands in 241 BC was a naval battle fought between the fleets of Carthage and the Roman Republic during the First Punic War. It was a victory for the Romans that would lead to their domination in the years to come.Rome lacked a fleet — the ships it had possessed had been destroyed in a previous battle. Yet their enemies, the Carthaginian forces, did little to capitalise on this, allowing Rome to restore its strength and build a new stronger fleet. When the Carthaganians heard about this, they prepared their fleet for battle, and sailed to the Aegates Islands. The Romans sailed out to meet them - but not before stripping their vessels of sails and masts to give them an advantage in rough sea conditions, . By ramming into their enemy's ships and destroying half of the fleet, the Romans won a decisive victory. It was the last battle in the First Punic War, which had raged for 20 years as the two powers fought for supremacy over the western Mediterranean Sea. Dr Henderson said: 'Prior to this project just three bronze rams were known to exist in the whole Mediterranean, and now we have 11, so it is a major change in terms of the amount of physical information we now have about this battle. 'Some scholars had thought that ships were no longer ramming each other and that the rams were just for show. 'But we have found bits of the enemy ships in some of the rams so it's very likely they were ramming each other.' Experts plan to cast the rams and use them to reconstruct what the ancient ships would look like. Archaeologists had spent years scouring the shallow waters off the island of Levanzo, just west of Sicily, searching for the infamous battlefield. But they only finally discovered the site after hearing stories told by old Sicilian divers that ancient lead anchors were lying on the seabed, off the Egadi Islands. Professor of pre-history and Soprintendenza del Mare, Professor Tusa said: 'The stories these divers told led me to speculate where this battle might have taken place. 'To prove my hypothesis I carried out a series of dives and discovered 50 anchors. Local fishermen brought up a bronze helmet from the same area and together with the discovery of the first ram my hypothesis became theory.' The area is so rich in archaeological finds that experts believe it could take decades to fully survey and analyse the data from this site. The artefacts are now being analysed at the University of Nottingham. Dr Henderson said: 'For the first time archaeologists have recovered finds in context from the site of an ancient naval battle. 'We can now begin to say something about the fittings and equipment present on ancient warships and indeed what would have been taken into battle. 'It's exciting because we now have archaeological data to add to interpretations which were wholly based on iconographic representations and the ancient literary accounts.'","Remnants found from Battle of Egadi Islands - last clash of first Punic War .

"Arsene Wenger has warned Arsenal’s title rivals that he is armed with his most dangerous attacking unit for years. After his side thumped Manchester City 3-0 in the Community Shield, Wenger said: ‘Three, four, five years ago we lost a big player every year.

Composed: New signing Sanchez led from the front for Arsenal at Wembley against Manuel Pellegrini's City . The impressive victory also suggested Arsenal can reverse last year’s poor results against their main rivals and finally mount a sustained title challenge. Wenger added: ‘Last year we were very consistent against teams outside the top six and not consistent against top-six teams. The year before it was the reverse. It’s hoped that this year it will be right on both sides.’ Goals from Santi Cazorla, Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud sealed victory and Wenger said: ‘To win today gives us a positive platform. You want to win the game and you want to look at the quality of the performance as well. It was important for our confidence to win the game and it was even more important to have a big part in the game with quality. That's the way to kick the season off!

Here to stay: Giroud points to the Arsenal badge after thundering home the third from difference . ‘It is a comfort to me to see the kind of quality we produced for some long patches in the game.’ Sunday's win at Wembley came without World Cup winners Ozil, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski, while Theo Walcott is set to return to full fitness at the end of next month following a serious knee injury. Wenger, who confirmed Sportsmail’s story that Mikel Arteta will captain the club following Thomas Vermaelen’s departure for Barcelona, is set to cool his search for a new centre back following the emergence of Calum Chambers. The 19-year-old made the breakthrough at Southampton as a right back but, as Sportsmail revealed last month, Wenger sees Chambers’ long-term future at centre half. Impressive: Calum Chambers performance could lead Wenger away from signing a new centre-back . The £16million man was excellent and Wenger believes he is ready to challenge first-choice centre backs Laurent Koscielny, who sustained a slight achilles injury at Wembley, and Mertesacker. The Gunners are on the lookout for a new central defender to replace Vermaelen following his £15m move to the Nou Camp. But Wenger said: ‘In my head Chambers is among the best three centre backs I have. If I can find another one I will do it, but to find another one of that quality will not be easy.’","Wenger says they used to lose players like Mesut Ozil and Sanchez .

"Microsoft has made the computer code behind behind its first operating system, MS-DOS, available for free - and revealed programmers included jokes in their code. Launched in 1982, MS-DOS, the  'Disk Operating System' was Microsoft's first commercial operating system. It has now released to code the The Computer History Museum (CHM) - prompting users to comb it for jokes left by the firm's programmers. The MS-DOS code also refers to Bill 'shake' speare. IBM went outside the company for many hardware and software components of their 1981 personal computer. Though most vendors were kept in the dark about the project, code-named “Chess,” IBM developed a unique relationship between their Boca Raton-based team and Microsoft, then a small company based in Seattle. Microsoft, which was providing the BASIC language interpreter, agreed to also supply an operating system. Without their own operating system already in place, they licensed a product from nearby Seattle Computer Products and worked closely with IBM to make the changes they wanted. It shipped as ""PC-DOS"" for IBM and ""MS-DOS"" for other PC manufacturers. The gags include references to programmers being 'gods', comments calling users 'dumb'; and references to Bill 'shake' speare - along wiht liberal use of the word f**k. They were found by internet user Leon Zandman, who posted them to his Twitter account. The code was given to the Computer History Museum (CHM) in the heart of California's Silicon Valley. It announced that it has, with permission from Microsoft Corporation, made available original source code for two historic programs: MS-DOS, the 1982 'Disk Operating System' for IBM-compatible personal computers, and Word for Windows, the 1990 Windows-based version of their word processor. 'Version 1.1 fits an entire operating system – limited as it was – into only 12K bytes of memory, which is tiny compared to today's software,' said Len Shustek, CHM Chairman. The first IBM PC, the 5150, that went to the market on August 11 1981. With a price of 3,280 dollars. It was a machine of 11 kg, 15 cm of height with a small black and green screen of 11.5 inches, and ran Microsoft's MS-DOS software. 'We think preserving historic source code like these two programs is key to understanding how software has evolved from primitive roots to become a crucial part of our civilization.' 'MS-DOS and Word for Windows built the foundation for Microsoft’s success in the technology industry,” said Roy Levin, distinguished engineer and managing director, Microsoft Research. 'By contributing these source codes to the Computer History Museum archives, Microsoft is making these historic systems from the early era of personal computing available to the community for historical and technical scholarship.'

"Scientists have controversially claimed that life on Earth originated in space after plankton were found on the exterior of the ISS. Earlier this week cosmonauts announced they had found the microorganisms living on one of the windows of the Russian segment of the space station. And while the exact origin of these critters is still unknown, it has been claimed they may have come from outer space - supposedly like life on Earth. Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe is best known as the only scientist to argue against evolution during the 1981 Arkansas legal case against the teaching of creationism in schools. Now he claims that plankton on the ISS came from outer space and not from Earth . Experiments have previously shown bacteria can survive outside our planet, but this is thought to be the first time more complex life has been found this far out in space. Their exact origin is not yet known and will require further study - although it may just be contamination from the American segment of the ISS. At the time of the discovery Russian experts said the tiny organisms were carried to the station on air currents from the sea where plankton is found in abundance. However others claim this is impossible, with another explanation being that the minute plants drifted onto the ISS from elsewhere in space. A . controversial academic from the University of Buckinghamshire has . claimed that plankton supposedly found on the exterior of the ISS . (pictured) earlier this week are proof that life on Earth is of . extraterrestrial origin. Professor Wickramasinghe says the plankton must . have come from outer space . Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe is a leading proponent of panspermia, the hypothesis that life exists throughout the universe and is spread by asteroids and comets, in addition to simply drifting through the cosmos. Panspermia proposes that life forms that can survive the effects of space, such as extremophiles, become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life. These life-forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks. If met with ideal conditions on a new planet's surfaces, the bacteria become active and the process of evolution begins, it is believed. They insist this supports theories that plankton - one of the earliest forms of life - must have originally fallen to earth from space billions of years ago. And say this is proof that we are all of extraterrestrial origin, a theory known as panspermia. Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe, of the Buckingham Centre for Astrobiology, said algae-like organisms, or diatoms, have previously been found on meteorites which have fallen to Earth. 'Diatoms have been found on meteorites in Sri Lanka, but there has been no proof where they actually came from,' he said. 'This is the first time that we have evidence that points towards complex living organisms falling from the skies to Earth. 'The space station is orbiting the earth in a total vacuum, there is no air, so it is a total defiance of the laws of physics to say these organisms were blown into space from Earth. 'The only explanation is that they have come from elsewhere in space, and this supports long-held theories that plankton, and therefore all life on Earth including humans, originated from organisms in space. 'Everything that we have on the Earth is derived from space, including humans.' Russia's launches into space take place from the Baikonaur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan . Experts had claimed that the plankton were not carried there at launch and must have been blown their on air currents, because they are marine microorganisms not indigenous to the Russian launch site in Kazakhstan. A SEM microscope view of one type of plankton (not discovered on the ISS) is pictured . Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe is best known as the only scientist to argue against evolution during the 1981 Arkansas legal case against the teaching of creationism in schools. The 74-year-old Sri Lankan-born British mathematician obtained a PhD from Cambridge under the supervision of the late Sir Fred Hoyle. The pair went on to collaborate on a body of work some credit with providing the basis of the field of astrobiology. Their joint work on the infrared spectra of interstellar grains led to developing the hypothesis of panspermia, which proposes that cosmic dust in space and comets is partly organic - and may have 'seeded' life on Earth. They further contended that extraterrestrial life forms continue to enter the Earth's atmosphere, and may be responsible for epidemic outbreaks, new diseases, and the genetic novelty necessary for macroevolution. In 2003 he was joint signatory on a letter sent to The Lancet which suggested that the virus which causes SARS may not come from chickens, but could in fact be from outer space. He was head of Cardiff University's Centre for Astrobiology until 2011, when funding was withdrawn and he was dismissed from his post. He is now Director of the Buckingham Centre for Astrobiology at the University of Buckingham. The discovery was made by Russian cosmonauts Olek Artemyev and Alexander Skvortsov while polishing the windows of the ISS during a spacewalk earlier this week. They found the presence of plankton and other microorganisms using high-precision equipment. The organisms are not native to Baikonur in Kazakhstan where the Russian modules of the station blasted off from so they could not have been carried into space from launch - although they could have been transferred from American parts of the station as Nasa's launches mostly take place near the Atlantic Ocean. 'The results of this experiment are absolutely unique,' said Vladimir Solovyev, chief of the Russian ISS orbital mission. 'We have found traces of sea plankton and microscopic particles on the illuminator [window] surface. This should be studied further.' '[Plankton] is found on the surface of the ocean. It isn’t characteristic to Baikonur [Cosmodrome, from where Russian launches to the space station take place].' Professor Milton Wainwright, microbiologist at Sheffield University, said previous experiments conducted by his team found evidence of diatoms 17 miles (27km) above the Earth’s surface. However he said this is the first time they have been detected so far out with the ISS more than 200 miles (250km) from the planet. He said: 'This is an astonishing development and there is no other explanation other than these organisms came from space in the first place, they could not have blown up from the Earth. 'This is the tipping point towards science proving that life is continually coming to Earth from space, and that it did so in the first instance. 'This is an amazing discovery, and there is now overwhelming evidence emerging that organisms on Earth came from outer space.' Assembly of the International Space Station began in 1998 and today construction has effectively been completed. Aside from housing astronauts to further humanity's space exploration efforts it also serves as a research laboratory for studies in biology, physics, astronomy and meteorology. With regards to the plankton, Nasa has not yet confirmed whether similar findings have been made in the past, nor what their position is on the latest findings. Pictured is a Soyuz rocket carrying the crew of Expedition 31 to the ISS on 12 May 2012. Although it is not likely that plankton were been taken to the ISS from this location, it is possible that contamination from American launches may have spread organisms over the station .

"A bizarre worm-like animal that lived 505 million years ago has been definitively categorised on the ‘Tree of Life’ by scientists. Known as Hallucigenia the creature has legs, spikes, a head and a tail, and has been linked with a group of modern animals for the first time. It had once been considered an ‘evolutionary misfit’ but now researchers have found an important link with modern velvet worms, which live in tropical forests. A bizarre creature that existed 505 million years ago has been classified by scientists. Known as Hallucigenia sparsa (artist's impression shown),  the worm-like creature with legs, spikes and a head difficult to distinguish from its tail has found its place in the evolutionary 'Tree of Life' The discovery published in the journal Nature was made by scientists at the University of Cambridge. The Cambrian explosion, or Cambrian radiation, was the relatively rapid appearance, around 530 million years ago, of most major animal phyla, as demonstrated in the fossil record. Before about 580 million years ago, most organisms were simple, composed of individual cells occasionally organized into colonies. Over the following 70 or 80 million years, the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude (as defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species) and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today. It ended with the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction event, approximately 488 million years ago. The similarity of Hallucigenia to other contemporary 'legged worms', collectively known as lobopodians, has been very controversial. This is because a lack of clear characteristics linking them to each other or to modern animals has made it difficult to determine their evolutionary home. What is more, early interpretations of Hallucigenia, which was first identified in the 1970s, placed it both backwards and upside-down. The spines along the creature's back were originally thought to be legs, its legs were thought to be tentacles along its back, and its head was mistaken for its tail. Hallucigenia lived approximately 505 million years ago during the Cambrian Explosion, a period of rapid evolution when most major animal groups first appear in the fossil record. These particular fossils come from the Burgess Shale in Canada's Rocky Mountains, one of the richest Cambrian fossil deposits in the world. Looking like something from science fiction, Hallucigenia (illustration shown) had a row of rigid spines along its back, and seven or eight pairs of legs ending in claws. The animals were between 0.2 and 1.4 inches (five and 35 millimetres) in length, and lived on the floor of the Cambrian oceans . Which way is the right way? Initially scientists had thought that the creature was supposed to be the other way up, with the spikes acting as the legs and the 'legs' actually being tentacles, but now they think they were looking at it upside down (illustration shown) A new study of the creature's claws revealed an organisation very close to those of modern velvet worms, where layers of cuticle (a hard substance similar to fingernails) are stacked one inside the other, like Russian nesting dolls. The same nesting structure can also be seen in the jaws of velvet worms, which are no more than legs modified for chewing. 'It's often thought that modern animal groups arose fully formed during the Cambrian Explosion,' said Dr Martin Smith of the University's Department of Earth Sciences, the paper's lead author. 'But evolution is a gradual process: today's complex anatomies emerged step by step, one feature at a time. 'By deciphering ""in-between"" fossils like Hallucigenia, we can determine how different animal groups built up their modern body plans.' Hallucigenia had once been considered an ‘evolutionary misfit’ but now researchers have found an important link with modern velvet worms, which live in tropical forests. Pictured here is a stock photo of a velvet worm in Dunedin, South Island, New Zealand . These particular fossils of Hallucigenia come from the Burgess Shale in Canada's Rocky Mountains, one of the richest Cambrian fossil deposits in the world. Pictured is a specimen of Hallucigenia sparsa on display in the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto with its spikes clearly visible . While Hallucigenia had been suspected to be an ancestor of velvet worms, definitive characteristics linking them together had been hard to come by, and their claws had never been studied in detail. Through analysing both the prehistoric and living creatures, the researchers found that claws were the connection joining them together. Cambrian fossils continue to produce new information on origins of complex animals, and the use of high-end imaging techniques and data on living organisms further allows researchers to untangle the enigmatic evolution of earliest creatures. 'An exciting outcome of this study is that it turns our current understanding of the evolutionary tree of arthropods - the group including spiders, insects and crustaceans - upside down,' said Dr Javier Ortega-Hernandez, the paper's co-author. 'Most gene-based studies suggest that arthropods and velvet worms are closely related to each other; however, our results indicate that arthropods are actually closer to water bears, or tardigrades, a group of hardy microscopic animals best known for being able to survive the vacuum of space and sub-zero temperatures - leaving velvet worms as distant cousins.' And Dr Smith added: 'The peculiar claws of Hallucigenia are a smoking gun that solve a long and heated debate in evolutionary biology, and may even help to decipher other problematic Cambrian critters.'","Researchers at the University of Cambridge have classified an ancient worm .

"Swimmers in Florida have been warned about a deadly flesh-eating bacteria that is carried in seawater after three people were killed in the state last month. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that Vibrio vulnificus can enter the body through open wounds or when people swallow water containing the bacteria. So far there have been 13 confirmed cases of infection in Florida, resulting in three fatalities - one in Lee, one in Dixie County and one in Sarasota - according to the Florida Department of Health’s latest figures. Warning: Three people have died from an infection so far in Florida, including one swimmer in Sarasota . The bacteria occurs naturally in the warm Gulf Coast waters and thrives during the summer months. Symptoms of infection include vomiting, fever, . diarrhoea, low blood pressure, swelling and pain in the areas of the . skin that have been infected. Most swimmers are unaffected by the bacteria but it can enter the body through an open wound or sore and eat away the flesh. Anyone . with a low immune system - including people suffering from cancer, . kidney disorders, chronic liver disease or HIV - is also at higher risk of . being infected. Precaution: Tourists are being advised to wash themselves after swimming and to avoid raw shellfish . Hidden danger: The bacteria (pictured left) can also be found in raw shellfish . People have also been warned against eating raw shellfish, which often contains the bacteria. There is no evidence that it can be transmitted from person to person though, according to the CDC. Florida's . state epidemiologist, Carina Blackmore, said: ‘People with underlying . health problems and people who are immune-compromised, especially those . with chronic liver disease, are at higher risk. ‘The bacteria have toxins that are destroying the cells in the tissue. The cells end up dying from the toxin exposure.’ At risk: An aerial view of Sarasota where one person has died as a result of an infection . The . infection can be treated with antibiotics but people have been advised . to seek medical treatment immediately as patients could require surgery . or even amputation if the disease spreads. Swimmers have also been advised to wash themselves thoroughly after swimming in the sea. Around 95 cases of infection are reported in the U.S. each year, 35 of which result in death. In 2013, 41 cases were reported in Florida, resulting in 11 deaths. Along with Florida, infections have also been reported in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.","Vibrio vulnificus carried in warm Gulf Coast waters and thrives in summer .

"A 24-year-old new mother calls her life 'heaven' now, but it didn't always used to be that way. In 1998, at just 8-years-old, Shyima Hall was sold into slavery by her parents in Egypt. She spent the next four years working 20 hours days for a family that hit her, called her stupid, and kept her in a cell-like bedroom. Hall finally got her taste of freedom two years after the family she worked for moved to California, and child services received an anonymous tip about her existence. Child slave: Shyima Hall was sold into slavery by her parents in Egypt when she was just 8-years-old. Now 24, Hall has since gained her freedom and now works as an advocate to spread awareness of child trafficking . Captors: Hall was kept as a slave by wealthy Egyptian couple Abdel Nasser Eid Youssef (left) and his wife Amal Admed Ewis-Abd El Motelib (right) for four years, two of which were spent in Southern California . Now she has written a book, Hidden Girl, shedding more light on her dark years as a servant and how she's bounced back to create a life of her own. 'I want people to know this can happen. Slavery is not in the history book. It's right next to you,' she told People magazine. Hall was one of 11 children born to her parents in the slums south of Alexandria. She says her home life was mostly happy, but her construction-worker father did beat the kids up. Her childhood came to an end the day one of her older sisters was accused of stealing something from the home of her wealthy employers, a man named Abdel Nasser Eid Youssef Ibrahim and his wife Amal Admed Ewis-Abd El Motelib. Used and abused: During her time as a slave, Hall worked 20 hours a day and was only allowed one meal - the family's leftovers from dinner . Hall went with her mother to visit the wealthy couple's house in Cairo and listened as they demanded a younger replacement to make up for the stolen property. Suprisingly, Hall's mother agreed. Hall cried as her mother left and the last thing she said was: 'This is for the good of the family'. Freedom: Hall  gained her freedom two years after the family moved to California and someone sent an anonymous tip about her existence into child services . Hall spent the next two years working for Ibrahim and Motelib who she called 'the Dad' and 'the Mom', caring for the couple's pair of twins three years younger than her and a daughter about the same age. She says the children 'knew what I was and reminded me all the time' while the Dad would smack her with his fist and the Mom would call her 'stupid slave'. The terrible treatment seemed endless for Hall, who would call her mom crying asking when she could come home. 'She'd always say, ""You need to pay off your sister's debt""' Two years later, the family relocated to Irvine, California and their abuse got even worse. In Cairo, the family had a staff, but in the smaller California home Hall was the only doing all the work. She got up at 5:30am every day to get the kids ready for school and proceeded to work on the upkeep of the house for the rest of the day, scared the Mom would come home and criticize her cleaning. She never took a break for eating either since she was only allowed one meal a day - whatever was leftover from the family's dinner. As for Hall's part of the house, the family kept her in a room without heat, air-conditioning or lighting with only a bare mattress to sleep on. She had to wash her clothes by hand after she learned the lesson not to use the washing and drying machines. When the Mom discovered her using the dryer one day she screamed, and said: 'Your clothes are never to touch ours. This bucket is what you wash your clothes in, behind the house.' Video Source The Jeff Probst Show . American now: Hall decided not to return to Egypt to live her family, and decided to stay in the U.S. Above, becoming a citizen in 2011 . In addition to her job at the mall, Hall works to spread awareness of child trafficking. On the left, speaking at an awareness event in 2008 . Hall never considered escape out of fear of what would happen if she was found. 'The Mom and the Dad would tell me ""If you walk out the cops are going to get you and beat you and you'll never see your family again""' Hall remembers. She got through each day by focusing on seeing her three younger siblings again - it 'was all I thought about'. Her lucky day came in 2002 when someone sent an anonymous tip into child services and a group of police, social workers and immigration officials stormed the house and took her away from her abusers. After years as a slave, Hall's only reaction to her freedom was fear. Ibrahim even had the nerve to order her to conceal her identity from police. Published: Hall has written a book on her experiences as a modern child slave . The last thing he told her in Arabic was: 'Don't tell them you work for us, say you're here for a visit'. Hall contacted her parents soon after being released and instead of being happy to have their daughter back, her father was upset she left the family 'that had put a roof over my head'. Her dad told her to return to Egypt, but this time Hall made her own choice and decided to stay in the U.S. She bounced around foster homes for the next few years and eventually became a U.S. citizen, attended three years of community college and now she works as an assistant manager at a luggage store. In addition to her job, Hall works to spread awareness of human trafficking and hopes to one day become an Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent. She also has a daughter, Athena, with boyfriend Daniel Eurquidez. 'Holding her up in my arms, I couldn't imagine giving her up - not even to save the world,' Hall said. 'i have my beautiful daughter and my boyfriend. It was a hard road, but I'm 100 per cent okay.' Her father has since died, and she hasn't seen her family since gaining her freedom. But she does hope to one day reconnect with her siblings. Both Ibrahim and Motelib were convicted and sentenced to two to three years in prison. Motelib was deported back to Egypt but her husband may still be living in Southern California.","In 1998 Shyima Hall was sold into slavery by her parents in Egypt to repay a debt .

If you put a cat inside an opaque box and make his life dependent on a random event, when does the cat die? When the random event occurs, or when you open the box? Common sense may suggest the former, but quantum mechanics suggests someone has to observe the result before the cat is dead. Continuous monitoring of a quantum system can direct it along a random path. This map shows how scientists tracked the transition between two states many times to determine how it changes. They found quantum particles follow the classical path of least resistance . Until that moment, the cat is both dead and alive at the same time. Now physicists at the University of California, Berkeley, have for the first time showed that, in fact, it's possible to follow the metaphorical cat through the whole process – regardless of whether the cat lives or dies. The researchers were able to do this by tracking the path that quantum particles, such as atoms or photons, follow. What they saw is that quantum particles follow the classical path of least resistance – just as pedestrian paths on streets gradually emerge after new sod is laid. Kater Murch (right), assistant professor of physics, and junior Chris Munley work with the equipment that can map a quantum device’s trajectory between two points in quantum state space, a feat until recently considered impossible . Usually, when quantum particles are 'touched' by the outside world, they lose this quantum strangeness and collapse into a ‘classical state’. But in the past 20 years, physicists have devised devices that isolate quantum systems from the environment and allow them to be probed so gently that they don’t immediately collapse. Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment created by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935. In the hypothetical experiment a cat is placed in a sealed box next to a radioactive sample, a Geiger counter and a bottle of poison. If the Geiger counter detects that the radioactive material has decayed, it will trigger the smashing of the bottle of poison and the cat will be killed. The experiment was designed to show the flaws in something known as the ‘Copenhagen interpretation’ of quantum mechanics. This states that a particle exists in all states at once until observed. If the Copenhagen interpretation suggests the radioactive material can have simultaneously decayed and not decayed in the sealed environment, then it follows the cat too is both alive and dead until the box is opened. With these devices, scientists can at last follow quantum systems into the bizarre and murky world of quantum territory. ‘Real-time tracking of a quantum system shows that it's a continuous process, and that we can constantly extract information from the system as it goes from quantum to classical,’ said Irfan Siddiqi, UC Berkeley associate professor of physics. ‘This level of detail was never considered accessible by the original founders of quantum theory.’ Professor Siddiqi’s experiment involved using a simple superconducting circuit that has different energy levels, or states, just like an atom. The team used the system’s lowest two energy levels, the ground state and an excited state, as their model quantum system. Between these two states, there are an infinite number of quantum states and the device was able to probe these energy levels before they collapsed into a classical. The quantum state of the circuit was detected by putting it inside a microwave box. A very small number of microwave photons were sent into the box where their quantum fields interacted with the superconducting circuit. The box then provided information about the quantum system in the form of a phase shift – or the position of the troughs and peaks of something known as the photons’ wavefunctions. In Schrödinger's experiment refers to a hypothetical cat in a box (stock picture shown), whose fate is decided by subatomic particles. According to the theory, it is both alive and dead until someone looks at it . Because even gentle probing makes each quantum trajectory noisy, the team repeated the experiment a million times and examined which paths were most common. ‘But real-time tracking of a quantum system shows that it's a continuous process, and that we can constantly extract information from the system as it goes from quantum to classical,’ said Professor Siddiqi. For quantum computers, this would allow continuous error correction. 'The implications are significant, as now we can design control sequences to steer a system along a certain trajectory,’ said Professor Siddiqi. ‘For example, in chemistry one could use this to prefer certain products of a reaction over others.' Chemistry at its most basic level is described by quantum mechanics. In the past 20 years, chemists have developed a technique called quantum control, where shaped laser pulses are used to drive chemical reactions. ‘The chemists control the quantum field from the laser, and that field controls the dynamics of a reaction,’ explained Kater Murch, PhD, an assistant professor of physics at Washington University. 'Eventually, we’ll be able to control the dynamics of chemical reactions with lasers instead of just mixing reactant one with reactant two and letting the reaction evolve on its own,' he said.","In Schrödinger's cat experiment, a cat in a box, whose fate is decided by subatomic particles, is both alive and dead until someone looks at it .

The enormous Mola Mola, which is also commonly known as the sunfish, develop their truncated, bullet-like shape because the back fin, with which they are born, never grows. Weighing in at 1000kg, the Mola Mola is one of the heaviest fish in the ocean. All three species of sunfish are found in all tropical and temperate oceans. The word mola comes from Latin and means millstone–in reference to these fishes’ roundish shape. Mola molas got became more widely known as 'ocean sunfish' because of their habit of lying atop the surface of the water appearing to sunbathe. Alien: The Giant Mola mola fish is one of the more unusually looking creatures swimming in the ocean . The peculiar looking fish has been discovered much further away from its normal habitats. A dog walker made a rare discovery when he found a six stone Mola mola fish the size of a child washed up on the beach near his home. Matt Hyde, 44, was walking his Labrador Jimmy along The Sandilands beach near Sutton-on-Sea, Lincolnshire when he nearly tripped over the blob-like creature. The find was even more unusual than he thought as it turned out to be a a Mola mola, or Ocean sunfish, which normally lives thousands of miles away in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.","Giant Mola Mola fish is a doppleganger for polar bear .

"Americans who consider human-linked climate change a load of hogwash and environmentalists kooks have rolled out a new way to express their political views: their exhaust pipes. Some truck enthusiasts are reconfiguring their vehicles to produce higher amounts of diesel exhaust in a form of protest dubbed 'rolling coal'. In some cases, they are even adding smokestacks to enhance the effect. Their aim is to spew thick black clouds of smoke into the air - or at cars - sometimes spending thousands of dollars to do so, according to the Huffington Post. The Rollin' Coal community Facebook page has 15,241 likes. Scroll down for video . A community of truck enthusiasts has been posting pictures on social media of their modified vehicles spewing thick clouds of black smoke in a new trend dubbed 'rolling coal' A ford pickup truck ejects a thick cloud of sooty black exhaust in this photo posted on Facebook, where a page devoted to 'coal rollers' has garnered more than 15,000 likes . Some in the community modify their trucks with smokestacks to boost their vehicle's smoke-belching capacity . One modification to their vehicles being used involves increasing the amount of fuel entering the truck's engine. When there's too much fuel, the engine fails to combust properly, turning it into soot. 'It’s just fun,' said Robbie, a 25-year-old mechanic in South Carolina who has been 'rollin' coal' since he got his first truck 12 years ago, according to Vocativ. 'Just driving and blowing smoke and having a good time.' A man shows off his smoke-spewing truck in a photo posted on Facebook. The vehicles are modified so that more fuel is forced into the engine, creating extra soot . The trucks are able to create copious amount of smoke on demand, enabling them to spew it on unsuspecting cars. They call the soot 'Prius repellant' Coal rollers call that soot 'Prius repellent' and channel it through smokestacks that can release it onto bystanders or cars - especially Priuses - in a thick, pollutant-heavy black cloud, the Post said. 'I run into a lot of people that really don’t like Obama at all,' an unnamed Wisconsin seller of smokestack kits told Slate's David Weigel, explaining some of the rationale behind the movement. 'If he’s into the environment, if he’s into this or that, we’re not,' he continued. 'I hear a lot of that. To get a single stack on my truck - that’s my way of giving them the finger. You want clean air and a tiny carbon footprint? Well, screw you.' The American Cancer Society has linked exposure to diesel exhaust to a variety of negative health effects, including lung cancer.","Some truck enthusiasts are modifying their vehicles to boost the amount of fuel entering their engines, creating high-pollutant soot that they can then spew out exhaust pipes and smokestacks in thick black clouds .

"Scientists have announced they are closer than ever to the ‘holy grail’ of biochemistry: artificial photosynthesis. By observing the first stage of the process in action, they say they’ve got a better understanding of how plans turn carbon dioxide into oxygen. And ultimately it may be an important step to a future where artificial plants are created that are more efficient than their organic siblings. Scientists have observed the water splitting process in plants that creates oxygen, known as photosystem II. The cycle, illustrated here, has four steps. The largest change is between steps S1 and S3, so this is the part the scientists 'zoomed in' on to capture their freeze-frame . The groundbreaking research published in Nature was carried out by an international team led by Arizona State University (ASU) scientists. The process through which plants absorb light using chlorophyll to produce chemical energy in the form of oxygen, glucose and more is called photosynthesis. During the process glucose is used by the plants to breathe or is converted into starch, while oxygen is released as a waste product – in turn giving us the air we need to breathe. The rate of photosynthesis is altered by differing carbon dioxide levels and light intensity. If either is increased then the process will also increase, up to a limit. Temperature also plays a part, with a higher temperature increasing the rate. However if the temperature is too high, beyond 40C, the rate slows down. Photosynthesis provides most of the energy necessary for life on Earth to exist. But no way to artificially mimic the process has yet been created, leaving us dependent on plants to survive and thrive. In the study they were able to observe the first snapshots of photosynthesis in action as it split water into protons, electrons and oxygen. This is the process that maintains Earth’s oxygen atmosphere and ensures air is made up of the things we need to breathe it and survive. ‘This study is the first step towards our ultimate goal of unraveling the secrets of water splitting and obtaining molecular movies of biomolecules,’ said Professor Petra Fromme, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at ASU and leader of the research team. Photosynthesis is one of the fundamental processes of life on Earth. The early Earth contained no oxygen and was only converted to the oxygen-rich atmosphere we have today 2.5 billion years ago by the ‘invention’ of the water splitting process that occurs in photosynthesis. This water splitting process is known as photosystem II (PSII), which produces the oxygen we breathe and ultimately keeps us alive. Revealing the mechanism of this process is essential for the development of artificial systems that mimic and surpass the efficiency of natural systems. In the study they were able to observe the first snapshots of photosynthesis in action as it split water into protons, electrons and oxygen. This is the process that maintains Earth¿s oxygen atmosphere and ensures air is made up of the things we need to breathe it and survive . The development of an ‘artificial leaf’ is one of the major goals of the ASU Center for Bio-Inspired Solar Fuel Production, which was the main supporter of this study. Director of the centre Professor Devens Gust explained that they are trying to find a way to turn water into oxygen gas, hydrogen ions and electrons just like plants do. ‘Photosynthetic organisms already know how to do this, and we need to know the details of how photosynthesis carries out the process using abundant manganese and calcium,’ he said. ‘Once the mechanism of photosynthetic water oxidation is understood, chemists can begin to design artificial photosynthetic catalysts that will allow them to produce useful fuels using sunlight.’ The team, led by Professor Fromme, used the world's most powerful X-ray flashlight at the US National Accelerator Laboratory to record still frames of the molecule complex PSII as it splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. ‘This is the very first scene of a molecular movie showing light-driven water splitting in photosystem II, the mechanism which makes all oxygen in the atmosphere,’ said Fromme. Co-author Professor Henry Chapman from the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (Desy) added: ‘A deeper understanding of photosynthesis could, for instance, aid the development of better solar cells and might advance the quest for biochemistry's holy grail, artificial photosynthesis.’ The process through which plants absorb light using chlorophyll to produce chemical energy in the form of oxygen, glucose and more is called photosynthesis. Shown is a Cyanobacteria cell, which was an early form of plant life that converted the Earth's early atmosphere into a breathable one . To observe photosystem II in action, the team grew tiny nano-crystals of the photosystem II complex of bacteria that employ photosynthesis, cyanobacteria called Thermosynechococcus elongatus. These crystals were illuminated with a visible laser to start the water splitting process, which is otherwise driven by sunlight. The researchers used double light flashes to trigger the transition and, with the short and intenses X-ray laser flashes, were able to monitor how the molecular structure changed in the process. This provided just enough time to freeze-frame the water splitting process for 30 quadrillionths of a second. But that was enough to glean the snapshot of the process in action - and now they’ll be hoping to take the research further and see the rest of the photosynthesis process.","Team led by Arizona State University observes photosynthesis in action .

"When mother-of-three Nicola Brightey tells people her children are triplets they can’t believe it. Triplet sister Elizabeth arrived into the world five years behind her brothers - but they were all conceived at the same time. The threesome have made the family complete for Mrs Brightey and her husband Kevin, who have tried for a staggering 15 years to have children. Triple treat: James and Daniel proudly hold their sister, Elizabeth, who was born five years after her brothers . They had to turn to IVF to help them in their mammoth battle - and it has cost nearly £20,000 to have the triplets. She said: ‘It is amazing to think my triplets were born five years apart. People can’t believe it when I tell them that they were all conceived at the same time. ‘James and Daniel couldn’t wait to meet their triplet sister - and now they are ever so protective of her. 'We have waited so long to have our children - but now our family is finally complete after all this time.’ The couple, who live in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, started trying for a family after they got married in August 1998. When nothing had happened after four years, Mrs Brightey went to visit her GP. Tests then showed that her fallopian tubes were blocked through scarring and she would need fertility treatment. Mrs Brightey, 35, a sales executive, said: ‘I had peritonitis at the age of 15 and doctors told me that it had caused extensive scarring on my fallopian tubes. ‘It meant that I couldn’t conceive naturally which was devastating, so I knew that the only way that we would ever be able to have a baby was to have IVF treatment.’ Proud mum: Nicola Brightey with her three children, who were conceived through IVF . After three years of saving, the couple underwent their first course of IVF treatment at CARE Fertility in Nottingham in October 2007. But that failed, leaving them devastated. Mrs Brightey said: ‘The cycle failed completely as I only produced one egg, which was devastating. ‘We had saved for so long and had pinned our hopes on the treatment. So to not even be able to go ahead with the rest of the treatment was heartbreaking.’ The couple began their second course of IVF in January 2008 and this time Mrs Brightey managed to produce 14 eggs. Eight were fertilised and two were put back into her womb. The remaining six were stored in the freezer. Two weeks later, Mrs Brightey made the thrilling discovery that she was pregnant. She said: ‘It was wonderful news. We just had to hope that everything would go smoothly.’ The twins were born safely in November 2008 at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kings Lynn, James weighing 5Ib13 and Daniel weighing 6Ib13. Mrs Brightey said: ‘It was so emotional when they were born and when I was holding them in my arms, it was the most amazing moment. After all those years we were finally parents at last.’ The couple decided to save up for more IVF treatment and try and have another sibling for the twins.Mrs Brightey said: ‘We really wanted to try for another baby and we thought that it would help the twins‘ social skills if they had another sibling to consider.’ So last February the couple went for their third course of IVF treatment. One embryo was taken out of the freezer and defrosted, but it didn’t survive the process. Family bond: Nicola and Kevin Brightey with their children, James, Daniel and Elizabeth . The second embryo defrosted and was successfully put back into Mrs Brightey’s womb. She said: ‘We didn’t have two put back because we already had twins. Amazingly I found out I was pregnant again, which was thrilling.’ Baby Elizabeth was born in November at Peterborough City Hospital weighing 6Ib14. Mrs Brightey said: ‘Elizabeth looked identical to the boys when they were born - they all looked like three peas in a pod. ‘And people can’t believe it when I tell them that they are triplets. 'When they see the boys they ask if they were IVF and when I tell them that Elizabeth is actually their triplet sister, but she has been born five years later, they are amazed. ‘The boys have really taken Elizabeth under their wing. They adore their triplet sister. They have such an incredible strong bond between them, but they have let Elizabeth in there too.’ Dream come true: The Brighteys have battled for 15 years to become parents to three children through IVF . The triplets have cost the couple nearly £20,000, but they say that they are worth every penny. Mrs Brightey said: ‘For years I never thought that we would ever be parents, and it has been such a long battle to have our triplets. 'It has taken 15 years and nearly £20,000 but it has been worth every penny. 'I feel like the luckiest mum in the world.’","Nicola Brightey and her husband Kevin turned to fertility treatment when they were unable to conceive naturally .

"Balitmore Police are investigating claims a gang of black youths chased and beat a Hispanic man with the butt of a handgun while shouting, 'this is for Trayvon'. A dog-walker claimed to have witnessed the alleged attack on a street corner as she returned home and immediately posted an account on a community Facebook page. It is the latest in a series of apparent 'revenge attacks' over the trial of George Zimmerman who was found not guilty of murdering 17-year-old black teenager Trayvon Martin on Saturday in a case that has divided America. Crime scene: Estate agent Christina Dudley said she was walking to her car just before 9pm last night when she saw several young black males and two black females chasing a 37-year-old Hispanic man down the street at the crossroads of E Fairmount Ave and N Streeper St . Estate agent Christina Dudley said she was walking to her car just before 9pm last night when she saw several young black males and two black females chasing a 37-year-old Hispanic man down the street. 'One of the boys had a handgun out and it was pointed at the back of him,' Dudley reportedly told police. She said when they caught up with the victim they set upon him, punching, kicking and stamping on him, yelling expletives. 'They were just yelling and calling him names as they ran after him, . but once they were hitting him and after that they started yelling, 'This is for Trayvon,' said Dudley, who said she heard them shout the slur several times. Relief: George Zimmerman breaks into a smile of relief a few moments after being cleared of all charges in July . She said she shouted that she was calling police and the gang scattered. Police are yet to make any arrests. According to the police report,  the unnamed victim told officers that he was standing in the cross roads of . Fairmont and N. Potomac Street when a group of five black males approached him. He said they were all between 16 and 18 years old and one, about 6 foot tall and with a mohawk, lifted his shirt to reveal a silver handgun in his waistband as he said: 'What's up?' Police reported that three of the attackers were 'skinny' while one was 'fat'. Victim: Trayvon Martin was shot and killed on February 26, 2012, as he was walking back from the 7/11 with a packet of Skittles and a can of juice . 'Everyone in the neighborhood is well aware of the situation, but my concern is that we have a very large Hispanic population and many of them might not have Internet connection or they aren't on that page,' Dudley said. 'So my concern is trying to get the word out to them.' The shooting of Martin, who is . African-American, by Zimmerman, who is not, has fuelled new debates about . racial profiling, gun-control, and self-defence laws. The trial of George Zimmerman has proved one of the most divisive in recent history and has triggered a fierce debate that has shaken the nation and threatens to redefine American cultural identity.

"The evolution of hind legs actually began as enhanced fins, according to a new study. Researchers have discovered well-preserved pelvis and a partial pelvic fin from a 375 million-year-old fossil of a transitional species, Tiktaalik roseae, between fish and the first legged animals. The find challenges existing theory that large, mobile hind appendages were developed only after vertebrates transitioned to land. The evolution of hind legs actually began as enhanced fins, according to a new study.  Researchers came to the conclusion after discovering well-preserved pelvis and a partial pelvic fin  (pictured, centre) from a 375 million-year-old fossil of a transitional species named Tiktaalik roseae (reconstruction pictured left) The fossils are described by scientists in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Corresponding author of the study Doctor Neil Shubin, of the University of Chicago, said: 'Previous theories, based on the best available data, propose that a shift occurred from 'front-wheel drive' locomotion in fish to more of a 'four-wheel drive' in tetrapods. 'But it looks like this shift actually began to happen in fish, not in limbed animals.' Discovered in 2004 by Dr Shubin and co-authors Dr Edward Daeschler, Associate Curator of Vertebrate Zoology at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, and the late Doctor Farish Jenkins, Tiktaalik roseae represents the best-known transitional species between fish and land-dwelling tetrapods. A lobe-finned fish with a broad flat head and sharp teeth, Tiktaalik looked like a cross between a fish and a crocodile, growing up to a length of nine feet as it hunted in shallow freshwater environments. This illustration of Tiktaalik roseae reveals its transitional fin that eventually gave way to hind legs . It had gills, scales and fins, but also had tetrapod-like features such as a mobile neck, robust ribcage and primitive lungs. In particular, its large forefins had shoulders, elbows and partial wrists, which allowed it to support itself on ground. However, only specimen blocks containing the front portion of Tiktaalik have been described up until now. As the researchers investigated additional blocks recovered from their original and subsequent expeditions to the dig site in northern Canada, they discovered the rear portion of Tiktaalik, which contained the pelves as well as partial pelvic fin material. The fossils include the complete pelvis of the original 'type' specimen, making a direct comparison of the front and rear appendages of a single animal possible. The scientists were immediately struck by the pelvis, which was comparable to those of some early tetrapods. The Tiktaalik pelvic girdle was nearly identical in size to its shoulder girdle, a tetrapod-like characteristic. It possessed a prominent ball and socket hip joint, which connected to a highly mobile femur that could extend beneath the body. Crests on the hip for muscle attachment indicated strength and advanced fin function. And although no femur bone was found, pelvic fin material - including long fin rays - indicate that the hind fin was at least as long and as complex as its forefin. Dr Daeschler said: 'This is an amazing pelvis, particularly the hip socket, which is very different from anything that we knew of in the lineage leading up to limbed vertebrates. 'Tiktaalik was a combination of primitive and advanced features. Here, not only were the features distinct, but they suggest an advanced function. They appear to have used the fin in a way that's more suggestive of the way a limb gets used.' According to scientists, Tiktaalik pelves were still clearly fish-like, but the expanded size, mobility and robusticity of the pelvis, hip joint and fin of Tiktaalik made a wider range of movements possible. Dr Shubin added: 'It's reasonable to suppose with those big fin rays that Tiktaalik used its hind fins to swim like a paddle. 'But it's possible it could walk with them as well. African lungfish living today have similarly large pelves, and we showed in 2011 that they walk underwater on the bottom. 'Regardless of the gait Tiktaalik used, it's clear that the emphasis on hind appendages and pelvic-propelled locomotion is a trend that began in fish, and was later exaggerated during the origin of tetrapods.'","Researchers discovered a well-preserved pelvis and a partial pelvic fin from the fossil of a transitional species called Tiktaalik roseae .

"Gonorrhea and syphilis are on the rise in the United States, according to a new report from the centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC reports the 'troubling rise' in syphilis affects men who have sex with men disproportionately, while the increase in gonorrhea cases are predominantly in young men and women between the ages of 15 and 24. It is estimated that nearly 20 million new sexually transmitted infections occur every year in the U.S. and half of those are in people 15 to 24. High risk: The CDC says the rise is due to inadequate testing due to homophobia and the stigma surrounding STDs and limited access to healthcare . The CDC says its annual surveillance only captures a fraction of the 'true burden of STDs in America,' since many cases go undiagnosed and unreported. According to the report, there were 15,667 cases of syphilis reported in 2012, making an 11.1 per cent increase since 2011. However, the increase was solely among men, particularly gay and bisexual men. The data shows that men who have sex with men account for 75 per cent of all primary and secondary syphilis cases. Disproportionate: The CDC says 75 per cent of primary and secondary syphilis cases occur in men who have sex with men . Primary and secondary syphilis are the earliest and most infectious stages of the disease. The disease is easily treated in these stages. In the primary stage, a single round, firm and painless sore will appear at the location where syphilis entered the body. If left untreated, the secondary stage will bring rashes in one or more areas of the body as well as fever, swollen lymph glands, sore throat, hair loss, headaches, aches and fatigue. Late-stage syphilis can result in death. The report says that the disparities in the sexual health of gay and bisexual men can be explained by many social and cultural factors. On the rise: Sexually transmitted diseases gonorrhea and chlamydia are most common among people aged 15 to 24 . While individual risk behaviors, such as unprotected sex, play a role, other factors such as limited access to high-quality healthcare due to homophobia and stigma around STDs. Bacterial diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea make it easier for people to acquire serious viral infections, such as HIV. There were 334,826 cases of gonorrhea reported in 2012, a 4.1 per cent increase since 2011. Young people account for more than half of the annual cases of gonorrhea and chlamydia, the report showed. Women face a particular long-term risk, since it is estimated that undiagnosed STDs cause 24,000 women to become infertile each year. According to the report, STDs cost the U.S. healthcare system $16 billion every year.","The CDC reports that syphilis cases rose 11.1 per cent between 2011 and 2012 .

"The impressive tale of two children in Gulfport, Mississippi, who spent nearly all the 1980s creating a shot-by-shot remake of Steven Spielberg’s Raiders Of The Lost Ark might soon be made into a film. Eric Zala and Chris Strompolos were both just 11 years old when they began their ambitious venture in 1982. After years of filming in backyards and garages with homemade and often dangerous special effects, they completed their adaptation in 1989. A book has already been written about the making of Raiders Of The Lost Ark: The Adaptation and now the producer of another cult phenomenon - Jeremy Coon, the man behind Napoleon Dynamite - has optioned it for a film. Scroll down for video... Endeavor: Eric Zala (right) and Chris Strompolos (left) spent most of the 1980s creating what is now called the greatest fan film ever with a backyard remake of Raiders Of The Lost Ark . Zala and Strompolos, now in their forties, are thrilled with the success of their project that spanned both Reagan administrations, but it hasn’t come quickly. Deadline reports that after the two men premiered their impressive film when they were 18, it went on a shelf and was all but forgotten. Their friends and family remained impressed with the special effects the two were capable of producing with little more than their own ingenuity, but their star turn ended there. That is until filmmaker Eli Roth managed to get his hands on a tape of the fan film and showed it before a live and deeply impressed audience in 2002. WATCH THE FULL MOVIE ON YOUTUBE . Shot-by-shot: Starting at age 11, the boys filmed death defying stunts in their Mississippi backyards and garages. At 18, their movie was done . Brave: Here, the actual scene in Raiders Of The Lost Ark where Indiana Jones clings for dear life to a car. Eric and Chris filmed their version without the aid of stunt doubles or driver's licenses . Short-lived: Despite their impressive ingenuity and knack for creating special effects on a budget of zero, their film debuted and quickly faded away . Shockingly similar: This gory scene was one of many that were so lovingly adapted by Eric and Chris, though their version flipped this particular moment . Raiders! But after filmmaker Eli Roth saw the movie by a stroke of luck and showed it to impressed audience, it became so popular that a book about its creation was written by Alan Eisenstock . With only 1980s level technology and on no budget, Zala and Strompolos managed to create what has now been dubbed the greatest fan film ever made. With the help of its handmade, paper replica of the original film’s trademark killer boulder, their movie became something of a cult phenomenon. ‘I thought the movie was an urban myth but when I saw it, from a filmmaker perspective it was more inspiring than any movie I’d ever seen,’ Coon told Deadline. Coon’s favorite part of the story is when one of the kids - seven were involved at one time or another - learned about special effects and did a mold of Zala’s face. But instead of special effects plaster, they used construction plaster which heats up and becomes very hard as it cures. Unable to speak or hear, Zala was rushed to the emergency room where doctors finally removed the plaster with a cast saw. Coon has purchased the rights to the aptly named book about the saga, Raiders! The Story Of The Greatest Fan Film Ever Made, and plans to turn it into a film. For that to happen, he says he’ll likely have to get permission from two very famous men behind the original Indiana Jones film: Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Video source Raidersbook . Iconic: In one of the most famous scenes, Chris re-enacts Indiana Jones replacing a priceless relic before a booby trap springs . Not bad! Few scene typify Harrison Ford's turn as Indiana Jones like this one. And true to form, the boys from Mississippi gave mimicking it shot-by-shot their best shot . It could happen: Even Steven Spielberg himself is a professed fan, though movie rights and the blessing of George Lucas still stand in the way of Raiders! the movie . Not surprisingly, both Eric (right) and Chris went on to indulge their love of film making with careers in entertainment . Spielberg appears to support the project - he’s already confessed he’s a fan of the ode to his movie. Lucas’s take on it remains unknown. But enthusiasm for the film is high. And regardless of whether or not it ever gets made, just the possibility will be enough to shine more light on Zala and Strompolos’s backyard masterpiece.","Eric Zala and Chris Strompolos were just 11 years old when the began making Raiders Of The Lost Ark: The Adaptation .

"A compensation package worth £33,000 could be handed to 120 victims of disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile, it has been reported. The exact amount is expected to be finalised when high court judge Dame Janet Smith publishes the results of her inquiry, which is looking into the culture and practices at the BBC during the years of Savile’s abuse, later in the year. It is believed the amount will be less than the £4.1million the corporation paid to its senior managers, swollen by controversial ‘golden goodbyes’ for bosses forced out over the handling of the Savile affair. Pay-out: Compensation of £4million or about £33,000, could be paid out to 120 victims of disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile, it has been reported . According to The Mirror the amount of compensation paid out to Savile's victims will equate to just under £4million. Alan Collins, a solicitor at Pannone, representing a number of the presenter's victims, said it appeared 'unjust' for the victims to receive less than the BBC's senior managers. He told MailOnline: 'In light of what some of the executives have got it seems wrong - it seems unjust.' A BBC spokesman said: 'The on-going Dame Janet Smith Review is independent of the BBC. 'It is inappropriate for us to comment on any potential allegations relating to Operation Yewtree or the Dame Janet Smith Review. It is believed the amount of compensation paid out to Savile's victims will equate to £33,000 each . 'Separately, the BBC will continue to assist the police with any enquiries relating to Operation Yewtree.' Earlier this month a man of 80 was arrested by police investigating decades-old sex crimes. Report: Dame Janet Smith is expected to publish the findings of her inquiry later in the year . The pensioner, who was held at an address in South London, was the 14th man arrested as part of Operation Yewtree. The controversial investigation was . sparked by the torrent of victims who came forward as Savile was exposed . as the most notorious paedophile in British history. Police said the suspect, who was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences, is linked to the disgraced TV presenter and radio DJ. The man, who was not identified, was later released on bail until an unknown date in October. Last week former Radio 1 and Top Of The Pops presenter Dave Lee Travis vowed to clear his name after he was charged with 12 sexual offences, some dating back to the 1970s. The 68-year-old, one of Britain’s best known DJs, said he was ‘very much looking forward’ to proving his innocence after being charged as part of Operation Yewtree. Earlier that week, former Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning, who was originally arrested in June, had his bail renewed until October. The week before veteran entertainer Rolf Harris, 83, was arrested for a second time. Comedian Jim Davidson, 59, and his friend and DJ Mike Osman, 53, have been told they will not face charges following their arrests earlier this year. Gary Glitter, 69, and Freddie Starr, 70, are both on bail. Two people have been charged. PR supremo Max Clifford 70, is accused of indecently assaulting seven women and girls, and former BBC driver David Smith, 67, is accused of sexually abusing a young boy.

"[caption] . The discovery of a complete 1.8 million-years-old skull has rewritten the story of how modern man evolved from our early ancestors in Africa, according to Swiss scientists. A skull found in Georgia from an ancient human ancestor, known as Skull 5, implies that all Homo species were once one. Research suggests that the earliest members of the Homo genus, including Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus belonged to the same species and simply looked different to each other, shaking up the classification system for early human ancestors. The 1.8 million-year-old skull: The discovery of Skull 5 (pictured) has rewritten the story of how modern man evolved from our early ancestors in Africa, according to Swiss scientists. The skull, which was found in Georgia, implies that all Homo species were once one . The skull that was unearthed in Dmanisi, Georgia and was unlike other Homo fossils and combines a small braincase with a long face and large teeth. Pictured is a skull discovered in 2005 that is 1.5m years old . Unique: The skull were discovered alongside the remains of four other early human ancestors and a number of animal fossils . It is popularly thought that different characteristics among the Homo fossils showed they were distinct, different species but this research casts this theory into doubt. Scientists from the Anthropological Institute and Museum in Zurich say Skull 5 indicates that rather than several ecologically specialised Homo species, a single Homo species that was able to cope with a variety of ecosystems, emerged from Africa some two million years ago. They studied the skull that was unearthed in Dmanisi, Georgia and found that unlike other Homo fossils, Skull 5 combines a small braincase with a long face and large teeth. It was discovered alongside the remains of four other early human ancestors, a variety of animal fossils and some stone tools, all of which are associated with the same location and time period which makes the find truly unique. The site, which has only been partially excavated, is providing scientists with the first opportunity to compare and contrast the physical traits of multiple human ancestors that apparently coexisted at the same time in the same geological space. The braincase of Skull 5 is only about 33.3 cubic inches (546 cubic centimeters), and suggests early humans had smaller brains despite modern human-like limb proportions and body size . The Dmanisi excavation site, situated below a medieval Georgian village, where the skull was found. It has only been partially excavated so far but has given scientists the first chance to compare how different human ancestors lived together . The differences between these Dmanisi fossils are no more pronounced than those between five modern humans or five chimpanzees, the scientists claimed. The discovery suggests that early, diverse Homo fossils with their origins in Africa, actually represent variation among members of a single, evolving lineage - most appropriately Homo erectus. Christoph Zollikofer from the Swiss museum said: 'Had the braincase and the face of Skull 5 been found as separate fossils at different sites in Africa, they might have been attributed to different species. 'That's because Skull 5 unites some key features, like the tiny braincase and large face, which had not been observed together in an early Homo fossil until now.' David Lordkipanidze of the Georgian Academy of Sciences holds a 1.75-million-year-old skull, excavated in Dmanisi in 2001. The bones of an early human with a small head suggest larger brains associated with modern humans did not necessarily evolve before our ancestors began migrating . Given their diverse physical traits, the fossils associated with Skull 5 at Dmanisi can be compared to various Homo fossils, including those found in Africa, dating back to about 2.4 million years ago, as well as others unearthed in Asia and Europe, which are dated between 1.8 and 1.2 million years ago. He added: 'The Dmanisi finds look quite different from one another, so it's tempting to publish them as different species. 'Yet we know that these individuals came from the same location and the same geological time, so they could, in principle, represent a single population of a single species.' The hominid fossils from Dmanisi represent ancient human ancestors from the early Pleistocene epoch, soon after early Homo diverged from Australopithecus and dispersed from Africa, according to the study, published in the journal Science. The jaw associated with Skull 5 was found five years before the cranium was discovered but when the two pieces were put together, they formed the most complete large skull ever found at the Dmanisi site. For this reason, the researchers suggest that the individual to whom Skull 5 belonged was male. The braincase of Skull 5 is only about 33.3 cubic inches or 546 cubic centimetres, however, which suggests that this early Homo had a small brain despite his modern human-like limb proportions and body size. Professor Zollikofer added said: 'Thanks to the relatively large Dmanisi sample, we see a lot of variation. 'But the amount of variation does not exceed that found in modern populations of our own species, nor in chimps and bonobos,' he added. 'Furthermore, since we see a similar pattern and range of variation in the African fossil record...it is sensible to assume that there was a single Homo species at that time in Africa. 'And since the Dmanisi hominids are so similar to the African ones, we further assume that they both represent the same species.' 55 million years ago - First primitive primates evolve . 15 million years ago - Hominidae (great apes) speciate from the ancestors of the gibbon . 8 million years ago - First gorillas evolve. Later, chimp and human lineages diverge . 5.5 million years ago - Ardipithecus, early ‘proto-human’ shares traits with chimps and gorillas . 4 million years ago - Australopithecines appear.

"A Florida jury has slammed the nation's No. 2 cigarette maker, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., with $23.6 billion in punitive damages in a lawsuit filed by the widow of a longtime smoker who died of lung cancer in 1996. The case is one of thousands filed in . Florida after the state Supreme Court in 2006 tossed out a $145 billion . class action verdict. That ruling also said smokers and their families need only prove addiction and that smoking caused their illnesses or deaths. Last year, Florida's highest court re-approved that decision, which made it easier for sick smokers or their survivors to pursue lawsuits against tobacco companies without having to prove to the court again that Big Tobacco knowingly sold dangerous products and hid the hazards of cigarette smoking. Scroll down for video . Damages: A Florida jury awarded the widow of a chain-smoker a $23.6 billion judgment for punitive damages . The damages a Pensacola jury awarded Friday to Cynthia Robinson after a four-week trial come in addition to $16.8 million in compensatory damages. Robinson individually sued Reynolds in 2008 on behalf of her late husband, Michael Johnson Sr. Her attorneys said the punitive damages are the largest of any individual case stemming from the original class action lawsuit. 'The jury wanted to send a statement that tobacco cannot continue to lie to the American people and the American government about the addictiveness of and the deadly chemicals in their cigarettes,' said one of the woman's attorneys, Christopher Chestnut. Reynolds' vice president and assistant general counsel, J. Jeffery Raborn, called the damages in Robinson's case 'grossly excessive and impermissible under state and constitutional law.' 'This verdict goes far beyond the realm of reasonableness and fairness, and is completely inconsistent with the evidence presented,' Raborn said in a statement. 'We plan to file post-trial motions with the trial court promptly, and are confident that the court will follow the law and not allow this runaway verdict to stand.' The lawsuit's goal was to stop tobacco companies from targeting children and young people with their advertising, said Willie Gary, another attorney representing Robinson. Addiction: A 2006 ruling determined that smokers and their families need only prove addiction and that smoking caused their illnesses or deaths . 'If we don't get a dime, that's OK, if we can make a difference and save some lives,' Gary said. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court turned away cigarette manufacturers' appeals of more than $70 million in court judgments to Florida smokers. Reynolds, Philip Morris USA Inc. and Lorillard Tobacco Co. had wanted the court to review cases in which smokers won large damage awards without having to prove that the companies sold a defective and dangerous product or hid the risks of smoking. The Supreme Court refused to hear another of the companies' appeals last year, wanting the court to consider overturning a $2.5 million Tampa jury verdict in the death of a smoker. Other Florida juries have hit tobacco companies with tens of millions of dollars in punitive damages in lawsuits stemming from the original class action lawsuit. In August, a Fort Lauderdale jury awarded $37.5 million, including $22.5 million in punitive damages against Reynolds, to the family of a smoker who died at age 38 of lung cancer in 1995. Attorneys for Reynolds said they would appeal, arguing that the woman knew the dangers of smoking because cigarettes had warning labels when she started. The attorney for the woman's family said teenagers like her were targeted by tobacco companies. Some large jury verdicts awarding tens of millions of dollars in damages to relatives of smokers have been upheld by appeals courts. Reynolds' vice president and assistant general counsel, J. Jeffery Raborn, called the damages in Robinson's case ""grossly excessive and impermissible under state and constitutional law"" In September, the 3rd District Court of Appeals affirmed $25 million in punitive damages and $10 million in compensatory damages against Lorillard, the country's No. 3 cigarette maker, for Dorothy Alexander, whose husband died in 1996 of lung cancer. Lorillard, based in Greensboro, North Carolina, unsuccessfully argued the damages were excessive and raised a number of other claims. The 1st District Court of Appeals upheld in June 2013 a $20 million punitive damage award to another smoker's widow, more than a year after reversing a $40.8 million award in the same case against Reynolds. After the appeals court rejected the first award as excessive the award amount was recalculated. The tobacco company still objected. Philip Morris is the country's biggest tobacco company and owned by Richmond, Virginia-based Altria Group Inc. Reynolds is owned by Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based Reynolds American Inc.","The case is one of thousands filed in .

"School officials violated state anti-discrimination law when they would not allow a transgender fifth-grader to use the girls' bathroom, Maine's highest court has ruled. The family of student Nicole Maines and the Maine Human Rights Commission sued in 2009 after school officials required her to use a staff, not student, restroom. ‘This is a momentous decision that marks a huge breakthrough for transgender young people,’ said Jennifer Levi, director of the Boston-based Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders' Transgender Rights Project after the Maine Supreme Judicial Court's ruling on Thursday. Victory: Nicole Maines (right) sitting in a hearing with her brother, Jonas (left), has been told that her Maine school discriminated against her . The court concluded that the Orono school district's actions violated the Maine Human Rights Act, which bans discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, overturning a lower court's ruling that the district acted within its discretion. The ruling represented the first time a state high court concluded that a transgender person should use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify, according to GLAD. Federal courts haven't taken up the issue. Students at the southern Maine high school Nicole now attends stood up and cheered when news of the ruling was announced, said her father, Wayne Maines. Nicole, pictured with her brother Jonas, is a biological male who identified as a girl beginning at age two . School administrators across the country are grappling with the issue. Colorado officials said last year that a suburban Colorado Springs school district discriminated against a 6-year-old transgender girl by preventing her from using the girls' bathroom. In California, there is an effort afoot to try to repeal a law that allows public school students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their expressed genders. In the Maine case, Nicole Maines was using the girls' bathroom in her elementary school until the grandfather of a fifth-grade boy complained to administrators. The Orono school district determined that she should use a staff bathroom, but her parents said that amounted to discrimination. Nicole is a biological male who identified as a girl beginning at age two. Ms Maines, center, with her father Wayne Maines, left, and brother Jonas, speaks to reporters outside the Penobscot Judicial Center in Bangor, Maine . Nicole, who is now 16, said after arguments before the high court last summer that she hoped the justices understood the importance of going to school, getting an education and making friends without having to be ‘bullied’ by other students - or school administrators. Nicole's father said all he had ever wanted was for his daughter to be treated just like her classmates. He said he was overcome with emotion when he learned of the decision. ‘It sends a message to my kids that you can believe in the system and that it can work,’ Wayne Maines said. ‘I'm just going to hug my kids and enjoy the moment, and do some healing.’ Melissa Hewey, lawyer for the school district, said the ruling provided clarity not just to Orono, but to schools around the state. ‘The court has now clarified what has been a difficult issue and is a more and more common in schools, and the Orono School Department is going to do what it needs to do to comply with the law,’ she said. In the 5-1 ruling, the court had to reconcile two separate state laws, one requiring separate bathrooms based on gender and the other prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation. In this case, where there the child had a formal diagnosis of gender dysphoria, ‘it has been clearly established that a student's psychological well-being and educational success depend upon being permitted to use the communal bathroom consistent with her gender identity,’ Justice Warren Silver wrote. The Supreme Judicial Court pointed out that its ruling was based on the circumstances of the case in which there was ample documentation of the student's gender identity. ‘Our opinion must not be read to require schools to permit students casual access to any bathroom of their choice,’ he wrote.","The family of student Nicole Maines sued her Maine school in 2009 .

"Work has recommenced on what is set to become America's largest family home. The sprawling 90,000-square-foot property in Windermere, Florida, owned by  former beauty queen Jackie Siegel, 47, and her self-made billionaire husband, David, 78, was imagined six years ago. But building work stopped on the property during the recession in 2009 after the couple ran out of funds. The Siegels, who were the subject of 2012 fly-on-the-wall documentary Queen of Versailles, now hope to finally move into the vast mansion with their eight children after scraping together the $30million needed to complete it. Back in the money: Former beauty queen Jackie Siegel, 47, and her self-made billionaire husband, David, 78, have restarted work on their   sprawling 90,000-square-foot property in Windermere, Florida . Mrs Siegel, who won the Miss Florida . title in the 1990s,  told The New York Post that as a result of the delay they have had to make several minor adjustments to the floor plan - especially now that their children are older. For example, instead of sandboxes and playrooms, they plan on creating 'man caves' and yoga studios. The Siegels modeled their extravagant 30-bedroom home after France's 17th century Palace of Versailles and started laying foundations on a ten-acre plot of land in 2007. Their lavish pad is nine times larger than other houses in the area and has a $20million mortgage, which is 100 times the size of the average mortgage in Central Florida, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Long-term project: The Siegels started building their mansion on a ten acre plot more than a decade ago . Artist's impression: When it is complete, the hall will feature two staircases and a massive central chandelier, hanging beneath a 30ft stained-glass dome . Unfinished: The 120ft-long Grand Hall will be the centrepiece of the mansion . However in 2009 they were forced to put their project on hold as their finances suffered a blow during the recession. Instead of pouring his profits into buying construction materials Mr Siegel concentrated his efforts on protecting his 30-year-old time-share and real estate company Westgate Resorts. 'We're finishing it to actually finish it. But we do want to live in there' Last July he even decided to put the property, which was only two-thirds complete, on the market for $65million so he could reinvest the money in his business. But after it failed to sell the Siegels decided to keep hold of the building and surrounding land. This year work restarted and Mrs Siegel told Today in February: 'We're finishing it to actually finish it. But we do want to live in there.' And she revealed to The New York Post that the family are once again enjoying their extravagant lifestyle. Luxury feel: It was previously estimated that it would take two years to add the finishing touches to the property .

It was previously estimated that it will take two years to finish the Siegels' home. 'I never see a bill. My husband gives me credit cards and I think they’re like magic, they just keep working' As well as 30 bedrooms, the concrete home fronted with white marble from Italy, will have 23 bathrooms boasting spectacular views over Lake Butler, about 20 miles outside Orlando. All . 23 full bathrooms will have full-sized hot tubs, and 160 triple-pane . windows and Brazilian mahogany French-style doors promise plenty of . light. The hand-built windows for the house cost more than $2million and bespoke materials have been sourced from all over the world. Hands full: Mrs Siegel is a mother to eight children and has an army of nannies to help her . On the entertainment front a roller rink,  children's theater, bowling alley, three swimming pools, a baseball field and two tennis courts will be installed. And . outside a large boat house, formal gardens, a one-story gatehouse and . an underground garage with enough space for 20 cars will complete the . palatial look. There is also a His and Her office space with a 12ft two-sided aquarium. The Siegels currently live in a 26,000-square-foot home in the exclusive Isleworth gated community, best known as the scene of Tiger Woods' 2009 car crash just before his divorce. The entire family and their entourage of staff featured in Queen of Versailles, a film by Lauren Greenfield which grossed more than $2million and won numerous awards including the U.S. Directing Award at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. Upstairs: The upper level has the lion's share of the bedrooms, as well as the children's theater . Floorplan: The main level has offices, a media room, the Grand Hall, pool deck and outdoor summer kitchen . Downstairs: The lower level has a 20-car garage, skating rink, bowling alley, games arcade and indoor pool . Mrs Seigel previously said that she enjoyed her time in the spotlight and would like to launch a career in reality TV. However she admitted to the New York Post: 'I don’t have time to watch a lot of TV but I probably need to start educating myself on the ""Housewives"" and what’s out there.' While their yet-to-be-completed home is large, the original Versailles, outside Paris . and completed by the Sun King, Louis XIV, in 1710, is much, much larger. The 219,000-square-foot landmark boasts 2,300 rooms and 67 staircases. Building it also caused financial problems, nearly bankrupting France.

"A rugby player was left waiting for three hours for an ambulance after he broke his leg - despite the hospital being just five minutes away. Ambulance chiefs have launched an inquiry after Luigi Segadelli, 30, was left lying face down on a freezing rugby pitch with his ankle bent almost 90 degrees during a game for Morriston RFC in Swansea, South Wales. The flanker broke his tibia and fibia in a horrific tackle. When paramedics arrived at the pitch they told him he could lose his foot which had turned blue in the freezing cold. Luigi Segadelli, 30, was left with his ankle bent almost 90 degrees after a horror tackle during a game for Morriston RFC in Swansea, South Wales . His shocked teammates called an ambulance - but had to cover him with blankets to protect him from the cold as he lay face down waiting for medics. Mr Segadelli said: 'The rugby club is only five minutes away from the hospital so none of us thought we'd be waiting for half an hour, let alone three. 'I was cold and shaking. When the paramedics saw how long it was taking to get colour back into my foot they said it was a big concern because I had been in the cold so long there was a risk of losing my foot. 'That was when I started panicking. 'I wouldn't want this to happen to anyone else. The 30-year-old broke both his tibia and fibia. When paramedics arrived he was told that he could lose his foot due to the severity of the injury . 'I want an apology for the delay - they must have the decency to make sure it does not happen to anyone else again. 'I'm a proud rugby player so I was up for moving to the hospital but there was no way I could move my ankle, it would have made things worse. Still, the fact that it was considered as an option shows how frustrating the wait was.' He was given morphine at the scene and has had an operation to put pins in his leg . The game was called off following his injury shortly after the 2.30 kick-off on Saturday afternoon. When his teammates called 999, operators told them Mr Segadelli wasn't to be moved. Mr Segadelli had to wait until almost 6pm for an ambulance - and the pitch floodlights had to be put on as it became dark. He was given morphine at the scene and has had an operation to put pins in his leg. Mr Segadelli said once he was eventually reached, the ambulance and hospital staff were 'brilliant' but he said he wanted an apology and an assurance no one else would have to wait so long for treatment. A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesman said in a statement: 'Demand on our ambulance service over the Christmas and New Year period was unprecedented and it meant we were unable to respond to some some calls in the time we would have liked. 'Unfortunately the call to help Mr Segadelli was one of those calls. 'The trust has had contact from Mr Segadelli and will now be looking into the matter to ensure we have a full understanding of what happened. 'In the meantime, we would like to wish him a speedy recovery.' Mr Segadelli had been playing for around 20 minutes during Saturday's match when he suffered the injury saying his ankle 'turned right round'. He said initially 'the adrenaline kicked in' and he did not feel too much pain but he soon began feeling severe pain and the 999 operator gave advice that he should not be moved.","Luigi Segadelli, 30, left with his ankle bent almost 90 degrees after tackle .

"The owner of a California arms store says a federal agency has raided his property in search of the names of customers who purchased gun parts, despite a temporary restraining order preventing it from doing so. Dimitrios Karras, owner of Ares Armor in Oceanside, says that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agents have threatened to shut down his business unless he hands over a list of 5,000 customers who bought AR-15 lower receivers, the sale of which the ATF says is illegal. The receiver is the part of a firearm that houses the operating parts. Ares Armor sold thousands of plastic 80 per cent receivers with colors marking where to drill, making it easier and cheaper to build an AR-15 assault rifle. Scroll down for video . Parts seller: Dimitrios Karras's store Ares Armor has been selling illegal AR-15 lower receivers, according to the ATF . Raid: Karras says federal agents have searched his store already, despite a restraining order . According to Fox News, it is legal to build rifles from scratch without serial numbers, but only if the receiver is made to ATF specifications, which the ones Karras sold were not. Karras says he arranged for ATF agents to pick up the illegal receivers Wednesday morning, but baulked at turning over the names of his customers. 'They said either give us these 5,000 names or we are coming in and taking pretty much anything – which is a huge, huge, huge privacy concern and something we are not willing to do,' he told Fox 40. Fearful of a government raid on his store, Karras took out a temporary restraining order, preventing ATF agents entering the property. 'They were going to search all of our facilities and confiscate our computer and pretty much shut our business down,' Karras said. 'The government invades our privacy on a daily basis and everyone thinks its ok.' 'This is one of those situations where hopefully the governmental institutions will come in say this is protected and no you’re not taking it from them.' Gun base: The lower receiver is essentially the frame of the gun and holds all the working parts of the firearm . Deadly weapon: The receivers sold by Ares Armor are used to make the AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle . DIY: Karras holds one of the questionable receivers, which make it easier and cheaper to build your own gun . If the two parties do not reach an agreement, a preliminary hearing has been set for March 20. Federal attorneys say the ATF 'is conducting a lawful criminal investigation of the illegal manufacture, distribution, sale, and possession of AR-15 variant lower receivers' and allege Ares Armor 'is in possession of approximately 6,000 ... unserialized AR-15 lower receivers. 'Further, Ares Armor is not a federal firearms licensee, so it cannot legally engage in the business of dealing firearms, let alone ones that do not bear the required manufacturer’s mark and serial number.' According to a post on the Ares Armor Facebook page, the ATF last night did search Ares Armor's buildings despite the restraining order. 'The ATF did execute a search warrant against all of our buildings today. None of our employees have been detained or arrested... We wholeheartedly believe that they are WRONG in their actions and we will be relentlessly pursuing remedy through the courts.'","Dimitrios Karras, owner of arms store Ares Armor, says the ATF has raided his store .

"Andy Murray has taken to the courts of Abu Dhabi and Perth in the past few days in a stylish new range of sportswear from his latest kit sponsor Under Armour. The former Wimbledon champion has signed a four-year contract - estimated to be worth £15m - with the lesser known American brand after his deal with adidas came to an end. And it looks like the new clothing could breathe new life into the British number one's game as he emerged as the victor of the Mubadala World Tennis Championship. Winning look: Andy Murray wore his new kit from Under Armour for the first time as he claimed victory in the Mubadala World Tennis Championship . Going global: The former Wimbledon champ is the first major British sports star to sign a contract with the brand who have risen in success in the U.S from humble origins . New fashion era: Murray receives his trophy wearing a trendy grey top from his latest kit sponsors after his contract with adidas came to an end . His winning streak continued today as he beat Frenchman Benoit Paire in the Hopman Cup mixed-team event in Perth, Australia. The victories comes after Murray, 27, had a lacklustre sporting year in 2014 as he failed to build on his grand slam success as Wimbledon champion in 2013 thanks to coming back from shoulder surgery. Murray won his latest title after world number one Novak Djokovic withdrew through illness ahead of the final. Put to the test: The Under Armour T-shirt is said to regulate body temperature and wick away sweat from the body... something Murray needed today as he played in 44 degree heat in Australia . While Murray did not have to play to win the exhibition match, he proved his form has improved by beating Rafael Nadal to reach the final, which should give him a confidence boost ahead of this month's Australian Open. Murray showed off garments from his new kit sponsor when he collected his trophy on court on Saturday. He wore a flattering, grey zip-up long-sleeved top by the brand, which was founded in 1996 by former University of Maryland football player Kevin Plank. Signing autographs: The tennis star was mobbed by fans as he landed in Perth, Australia, for his next tournament . Back to the day job: Following her appearance on Strictly, Judy Murray is back on the tennis circuit with her son and was pictured arriving in Perth . The Scot was later pictured wearing the same top as he landed in Perth, Australia, for the Hopman Cup in which he will team up with fellow Brit Heather Watson to play in the mixed team tournament. Murray was accompanied by his mother, Judy, who is back on the tennis circuit following her appearance on Strictly Come Dancing. The 55-year-old has become accustomed to glamorous ballgowns and glitzy dresses during her time on the BBC show but was back in comfortable jeans and a floral top as she arrived in Australia. While playing, Murray will wear Under Armour's technical T-shirt that has been developed to provide compression to athletes' muscles and wick perspiration off the skin. The brand, who do clothing for men and women, say the T-shirt 'works with your body to regulate temperature and enhance performance.' Murrays down under: Judy has swapped her ballgowns and sequin dresses for jeans and a floral cardigan while Andy showed off his new sports kit as he signed a Scottish themed toy in Australia . The tennis star played in black and white versions of the lightweight shirt in Abu Dhabi. And he certainly put the fabric technology to the test today as he played in temperatures reaching 44 degrees in Perth. His white T-shirt was saturated with sweat by the end of the match and the Scot joked afterwards that the conditions were not what he was used to growing up in Dunblane, Scotland. He said: 'It was a bit of an eye-opener when we arrived at the practice court this morning and it was 44 degrees outside. I'm from a small town in Scotland and the weather is not quite like that there.' When he signed his contract with Under Armour, Murray said: 'I am very honoured and excited to be joining Team Under Armour and to help them tell their story globally. 'They are committed to providing innovative apparel, accessories, and footwear, with an unmatched focus on training and performance.' Murray is the most famous British sports star to be sponsored by the U.S. brand who also have American football players, skiers and snowboarders on their books. They have already made inroads into promoting themselves in the UK by sponsoring football team Tottenham Hotspur. Accessorising: Murray's new kit has been colour coordinated with his trainers - which are still adidas as Under Armour are currently working on their own footwear for the star . On the up: Under Armour began with just a T-shirt - created to regulate an athletes' body temperature - before becoming a major sports brand . The brand's story is a classic 'rags to riches' tale. Plank went from selling T-shirts from his grandmother's house to becoming the U.S's second bestselling sportsbrand behind Nike a decade later. He started the business with just $15,000 (£9,800) savings plus as much money as he could loan from credit cards. Of those early days, Kevin told The Washington Post: 'It was a challenge, and I had to learn to really focus on my business. But acting like a professional company and running it out of a residential neighborhood is not the easiest thing to do.' His big break came when Under Armour became the official supplier to the American football NFL Europe League. New brand ambassador: Murray has played in black and white kit from Under Armour, who were founded by Kevin Plank. The football player turned enterpreneur has become a billionaire thanks to the brand's success . Expansion: The sports brand state that they started out with the 'simple plan to make a superior T-shirt' and are now sponsoring global stars like Murray, whose contract is estimated at £15m . Now the football player turned entrepreneur is a self-made billionaire thanks to the rise and rise of his brand. Speaking of his success, Plank said: 'Success doesn't happen quickly. It happens from doing the same thing over and over, becoming great at it, and delivering great value to consumers. It takes time, and that’s why I'm such an advocate for, if you have an idea, get it out there, find out if it can sell, and if does, move to version two, move to version three, and find a way.' While well-known in their home country, signing global stars like Murray will propel them to even greater heights. The tennis player will be a brand ambassador and feature in major marketing campaigns. On signing Murray, Ryan Kuehl, Under Armour said: 'Signing Andy is really a special moment for the brand, as we continue to elevate and diversify our athlete roster and expand our international presence. Andy's remarkable character, competitive spirit and unmatched ability make him the perfect fit for our family.' The sports brand state that they started out with the 'simple plan to make a superior T-shirt' but have since branched into making other sporting clothing and accessories. Tying the knot: Murray popped the question to long term girlfriend Kim Sears last year and the pair are likely to wed this October . However, they have yet to develop tennis shoes for Murray so he will continue to wear adidas trainers until they have developed footwear specifically for him - a process which is estimated to take at least six months. The brand showed a flair for fashion by matching the colour of his shorts to his adidas shoes. Murray will be hoping to improve his form in 2015 after he dropped to a year-end ranking of number six in the world. However, while 2014 may not have been a vintage year for him in terms of sporting achievement, it was a special one for him in his personal life as he popped the question to long-term girlfriend, Kim Sears, 26. Judy has revealed that the wedding is likely to take place in October this year.","Murray has signed new kit contract with Under Armour .

"Newcastle will make an external appointment in their search for a new head coach with Steve McClaren and Remi Garde the leading candidates to replace Alan Pardew. Sportsmail understands that reports of shortlists as big as eight men being drawn up are exaggerated and managing director Lee Charnley and chief scout Graham Carr have instead narrowed their targets. Derby County’s McClaren is the only domestic-based boss being considered and, despite denials from Rams chief executive Sam Rush, he could yet end up at St James’ Park, albeit with a compensation package agreed. Steve McClaren is on Newcastle's shortlist to replace Alan Pardew as the new head coach . Former Lyon head coach Remi Garde is also being considered by Newcastle . United, though, would not have to pay a penny in severance for former Lyon chief Garde. The ex-Arsenal defender left Lyon at the end of last season after three years in charge and, like McClaren, fits the bill of ‘head coach’ the Magpies want to take care of first-team affairs. Caretaker boss John Carver, meanwhile, has not been told if he will be in charge for Saturday’s trip to league leaders Chelsea. He will take training on Tuesday but as of Monday night night there was no word from the club’s hierarchy as to whether he will still be at the helm come the weekend. Alan Pardew left Newcastle to take over at Crystal Palace where he spent time as a player . Caretaker manager John Carver does not know if he will be in charge for this weekend's game with Chelsea . Carver – who has applied for the position – looks set to start Tim Krul at Stamford Bridge - should he be picking the team - after the goalkeeper returned to training on Monday. The Dutch No.1 has been absent since injuring his ankle in November and was expected to be sidelined until the end of January. Newcastle have conceded 21 times in his absence and rookie replacement Jak Alnwick could well have played his last game for the club with his contract up in the summer. Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul is in line to face Chelsea after returning to training after an ankle injury . Carver said he has sympathy with stand-in keeper Jak Alnwick after a difficult time in goal . Carver, though, praised the 21-year-old. ‘He's had a bit of a tough time with the goals that we've conceded and I've felt a little bit sorry for Jak, but he's been a strong lad,’ he said. ‘He's stood up to it. It's not easy when you're a young lad and you've got to be able to deal with the pressure, because it takes a special type of player to play at this football club and if you can't handle the pressure of the 52,000 every other week then you'll not survive here.’","Alan Pardew left Newcastle to become Crystal Palace's new manager .

Newcastle are seeking to appoint a head coach rather than a manager ."
"Newcastle United’s search for a new head coach is narrowing. Sportsmail revealed on Monday that reports of eight-man shortlists were exaggerated and that a handful of potential successors to Alan Pardew were instead being considered. Steve McClaren is the prime domestic-based candidate but the club are also looking to France with former Lyon boss Remi Garde the leading contender. Here, we take a closer look at the two frontrunners for the St James’ Park hotseat… . Steve McClaren, on the touchline with Derby County, has guided the Rams to third in the Championship . STEVE McCLAREN . CURRENT POSITION: Derby County (manager) PREVIOUS JOBS: Middlesbrough, England, FC Twente (twice), Wolfsburg, Nottingham Forest . HONOURS: League Cup (Middlesbrough), Eredivisie title (Twente) REASONS FOR: McClaren has always had a reputation as a fine and respected coach, and that is what Newcastle want. He is level-headed and will not speak out against the regime, knowing how to handle the media. McClaren is admired within St James’ for the manner in which he has rebuilt his reputation after his failure with England and his knowledge of the Dutch and German leagues – he won the title in the former - is invaluable given United’s continental scouting model. McClaren has previously managed Middlesbrough, England, FC Twente, Wolfsburg and Nottingham Forest . REASONS AGAINST: It would take a compensation payment to release him from Derby after he signed a new three-year deal in the summer. His somewhat dour demeanour would perhaps not appeal to some fans and his reputation within these shores remains a little tainted by his experience with England. Newcastle would also have to convince McClaren to quit promotion-chasing Derby. FAN VIEW: His name has been fairly well received. One criticism of Pardew from the terraces was that the team lacked identity and, quite often, a game-plan. They see McClaren as more methodical with a greater emphasis on tactics. Remi Garde quit as manager of Ligue 1 side Lyon at the end of last season and is currently without a club . REMI GARDE . CURRENT POSITION: Unemployed . PREVIOUS JOBS: Lyon . HONOURS: French Cup (Lyon) REASONS FOR: There would be no severance payment for starters given his decision to quit Lyon at the end of last season. His knowledge of Ligue 1 – Newcastle’s preferred hunting ground for new talent – is a big plus and he has the experience of 10 years at a top club in the roles of coach, assistant and manager. There is also no pre-existing relationships with the press, something Newcastle are keen to control, and he is familiar with the Premier League following three years as a player with Arsenal. Former Lyon head coach Garde, who previously played for Arsenal, is in line for the Newcastle job . REASONS AGAINST: Garde cited family reasons and a lack of energy as the motivation behind his decision to stand down as Lyon boss. Has he had time to recharge his batteries? There is also the unknown element in Garde having never managed or coached outside of France. FAN VIEW: It appears that Garde is well respected in his homeland and the Toon Army have spoken positively about the link. He also fits the the bill of continental head coach and this new model is something the Toon Army appear to have accepted. Garde (left), with Patrick Vieira and Nicolas Anelka, has Premier League experience playing for Arsenal .","Alan Pardew left Newcastle to become Crystal Palace's new manager .

"Optimism swept around Goodison Park last summer but Everton’s campaign is delicately poised as they prepare for an FA Cup showdown with West Ham. A run of four consecutive defeats — their worst sequence of results since December 2005 — has been a great cause for concern and, for the first time in his reign, Roberto Martinez finds his managerial methods questioned and scrutinised. CONFIDENCE CRISIS . Head back to Everton’s opening fixtures against Leicester City and Arsenal in August. They were slick in both games and should have taken maximum points but conceded late goals to draw twice. That set the tone for them in the Premier League. Everton have disappointed considering their performances last season and investment during the summer . Roberto Martinez has found himself under scrutiny for the first time since taking charge at Everton . They have struggled for fluency and Martinez feels the goals against Leicester and Arsenal inflicted psychological wounds that are yet to heal. The nadir was reached in last week’s dreadful performance at Hull. ‘Those four points we lost really made it very difficult,’ said Martinez. ‘When I say difficult, I mean you are afraid of making a mistake and then you make it. When you play with freedom and you’re on top of your game, those aspects don’t get punished.’ WHY CAN’T THEY KEEP FIT? Martinez was asked for an injury bulletin at the start of Monday’s press conference and reeled off a succession of experienced names that included Darron Gibson, Steven Pienaar, Leon Osman, Tim Howard, Tony Hibbert and, most significantly, James McCarthy. The Republic of Ireland international — Everton’s standout performer — is again sidelined with hamstring damage and that injury has afflicted a number of players, including Phil Jagielka, Seamus Coleman, Kevin Mirallas and Steven Naismith this season. Olivier Giroud scores a last-gasp equaliser for Arsenal against Everton during their clash at Goodison Park . A number of key players for Everton, including Kevin Mirallas (pictured), have struggled to stay fit this season . Everton, unusually, only played five games in pre-season, leading to claims, which Martinez refuted, that they were under-cooked. There has been upheaval behind the scenes recently with Danny Donachie, the respected head of medicine, leaving abruptly. NO CASE FOR THE DEFENCE . Perhaps the most surprising aspect about Everton is how easily breached they are. They have conceded 33 times, the same tally as bottom club Leicester. Only QPR (35) have conceded more. They have only kept six clean sheets from the 27 matches they have played in all competitions — their last shutout was against Wolfsburg on November 27 — and what has concerned Martinez is the fact they were unable to muster a response against Hull. ‘We can see the goals we conceded are not up to the standard we want,’ he accepted. ‘That is clear. But as a team it is only against Hull I felt the goal, when it went in it, affected us too much. The way we conceded and how it affected us is something very rare.’ Ross Barkley has played well when fit, but maintaining fitness has been an issue for the young midfielder . Romelu Lukaku has struggled to reproduce the form that saw Everton pay £28m for him during the summer . THE TWO YOUNG HOPES . Martinez claimed he would have paid £100million to sign Romelu Lukaku in the summer. He ultimately got him for £28m but the Belgian’s performance have lacked swagger and in some games he has been anonymous. Ross Barkley, meanwhile, has not made the impact expected because of injuries and failing to play in a settled position. He has been stationed, puzzlingly, at times on the flank when he is more potent through the middle. TENSE ATMOSPHERE . It was said when Martinez arrived 18 months ago the atmosphere at Finch Farm, the club’s training retreat, lifted and the positivity certainly played its part in helping Everton come within a whisker of Champions League qualification. The downturn in results — coupled with the punishing schedule of Europa League football — means the mood is not as vibrant, though Jagielka recently made a point of emphasising the squad is ‘massively behind’ Martinez. The Goodison crowd is capable of giving its team tremendous backing but, if they turn, the stadium can be an unforgiving venue; there were growls of frustration when they beat QPR 3-0 last month. ‘The atmosphere at Goodison has only been a little bit shaky because of our expectations,’ said Martinez. ‘I think now the crowd understands we are in a difficult position and that we have to help each other.’ DEALING WITH PRESSURE . One of Martinez’s strengths is not getting flustered, either by the sequence of results or the focus on his position. He is also certain in his methods and will not resort to changing his tactics for the sake of a quick fix. ‘The truth is that I feel under the same pressure when we win and when we lose because I always look forward,’ he said. ‘My vision is to create a winning team. Losing games forces you to try and find solutions, to look inside in a different way than when you win.’ Aside from that, there is also a strong relationship with chairman Bill Kenwright. ‘He is an Evertonian and really cares about the club — results are paramount,’ said Martinez. ‘The support I got from day one has been incredible and really helps in moments like the one we are experiencing now.’ Everton's fans were heard booing during their side's 3-0 victory against QPR at Goodison Park . Martinez admitted the support of chairman Bill Kenwright has helped him in  the more difficult moments .","Everton are struggling and have lost each of their last four matches .
Romelu Lukaku has struggled to reproduce his form from last season .

"Holland legend Johan Cruyff has told Louis van Gaal he has no right to complain about the hectic holiday season programme in the Premier League when he chose to go and work there. Writing in his weekly column in the daily De Telegraaf, Cruyff said the Manchester United manager had to accept the English way of running their league without a winter break. 'If you choose for (a job in) England, then you choose for their successful system, which is based on the proposition that the stadiums open as soon as the fans are available to watch, which is the holiday period,' Cruyff said. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has been critical of the club's busy festive fixture list . 'Playing football between Christmas and New Year is a war of attrition and thus in favour of physically stronger teams.' Any attempt by Van Gaal to try to change the system would be doomed to failure, added Cruyff, who has had a strained relationship with his compatriot and has criticised Van Gaal's organisation of the United team since taking over in July. 'It has been working (well) since time immemorial and in 100 years it will still be so,' Cruyff said. 'Complaining makes no sense if everyone else around you is happy. Moreover, everybody is well paid for working over the holiday period.' Dutch legend Johan Cryuff says Van Gaal can't moan as he already knew there was no winter break in England . Van Gaal said the over-crowded festive fixture schedule neglected player welfare and short-changed millions of supporters. 'Everybody knows the body cannot recover within 48 hours,' he said last month. 'Therefore there is a rule within UEFA and FIFA that you cannot play the games within two days. The scientists have proven it, everybody knows it and, in spite of that, we have to play. 'It is the culture of England. I don't mind, but it's not good for the players, for the health of the players, and it's not good for the game,' said Van Gaal.

"Karl Fellows, 29, was rushed to hospital after being punched unconscious by a thug during a football game on New Year's Day . A football player has been left with horrific injuries after a single punch broke his jaw and teeth following a brutal attack on the pitch. Karl Fellows, 29, was rushed to hospital after being punched unconscious by another player during a semi-professional game on New Year's Day. The Aston Villa coach - who also plays for Stourport Swifts -  spent three hours under the knife as surgeons battled to save his shattered jaw. Medics inserted a plate and four screws to repair the battered bone, after the Midland Football League Premier Division match away at Walsall Wood FC. Mr Fellows said he was attacked in the 30th minute by a 21-year-old opposition player - who has not yet been named. Fortunately an off duty nurse who happened to be watching the game rushed to help the father-of-one. But he now needs surgery to repair his teeth and jaw. He said: 'I can't really remember much of it, because I was completely knocked out by the blow. 'But I know the punch came from behind. I was running back towards my goal to get the ball, and the next minute I was waking up in hospital. 'I'm still in excruciating pain, I can't believe what has happened to me, I was just playing football. 'When I went under the knife I was just supposed to be there for an hour, but they found my jaw was so badly broken they needed to do more work to save it. 'The x-rays show the damage was so bad they have had to cut in from the outside rather than just through my open mouth. 'That means I will have scars on the inside and outside of my mouth for the rest of my life. 'My face has been swollen, and my teeth are now completely rearranged. 'They said they managed to get the back teeth back in place, but it would take years and years for the front ones to come back, and they may well never do. 'I don't think I will play again, not how I feel at the moment, it's scary to think that could happen when you're just there to play. Karl Fellows is helped by a team mate on the ground being treated for his injury. Chris Reynolds, chairman of Stourport Swifts, said he had written to football league officials to complain about the incident . Mr Fellows was rushed to hospital after being punched unconscious by another player during a semi-professional game on New Year's Day . Fortunately an off duty nurse who happened to be watching the game rushed to help the father-of-one. But he now needs surgery to repair his teeth and jaw . Mr Fellows, 29, from Solihull, West Midlands. Karl was assaulted and left unconscious with a broken jaw while playing for the Stourport Swifts in an away game at Walsall Wood FC on New Year's Day . 'I coach football to young people and it is all about teaching respect. Players will always be injured, but being attacked, like I was, was disgusting.' His father Paul, 55, also from Solihull, said he was left 'horrified' by the incident. He added: 'I wasn't at the game but I got a call from Karl who could barely speak. I couldn't believe it when he told me what had happened. 'I've been refereeing football games for more than 20 years and I've never heard of an incident like it. 'Karl lives and breathes football. To think that this will put him off playing again breaks my heart.' Pictured at hospital after the injury. Mr Fellows now says he is reluctant to return to the football pitch . Chris Reynolds, chairman of Stourport Swifts, said he had written to football league officials to complain about the incident. He added: 'I'm appalled. Behaviour like that should not be tolerated, on or off the pitch.' A spokesman for Walsall Wood FC said that the incident had begun with a Walsall Wood player being fouled from behind by a Stourport Swifts player, who then spat on their team member. Whilst the club stressed that it in in no way condones violence, it added that the incident would never have occurred but for the initial spitting offence. A West Midlands Police spokesperson added: 'A 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assault at Walsall Wood FC's ground near Aldridge at around 4pm on New Year's Day. 'He has since been bailed for further questioning later this month.'

"Injured captain Michael Clarke spent time in a private box at the Sydney Cricket Ground with the family of Phillip Hughes on Tuesday, as Australia began an emotional final Test dedicated to the memory of the tragic cricketer. Clarke shared tender moments chatting with Hughes' mother Virginia and friends, who were joined by the late 25-year-old's father Greg, as they watched Dave Warner pay the ultimate tribute with a heart-breaking century on the pitch where Philip Hughes was knocked down. 'This was his ground, the Sydney Cricket Ground,' Clarke said in a Nine Network tribute. Australia finished the opening day 2/348 with Shane Watson 61* and Steve Smith 82* after a dominant day of play. The start of play was marked by scenes of the Australian players, wearing black armbands as they have done throughout the series, touching a recently erected plaque of Hughes as they walked down the SCG race. Warner, who has played with obvious inspiration in this Test series against India, looked to the sky and leapt into the air when he notched his third hundred of the summer. Earlier, the left-hander - a close friend of Hughes - knelt on the pitch as he reached 63 not out and kissed the spot where Hughes played his final inning. Scroll down for video .

"Brendan Rodgers admits that he will have to win a trophy to be considered a success at Liverpool following last season’s title heartbreak. Liverpool achieved their aim of qualifying for the Champions League but suffered a late stumble in the Premier League title race and lost out to Manchester City on the final day. Rodgers insists the pain of that experience will drive his players on to go one better this season, but has warned that they will be judged on the trophies they win. Wants a trophy: Brendan Rodgers is looking to lead Liverpool to success after last season's slip-up . Team spirit: But the boss insists that means no extra pressure for his side, lead by Steven Gerrard . ‘I want a trophy this year,’ he said. ‘My sole aim in the first three years was to get us into the Champions League. I knew what it meant to the city and the supporters, so my drive in that period was to get us back. ‘Now I want the club to win the big trophies again. That’s what I said to the players. The expectancy this season is continual improvement. We want to win. To be successful is winning trophies. ‘I don’t think it puts pressure on us. We were ahead of schedule last year. I just think there is a real excitement, not pressure of last year. We know we can do it now. We embrace it and I am looking forward to this year. ‘We’ve got players who have had disappointments in their careers and picked themselves up again. We went so close but it is only the beginning for us. I’m super hungry to be a champion and succeed and in the short period of time we have shown we have the credentials to do that. ‘The Premier League is going to be as competitive as ever and we’ve got the belief behind us from the early stages of the season we can win it.’ Agonising: Liverpool - and Gerrard - slipped up at vital times last season, particularly against Chelsea . Dark times: Gerrard has retired from international football to focus on the task ahead with Liverpool . Rodgers believes Liverpool can take heart from Manchester United’s success in the 1990s after Sir Alex Ferguson’s team lost out to Leeds in the race for the old First Division title. ‘If you look at the history of the winning teams they have always come close,’ he added. ‘The United team that won it in 1993, they came close in 1992 when they lost it to Leeds. They came back the following year and won it. That set up an era of winning for them. It has made us even more unified and stronger to be more successful in the future.’ There are concerns about how Liverpool will cope with the loss of Luis Suarez, but Rodgers refuted suggestions that they would be perceived as a selling club after agreeing to let the Uruguay striker join Barcelona for £75million. Moving on: Rodgers insists Liverpool are not a selling club despite Luis Suarez leaving for Barcelona . Step up: Lazar Markovic will be one of those tasked with replacing the Uruguayan forward this season . Loving life: Rodgers oversees a training session during Liverpool's tour of the USA . ‘Liverpool is not a selling club, that’s for sure,’ he said. ‘The big clubs lose the big players at some point. That’s reality. It’s not due to any lack of ambition. Sometimes you lose your best player and the key is planning your success beyond that. ‘Luis had his time here and has looked to move on. He will be in Spain for a time and then end up back in South America. ‘We’re in a really healthy position now. The conversations we’ve had with players and agents is showing the power of the club is back again.’","Liverpool slipped up in Premier League title race last season .

"A new year dawns and with it there is new hope for Liverpool. Nothing extraordinary yet, nothing on a par with that remarkable run in last season’s Premier League title race. But hope all the same that the problems of the last six months are being left behind as the door closes on 2014. The green shoots of recovery were clearly evident in the win over Swansea at Anfield on Monday night. It was Liverpool’s biggest win of the season, but the manner of victory is what will please Brendan Rodgers most; a return to the high-energy, high-intensity, performances of last season when his team seemed capable of sweeping aside all before them. There was enough to suggest that even without Daniel Sturridge, Steven Gerrard and, of course, Luis Suarez, Liverpool are capable of getting back to those sort of levels using the players Rodgers signed in the summer. Liverpool celebrate their fourth goal against Swansea on Monday night as they ease to victory . Adam Lallana was excellent, producing his best performance in a Liverpool shirt to date by scoring twice. Lukasz Fabianski will not want to see the first of those two again, but the way Lallana closed down the Swansea goalkeeper’s clearance is exactly what Rodgers wants to see from his players. ‘That was what was missing from our way of working for the first period of the season,’ said the Liverpool boss. ‘We are a team that plays with a big pressure. We have got technically gifted players in the team, but that ability to press the ball allows them to create chances at the far end of the field. We ask the players to go and press and he got his reward.’ Alongside Lallana and Raheem Sterling in attack, Philippe Coutinho was imperious, looking every inch a Brazilian No 10. Jordan Henderson and Lucas were everywhere in midfield, Alberto Moreno’s constant incursions down the left flank were rewarded with his first Anfield goal, and Emre Can fitted seamlessly into a back three. Brazil playmaker Philippe Coutinho was back to his best on Monday night . England midfielder Adam Lallana scored twice as he put in arguably his best performance in a Liverpool shirt . Some of the changes might have been brought on by circumstance and necessity towards the back end of a busy Christmas programme, but Rodgers insisted that signs of a return to the high intensity displays of last season were even there in the depressing 3-0 defeat at Old Trafford earlier this month. ‘If you look at how we played against Manchester United, we conceded poor goals, but the creativity started that day,’ said the Northern Irishman. ‘We looked at a shape and system that could get us back to how we played last year. We didn’t quite get that result but I saw enough. ‘We moved on to Bournemouth and played really well. Arsenal we deserved more again, and the performance was better. We had to show a different side against Burnley but on Monday night we came out and had the intensity and work-rate to get a reward. Our creativity was very much there, but a solid base was behind it and that is key for us. ‘The last two or three weeks the performance level has been much more what we were over the course of the last 18 months. A lot of work, a lot of hours go in to find a tactical idea to get back to that. When you have the players that want to press the ball and work as hard as we did, and have the quality to back that up, then you can be a really hard team to play against.’ Brendan Rodgers gives Raheem Sterling a pat on the cheek after substituting the youngster . It would be wrong to think that everything has suddenly turned rosy for Rodgers. Elsewhere on Monday night, there were reminders of issues that still need to be resolved. On the substitutes bench, for instance, Mario Balotelli sat alongside Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini. Ideally, Liverpool would like to offload two of them in the January transfer window but only Borini is likely to go if a £6million buyer can be found. It speaks volumes that Rodgers was happy to leave out his three conventional strikers while once again asking Sterling to play out of position and lead the line. The wisdom of signing forwards like Lambert and Balotelli for a team designed to play a pressing game seems as curious now as it did five months ago. The goalkeeping situation clearly needs addressing as well. Simon Mignolet looks like a goalkeeper who knows he is only back in the team because of an injury to Brad Jones, and Mamadou Sakho’s header in the build-up to Swansea’s goal was a reminder that Rodgers is still short of top-class defenders. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet still looks short on confidence despite being recalled . No-one is getting carried away just yet although Lallana, for one, believes Liverpool are finally heading in the right direction. ‘Expectation levels were raised after last season and maybe that all came as a bit of a shock to some of the new players,’ said the £25m signing from Southampton. ‘But we’ve settled in now and we’re just gelling that little bit more as a team. ‘We believe we’ve turned the corner in the last few weeks. In no way are we there yet – there’s still a lot of hard work to do.’ The Kop faithful will be hoping there's plenty more to cheer about in 2015 .","Liverpool beat Swansea 4-1 at Anfield on Monday night .

Photos from her latest campaign, for American swimwear brand Beach Bunny, show the 28-year-old at her glamorous best, posing on a tropical beach in a succession of teeny bikinis. The campaign is the latest in a series of career coups for the Russian model, who last year, appeared in editorial features in a host of prestigious magazines as well as on the cover of Spanish Vogue. Scroll down for video . Smouldering: Irina Shayk appears to have put a miserable Christmas behind her in these stunning new shots . Grecian: Some of the bikinis appeared to take inspiration from the Hellenistic heroes of the past . The model is also due to make her film debut later this year when she appears in Hercules: The Thracian Wars as Megara, the vengeful wife of the eponymous hero, played by The Rock. But, as these photos prove, she won't be giving up her modelling career in the near future - and even managed to make some of the more dubious designs look good. Particularly outré was an antique gold number, which could have come direct from the costume department of Hercules: The Thracian Wars, and came complete with bling straps encrusted with turquoise stones. In better taste was a cobalt Grecian number that boasted a smattering of pretty beading and a relatively restrained black and silver option. Hercules approved: Some of the designs could have come direct from the set of Hercules: The Thracian Wars . The designer behind the brand is Californian Angela Chittenden, a former swimwear model herself, who says the idea for her own label arose after she was unable to find beachwear to suit. 'Either they were too conservative with too much coverage, or they weren’t very classy,' she complains in an interview on the Beach Bunny website. 'There was nothing out there that was sexy and elegant. So I decided to design my own.' Having concluded that 'sexy cuts' with copious embellishment were the future of swimwear, she launched her label in 2004. 'Some people said I was crazy, that my designs were too risky, too out-there to catch on,' she adds. 'I guess they were wrong.'

"In a victory for the gay rights movement, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Monday that it will not hear appeals from five states seeking to prohibit same-sex marriages, paving the way for an expansion of unions between homosexuals. The decision doesn't immediately fling open the courthouse doors to couples previously denied the right to marry, but makes it likely that earlier appeals court decisions will take effect as soon as judges lift the 'stays' they ordered while the nation's highest court examined the cases. There are still numerous gay-marriage court cases wending their way through lower courts, but the justices declined to immediately review decisions affecting couples only in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. It's likely the Supreme Court is waiting to get a fuller picture of how the nation's judiciary views the contentious issue. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage often clash on courthouse steps, but the rainbow-flag brigade got the upper hand on Monday . Jeff Zarrillo (right) and Paul Katami (left) were among the first same-sex couples to wed legally in California, and plaintiffs in the case that led to a court overturning the state's five-year ban . But for the moment it appears likely that gays and lesbians in at least those five states – and as many as 11 – will be able to marry soon. The high court will likely weigh in only when two or more federal appeals courts disagree sharply on whether gay Americans should be able to tie the knot. All five of the cases before the nine justices were appeals from states affected by rulings that legalized the practice. The Cincinnati-based Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals is the most likely one to put the issue on the Supreme Court's plate. That district includes Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told an audience three weeks ago at the University of Minnesota School of Law that 'there will be some urgency' to decide the issue once and for all if judges on that court uphold gay-marriage bans. But she said then that if the appeals panel in Cincinnati agrees with the cases that the Supreme Court rejected on Monday, there will be 'no need for us to rush.' A similar case sits in the traditionally liberal Ninth Circuit, based in San Francisco, Legal observers say there's virtually no chance that court will side with those who advocate for a strictly traditional definition of marriage between one man and one woman. Celebrating: A wave of pro-gay-parriage decisions has made Missourians like David Gray and Tod Martin (left, Miranda Duschack and Mimo Davis (center) and Terry Garrett and Bruce Yampolsky (right) rejoice . The gay rights movement has seen remarkably fast movement toward a new national standard that would prohibit government officials from distinguishing among between same-sex and traditional marriages . Ginsberg and her eight black-robed colleagues offered no comment Monday in rejecting the only gay marriage appeals cases they had on their potential docket. The Associated Press reported Monday that the court's order immediately ends delays on marriage in the five affected states. But gay couples in six other states – Colorado, Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming – will also be bound by the ruling since they are part of the same appeals-court districts.

"Football players at Northwestern University can create the first union of college athletes in the United States, in a ruling which could revolutionize a college sports industry worth billions of dollars. The case has stirred a national debate over whether student football players who help generate millions of dollars in revenue for their universities should be treated as employees. On Wednesday, a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board decided the answer is yes. Scroll down for video . Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter, right, speaks while College Athletes Players Association President Ramogi Huma listens during a news conference in Chicago . Peter Sung Ohr's ruling means he agrees that football players at Northwestern - a member of the Big Ten conference of 12 universities with prestigious sports programs - qualify as employees under federal law and therefore can legally unionize. An employee is generally regarded by law as someone who receives compensation for a service and is under the direct control of managers. Players argued that their sports scholarships are compensation and coaches are their managers. The decision comes at a time when the National Collegiate Athletics Association, which organizes the athletics programs of many universities in the U.S., has been under increasing scrutiny over its rules and is fighting a class-action federal lawsuit by former players seeking a cut of the billions of dollars earned from live broadcasts, memorabilia sales and video games. Ruling: Ryan Field at Northwestern University which has been told it can create a union of college athletes . Other lawsuits allege the NCAA failed to protect players from debilitating head injuries. Northwestern, which is in Illinois, argued that college athletes, as students, don't fit in the same category as factory workers, truck drivers and other unionized workers. Immediately after the ruling, the school announced it plans to appeal to labor authorities in Washington, D.C. Attorneys for the College Athletes Players Association, which would take the lead in organizing the Northwestern players, argued that college football is, for all practical purposes, a commercial enterprise that relies on players' labor. Supporters of the union bid also argued that the university ultimately treats football as more important than academics for scholarship players. Ohr sided with the players on that issue. He wrote: 'The record makes clear that the employer's scholarship players are identified and recruited in the first instance because of their football prowess and not because of their academic achievement in high school.' A ruling has decided that football players at Northwestern University can create the first union of college athletes . He also noted that among the evidence presented by Northwestern, 'no examples were provided of scholarship players being permitted to miss entire practices and/or games to attend their studies.' The ruling described how the life of a football player at Northwestern is far more regimented than that of a typical student, down to requirements about what they can and can't eat and whether they can live off campus or purchase a car. At times, players put 50 or 60 hours a week into football, he added. Alan Cubbage, Northwestern's vice president for university relations, said in a statement that while the school respects 'the NLRB process and the regional director's opinion, we disagree with it.' In a written statement, the NCAA also said it disagreed with the notion that student-athletes are employees. 'We frequently hear from student-athletes, across all sports, that they participate to enhance their overall college experience and for the love of their sport, not to be paid' the NCAA said. Scholarship players will vote within 30 days on whether to formally authorize the College Athletes Players Association, or CAPA, to represent them, according to former UCLA linebacker Ramogi Huma, the designated president of Northwestern's would-be football players' union. The specific goals of CAPA include guaranteeing coverage of sports-related medical expenses for current and former players, ensuring better procedures to reduce head injuries and potentially letting players pursue commercial sponsorships. But critics have argued that giving college athletes employee status and allowing them to unionize could damage college sports in numerous ways, including raising the prospects of strikes by disgruntled players. The outgoing quarterback for Northwestern's Wildcats, Kain Colter, took a leading role in establishing CAPA. The United Steelworkers union has been footing the legal bills. Colter, whose eligibility has been exhausted and who has entered the NFL draft, said nearly all of the 85 scholarship players on the Wildcats roster backed the union bid, though only he expressed his support publicly. During the federal agency's five days of hearings in February, Wildcats coach Pat Fitzgerald took the stand for union opponents, and his testimony sometimes was at odds with Colter's. An attorney representing the university, Alex Barbour, noted Northwestern has one of the highest graduation rates for college football players in the nation, around 97 per cent. Barbour insisted, 'Northwestern is not a football factory.'","Case argued football players who help generate millions of pounds for universities should be treated as employees .

"A Montana man was charged in a shooting that killed a 17-year-old exchange student - after he and his wife reportedly set a trap in their garage to catch would-be burglars because of recent thefts. Markus Kaarma, 29, of Missoula made an initial appearance in Justice Court on Monday but did not enter a plea to the count of felony deliberate homicide filed in the death of Diren Dede, an exchange student from Hamburg, Germany. Kaarma's attorney, Paul Ryan, said his client feels terrible about the death of the young man, but he was also disappointed that the Missoula County attorney filed the charge. Victim: Diren Dede, pictured, was a 17-year-old German exchange student reportedly shot after homeowner Markus Kaarma 'set a trap' for burglars in his garage . Court records obtained by KPAX said Kaarma and his wife, Janelle Pflager, had set up sensors outside the garage, a video monitoring system in the garage and left the garage door open. Pflager said she put personal items that she had cataloged in a purse in the garage 'so that they would take it.' Early Sunday, the sensors went off, and Kaarma and Pflager looked at the video feed and saw that someone was in the garage. Kaarma went outside with his shotgun. He told investigators he heard a noise that sounded 'like metal on metal,' and he was afraid the intruder would come out and hurt him. He said he did not see anyone in the darkened garage and did not communicate with anyone before sweeping the garage with four shotgun blasts. Dede was struck in the head and arm and died at a Missoula hospital, court records said. Kaarma told police he fired high to avoid hitting the car in the garage - but court records showed that three of four shots were aimed low. He also told investigators 'wanted him to be caught' because 'police can't catch burglars in the act.' Plager's testimony shows a different version of events. She told police she heard Kaarma say 'Hey hey' at the garage door and put a shell into his shotgun. She then heard someone say 'Hey' or 'Wait' right before Kaarma fired two shots. As she went to turn on lights, two more shots were fired, according to court records. Charged: Markus Kaarma, pictured right, did not enter a plea to the count of felony deliberate homicide on Monday . Pflager told police that they had been burglarized two times within the last three weeks, Ryan said. They were frustrated, on edge and felt someone in their neighborhood was watching them, Ryan said. The couple called police 'and nothing was done,' he said. Pflager had made a list of the items in the purse so if it was taken she could attempt to track the thief, Ryan said. Despite the recent burglaries, they left the garage door open, prosecutors noted. 'They certainly didn't tell the kid to come in (the garage),' Ryan said. 'He entered voluntarily.' On Sunday, a woman told investigators that Kaarma had told her that he had been waiting up for three nights with his shotgun to 'shoot some f****** kid, court records said. Dede was a junior at Big Sky High School, where officials set up brief support for students. Missoula County Public Schools spokeswoman Hatton Littman told Helenair that he was an active and popular student who participated in track and soccer. 'He was a very loved student, especially in the junior class,' she said. 'When he landed...first thing he asked was when are we practicing for soccer.' Justice of the Peace Karen Orzech set Kaarma's bail at $30,000 . Less than two hours before the Missoula shooting, a homeowner 350 miles away in Billings shot and wounded a houseguest he thought was an intruder. The 19-year-old seminary student was making a phone call in the home's garage late Saturday when he was shot, Billings Police Sgt. Pat Curry told The Billings Gazette. The student, who was not named, appeared to be shot in the chest, but the injury was not life-threatening, Curry said. The homeowner, who also was not identified, probably won't face charges, Curry said.","Markus Kaarma, 29, and his wife Janelle Pflaeger reportedly set up sensors outside their garage, put a video monitoring system inside it and left its door open .

Rachel Canning has turned 18 but the rare lawsuit aims to force her parents to support her even though she’s living with a friend’s family who are shelling out thousands for her attorney fees. Meanwhile, Sean Canning has shot back saying his college-bound daughter is nothing but a ‘spoiled’ liar who left home on her own when she couldn’t live by the former officer’s rules. Scroll down for video . Sick: Rachel's mother submitted court documents in which she claimed to have supported her daughter throughout her bulimia battle after finding garbage sacks full of vomit hidden in her bedroom . Won't pay: Rachel's retired police chief father Sean Canning denies he and his wife Amy kicked out Rachel and say she left on her own accord because she didn't want to follow his rules. He's fighting back against his daughter's financial demands . While her exact reason for leaving remains foggy, neither side in the Morris County, New Jersey suit is refuting that Rachel left her home in comfortable Lincoln Park sometime on or near her 18th birthday on November 1. Rachel, who’s already received acceptance letters to several universities and a $20,000 scholarship offer from a New York private college, claims she was forced out of her home on her birthday after her father and mother Amy jointly decided to cut her off ‘from all support both financially and emotionally.’ ‘My parents have rationalized their . actions by blaming me for not following their rules,’ court papers filed . on behalf of the teen claim. ‘They stopped paying my high school . tuition to punish the school and me and have redirected my college fund . indicating their refusal to afford me an education as a punishment.’ According . to DailyRecord.com, Sean and Amy Canning owe Morris Catholic $5,306 in . tuition they’ve neglected to pay since the start of the family feud. The father of Rachel's friend, attorney john Inglesino (pictured) says he and his wife are helping her sue her parents because without her parents, 'Rachel's ability to fulfill her potential will be greatly diminished' And it’s not just because of their missing money that school administrators appear to be backing Rachel. 'Rachel . has excellent grades and will not be removed from the school for this . non-payment; however her parents do have a contractual obligation to . pay. Rachel is certainly unable at this time to attend Morris Catholic . High School full-time and support herself financially,' Morris Catholic . president Michael St. Pierre wrote in a certification to the court. St. Pierre said the school called New Jersey Child Protection and . Permanency last fall after abuse allegations from Rachel and what he . called ‘difficult meetings between Rachel and Mr. Canning.’ Mr. Canning admits a state worker visited the home just prior to Rachel’s . alleged ‘abandonment,’ but that the official found the teen simply to be . ‘spoiled’ and didn’t pursue the abuse allegations. 'We . love our child and miss her. This is terrible. It’s killing me and my . wife. We have a child we want home. We’re not draconian and now we’re . getting hauled into court. She’s demanding that we pay her bills but she . doesn’t want to live at home and she’s saying “I don’t want to live . under your rules,”' Mr. Canning said. Mr. Canning contends that his daughter left on her own accord because she . was simply unwilling to follow his demands she be respectful, do her . chores, and give back some of her sister's borrowed belongings. 'We’re . heartbroken but what do you do when a child says ""I don’t want your . rules but I want everything under the sun and you to pay for it?”' Mr. Canning was unavailable for comment when a call was made to his office at Mt. Olive Township Monday afternoon. He admits that he's stopped paying Rachel's high school tuition but says she'll receive her existing college fund. But . that’s just not enough, says John Inglesino, an attorney and former . local city official whose already paid $12,597 for Rachel’s lawyer Tanya . N. Helfand, who claims his daughter friend is ‘emotionally distraught . by her parents’ sudden rejection of her.’ ‘Rachel . is likeable, communicates exceptionally well and is highly motivated to . attend and excel at a college appropriate for her. That is why my wife . and I have decided to fund this lawsuit. We know that if Mr. and Mrs. Canning are not required to fulfil their legal obligations as parents, . that Rachel’s ability to fulfil her potential will be greatly . diminished,’ Inglesino wrote to the court. Inglesino did not immediately return MailOnline's call for comment. Just spoiled? Rachel alleged she was being abused last fall, which helped prompt officials at her school to call child protective services. But Rachel's father says the state worker only found that his daughter is 'spoiled' 'My parents have rationalized their actions by blaming me for not following their rules,' Rachel said in court papers. The 18-year-old has offers to attend several colleges and is an accomplished cheerleader and lacrosse player who hopes to one day be a biomedical engineer . Rachel is demanding her parents pay her college tuition and expenses, transportation costs, cover her current high school tuition and even pay her legal fees. Her attorney’s argument that these are all reasonable demands spin solely on the fact that 18-year-old Rachel, who says she wants to study biomedical engineering, will be a student. Helfand says her client has not ‘moved beyond (her parents’) sphere of influence’ and per New Jersey law may be deemed non-emancipated. ‘A child’s admittance and attendance at college will overcome the rebuttable presumption that a child may be emancipated at age 18,’ reads an earlier state court decision. But the attorney for Mr. and Mrs. Canning Laurie Rush-Masuret is claiming Rachel removed herself from that 'sphere of influence' when she voluntary left her parents' home.Family law attorneys Sheldon Simon disagrees. ‘A child is not emancipated until they’re on their own…Even if a child and the parents don’t get along that doesn’t relieve the parents of their responsibility,’ Simon told the DailyRecord. Simon said he's never seen anything like the lawsuit in 40 years of practice. Judge Peter Bogaard has scheduled a the first court hearing for Tuesday in Morristown, Pennsylvania. Forced to pay? Rachel currently attends Morris Catholic High School. her father admits he and his wife stopped paying her tuition when she moved out. The school says they're contractually obligated to pay up and have decided to allow Rachel to finish her studies .","College-bound honors student Rachel Canning of Lincoln Park, New Jersey says she was 'abandoned' by her parents the day she turned 18 .

"Philip Branch was jailed for three years at Guildford Crown Court for historic sexual abuse . A paedophile golfer who repeatedly abused his schoolboy caddie more than 35 years ago, was behind bars today. Grey-haired Philip Blanch was jailed for three years after his victim, now an adult, found the courage to contact police. He had targeted the schoolboy, then aged 11 years,  after he volunteered to caddie for him in exchange for pocket money. Over the next four years Blanch, now aged 79, repeatedly sexually abused the boy  until he turned 15. He told the child that if he ever contacted police both he and his sister would be taken into care. His victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, branded Blanch a 'monster' who had wrecked his life in a statement read to Guildford Crown Court. 'He took away my childhood,' he said. 'I am living behind the wall with no emotional output. I blame him for multiple suicide attempts. I blame him entirely for my criminal record, I turned to stealing when he was abusing me. 'It sent me into a spiral of criminal behaviour. My IQ was 157 yet I failed miserably at school.' The man urged Judge Peter Moss to jail Blanch to protect the public. He added: 'I feel let down by those who should have protected me from this monster. 'I look to the court to do the right thing and send him to prison and protect other young boys.' Blanch, of Belaugh Avenue in Lowestoft, Suffolk, admitted three indecent assaults on the boy when he was a member of a golf club near Woking in Surrey. He was also convicted on a majority verdict of 11 to one of three other indecent assaults on the same boy after a five day trial in November. Blanch was acquitted of four counts of rape by buggery and three counts of indecent assault on a child. Blanch told his victim that if he ever told anyone else about what happened both he and his sister would be taken into care . A judge sitting at Guildford Crown Court was told how Blanch would take the boy on trips and abuse him in the car as well as buying him gifts. Blanch told the boy, who lived with his mother and sister, that if he reported him to the police he and his sister would be taken into care. Stephen Requena, defending, appealed for a suspended sentence because Blanch's 80-year-old wife has poor health and he has to do most of the house work. He said: 'This is an elderly woman who has stood by Mr Blanch and with reason it has to be said, these 34 years despite what he did in the 60s and 70s.' The court heard Blanch was convicted of two similar incidents in 1965 and 1980, but was arrested in a public house in April 2013 for the current crimes. Mr Requena stressed that since his last conviction Blanch has had treatment and now has 'significant' health problems including diabetes and heart disease. He said: 'It is a case of positive good character. He has spent the last 34 years feeling disgusted, ashamed and deeply sorry. He has shown remorse.' However, Judge Moss told Blanch that because of the severe psychological damage his crimes had caused his victim only an immediate jail term would suffice. Jailing him for three years and four months, Judge Moss said: 'These offences arose when you met the boy at your golf club. You stole his innocence. That has obviously had an impact on the remainder of his life. 'He has suffered psychological damage as a consequence of what you have done. 'He was 11 years old at the time and from a background which was deprived of a father. 'You took advantage of him. You knew he would be vulnerable. He trusted you and you utilised and abused that. You did groom him. 'Your wife is an innocent victim of these historic allegations. 'It is impossible to find any alternative other than an immediate custodial sentence.'","Philip Blanch, 79,  was jailed for three years at Guildford Crown Court .

"It's just not cricket without Richie Benaud behind the microphone and so the summer of Test matches in Australia will conclude at the SCG, without the legend calling a ball. The veteran of the Channel Nine commentary team is unlikely to make his much anticipated return at his home-town Test beginning on Tuesday. The Nine Network had left the door open for Benaud, 84, to return in the fourth and final match between Australia and India, ever since he appeared at their summer of cricket launch at the same ground a month ago. However, Nine's head of sport Steve Crawley confirmed that Benaud hadn't been in touch about working at the Test and he accepted it wouldn't happen. Scroll down for video .

He's taken on a role of alongside regular 'lambassador', AFL legend Sam Kekovich, in this year's Australia Day lamb campaign. 'To me, Australia Day is the perfect excuse to get together with friends and family over a BBQ and enjoy some delicious lamb chops,' the former Australian captain said. The ad campaign featuring two of the country's best loved sporting greats is about to be rolled out.

Richie Benaud has taken on legendary status in his homeland, the silver fox looks and beige jacket a staple during Australian summers - even leading to fans mimicking his look at last year's Ashes Test in Sydney . The 84-year-old has been absent from the Nine Network's cricket commentary team this summer while he battles skin cancer. 'He's a man of great manners and he knows that the offer is there and he would have made contact by now,' Crawley said. He hasn't returned to the commentary box since a car crash left him with two crushed vertebrae 15 months ago and he revealed at Nine's cricket launch on December 6 that he was also undergoing treatment for cancer. 'To me, Australia Day is the perfect excuse to get together with friends and family over a BBQ and enjoy some delicious lamb chops' the former Australian captain said. Richie Benaud will feature in an ad campaign ahead of Australia Day . There had been speculation Benaud could even contribute to the commentary from his lounge-room in seaside suburb Coogee, but that too is unlikely. 'I very much doubt he'll be calling over the next five days,' Crawley said. 'But if he did decide to jump in a taxi and get over to the SCG, well, the door is always open to him.' Crawley said only Benaud would decide if and when he got behind the microphone again. 'With Rich we just want him to get better,' Crawley said. 'All that matters is his health and recovery.' Benaud has been heard in pre-recorded snippets this summer, including a brief tribute to the late Phillip Hughes during the 1st test in Adelaide and a small segment for the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne where he recounted his battle with illness and his gradual recovery at home .","Richie Benaud has been battling health issues after skin cancer treatment and a car accident .

"A rugby player was left waiting for three hours for an ambulance after he broke his leg - despite the hospital being just five minutes away. Ambulance chiefs have launched an inquiry after Luigi Segadelli, 30, was left lying face down on a freezing rugby pitch with his ankle bent almost 90 degrees during a game for Morriston RFC in Swansea, South Wales.

Joshua (front) was out celebrating his heavyweight win against Denis Bakhtov on Saturday night . The emphatic triumph now sees the Olympic champion's record read at nine wins out of nine in his first year since turning professional. Bakhtov had not been stopped for almost a decade and had boxed a staggering 250 rounds more than his younger opponent, but that didn't look the case as the fight came to a quick conclusion. Despite the ease of the outcome Joshua, who will fight Michael Sprott in six weeks time in Liverpool, says he won't get carried away by his performance. Joshua (left) needed only two rounds to dispatch of Bakhtov (right) in a one-sided bout . ‘I need to put this behind me,’ he said after the fight. ‘Not everyone will get knocked out like that, not everyone will fold under pressure. There’s a whole ocean of heavyweights out there,’ he added. ‘There’s been a long line of heavyweights and there’s always two or three that rise to the top. I’ve got the potential but I’ve got to graft and grind to bring that dream to a reality.’ The Watford fighter (left) will next fight Michael Sprott in Liverpool in six weeks time .","Anthony Joshua produced a commanding display against Denis Bakhtov .

"The BBC made an embarrassing blunder this afternoon after announcing that the former Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher had died after suffering a strike instead of a stroke. An update on the mobile website of BBC News wrongly stated that she had been killed by a form of industrial action. It read: 'Reaction as former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher dies following a strike.' Embarrassing: The BBC made a blunder this afternoon after announcing that the former Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher had died after suffering a strike instead of a stroke . In reality she suffered a stroke and passed away at the age of 87. The gaffe was spotted by the @HeardinLondon Twitter account, which sarcastically tweeted: 'Well done, BBC.' The post has been retweeted more than 800 times and received nearly 150 favourites. In response to the mistake a BBC spokesperson said: 'This was an error which was quickly corrected.' The error provoked amusement on the internet with one Twitter user calling the gaffe 'The most ironic typo ever,' while another questioned 'Most inappropriate typo ever?' When Baroness Thatcher came to power in May 1979, it was at the end of the infamous Winter of Discontent, where Britain was crippled by a wave of national strikes. Mistake: An update on the mobile website of BBC News wrongly stated that the former Prime Minister had been killed by a bout of industrial action. Right, a 1984 photo showing police taking action as violence flares with miners at Daw Mill colliery in Warwickshire . The Iron Lady, named because of her . strong will, spent the next decade curbing the power of trade unions, . signalling the end of an era when trade union leaders trooped in and out . of 10 Downing Street, haggling and bargaining with her Labour . predecessors. Instead she stripped the unions of . many of their powers with the aim of transferring them to management . and individual consumers. Mrs Thatcher successfully defied . Arthur Scargill's nationwide and year-long miners' strike, which . threatened to cripple Britain's entire economy. And as she transformed the nation - . attempting to release the grip of the state on massive industries and . public services alike - she became one of the most influential, . talked-about, listened-to and dominant statesmen of the Western world. Other criticism leveled at the corporation was when viewers noticed that news anchors were not wearing black ties. Presenter Huw Edwards was not wearing a dark tie fronting the Thatcher special on BBC News Channel. One Twitter user wrote: 'Would it be too much for the BBC news readers to put on a black tie and show some respect!?!' While another wrote: 'No black tie for BBC News Channel presenter? Surprising.' It is thought that the corporation's staff are only obliged to wear a black tie when a death occurs which they class as a Category One - such as the Queen.","The update was seen on the mobile website of BBC .

"CLICK HERE to read the full match report . Saido Berahino scored four times in a West Bromwich Albion rout — but you wouldn’t have guessed it by his grumpy expression. The in-demand striker refused to celebrate any of his four goals in this majestic victory. Luckily, new boss Tony Pulis has an impressive record with ‘problem’ players, which may come in handy when dealing with the troubled Berahino. Saido Berahino looks downcast despite scoring four goals in West Brom's 7-0 defeat of Gateshead . Not that Berahino saw any problem with his celebration, insisting he was 'acting professionally.' ‘I was just handling business and acting professionally and that’s it,’ said Berahino. ‘There’s no need for me to explain myself on not celebrating goals. It is what it is.’ Asked if his lack of celebration was out of respect to Gateshead, he said: ‘No. I just didn’t want to celebrate and that was it. I was just acting professionally.’ A straight-faced Berahino (2nd left) was mobbed by team-mates after his first goal . There still wasn't much of a smile when Berahino (2nd right) doubled his tally a few minutes later . His hat-trick brought congratulations from Chris Baird - but still no wild celebration from the striker (right) The Baggies strikers nets his fourth goal to send his side into the FA Cup fourth round . There was a hint of a grin after his fourth but again Berahino (right) didn't go crazy with the celebrations . Pulis has the dual challenge of keeping the 21-year-old at the club, amid interest from Liverpool and Tottenham, while also giving him something to smile about. ‘He won’t be the first boy to have problems off the pitch,’ said Pulis. ‘I have signed players who have had massive problems off the pitch and worked with them and got the best out of them. ‘We are all different. I have had players turn up late and had players not turn up at times. I have had players do things that would make your hair curl. But I have dealt with it and that is what management is about. Interpret the Berahino show in any way that you wish. Pulis will no doubt have taken pleasure in four beautifully-taken goals, including two sublime, curling finishes that are rapidly becoming his trademark. But the striker adopted the same grumpy expression after each goal, offering the impression that his art-form was a chore. He has been linked with a January move while contract talks have been shelved. West Brom insist that they do not need to sell their star forward to strengthen, although Pulis did accept that it would allow him to ‘buy a lot more’. New manager Tony Pulis insistshe has experience in sorting out troubled players . James Morrison (above), Victor Anichebe and Chris Brunt were also on the scoresheet for the Baggies . The new manager can, at least, reflect on a first fence successfully cleared in his first match in charge. Yet as peculiar as it may sound, West Brom were pretty dire until the 42nd-minute breakthrough. Eventually they cut the visitors apart with Victor Anichebe, James Morrison and Chris Brunt adding to Berahino’s four. As Pulis recognises, sterner challenges await with Hull City’s visit in the Premier League on Saturday.","West Brom defeated Gateshead 7-0 in the FA Cup third round .

"Tony Pulis refuted suggestions that Saido Berahino is unhappy at West Brom after the forward refused to celebrate any of his four goals in the 7-0 demolition of Gateshead in the FA Cup. The England forward has been repeatedly linked with a move away from The Hawthorns in the January transfer window and speculation only increased on Friday when technical director Terry Burton admitted that the club had halted contract negotiations with Berahino.

West Brom team-mates congratulate Berahino - who did not appear in the mood for celebration . His new manager said: ‘Someone said he didn’t celebrate at all. It was lovely to see all the lads go over when we scored a goal as that showed the unity that we’ll need. You should see him in the dressing room, he’s happy in there.’ Pulis insists that despite reported interest from Liverpool and Tottenham, West Brom are still to receive an offer for the striker: ‘I hope he keeps reading the headlines if he scores four every week. There is always going to be transfer speculation and you can see why. ‘He has great pace, great balance and scores goals. But when I came in here the chairman had not received any offer for him and we will try our damnedest to try and improve him.’ New manager Tony Pulis insists Berahino is content, despite being linked with a January move . James Morrison (above), Victor Anichebe and Chris Brunt were also on the scoresheet for the Baggies . Pulis, for his part, can reflect on a successful first match in charge. Victor Anichebe, Chris Brunt and James Morrison added to Berahino’s four to add some gloss to the scoreline but West Brom made a dire start to the match and took 42 minutes to break through. Pulis admits that he felt compelled to swap the director’s box for the dugout on the quarter-hour mark after his side made a sluggish start to the match. He said: ‘I had no intentions of going down. It took me only 15 minutes! We started very apprehensive and they shouldn’t be like that but they were against West Ham too, especially in the final third. They have to eradicate that and play with confidence and belief.’","West Brom defeated Gateshead 7-0 in the FA Cup third round .

"Tottenham have no plans to bid for Saido Berahino in January. Manager Maurico Pochettino is aware that the West Bromwich Albion is keen on a move away from The Hawthorns but the 21-year-old is not high on Tottenham's list of priorities. Pochettino will listen to offers for Aaron Lennon, Kyle Naughton, Paulinho, Etienne Capoue and Vlad Chiriches and is prepared to bring in players from his academy ahead of what he anticipates will be a relatively quiet transfer window. Tottenham are not planning on making an offer for West Brom's Saido Berahino during the transfer window . West Brom forward Berahino is said to be keen on a move away from The Hawthorns . New Baggies manager Tony Pulis would want in the region of £20million for the England international . Should substantial bids come in for Roberto Soldado, who is wanted on loan by AC Milan, or Emmanuel Adebayor, they could go too but Pochettino will not necessarily turn to Berahino with Burnley's Danny Ings and Southampton's Jay Rodriguez also in his thoughts. West Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis played Berahino in the FA Cup tie against Gateshead and will assess the England U21 international over the next few weeks. He would want around £20million should he decide to sell which would limit the market further for the 21-year-old. Albion's club record £10m signing Brown Ideye could also yet be sold.

Leicester have completed their first signing of the January transfer window with the capture of Chelsea goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. The 42-year-old will move on a free from the Blues - ending his 18 months service at the club. Schwarzer's arrival to the King Power Stadium will be a welcome addition to boss Nigel Pearson as his side fight relegation. Goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer has left Chelsea for Leicester City on a free transfer . Leicester's first-choice goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel (right) is currently out injured with a broken foot . Current first-choice goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel is currently out injured - having suffered a broken metatarsal during a training session in December. The Danish international's sustained stress fracture has seen Ben Hamer play in his absence - with the Foxes having conceded seven goals in five games since. Schwarzer's experience will prove vital to the East Midlands outfit who sit four points adrift from safety at the bottom of the table. The former Australian international's departure from Chelsea also indicates that Petr Cech is likely to remain at Stamford Bridge until the end of the season at least. Cech has been linked with a January move away from west London after losing his place to Thibaut Courtois in goal; but that possibility looks remote as Jose Mourinho's side continue to fight on four fronts for silverware.

"President Barack Obama plans to sign executive orders Monday prohibiting discrimination against gay and transgender workers in the federal government and its contracting agencies, without a new exemption that was requested by some religious organizations. Obama's action comes on the heels of the U.S. Supreme Court's recent ruling in the Hobby Lobby case that allowed some religiously oriented businesses to opt out of the federal health care law's requirement that contraception coverage be provided to workers at no extra charge. Senior administration officials said Friday that ruling has no impact on non-discrimination policies in federal hiring and contracting. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plans publicly. Order: Obama plans to sign an executive order on Monday that prohibits discrimination of LGBT federal employees . Since Obama announced last month that he would sign the orders, he's faced pressure from opposing flanks over the religious exemption and given no indication of where he would come down. Many religious leaders and conservative groups wanted him to exempt religious organizations from the order, while liberal clergy and gay advocacy groups adamantly opposed such an exemption. Until last month, Obama long resisted pressure to pursue an executive order for federal contractors in hopes that Congress would take more sweeping action banning anti-LGBT workplace discrimination nationwide. A bill to accomplish that goal — the Employment Non-Discrimination Act — passed the Senate last year with some Republican support, but has not been taken up by the GOP-controlled House. The senior officials said Obama's action planned for Monday at the White House would amend two executive orders. The first, signed by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965, prohibits federal contractors from discriminating based on race, religion, gender or nationality in hiring. Obama plans to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of protections, and order the Labor Department to carry out the order. The officials said that means the change will probably take effect by early next year. Identity: Obama will also amend a Nixon-era anti-discrimination law to include gender identity as a protected class . President George W. Bush had amended Johnson's order in 2002 to allow religious groups to hire and fire based upon religious identity. Churches also are able to hire ministers as they see fit. The senior administration officials said Obama will not change those exemptions. The second order Obama will amend was signed by President Richard Nixon in 1969 to prevent discrimination against federal workers based on race, religion, gender, nationality, age or disability. President Bill Clinton added sexual orientation, and Obama will include gender identity in a change to immediately take effect. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said: ""With two strokes of a pen, the President will have a very real and immediate impact on the lives of millions of LGBT people across the country."" Religion: The order follows the Hobby Lobby ruling, which allowed businesses to opt out of the federal health care mandate for religious reasons . The administration officials said the change for federal contracting will impact some 24,000 companies with 28 million workers, or one-fifth of the U.S. workforce. Many large federal contractors already have employment policies barring anti-gay workplace discrimination, as do 21 states. However, the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School estimates that the executive order would extend protections to about 14 million workers whose employers or states currently do not have such nondiscrimination policies. While few religious organizations are among the biggest federal contractors, they do provide some valued services, including overseas relief and development programs and re-entry programs for inmates leaving federal prisons.","The order will protect federal workers and employees at companies that contract with the federal government .

"More than 100 black candidates will be on the ballot in statewide and congressional races next month, a post-Reconstruction record that some observers say is a byproduct of President Barack Obama's historic presidency. At least 83 black Republicans and Democrats are running for the U.S. House, an all-time high for the modern era, according to political scientist David Bositis, who has tracked black politicians for years. They include Mia Love in Utah, who is trying to become the first black Republican woman to be elected to Congress. More than 100 black candidates will be on the ballot in statewide and congressional races next month. Pictured: Mia Love, the Republican nominee in Utah's 4th congressional district, smiles after speaking during a rally, in Lehi, Utah . Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. (pictured) speaks at the Conservative Political Action Committee annual conference in National Harbor, Md . Four other black women — Bonnie Watson Coleman in New Jersey, Brenda Lawrence in Michigan, Alma Adams in North Carolina and Stacey Plaskett in the Virgin Islands — are expected to win seats as Democrats, Bositis said. If they all win, and no black female incumbents lose, there should be 20 black women among House members, an all-time high, Bositis said. There are at least 25 African-Americans running for statewide offices, including U.S. senator, governor or lieutenant governor, also a record number. The previous record for black candidates seeking House seats was 72 in 2012, the year Obama, the nation's first black president, was re-elected to a second term. The previous record for statewide contests was 17 in 2002, said Bositis, formerly of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank in Washington that focuses primarily on issues affecting African-Americans. The number is a post-Reconstruction record that some observers say is a byproduct of President Barack Obama's (pictured) historic presidency . Those statewide numbers include Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey and Republican Tim Scott of South Carolina, the U.S. Senate's only black members. Booker is seeking a full term next month, having won a special election last year to replace the deceased Sen. Frank Lautenberg. Scott, appointed last year, is seeking to finish out the two years remaining in the term of former Sen. Jim DeMint, who resigned from the Senate in 2013. An Obama 'coattails effect' is partly responsible for this large candidate pool because it spurred blacks to vote, and encouraged them to pursue offices they might not have sought in the past, said political science professor Fredrick C. Harris, director of Columbia University's Center on African-American Politics and Society. America's blacks voted at a higher rate than other minority groups in 2012 and by most measures surpassed the white turnout for the first time, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. 'It may be that this is a reflection of political opportunity,' Harris said. He noted a similar increase in black candidacies in 1988, when Jesse Jackson made a second, unsuccessful run for the Democratic presidential nomination. Bositis said the increase may also be a result of changing political demographics in regions like the South. 'The fact is that many of the increases are occurring in states (especially in the South) where most whites are withdrawing from Democratic Party politics — leaving black candidates the nominations by default,' Bositis said. Sen. Cory Booker, center, D-N.J., (pictured) along with 3rd Congressional District democratic candidate Aimee Belgard, right, and Freeholder candidates Tom Pullion, left, and Mike Schmidt second right, greets a gathering at a campaign center in Willingboro, N.J . Republicans have been heavily courting minorities, spending millions to woo black voters and to recruit women and minorities to run for state and local office. 'If elected, these candidates will be great representatives for all their constituents and will continue to play a major role in the party's efforts to expand the electorate,' said Republican National Committee spokesman Orlando Brown. While the GOP is building up its numbers, the Democrats have a record number of African-Americans running for statewide and congressional offices, according to Bositis. There are at least 65 Democratic nominees, surpassing the previous high of 59 in 2012. 'The historic number of black Democrats running for office at all levels this year once again confirms that the Democratic Party is a broad coalition of Americans from diverse ethnic and professional backgrounds, focused on expanding opportunity for all and building ladders to the middle class,' said Kiara Pesante, Democratic National Committee spokeswoman.

"A Virginia Republican Party official resigned Wednesday night over a post he made on Facebook questioning Muslims' contributions to the 'fabric' of America. The post was a critique of President Barack Obama's statement that the Muslim holiday Eid-al-Fitr 'reminds us of the many achievements and contributions of Muslim . Americans to building the very fabric of our nation and strengthening . the core of our democracy. ' 'It is one thing to be gracious on religous holidays, but this is . pure nonsense,' Bob FitzSimmonds, the unelected Treasurer of the Republican Party of Virginia, said in a comment accompanying Obama's quote. 'Exactly what part of our nation's fabric was woven by . Muslims? What about Sikhs, Animists, and Jainists?  Should we be . thanking them too?' he asked. Bob FitzSimmonds, Treasurer of the Virginia Republican Party, is resigning his position after inciting outrage among Republicans and Democrats alike last week when he questioned Muslims' contribution to the 'fabric' of America . FitzSimmonds remark was quickly repudiated by Republican activists and elected officials in Virginia, including Delegate David Ramadan, who comes from a Muslim family. 'The fabric of this great nation is built and continues to be woven on a daily basis by every loyal patriot American, whether they are Jews, Muslim, Christians or any religion,' Ramadan said, according to Virginia news website Inside Nova. 'This is the party of Lincoln. This is a party that represents everybody in the community regardless of their religion.' 'Medicine, business, finance, STEM to name but a few contributions to the nation's fabric. They should be recognized for the good works Muslims do,' a Virginia resident said in a comment on FitzSimmond's post two days later. That's not the point, FitzSimmonds replied. 'Modern day Muslims are integral and important members of our society, but that is not really pertinent to my previous comment. 'Muslims were not around in the 1700's to ""build the very fabric of our nation"" as asserted by the President,' FitzSimmonds aruged. 'If he had opined that Christians ""built the very fabric of Afghanistan or China"" I would have been equally dismissive.' Later that day, The Washington Post, which first brought the Republican Party official's controversial statement to light, claimed that two party officials said FitzSimmonds had resigned from his voluntary position with the party. 'This is news to . me,' FitzSimmonds said on Facebook. 'Seems like I ought to know about this if it had happened.' 'I have no plans to resign now or in the future,' FitzSimmonds told a writer for conservative Virginia blog, The Bull Elephant. This is the third time in the the last two years FitzSimmonds has publicly come under scrutiny for comments he made on Facebook. Two weeks after President Barack Obama won reelection in 2012 the Republican said: 'When Obama is 90 years old and he dies and goes to Hell, he is going to say ""This is all Bush's fault"" ' 'My Facebook post was not about Obama going to Hell. It was about his obsession with blame shifting and I don't really see anything inappropriate about it,' FitzSimmonds said in an e-mail to the Virginian-Pilot at the time. Earlier this year FitzSimmonds accidentally called a female representative from the state a t**t. After someone said said on Facebook that the women should vote for Barbara Comstock, a Republican Delegate who is running for Congress in Northern Virginia, FitzSimmonds wrote: 'I have nothing against Barbara Comstock, but I hate sexist t**t.' Soon after he deleted the comment, and posted apology. In yet another email to the Virginian-Pilot explaining himself, FitzSimmonds said he meant to say 'twaddle.' 'Also to be clear, my post was not about Barbara . Comstock.  It was relating to the sexist stereotypes being used by the . woman posting,' he said. FitzSimmonds said in his resignation letter he was not sorry for what he said because it was 'historically accurate' FitzSimmonds, who is also a deputy chief deputy clerk of a county court in Virginia, tried to do damage control on his recent statements on Tuesday by meeting with the Muslim Association of Virginia, but the one on one did not have the intended effect. 'On this subject matter, we all have different opinions and in his mind, [FitzSimmonds] didn’t think [what he wrote] was offensive, and of course it was offensive to us, and not only to us but also to people throughout the state of Virginia,' association member Rafiuddin Ahmed, told Inside Nova. 'Even elected officials thought it was offensive.' Ahmed told Inside Nova that the Muslim association wants FitzSimmonds to resign from his $82,000 a year job with the Virginia government because they are concerned he is unable to act impartially. 'A lot of people are concerned because … they are part of jury selection,' Ahmed said. 'So if someone is in a position where they are in court, they are worried about whether they will truly get a jury of their peers. FitzSimmonds has not quit his day job yet, but he succumbed to pressure to on Wednesday night to step down from his position in Republican Party leadership. In a letter to members of the GOP's state central committee, FitzSimmonds said that were his comment 'not causing grief for others, I would not mind.' But because it is causing problems for the state party, FitzSimmonds said he would resign as soon as the committee votes on a successor. 'It seems that no matter how careful I . might be, I will periodically give occasion for others to portray the . party in a bad light, so long as I am a party official,' he wrote. 'After discussion . with several party leaders it seems clear that I will either need to . stop posting on social media or step down from my party office.' Fitzsimmonds chose the latter, saying he was not 'constitutionally suited to sit quietly on the sidelines.' He apologized in the letter for bringing unwanted attention to the RPV, but refused to retract his offending statement. 'It is historically accurate, was a valid criticism of the President’s revisionist history, and not a statement on Muslim involvement in modern day America,' he said. Young Republican Federation of Virginia Chair John Scott, one of the Virginia leaders calling for FitzSimmonds to resign,' told MailOnline in an email this afternoon he was 'pleased' to hear about the outgoing Treasurer's decision to vacate his position. 'I look forward to putting . these repeated distractions behind us and refocusing on what we should . be working towards--electing Republicans,' he said.","The comment was in response to a statement by President Obama on the 'contributions of Muslim .
Americans to building the very fabric of our nation'
'Exactly what part of our nation's fabric was woven by .
Muslims?' asked Bob FitzSimmonds, Treasurer of the Republican Party of Virginia, on Facebook .
He later explained: 'Muslims were not around in the 1700's to ""build the very fabric of our nation"" as asserted by the President'
After saying he wouldn't leave his voluntary position with the party, FitzSimmonds succumbed last night to calls for his resignation ."
"Hillary Clinton already has a running mate for 2016 in mind, according to several news sources. Clinton is reportedly eying Incoming Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro for the role of vice president should she run again and is keeping the former San Antonio, Texas, mayor and his twin brother, Rep. Joaquin Castro, 'very close' just in case, says the Washington Post. 'Clearly, if you were putting together a list of five people in the country who could potentially be a contributing running mate, you would have to put Julian Castro on that list,' Henry Cisneros, former HUD Secretary for Bill Clinton, told WaPo. This photo of Hillary Clinton and Julian Castro, taken at an event in Los Angeles last year, appeared on Castro's old facebook page, which has since been shut down to make way for his new Housing and Urban Development Secretary page. Clinton is reportedly grooming Castro to join her 2016 presidential campaign as her number two . 'A lot of people have mentioned the Clinton-Castro ticket, which I think would be very attractive,' Democratic strategist Maria Cardona told Real Clear Politics last year. The rising Democratic star has long been considered a potential running mate for Clinton or another Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, but until recently he didn't have the kind of national profile and experience that is generally associated with the nation's second in command. That all changed when President Barack Obama nominated him as HUD secretary in May, a position he was confirmed for last month. At 39, Castro is now the youngest member of Obama's Cabinet. Castro was previously approached by the president to serve as transportation secretary but passed, against the advice of his mentor. 'I advised that he accept a position for President Obama,' Cisernos, a former San Antionio Mayor himself, told the New York Times in April. 'I thought that if he was going to be vice-presidential material in 2016, then he needed to be more than mayor at that time.' The second time around, the Hispanic politician accepted the opportunity to serve the president, a nod toward his own aspirations to become Commander in Chief. Castro is pictured here last month speaking to employees at the Department of Housing and Urban Development after being sworn in as President Barack Obama's newest cabinet member . A graduate of Stanford and Harvard Law, Castro returned home and became the youngest person to serve on San Antonio City Council before winning three terms as mayor of San Antonio. He resigned that position at the end of last month to join the Obama administration. In 2012 Castro became the first Latino to give a Democratic National Convention keynote address, rocketing him to national prominence. The relatively young leader has his first memoir coming out in 2015 - an important item on the presidential checklist. In a viral video produced for a 2012 gridiron dinner, Castro mocks his well-known presidential aspirations, asking his iPhone: 'Should I run for higher office?' 'Ay, mijo, of course you should,' Siri responds. 'Your momma would slap you with her chanclas for asking such a question.' A smiling Castro tell his phone: 'Thank you, Siri, it's been a delightful conversation.' 'You're welcome, Mr. Presidente,' she replies. The humor of the faux phone conversation is not just in Castro's transparent political ambitions. It's the fact that the politician of Latino descent doesn't speak Spanish. Still, he's seen as the left's answer to two influential Hispanic Republicans - fellow Texas politician Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, both of whom are mulling 2016 presidential runs. If either lawmaker wins the Republican Party's nomination or earns a spot on the presidential ticket and Clinton is the Democratic nominee, Castro is considered the likely choice to join the Hillary 2016 campaign. And, as the Post and others point out, the Clintons and Castro have an increasingly cozy relationship. In the last month Castro has appeared at an event in New York with Hillary Clinton and visited her home in Washington, D.C. for dinner. Sources present at the gathering told the Post that Castro and Clinton didn't have 'the talk' at dinner and instead discussed his new job. But it's likely that such a discussion will take place in the future if Clinton throws her hat into the ring in 2016. Asked by ABC News' Robin Roberts in May about Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren - another potential running mate - and Castro, Clinton talked both Democratic politicians up. They’re both extraordinary leaders and great political advocates for a lot of what needs to be done in our country, and I admire both of them greatly,' she said.For Castro, at least, the feeling is mutual. The former San Antonio mayor told Real Clear Politics last August that he would support Clinton if she ran for president again. 'I believe she should and that if she does, she’ll win,' he said. 'She’s had an amazing career, understands policy backwards and forwards, and in 2008, I was extremely impressed by her grasp of policy. I believe that she would offer very strong and steady leadership for the United States.'","Clinton is said to be keeping the new Housing and Urban Development Secretary 'very close'

"It's a Sunday evening TV treat that has warmed the cockles of the nation's heart but for the young stars of Call the Midwife, their spell in the limelight is an all too brief experience. The makers of the BBC smash hit show have revealed that the newborn babies who appear on the show have a career that lasts just three days because of the corporation's extensive health and safety rules. According to lead writer, Heidi Thomas, babies used on screen have to be less than 10 days old because older children don't have the 'scrunched-up' look of a newborn. Scroll down for video . Brief career: Babies, including this boy pictured in the arms of Miranda Hart (Chummy Noakes), have to be less than 10 days old to appear on the show . But thanks to the BBC's ponderous health and safety system, the first week of each tiny star's life is taken up with form filling - leaving programme makers with a window of just three days to capture the newborn look before it fades. 'We have someone who books the ladies while they're still pregnant because once the babies have got past 10 days old, they lose that scrunched-up look,' Thomas revealed in an interview with the Radio Times. Although the babies are 'booked' before they even make it into the world, the extensive paperwork can occasionally take so long, producers are forced to disguise older children with swathes of blankets. Luckily for the makers of the hit show, there's no shortage of new babies looking for a share of the applause. Three older babies pose with Call the Midwife stars, Jessica Raine, Helen George and Bryony Hannah . Realistic: Tiny newborns such as this child have to be used so birth scenes look  authentic . According to Thomas, the show has become so popular, expectant mothers routinely volunteer their offspring. Unlike the rest of the cast, however, the young stars don't have to sit through hours in the make-up chair. 'In episode four of the new series, we have a baby born with spinal bifida [a nervous disease that affects the vertebrae] so we used CGI to paint a lesion, a flesh wound on its back. 'You can't submit a newborn baby to complicated make-up jobs so it really does make our lives easier.'

"A local New York paper has come under fire for publishing an opinion piece about President Barack Obama that carries the headline 'The N----r in the White House'. Incredibly, the WestView News - a community paper that serves Manhattan's West Village - ran the contemptuous term in full. The headline was printed on page 15 in the latest edition of the periodical.

'If you were quoting something or referring to the historic context of the word being used, I can understand the justification.' 'It seems he’s just using it for shock value.'

"A beautician who glassed another woman in a Belfast nightclub, leaving her victim scarred for life, has been jailed for 15 months. Natasha Quinn, 21, was out with work colleagues at the popular Belfast's El Divino nightclub on June 30 last year when she was attacked by Alexandria McNairn, also 21. Bouncers separated the two women who had been pulling each other’s hair. Before and after pictures taken on the night that Natasha Quinn was attacked by Alexandria McNairn: McNairn was jailed after pleading guilty to unlawful and malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm . As McNairn was led away, the security . noticed that Miss Quinn had been glassed. Police were called and Miss . Quinn said that she had been kicked on the back of her legs by McNairn. Prosecution barrister Kay McKay said: ‘When she turned round, McNairn grabbed her by the throat. 'She received a number of blows to her face and then she felt liquid running into her eyes, which was, in fact, blood. ¿This incident has left me scarred for life': The wound to Miss Quinn's forehead needed 18 stitches and she will eventually need cosmetic surgery . ‘The . blows to her face caused a long and deep laceration to her forehead and . onto her eyebrow which needed more than a dozen external sutures along . with a number of internal stitches.' McNairn . was arrested but denied the attack. She claimed that someone had pushed . her and she had a glass which broke on impact on Miss Quinn's face. But . at Belfast Crown Court last month she pleaded guilty to unlawful and . malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Miss McKay added: ‘Miss Quinn does have a noticeable scar on her forehead which will require cosmetic surgery. ‘This unprovoked attack has had quite a lasting effect on Miss Quinn as recorded in her victim impact statement.' A . defence barrister said McNairn was now ‘deeply remorseful and accepts . her culpability and full responsibility for her actions'. Judge . Gordon Kerr, QC had said in a pre-sentence report that he would pass a . community order on McNairn. But passing sentence he told her: . ‘Frankly, that is not possible in this case. ‘You . attacked Miss Quinn in El Divino's with a glass to her face which has . left her scarred for life and which will require cosmetic surgery.' ‘Taking . all matters into consideration, I have decided you must serve a period . in custody and accordingly I sentence you to 30 months of which 15 . months will be served in custody and the remainder on licence.' McNairn showed no emotion in the dock as sentenced was passed. 'You must serve a period in custody': Alexandra McNairn showed no emotion in the dock at Belfast Crown Court as she was sentenced to 15 months in prison and a further 15 months on licence for the attack . After McNairn's guilty plea, Miss Quinn released a picture of herself covered in blood after the incident, and another taken earlier of her dressed smartly for her night out. 'Promised myself I'd put this picture up when this was all over,' she wrote on Facebook. Outside court, Miss Quinn said she was ‘delighted’ that McNairn had been jailed for the attack. ‘These past 10 months of my life have just been a terrible nightmare. I am just so relieved it is now over,’ she said. ‘I don't know why she did it. She could have done it out of jealousy but I just don't know why. It was totally unprovoked. ‘The . first I knew of anything was when she kicked me in the back of the leg. I turned round and she was just standing in front of me staring . straight at me. ‘I just looked at her and then she just grabbed me by the throat.

"Hearts remain unbeaten at the top of the Scottish Championship after earning a 1-1 draw against Edinburgh rivals Hibernian. The Jambos' impressive league record appeared to be in danger when Jason Cummings fired the visitors into the lead midway through the first half. But his ninth goal of the season was cancelled out in style by Jamie Walker who grabbed a superb equaliser to ensure the derby clash ended all square. Jamie Walker wheels away in celebration after scoring the equaliser for Hearts against Hibernian . Walker is congratulated by his team-mates after his ninth goal of the season ensured Hearts nicked a draw . The outcome at Tynecastle means Hearts have still not lost a league match this season after 19 games. Unsurprisingly, Hibs named an unchanged side following their emphatic 4-0 win over Rangers, with Martin Boyle on the bench after joining on loan from Dundee. Hearts made two changes from the side who defeated Livingston, with Miguel Pallardo and Walker both drafted into the starting line-up. The visitors almost snatched the opener within seconds of kick-off amid a raucous atmosphere inside the Gorgie ground. A poor ball from Alim Ozturk was pounced on by Cummings but his 20-yard shot was straight at Neil Alexander and comfortably blocked by the Hearts goalkeeper. Their unbeaten record was under threat in the Edinburgh derby, until Walker scored just before half-time . Hibernian's Jason Cummings celebrates after putting the visitors one in front in the first half . Hibs were threatening again when they were handed a free-kick after Scott Allan was fouled by Morgaro Gomis. Liam Craig's low effort took an awkward deflection but Alexander did well to get down and smother. Hearts were not too far away when Walker picked out Danny Wilson from a corner and the skipper nodded just wide of the upright. But it was Hibs who sparked wild celebrations among the travelling support when they surged into the lead in the 24th minute. A lovely cross from Allan from the right picked out Cummings at the back post and he slotted home his third goal in as many games. Cummings then almost helped himself to another moments later, collecting unmarked from Lewis Stevenson only to nod just past the post. Walker (right), scorer of Hearts equaliser, challenges the Hibernian goalkeeper Mark Oxley . James Keatings (right) and Scott Robertson battle for the ball at Tynecastle on Saturday afternoon . Hearts tried to haul themselves back into the game but Walker succeeded only in smashing his shot into the side-netting. However, he was celebrating five minutes before half-time thanks to a fantastic ferocious strike from 25 yards into the top corner that left goalkeeper Mark Oxley with no chance. Buoyed by the leveller, the home side could have edged in front shortly after the restart but Adam Eckersley failed to keep his close-range header on target. Hibs fans then screamed for a penalty when Danny Handling went to ground under pressure from Pallardo but there was no spot-kick award from referee Steven McLean. Moments later, it was Hearts' turn to appeal, with Gomis and Walker both hitting the turf in quick succession but, again, the match official declined to point to the spot. Boyle was thrown into the action for his debut with seven minutes to go but it was fellow sub Callum Booth who was denied a late winner when his volley was cleared off the line by Callum Paterson.","Jason Cummings fired Hibernian into the lead in the first half .

"The NHS official in charge of the controversial plan to centralise patient records claimed £46,000 of taxpayers’ money in expenses for hotel bills and fine dining, it was revealed last night. Tim Kelsey – whose salary as national director for patients and information was £180,000 in 2013 – was responsible for the highest expenses bill of nine top NHS officials, who claimed nearly £200,000 last year. Taxpayers paid for taxi fares and five-star hotels. A further £32,000 was claimed by Sir David Nicholson, who was dubbed ‘the man with no shame’ following the Mid Staffordshire scandal. Tim Kelsey, who claimed £46,000 in expenses for hotel bills, it has been revealed . Staff have now been banned from first-class travel and told to ‘think like a patient and act like a taxpayer’ by Simon Stevens, the new head of the Health Service, in a clampdown on expenses. A total of £195,802 was spent by just nine board members of NHS England on travel and hotels from 2013-14 – the first year of the organisation’s existence – according to figures released to the Daily Telegraph under the Freedom of Information Act. Sir David Nicholson, former chief executive of NHS England, who claimed £32,000 in expenses . The central NHS body was set up to cut bureaucracy in a reorganisation by ministers and led by Sir David, who was criticised after the Mid-Staffordshire scandal for his use of first-class travel. Mr Kelsey’s £46,000 expenses bill included more than £21,000 on hotels with some expenses totalling £370 a night. He spent almost £7,000 on air fares. The NHS’s chief nursing officer, Jane Cummings, spent more than £27,000 over the year, including £8,000 on hotels. A further £23,000 was spent by Bill McCarthy, the former national director for policy, including £491 for four nights at a hotel in Berkshire. He recently resigned. An NHS England spokesman said: ‘In his first address to staff Simon Stevens set the goal of “thinking like a patient, and acting like a taxpayer”.

Ms McDonald took part in the photo shoot after undergoing three laser surgeries on her face following the savage attack in September 2013 . The model, who was out with six friends, suffered a fractured skull and was drenched in blood. She was also left with a six-inch scar on her face which she thought could end her career. But now, after undergoing laser surgery, she has taken part in her first full photo shoot for 11 months. Ms McDonald, from Anniesland in Glasgow, told the MailOnline: 'I went through a huge whirlwind. I was emotional, angry and disgusted by what had happened. 'I have had three laser surgeries on my face now. They're incredibly painful but they reduce the scarring and and redness on my face. 'Also in the first operation, they stitched up glass in my face and so I had to go back and have another operation three weeks later.'

'I came back from the VIP area and remember my hair being pulled and then felt contact to my face and then I put my hand on my face and was covered in blood and fell to the floor. 'I remember people were looking at me with their mouths open.' And she said the appalling ordeal had changed her as a person. 'I used to be the party girl and go out all the time. After what happened, I thought ""what's the point of making an effort?"" 'I was also frightened of going out and leaving the house.

"Jamie Walker insists Hearts are taking nothing for granted in the title race despite stretching their unbeaten run in the Scottish Championship to 19 games. The midfielder grabbed a superb equaliser to secure a point for the league-leaders against Edinburgh rivals Hibernian at Tynecastle on Saturday. The result means the Jambos are still the only senior side in Britain who have not lost a league game so far this term. Jamie Walker watches his strike fly in to cancel out Jason Cummings' 24th minute effort . They also boast a 13-point advantage over nearest rivals Rangers but Walker warned the league is not won yet. He said: 'No-one at this club will start celebrating anything until it is mathematically impossible for us to be caught in the league. 'There is still an awful lot to play for in the remaining weeks of the season. 'No-one here is thinking that things are done and dusted. 'If Rangers were to beat us in a couple of weeks at Ibrox, it would make things tighter and the boys will just keep focused. 'To be fair, everyone has been focused. As you saw against Hibs, it was not our best performance of the season. 'But everyone dug in and we managed to get out of it with a draw.' Jason Cummings fired Hibs into a deserved lead in the 24th minute. But hopes of ending Hearts' unbeaten run were shattered thanks to Walker's terrific leveller five minutes before the break. He said: 'That is probably the best goal I have ever scored and I'm just delighted that it brought the boys a point. Walker celebrates his goal which extended Hearts' unbeaten run to 19 games as they hunt for promotion . 'I think we have shown a good ability as a squad throughout this season to dig out results. 'Hibs played well, but we managed to stick in there because we did not want to be losing our unbeaten run. 'We don't want to lose it at all, but especially not here at home against Hibs. 'The boys deserve a lot of credit for being able to do that.' Hibs midfielder Scott Allan admits there is little chance of catching their city rivals, with 19 points now separating the sides. But he still has every faith in the Easter Road side's ability to win promotion back to the top-flight via the play-offs. He said: 'This game was a real chance for us to set a marker down but we couldn't and it's going to be hard to catch them now. 'We just need to get back to winning ways next week and take it from there. 'The aim is to get back up to the Premiership and we believe ourselves we're capable of doing that. 'If we get to the play-offs I'd fancy us against anybody over two legs.'","Jamie Walker scored equaliser to extend Hearts' record .

"A double century from Kumar Sangakkara helped Sri Lanka finish day two of the second Test against New Zealand in the ascendancy. Fresh from becoming only the fifth batsman - and first Sri Lankan - to pass 12,000 Test runs on Saturday's opening day, Sangakkara made the Black Caps bowlers toil in Sunday's action at the Basin Reserve in Wellington. The stylish number three scored his 11th Test double century to help the tourists to a first-innings total of 356 all out to lead by 135 runs - an impressive feat considering they started the day in the perilous position of 78 for five. Kumar Sangakkara celebrates after being dismissed for 203, the 11th double century of his career . Sangakkara's innings, guiding the tail from the number three spot, put the tourists in the driving side . New Zealand reached the close on 22 without loss in response to trail the tourists by 113 runs. The Black Caps bowlers sought to snare the five remaining wickets when play resumed on Sunday morning but Sangakkara and Dinesh Chandimal had other ideas and set about getting Sri Lanka as close to New Zealand's first-innings effort of 221 as possible. Seamers Trent Boult, Tim Southee and then Doug Bracewell - so impressive on the opening day - had little joy as Sangakkara and Chandimal played flawlessly to steer Sri Lanka to 159 at lunch, with Sangakkara registering his half-century in the process. Ross Taylor congratulates Sangakkara after his magnificent effort, which took Sri Lanka into the lead . Dinesh Chandimal hit an important 67 as he and Sangakkara frustrated the bowlers on day two . New Zealand had only an opportunistic lbw shout from off-spinner Mark Craig to show for their morning efforts and it did not get any better for the hosts after the interval as Chandimal joined his batting partner in notching a fifty. Chandimal then passed 1,000 Test runs before his and Sangakkara's sixth-wicket partnership ended on 130 runs when Jimmy Neesham tempted him to drive at a full, swinging delivery and he succeeded only in edging behind. Sangakkara cut Craig to bring up his 38th Test century moments later and useful stands with Dhammika Prasad, Rangana Herath and Suranga Lakmal saw Sri Lanka pass the New Zealand total and then build a decent lead. Trent Boult, who had so much success on day one, endured a difficult day with Sangakkara in form . Sangakkara blazed a peach of a cover drive off Neesham after tea to bring up his 11th Test double century - he needs one more to equal Sir Donald Bradman's world record of 12 - before falling on 203 to a stunning Boult catch at backward point to give Neesham his third wicket of the innings. Throwing caution to the wind, Lakmal danced down the wicket to slog the very next delivery, from Craig, but got it horribly wrong and was stumped by BJ Watling, who ended the innings with five victims. New Zealand openers Tom Latham and Hamish Rutherford saw out the remaining 11 overs without incident.","Kumar Sangakkara scores 203, bats Sri Lanka into strong position .

"Australian fast bowler Mitchell Johnson is doubtful for the fourth and final test against India next week after a hamstring problem forced him out of training on Saturday. The 33-year-old reigning ICC Cricketer of the Year's decision to sit out Saturday's session is thought to be precautionary, with an eye on the World Cup starting in Australia next month.

"Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale has called for reform of the domestic Twenty20 competition to prevent English cricket being 'left behind'. The 18 first-class counties contest the NatWest T20 Blast - albeit with 2014 champions Warwickshire rebranded as Birmingham Bears - with group games played mostly on Friday evenings from mid-May to late July and this year's finals day taking place on August 29. Gale favours a shorter, smaller competition between city-based franchises, along the lines of the Indian Premier League or Australia's Big Bash League. Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale wants English Twenty20 cricket to undergo reform . He wrote on Twitter: 'How good is the big bash, we have to do something with our comp otherwise we'll get left behind. Gotta inspire the kids. 'Franchise system would work in England. 10 cities, over 3 week period, straight after IPL. Worlds best players, bigger crowds.' That would effectively mean his Yorkshire team in their current form ceasing to compete in Twenty20 cricket, an unpalatable move to many - but Gale still had one more left-field suggestion up his sleeve. 'Be good if 2 big bash teams played in our comp and 2 English teams played in their comp,' he wrote.

"Australia have ruled paceman Mitchell Johnson out of their plans for the fourth Test against India. Johnson is struggling with a hamstring problem and is effectively being rested by Australia, who carry a 2-0 winning lead into the final match of the series. With one-day matches against England and India to come, followed by the World Cup, Australia are determined to protect the 33-year-old Johnson to ensure he is available for the key matches that lie ahead. Australia's destructive paceman Mitchell Johnson has been ruled out of the fourth Test against India . Australia have already won the series 2-0, with the third drawn, and don't want to risk Johnson . Australia head coach Darren Lehmann said in a statement from Cricket Australia: 'Mitchell is an important part of our plans for the remainder of our summer and we want him 100 per cent right so won't be taking any risks with him. We believe it is best for Mitchell to take this opportunity to freshen up and get his body fully fit ahead of the Tri Series.' The fourth Test takes place in Sydney from 10.30am on Tuesday . Australia physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said: 'Mitchell had some right hamstring soreness during the Boxing Day Test and we have been closely monitoring his recovery since that match but feel he has not fully recovered. Johnson has an on-pitch encounter with India's new Test captain Virat Kohli in Melbourne . 'As such, he will not play in the upcoming Sydney Test match. 'We expect him to recover in time to play a part in the upcoming Tri Series against England and India.' Meanwhile, Australia captain Michael Clarke remains hopeful of playing in next month's World Cup after revealing he is ahead of schedule in his recovery from injury. A hamstring injury forced Clarke out of the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Test series against India after the opening game in Adelaide in mid-December, allowing Steve Smith to lead the team to a series win with one left to play. The 33-year-old Clarke had initially revealed fears of never playing again, but is now well into the rehabilitation process following surgery, with Australia set to open their World Cup campaign against England on February 14. Injured Australian skipper Michael Clarke speaks with (from left) Mitchell Marsh and Mitchell Stark . Clarke, out of the India series with a hamstring injury, has been commentating for Channel Nine . In his column for Australia's Daily Telegraph, Clarke wrote: 'I'm a week ahead of schedule in my rehab from hamstring surgery. I've already completed three running sessions and am back riding the bike. 'I'm still looking at being fit by the early stages of the World Cup but I'll ultimately be guided by our medical team.' Clarke has also been enjoying the commentary box vantage point for the series, as Australia drew the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne to clinch the series ahead of this week's final game in Sydney. Arguably the biggest fallout from the third Test was the retirement of Clarke's India counterpart Mahendra Singh Dhoni from the five-day game. Clarke applauds Shaun Marsh after the Australia batsman was run out on 99 in the third Test . Clarke on media duties during the drawn third Test against India that clinched the series against India . Clarke paid tribute to the Ranchi-born wicketkeeper batsman, saying: 'I can't imagine there would be many jobs in international sport tougher than being the captain of India's cricket team. 'I doubt many have dealt with the expectation, scrutiny, pressure and extreme adoration better than MS Dhoni. 'How Dhoni has managed to hold down the captaincy while playing all three forms of the game and wicketkeeping is beyond me. He's done a wonderful job and I think the hole he has left in the Test team will be hard to fill.'

"Saracens stepped up their efforts in the fight against concussion on Saturday by wiring their players with ear devices that monitor head collisions. They are the first Premiership club to use the units, which have the same sensors that detect movements in smartphones. Owen Farrell had the technology taped behind his right ear during this victory over London Irish and was among a number of players to be included in the tests that have also been carried out in training sessions. Saracens' David Strettle breaks clear to score his second try against London Irish . Strettle is mobbed by his team-mates after increasing Saracens' lead at Allianz Park . An ear device taped behind the ear of Owen Farrell and other Sarries players measures head collisions . Sarries are the first Premiership club to use the units, which use the same sensors as smartphones . They have already been used in NFL helmets and rugby gumshields, with an experiment in New Zealand recording an impact of 126 G-Force. Impacts in the game are increasing and that is directly linked to the occurrence of concussion. Saracens No 8 Billy Vunipola was back to his best against Irish, with coach Mark McCall praising the way he has responded since being dropped by England at the end of the autumn internationals. ‘It’s a huge setback to be starting No 8 in the Six Nations and then not even go into camp for the last couple of weeks,’ said McCall. ‘It’s a hell of a blow for a young fella and you have to judge him by how he has reacted and how he has responded. Owen Farrell kicks one of four successful penalties as Saracens secured a 22-6 victory . Shane Geraghty of London Irish (centre) is tackled by Nick Tompkins (left) and Farrell . ‘He has been close to being man of the match five games in a row now. He was really good out there and it’s good for us and good for everyone.’ The Exiles are one of just two sides to win a Premiership match at Allianz Park but there was no repeat of their stunning victory here last February. In fact it was Farrell who kicked his side ahead with two penalties inside the opening half an hour, before Saracens began to assert their dominance in the scrum. Hooker Jamie George was particularly impressive in the front row, with the 24-year-old doing no harm to his chances of a Six Nations call up. Saracens' Billy Vunipola (right) breaks forward with the ball during his side's comfortable win on Saturday . Vunipola sucked in defenders with a pick and carry from the base, before the ball went through the hands for winger David Strettle to dive over and put his side 11-0 up at the break. But Exiles full-back Tom Homer found his range with two penalties early in the second half, yet Farrell quickly responded with two more kicks of his own and the hosts put the result beyond doubt with their second try just after the hour mark. Neil de Kock and Chris Wyles combined with some neat interplay, which sparked a move that was again finished by Strettle. ‘It was difficult in the first half,’ said McCall. ‘It was wet and we were playing into a fairly strong wind and I thought we did a pretty good job in the first half. With 20 minutes to go, we got ourselves into a pretty strong position where we should try to kick on and probably get a few more tries but we didn’t manage that. ‘We lacked a bit of composure in their 22. We were down there often enough but we weren’t good enough to get another few tries. That has been an issue for us.’ London Irish boss Brian Smith shared McCall’s view of Vunipola, however, after watching him punch holes in his side’s defence. ‘Billy Vunipola is absolutely world class and he’s a handful,’ said Smith. ‘I thought we made a fair effort to contain him today but he’s very, very dynamic. He’s a monster. He got in behind us a couple of times and caused us a lot of trouble.’","David Strettle scored two tries for Saracens at Allianz Park .

"Gloucester ruined Exeter’s centenary celebrations as they edged their West Country rivals at Sandy Park. It was the 100th game in the Premiership for the Devon club against the side who they defeated on their first game in rugby’s top flight back in 2010. The usually reliable boot of Gareth Steenson was most culpable. The Chiefs fly-half gifted the visitors a crucial try when Exeter were on top in the second half. The Ulsterman’s misjudged kick from his own line was charged down by Tom Savage. It came two minutes after Chiefs had snatched the initiative with two tries in two minutes by wingers Jack Nowell and Matt Jess. Gareth Steenson's usually reliable boot let him down on Saturday as Exeter lost to Gloucester by one point . Steenson also failed with a vital conversion after Thomas Waldrom had crashed over with nine minutes left. His kick would have given the Chiefs a one-point lead late on, but his attempt came back off the left post. Exeter were the better team in the first half, but were unable to convert pressure into points. Two penalties from Greig Laidlaw were the only scores of a lacklustre half. What was a fluctuating game fortunately sparked up in the second half. First England centre Billy Twelvetrees stroked home a superb drop kick from 45 metres to put Gloucester 9-0 ahead. Gloucester's Darren Dawiduik attempts to bust through the tackle of Exeter's Moray Low and Jack Yeandle . Then, Nowell gave England team-mate Ben Morgan the slip in the 49th minute to score the first try of the game, which was quickly followed by a 80-metre dash from Jess to the line after he gobbled up a wayward pass from Twelvetrees. Steenson converted both tries to put Chiefs 14-9 ahead. But after Steenson’s error let in Savage, Laidlaw converted to give Gloucester a narrow lead. Steenson and Laidlaw exchanged penalties before Ben Morgan crashed over to gain breathing space. Chiefs' Jack Nowell makes the break that leads to his try but Gloucester held on for victory . Waldrom’s try looked to have given Exeter the final say, but Steenson’s conversion effort was marginally off target and Gloucester held on. Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys was delighted with his side’s efforts. ‘Today was all about the result,’ he said. ‘I thought we showed a huge amount of character and spirit.’ Chiefs head coach Rob Baxter bemoaned his side’s errors as they lost for only the second time at home this season. ‘What’s hurt us is the fact we didn’t convert some of the opportunities.

"A few Sundays ago during a game against the Dallas Cowboys, New York Giants rookie wide receiver Odell Beckham Jnr made the catch seen round the world, breaking the Internet in a way that has only recently been eclipsed by the sight of Kim Kardashian's bare bottom. OBJ has backed up that outstanding play with two great games in a row for the G-Men and is on pace to go over 1,000 yards and catch more than 75 passes despite missing all of September because of an injury. He’s had at least six catches and 90 receiving yards in six straight games and has scored six touchdowns thus far. The Giants are trying to get the ball in the 22-year-old’s hands as much as possible and have handed off to him in three straight games and even had Beckham Jnr uncork a deep bomb to fellow wide receiver Rueben Randle during a trick play against the Titans on Sunday. Odell Beckham Jnr announced himself to the world with this astonishing catch against the Dallas Cowboys . Beckham Jnr celebrates after scoring a touchdown against the Titans. He has six to his name this season . In a twist that shouldn’t be that surprising, it turns out the talented rookie isn’t just skilled at the American brand of football. OBJ might not exactly be David Beckham, but he may have a career in the MLS to fall back on if things in the NFL don’t work out. A senior college football columnist wrote this about Beckham Jnr in January.before the NFL draft: . 'Beckham is a fantastic athlete. You're talking about a guy who is really explosive; could've been an elite soccer player, can throw the ball very well with either hand; has excellent return skills and some of the best hands in the draft. The coaches I know at LSU say he could've played any position in their secondary and been a star there too.' Anyone who has seen the catch Beckham made against the Cowboys would likely agree that the hands comment is perfectly accurate, but saying Beckham Jnr could have been ‘elite’ at soccer/football sounds like hyperbole right? Maybe not. Beckham Jnr warms up alongside Giants coach Tom Coughlin in Nashville . During the World Cup over the summer, Beckham Jnr said: ‘My coach actually tried to get me on the national team when I was like 13 or 14. But to do the soccer thing, you really have to go overseas and stuff like that, and it was a decision at a young age that I really didn’t want to leave my family.’ ‘It was kind of one of those things that I had to let it go even though I still think about it to this day. Soccer is my first love. I haven't done it in a while, but any chance I get to put a soccer ball by my feet, I'll definitely mess around with it.’ That appears to be true... He may be able to bend it like Beckham, but the former England captain isn’t OBJ’s favourite player. He said: 'I really like Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo (who plays for Portugal’s national team), just respect greatness. Him and (Lionel) Messi from Barcelona (and Argentina).' If he switches his brand of professional football immediately, Beckham Jnr might have the chance to take on Messi or Ronaldo during the next World Cup in 2018 as a member of the US team. As he proved with his one-handed grab against Dallas, anything is possible.","At No 12 overall, Odell Beckham Jnr was the third wideout selected in the 2014 NFL draft .

"Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall heaped praise on Billy Vunipola after his man-of-the-match display in the 22-6 victory over London Irish at Allianz Park. Vunipola's England career hit a slump during the autumn internationals when the 22-year-old was dropped by Stuart Lancaster midway through the November schedule, having started in the defeats to New Zealand and South Africa. The Saracens number eight was left out of the match squads for the victories over Samoa and Australia, with his replacement Ben Morgan subsequently named England's player of the series. No 8 Billy Vunipola hit form for Saracens on Saturday in their 22-6 win over London Irish . Vunipola, 22, attempts to evade Irish's Kieran Low during his man-of-the-match display . Vunipola, however, has bounced back from recent Test disappointments with a string of powerful displays for his club side. 'He was great today,' said McCall, after Saturday's home win. 'What's impressive is you get a huge setback like he got. From being the starting No 8 in the Six Nations to not even going into the (England) camp for the last couple of weeks (of the autumn internationals). It's a hell of a blow for a young fella. Sarries director of rugby Mark McCall paid tribute to the way Vunipola has handled his England setback . 'You can only judge him by how he's reacted and how he's responded. That's five games in a row when he's been there or thereabouts in terms of getting close to man of the match. 'He was really good out there today. It's good for us and it's good for him that he's back in top form.' London Irish boss Brian Smith shared McCall's view after watching Vunipola punch holes in his Exiles defence throughout the contest in north London. 'Billy Vunipola is absolutely world class and he's a handful,' Smith said. 'I thought we made a fair effort to contain him today but he's very, very dynamic. He's a monster. He got in behind us a couple of times and caused us a lot of trouble.' England fly-half Owen Farrell enjoyed more valuable game time in the convincing win over the Exiles . After David Strettle danced his way over in the right corner for his second try of the afternoon, it looked like Saracens would go on to claim the two tries they needed for a bonus point. But Smith's men then held firm as McCall's men failed to cross the London Irish whitewash again in the final quarter. 'It was difficult in the first half,' McCall said. 'It was wet and we were playing into a fairly strong wind and I thought we did a pretty good job in the first half. Saracens winger David Strettle crosses for one of his two tries for the afternoon . 'With 20 minutes to go, we got ourselves into a pretty strong position where we should try to kick on and probably get a few more tries and we didn't manage that.

"Michael van Gerwen showed class and tremendous resolve under pressure on Thursday night night as he moved into the semi-finals of the William Hill World Darts Championship. Exactly a year after he became world champion, the 25-year-old progressed into the final four with a thrilling 5-2 victory over Robert Thornton, the ninth-ranked player. But it could easily have gone the distance as the Scot, who had trailed 3-0 at one point, missed a dart to level at 3-3. Van Gerwen, who banks £60,000 for reaching this stage, may have hit a superb 170 finish to secure the win but he acknowledged it had been a hard-fought match. VIDEO Scroll down to see Michael van Gerwen's reaction to booking his semi-final place . Reigning champion Michael van Gerwen sealed his place in the semi-finals of the PDC World Championships . Van Gerwen edged out Robert Thornton (above) in a thriller at Alexandra Palace . The Dutchman said: ‘I was playing very well but Robert fought back. ‘I was under pressure. I was a bit nervous. I thought to myself, “This can’t happen, can it?” The 170 finish to win was such a big relief for me. ‘I had a 106 average at the end but I am not happy with my performance. I can do a lot better. I can improve to win this tournament. If you want to be a winner, you can’t be scared of who you play next. That is the most important thing.’ By his own admission, Van Gerwen started sluggishly in the opening rounds at Alexandra Palace. He was far from lethargic here early on. Back to his rapid-fire best, Van Gerwen recorded a three-dart average of 112.59 in the opening set. These were the first sets that Thornton had dropped this tournament after winning 11 straight in three matches. Van Gerwen had raced into a 3-0 lead but was pegged back to 3-2 by Thornton . Yet the 47-year-old, from Ayrshire, is renowned on the PDC circuit as a battler and those qualities came to the fore in the fourth and fifth sets. A memorable comeback and a massive upset were on the cards. Thornton had a chance to square it at 3-3 with an 81 finish — his third dart vibrated the wire of the bullseye — but he was then punished by the world No 1, who moved remorselessly through the gears.

"Phil Taylor, the 16-time world champion,  avoided a giant-killing by the giant Dutchman Vincent van der Voort on Friday night to reach the 20th world semi-final of his illustrious career. The 54-year-old believes this is his last realistic opportunity to lift the Sid Waddell trophy. And he remains on track with that target, moving into the semi-finals of the William Hill World Darts Championship with a 5-3 victory at Alexandra Palace. From the Power's perspective, though, this was an edgy and nervous win against a 6ft 5in opponent who has been struggling with a severe back problem. Taylor, who won his first world crown, albeit the BDO version, nearly 25 years ago, appreciated afterwards that he came close to being toppled, especially as Van der Voort led 3-2 in sets after being 2-0 down. VIDEO Scroll down for Phil 'the power' Taylor's thoughts on reaching the semi-final . Phil Taylor reacts after winning the sixth set of his match with Vincent van der Voort on Friday night . Dutchman Van der Voort had been suffering with back problems but said he gave the match all he could . Taylor, 5ft 8in, said: 'That match was all about survival. Vincent was in agony with his back. I tried to extend the game as long as I could. He was in trouble and yet he was still hitting his scores and 180s. I need to rest now because I' m shattered.' Taylor, as he has done so often in the past, asserted his authority on this match in the opening stages. When Van der Voort missed the bullseye on a 126 finish in the fifth leg of the first set, Taylor punished him with an 87 checkout. His average of 107.82 after five legs gave the impression he was in the mood for an early finish. It was a similar story in the second set as, after Van der Vort missed three darts for 16, Taylor nailed 80. Yet the 39-year-old Dutchman refused to lie down and reacted by winning three successive sets in a row, taking nine of out 11 legs. In the fourth set, Van der Voort knocked off 113 and 107, both on a double 20 finish; in the fifth, he took out 100 and 104 against Taylor's throw and enjoyed a three-dart set average of 120.61. Taylor clenches his fist as he celebrates winning a leg during the match at Alexandra Palace . Van der Voort (left) celebrates going 3-2 ahead but it wasn't enough to beat Taylor who came back to win 5-3 . However, the sixth set end up being a pivotal one in terms of the narrative of this match. Had Taylor lost, he would have gone 4-2 behind. Instead the relieved Stoke thrower won it to draw level at 3-3 apiece – but he only sealed the leveller with his 21st dart and surprisingly after missing eight darts at the double. Little wonder that he celebrated by sticking his index finger to his temple and mouthing to the crowd the words: 'This is doing my head in – I need bloody shooting!' The pressure on his shoulders eased in the seventh set as he won it against the throw. And the eighth set was a mere formality as he booked yet another semi-final appearance. Van der Voort said: 'I gave it everything I had. It just wasn't good enough. I don't want to use my back as an excuse. I lost to the better player.' Taylor will face Raymond van Barneveld who overcame reigning BDO world champion Stephen Bunting in a 5-4 thriller. The two men matched each other almost all the way, but Van Barneveld broke the game in his favour with a 124 checkout to go two-up midway through the final set. 'I needed extra eyes in set five because I couldn't see, it was all blurred,' the Dutchman said before taking the microphone and turning to the crowd to praise his opponent. 'This man here, he won everything in the BDO and then he said I will come over, I want to play with the best of the best and he is one of the best. 'Stephen, you are a world class player.'","Phil Taylor avoided a giant killing to win 5-3 against Vincent van der Voort .

"Stoke City boss Mark Hughes expects the club to soon wrap up the loan signing of defender Philipp Wollscheid from Bayer Leverkusen. The Potters have shaken hands with their Bundesliga counterparts on an agreement that would see 25-year-old Germany international Wollscheid switch for the rest of the season. 'It is a deal that is likely to happen and we are likely to see him here early next week I would suggest,' Hughes told the club's official website. Stoke City are close to signing Bayer Leverkusen centre back Philipp Wollscheid (left) on loan . Mark Hughes said he hopes to have the deal tied up very soon with the player arriving this week . 'He has superb quality and in my opinion he is a very good footballer, so we are very pleased to have agreed the terms of the deal. 'He has moved for decent money in the past and he has played for the reigning world champions, so he has real good pedigree.' Speaking more generally about January transfer window plans in his post-match press conference after Stoke's 3-1 FA Cup win over Wrexham, Hughes added: 'In terms of spending huge amounts of money, we don't anticipate that is going to happen in January. 'We will just see what is out there. If something makes sense, and we think it will help us, we will pursue it if we've got the means to.' With regard to potential outgoings, Tony Pulis taking over as West Brom head coach has prompted talk of the former Stoke boss trying to lure some of Hughes' players to the Hawthorns this month. The club are in negotiations with Leverkusen about bringing the defender to the Britannia Stadium . Peter Crouch could be heading for the exit though with Tony Pulis and West Brom interested . Among those is striker Peter Crouch, who Pulis signed for Stoke in 2011 and is currently on a contract with them that runs out in the summer. The Potters are looking to keep Crouch on, but reports have suggested contract negotiations have stalled between the two parties. When asked about the tall frontman being linked with Albion, Hughes said: 'There is an obvious connection, so people do the sums and two and two make five. 'There is a willingness from our point of view in that we want to make Peter happy that he is content here for the next two or three years, or however long it is that his future is with us. 'Those are the conversations we are going to have with him and it's up to us to make sure we get something in front of Peter that he is happy with.'","Stoke City have been in negotiations to sign Philipp Wollscheid on loan .

"Ronny Deila insists he is unconcerned by Aberdeen's overtaking of Celtic at the top of the Scottish Premiership. The Hoops' game against Partick Thistle at Firhill on New Year's Day was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch which allowed the Dons to leapfrog them by one point with their 2-0 home win over St Johnstone. The Granite City club have a chance to extend that lead to four points against Motherwell on Sunday and Dundee United could also be above Celtic if they beat Partick on the same day, before the champions travel to Kilmarnock on Monday night. Celtic boss Ronny Deila leads his players in training ahead of their Monday night clash with Kilmarnock . However, Deila, disappointed that the Thistle game was off - 'we were ready to play and wanted to play' - is relaxed about a situation few would have envisaged at the start of the season when it was widely assumed that, in the continuing absence from the top flight of traditional rivals Rangers, the Hoops would proceed unhindered to their fourth successive title. The Celtic boss said: 'I'm not concerned about that. 'It is in our hands and if we win our games we are the champions and that is what we want to do. 'We are not halfway through (league campaign) yet so there are a lot of games to go. Celtic's players train at Lennoxtown after having their New Year's Day game postponed . 'This Spring will be unbelievably exciting and we are looking forward to every game. 'We have a very big squad and we have performed well. 'It is about winning in the end and again, I think we are in a good position. It is in our hands. 'We could be better but we could be worse. 'We are confident that we can win every game. Every game we go into in Scotland we are favourites and that is a good thing. Celtic players Efe Ambrose, Stefan Scepovic and Stefan Johansen (L-R) chat during training . 'We are showing that we are controlling games and have more chances than the opponents, so it is up to us.' The Parkhead squad jet out to Gran Canaria for a winter break following their trip to Rugby Park. Having postponed their match against St Johnstone on January 10, Deila's side could fall further behind in the title race. However, the Norwegian believes Celtic's experience of winning the title over the past three seasons will stand them in good stead in the second-half of the campaign. Hoops forward Kris Commons is a January target for Championship side Bolton Wanderers . He said: 'That is very important, to know the demands and know how to focus when things are tight and that is something that there is a lot of in this squad. 'We have the experience of this. It is about us and if we win every game we will win the league. 'So it is up to us. We can't think about what the other teams are doing. 'It could be very close and if they win a lot of games it will be close. 'But we have a very good chance to win everything and we are preparing to win every game. We will see in the end.'","Aberdeen are one point ahead of Celtic in the Scottish Premiership .

"With Manchester City still nursing an striker crisis at the club, veteran defender Martin Demichelis put forward a case to play in the makeshift role for the champions after a stunning goal in training. Demichelis produced something out of the ordinary ahead of his side's FA Cup win against Sheffield Wednesday on Sunday, flicking the ball over  team-mate Bacary Sagna before hitting a rasping volley into the net, giving Joe Hart no chance in the goal. The 34-year-old, who has just three goals to his name since joining City in September 2013, was an unused substitute as his side edged past the Championship opposition to advance to the fourth round of the competition.

In their absence utility man James Milner played as a false No 9 for a three-game spell, with Manuel Pellegrini's men winning two and drawing one of those fixtures during that time.

"Midfielder Sergio Busquets believes the speed and mobility that has been such a strength for Barcelona in recent years has become their great weakness. Busquets concedes size has mattered of late for Barca, no more so than when their goal was breached yet again from a set-piece as they fell 1-0 to David Moyes' Real Sociedad.

"The open letter to a former club has become a recent phenomenon when a player signs for a new side, and West Ham's latest arrival Doneil Henry is no exception. Henry was under contract at Cypriot side Apollon Limassol before joining the Hammers for an undisclosed fee this month, but the Canada international had spent most of his career at Toronto FC before completing his Upton Park switch. Now the 21-year-old has sent out an open letter to the club where he started his career thanking them for handing him his professional break. Doneil Henry has penned an open letter to former club Toronto FC after joining West Ham . Henry celebrates a goal with Toronto team-mate and former West Ham striker Jermain Defoe . Henry said: 'Toronto was my first professional club as well as the city in which I grew up in. As I embark on my new challenge at West Ham United, TFC will always have a special place in my heart. Toronto FC will always be my home! Thanks for all the great memories.' Henry, who has 14 caps for his country, joins on a long-term contract from Cypriot First Division club Apollon Limassol for an undisclosed fee. The 6'2 defender has been closely monitored by the Irons for a while after having already spent two periods training with the club in recent months. Henry was brought to Upton Park boss Sam Allardyce's attention by Toronto FC head coach Ryan Nelsen. To my city. 'Toronto was my first professional club as well as the city in which I grew up in. As I embark on my new challenge at West Ham United, TFC will always have a special place in my heart. 'I would like to thank all the passionate fans for their support and patience, encouraging me as I developed into the player I am today. 'A special thank you to the MLSE organisation, Larry Tanenbaum for his support and kindness, Tim Bezbatchenko and the entire TFC family for giving me all the tools necessary to continue on my journey.

'Ryan (Nelsen) was my captain at Blackburn for a couple of years and he rang us and told us about Doneil,' Allardyce told West Ham's official website. 'He said this lad definitely has Premier League potential and he has everything he needs. 'With a little coaching from us and work in terms of how to defend in the Premier League, Ryan says he has all the attributes to be a good player.

"Robert Sarver, the majority owner of the Phoenix Suns NBA basketball team, has made an approach to Rangers which may lead to an offer being made for the company, the club has announced to the Stock Exchange. Reports emerged on Sunday that an £18million takeover bid from Sarver had either been lodged or was about to be and on Monday the club confirmed interest from the 53-year-old. 'The Company notes recent press speculation and confirms that it has received an approach from Robert Sarver (or a vehicle to be established and controlled by him) ('Mr Sarver') that may or may not lead to an offer being made for the Company,' Rangers said. Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver is preparing an £18m takeover bid for Rangers . Sarver, 53, must either make an offer for the Scottish Championship club or withdraw his bid by February 2 . 'There can be no certainty that an offer will be made, nor as to the terms on which an offer may be made. A further announcement is expected shortly.' The statement added that Sarver must make an offer or withdraw his bid by 5pm on February 2. It is another twist to a seemingly never-ending saga, but it is understood the financier may now be prepared to back Dave King and the 'Three Bears' group's attempts to seize control of the club. He lodged his offer in an email to Rangers International Football Club chairman David Somers just after Christmas. Sarver - a keen sports fan whose sons are interested in the game - asked the Rangers board to call a general meeting to vote on a plan which would have seen enough new shares issued to hand him a 51 per cent stake. The financier is reportedly prepared to back Dave King and the 'Three Bears' group's attempts to take control . He was also prepared to spend up to £15m buying out any remaining shareholders as he sought a 100 per cent stake in the club. Sarver, who also owns the Phoenix Mercury Women's NBA team, submitted his offer at the same time to WH Ireland, which manages RIFC's listing on the Alternative Investment Market. But it remains to be seen if he will press ahead with his bid after former oldco director King followed the 'Three Bears' group of Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor in buying up significant tranches of equity last week. King now holds a 14.57 per cent share, while Park, Letham and Taylor are responsible for 19 per cent. Dave King, seen here at the Liverpool vs Real Madrid match, now holds a 14.57 per cent share . It is understood the Three Bears have had tentative talks with Sarver but there is no deal in place. However, it seems unlikely that he will now be able to take control of the club following the moves made by King and the Three Bears. At least 75 per cent of shareholders would have to agree to new shares being issued to a non-shareholder at a general meeting, after resolution nine was defeated at the annual general meeting in December. Somers has already rejected a £16m investment plan offered by King which would have seen the South Africa-based businessman receive a controlling stake and seats on the board. The confirmation of the approach came as Rangers revealed they had secured a loan of up to £500,000 from shareholder and football club chairman Sandy Easdale. Easdale's loan will be secured on future income from the recent sale of Lewis Macleod to Brentford. The midfielder went for an undisclosed fee that was reported as £1m. A separate statement to the Stock Exchange read: 'The company is pleased to announce that it has entered into a short term credit facility for up to £0.5m. The facility is being provided by Alexander Easdale, a shareholder in the company and director of The Rangers Football Club Limited, the wholly owned subsidiary of RIFC. The facility will be used by the company for general working capital purposes over the next few days. 'Alexander Easdale will make available to the company up to £500,000 on a fee and interest free basis and it will be secured against the income from the sale of player announced on 2 January 2015.'","Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver has made an approach to Rangers .

"Newcastle United Supporters Trust are to raise concerns over Mike Ashley’s dual interest in the English Premier League club and Rangers with government sports minister Maria Miller. The supporters group will write to the Minister for Culture, Media and Sport and ask local politicians to raise the matter in the House of Commons. They will also lobby the English FA, Premier League and Football League over fears Newcastle or Rangers could potentially be excluded from European competition for a season under UEFA regulations. Mike Ashley owns Newcastle United and also has a stake in Scottish giants Rangers . The SFA have already charged Ashley with breaches of their rules on dual ownership, with a hearing due to commence on January 27. And Newcastle’s supporters trust believe their owner is in further danger of breaching article three of UEFA regulations on the integrity of competitions. Those ban any club participating in a European competition from having any influence ‘either directly or indirectly... in the management, administration and/or sporting performance of more than one club participating in a UEFA club competition’. Suspected of having pushed for the appointment of Derek Llambias as Rangers chief executive at Ibrox, Ashley has yet to respond to the challenge to his powerbase by former director Dave King and a second group of supporters, the so-called ‘Three Bears’, who have separately purchased blocks of shares representing 31 per cent of the club. Rangers chairman David Somers (left) and non-executive director Derek Llambias (right) But Michael Martin of the Newcastle United Supporters Trust declared the latest front in a long-running war of attrition with the man blamed for Saturday’s FA Cup defeat to Leicester by telling Sportsmail: ‘UEFA’s article three, regarding the integrity of the competitions, is clear cut. ‘Read through that and you see that the rules definitely catch Ashley out. ‘He owns 100 per cent of Newcastle United and just under 10 per cent of Rangers. ‘And he has the merchandising operation, is a major creditor and has tried to tie up various naming rights deals. ‘I don’t think anyone would argue that Llambias is also his appointment as chief executive at Rangers and has arranged for two directors to be removed from the board. Newcastle United Supporters Trust are to raise concerns  with government sports minister Maria Miller . ‘So we don’t think any reasonable person can dispute that he has a substantial interest in Rangers. ‘As a consequence of that he has dual interests in two clubs and once Rangers recover from their current situation and get back to where a club of their status should be they will definitely be competing in European competition. ‘And the likelihood is that would be in the Europa League to begin with where they might meet Newcastle because Ashley can’t compete with Manchester City, Chelsea or others. ‘Because of that we have drafted letters to the Secretary of State for sport, the Premier League, the Football Association and the Football League. Those will be going out next week. ‘We will also be approaching some local MPs we have good relations with and we will be asking them to raise this issue with the secretary of state for sport in the House of Commons. Second-placed Rangers are 13 points adrift of Hearts at the top of the Scottish Championship . ‘If we don’t get anything from that we will then write to the sponsors of these competitions asking if they are aware that what they are buying is being sullied by the fact either Newcastle or Rangers won’t be able to compete. ‘The product of footballing being a sporting enterprise is being potentially sullied by Ashley’s dual interests. The SFA had led the way on this and we await their judgment later this month with some interest.’ Newcastle United have denied any potential future breach of UEFA rules on dual ownership, banning a newspaper which put the specific concerns to Europe’s governing body in September.","Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley owns a stake in Rangers .

"Bournemouth romped to an outstanding 8-0 victory at managerless Birmingham as the misery continued for the home fans. A goal down in two minutes to Brett Pitman and reduced to 10 men three minutes later it proved a nightmare for Birmingham's caretaker boss, Malcolm Crosby. They could do nothing right and Bournemouth capitalised on the situation to add two further first half goals through Callum Wilson and Matt Ritchie. The electronic scoreboard shows the result at the end of the game at St Andrew's . Birmingham City's Callum Reilly (left) and David Davis absorb their humiliating defeat at full-time . Birmingham City's Grant Hall aknowledges the stunned home fans at the end of the game . Marc Pugh added the fourth, fifth and seventh goals after the break with substitute Tokelo Rantie converting an 80th minute penalty. Rantie completed Birmingham's humiliation with the eighth goal four minutes from time. Following such a dire start there was little chance of Birmingham staging a revival as Bournemouth were generally in control and went on to record their sixth win in their last seven outings. These are bleak times for Birmingham, highlighted by the sacking of manager Lee Clarke on Monday. Birmingham are reduced to 10-men when David Edgar (centre) is sent off by referee Keith Hill . During his stewardship Birmingham had won only one of their previous 24 homes games and this latest heavy defeat keeps them anchored in the relegation area and facing a bleak future. In their hour of crisis the West Midland's club could not have made a worse start. They were caught in total disarray when Pitman simply ran through unchallenged to slip the ball past the advancing Darren Randolph. Things became even worse in the fifth minute. There was no real danger when Wilson attempted to gain possession only to be pulled back by Edgar who was immediately shown a red card by referee Keith Hill. Brett Pitman fires Bournemouth into an early lead in the second minute of the match . Against 10 men, Bournemouth had a fine opportunity to completely destroy a hapless Birmingham but their early marksman, Pitman, suddenly lacked his finishing touch. Twice in quick succession he should have added to his tally. On the first occasion Randolph bravely pushed out an effort from Wilson only for Pitman to glide his effort wide. A minute later he completely mis-screwed his shot wide with the goal at his mercy but Wilson made no mistake with his 35th minute goal. Bournemouth's Callum Wilson (second right) doubles the away side’s lead in the 35th-minute . Matt Ritchie makes it 3-0 five minutes before the break as Birmingham began to fall apart at St Andrew's . Yet again it came about as a result of a mistake. This time Randolph made a woeful clearance straight to the Cherries striker. He calmly went forward, rounded Randolph and scored with a low angled shot for his tenth goal of the season. The chronicle of errors continued unabated as Bournemouth notched a third goal six minutes before half time. Randolph came out only to see Paul Robinson's clearance bounce back off Ritchie who then ran gleefully on to the loose ball to score into an empty net. March Pugh opens the second-half scoring just after the hour mark to make it 4-0 to the Cherries . Pugh adds his second in the 69th-minute as Birmingham cruise out to a 5-0 lead . Bournemouth's Tokelo Rantie converts an 80th minute penalty to make 6-0 as the humiliation continues . Paul Caddis has an opportunity to get Birmingham on the scoresheet in the 53rd-minute but Artur Boruc saves his spot kick . Birmingham could do nothing right as they even missed a 53rd minute penalty. Clayton Donaldson was impeded by Tommy Elphick but Paul Caddis saw Artur Boruc save his spot kick low down diving to his left. There was no respite for Birmingham as Pugh hooked home a right wing cross from Simon Francis in the 64th minute. Pugh headed home Bournemouth's fifth in the 70th minute when he converted another accurate Francis cross. Rantie notched an 80th a penalty followed by another Pugh goal.

"AFC Wimbledon goalkeeper James Shea would love to follow in Dave Beasant's footsteps by making an impact against Liverpool - but remarkably admits to not having seen his penalty save from the 1988 FA Cup final. Monday will be a special occasion for everybody associated with the Dons, who are in the FA Cup third round for the first time since their rebirth in 2002. Player trials on Wimbledon Common and Combined Counties League football seems an awful long time ago now, though, with the club chasing promotion from League Two and readying themselves for a mouth-watering clash with Liverpool. AFC Wimbledon keeper James Shea is hoping to emulate Dave Beasant's performance against Liverpool . Wimbledon goalkeeper Beasant dives to save John Aldridge's penalty in the 1988 FA Cup final at Wembley . The Kingsmeadow encounter brings with it memories of the most famous day in Wimbledon's history, when the Crazy Gang shocked the Merseyside behemoths to win the FA Cup. Lawrie Sanchez scored the decisive goal at Wembley that day, although captain Beasant's save from a John Aldridge penalty remains the iconic image - one current Wimbledon goalkeeper Shea admits he has yet to see. 'I haven't seen the save but I've heard it is unbelievable,' he said. 'I remember (former AFC Wimbledon manager) Dave Anderson telling me about it when I was about to join. 'He talked me through the whole history of the club and everything, but I haven't had the chance to see it yet. 'I've been meaning to see the Crazy Gang documentary as well, but I don't have BT Sport. My old man has recorded it for me so I've got to go around his and watch it.

Former Wimbledon player Neal Ardley will lead Wimbledon out against Liverpool in the FA Cup third round . 'I've seen (other) videos, I've seen the goal and inside the stadium there are pictures everywhere. 'It was a great day for them. They weren't expected to win and hopefully we can replicate what they done.' Beasant will be amongst the 4,800 crammed into Kingsmeadow on Monday and, given his own career started with non-league Edgware Town, he will appreciate Shea's journey to AFC Wimbledon. The 23-year-old came through the ranks at Arsenal, where, alongside the likes of Jack Wilshere, he won the 2009 FA Youth Cup against Liverpool. Shea progressed to the first-team and was on the bench for five Champions League matches during the 2012-13 season - what proved to be his last campaign with the Gunners. The Islington-born goalkeeper was released and dropped into non-league with Harrow Borough, leading him to seriously consider a future out of the game.

He said: 'It was getting to that point when I had to think ""what am I going to do with myself?"" 'I didn't know. I wasn't too sure. All I ever wanted to do was play football and to go into non-league it was a shock.' Thankfully for Shea it all worked out and the goalkeeper calls his time with Harrow the 'best thing' he has ever done. The goalkeeper remains thankful to the club and Anderson for helping him get the move back to league football with Wimbledon, for whom he will be the last line of defence against Liverpool, . 'It's going to be a very hard game - not just for me, but the whole team,' Shea said. 'It is a great game to be a part of. We are in a no-lose situation, really. We're not expected to win, apart from the pressure we put on ourselves. Hopefully we can put on a show on Monday.'","AFC Wimbledon face Liverpool in the FA Cup in a replay of the 1988 final .

"Connor Wickham has insisted his contractual situation was never a concern after committing his future to Sunderland. The 21-year-old striker signed a new four-and-a half-year deal in December after months of speculation over his future, with head coach Gus Poyet fearing he could lose him for nothing, just as he did with midfielder Jack Colback last summer. However, the England Under 21 international was always confident agreement would be reached to extend his stay at the Stadium of Light. Sunderland striker Connor Wickham (right) signed a new four-and-a-half year contract in December . Wickham (right) goes up for a header with Leeds' Liam Cooper during Sunderland's 1-0 FA Cup win . Wickham said: 'The speculation never bothered me as much as what was made of it. People don't see what goes on behind closed doors, and it was never in doubt. 'I took criticism for how long it took, but that was the process. At least it's settled now and everyone knows what's happening. I've signed the contract and that's the end of that. 'Over a month, I sat with the gaffer a couple of times and he explained to me what he wanted me to do. We had a good chat for half-an-hour, 45 minutes, and we got a lot out in the open and we understood each other. 'Now I know what he wants from me, and that's made it a lot easier. He said to me way before the negotiations even started what he wanted me to do for this season. I was happy to do it then, I'm happy to do it now. 'The contract was just one of those things that came up between then and now.' For much of the current campaign, Wickham has been asked to fill a wide left midfield berth with the club having failed in its attempts to clinch a summer deal for Liverpool's Fabio Borini, who excelled in that role during last season's loan spell on Wearside. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet shouts instructions to his players at the Stadium of Light on Sunday . Patrick van Aanholt (centre) celebrates scoring Sunderland's winning goal against Leeds United . There is little doubt he would prefer to line up through the middle - that responsibility is currently the preserve of Scotland international Steven Fletcher with Poyet largely operating a 4-1-4-1 system - but he is happy to do a job for the Uruguayan and the team. Wickham said: 'Obviously I want to play as high up the pitch as I can, and the role on the left involves some defending, which probably isn't the strongest bit of my game. 'But the gaffer wants me to do it, so that's what I've got to do. It's up to me to adapt to the way he wants me to play. 'The manager asked me before the start of the season whether I could play on the left. I did it at Ipswich for a whole season and it didn't seem the same as what it seems now. 'Full-backs push on and there is defending to do, but it is the fact that we need to score more goals and get forward in numbers as much as we can.' Poyet is on the lookout for a new striker with Steven Fletcher (right) among those struggling for goals . Poyet has made no secret of his desire to add goals to his squad during this month's transfer window - Fletcher, Wickham and Jozy Altidore have scored just eight between them so far this season - and that was a failing which might have come back to haunt the Barclays Premier League club once again on Sunday when they edged past by Sky Bet Championship Leeds 1-0, the same scoreline as that which famously separated the clubs in the 1973 final, into the FA Cup fourth round. Returning full-back Patrick van Aanholt's 33rd-minute strike proved decisive on a day when chances went begging, and the Black Cats very nearly paid a heavy price when Leeds skipper Liam Cooper headed against the post in injury time. Wickham said: 'It wasn't easy, but it's not going to be against Leeds with the history of the two teams. But we'll take the win and we're into the next round. 'We did have chances and Pat scored a good goal. But in the second half, we let them get back in the game and they hit the post. We're happy to take the win though.'","Connor Wickham signed a four-and-a-half year contract in December .

"Lee Mason could be forgiven for taking next Christmas off after yet another festive refereeing row. A week after upsetting Aston Villa by showing Gabby Agbonlahor a red card that was later overturned, the Greater Manchester referee was again under fire after this bruising encounter at Goodison Park. Everton were furious that Mason only booked Jonathan Walters for dragging back Leighton Baines when he was clear on goal moments before awarding Stoke a decisive penalty when Bojan Krkic went down under considerably less contact from James McCarthy.

The little Spaniard took it himself and beat Tim Howard convincingly despite being targeted by a laser pen in the crowd, crowning a classy performance amid the driving rain and thundering challenges. It was the second Boxing Day in a row that Mason has been involved in controversy. Last year, Brendan Rodgers was fined £8,000 for criticising him following Liverpool’s costly defeat at Manchester City. Bojan went off with a back injury midway through the second half but, according to Stoke manager Mark Hughes, he had already answered any questions about his ability to perform in such testing conditions. ‘If people see any weakness in Bojan’s play, they say he’s not quite right for the English game,’ said Hughes. ‘I think he’s knocked those thoughts on the head.’ Everton and Stoke players observe a minutes applause to mark the 100 years Christmas Truce in World War One .

Jagielka (centre) winces in pain after going over on his ankle following a collision with Walters . Everton, though, were furious over Mason’s decisions. The 43-year-old official certainly had his hands full on Friday. He had to add 10 minutes of injury-time in a first half that left with Stoke skipper Ryan Shawcross with a heavily bandaged head and Everton’s Ross Barkley with a bloodied nose. Indeed, at times it felt as though these two teams were taking Boxing Day a little too literally. Shawcross was injured after an early collision with Romelu Lukaku who, to be fair, had his eyes on the ball when they were involved in a clash of heads which inflicted a nasty cut over his opponent’s right eye that required stitches at half-time. John Stones was the next player to need treatment after a crunching tackle by Glenn Whelan which allowed Bojan to set Mame Diouf free on goal, but Phil Jagielka got back to make an excellent block. Jagielka was injured shortly afterwards when he stumbled over Walters, and by then Barkley was making regular trips to the touchline for running repairs on his nose injury. At one point the two team-mates were stood side by side next to the dug-out with the home side temporarily reduced to nine men. Everton’s response was robust. Marko Arnautovic needed treatment on his right ankle following a crunching challenge by Gareth Barry, and Steven Naismith was cautioned for a late tackle on Bojan. When Barry followed him into Mason’s notebook in the second half, he became the first player to reach a century of yellow cards in the Premier League. Then came the turning point. Walters escaped with a yellow for grabbing hold of Baines as he moved on to Barry’s through ball, and soon after Bojan outpaced McCarthy down the left flank and just kept the ball in play. Everton felt Stoke should have had Walters (right) sent off after bringing down Leighton Baines (centre) Howard had to come off at half-time after injuring his calf to add to a miserable first half for Roberto Martinez's side . Lukaku (left) and a bandaged Shawcross cross paths once more as they contest a 50-50 ball . Mame Biram Diouf's (right) cross is blocked by Stones during their Boxing Day encounter . You have to wonder if the Everton midfielder’s lack of match fitness after a month out played a part, as Bojan wriggled past him and then went down under the slightest of touches. Up to that point, Everton’s best chance had fallen to Barry, who could not direct Kevin Mirallas’s corner into an empty net at the far post after the Belgian’s shot had been deflected inches wide. But they twice went close to equalising at the end of the first half. Asmir Begovic came out to punch a corner from Baines and Naismith’s follow-up header was nodded off the line by Steven N’zonzi. Then Naismith set up Mirallas, who had time to draw Begovic out of his goal before sliding a shot wide of the near post. Jagielka’s ankle injury meant he did not appear for the second half and neither did Howard, a calf strain bringing Joel Robles off the bench to replace him in Everton’s goal. The Spanish keeper had little to do except try to keep warm in the driving rain as Everton dominated the second half. Stoke were happy to drop deep and protect their lead, with N’zonzi particularly impressive in securing a valuable win. ‘In the second half we expected Everton to come back,’ said Hughes. ‘But I don’t think they gained any real momentum to ask any questions of us, and I thought we saw it out quite comfortably.’ Gareth Barry (left) and Seamus Coleman (right) sandwich Bojan as the Stoke forward tries to force his way past the Everton duo .","Stoke forward Bojan proved their matchwinner with the only goal of the game at Goodison Park .

"The battle for Rangers took another twist on Sunday night when it emerged that American financier Robert Sarver had submitted an £18million offer for a controlling stake. Sarver, who owns the Phoenix Suns basketball team, made his offer to PLC chairman David Somers in the days after Christmas. He wanted a general meeting called to approve the issue of new shares and was willing to spend a further £15m to buy up 100 per cent of the club. American financier Robert Sarver had submitted an £18million offer for a controlling stake in Rangers . However, the acquisitions made recently by Dave King and a consortium comprising Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor – who now have around 34 per cent between them - have since altered the picture significantly. None of those wealthy fans would have any intention of selling as they seek to force regime change. While the initial format of his bid appears unlikely to succeed, Sarver may still have a role to play as it is understood he would be willing to work alongside fan groups and Rangers-supporting businessmen. The 52-year-old chief executive of Western Alliance Bancorporation is thought to have had some limited contact with the Park consortium. Should the broad coalition of fans succeed in toppling the current board, then he could figure in plans to try and rebuild the financially-stricken club. ‘Sarver is a serious player with superb credentials,’ one source told BBC Scotland. Sarver, who owns the Phoenix Suns basketball team, made his offer to PLC chairman David Somers . ‘He knows what it takes to make major sports clubs successful and would bring a tremendous track record to Rangers. ‘He is regarded as a straight-talking and very determined guy with a genuine passion for sport and an impressive record of success at the highest level of US sport and business. ‘Of course, he sees this as an exciting opportunity to invest in a major sporting institution, but given his involvement in the NBA, he fully realises that, without the broad support of fans, any proposals are doomed to failure.’ At least 75 per cent of shareholders would have to agree to new shares being issued to a non-shareholder at a general meeting, after resolution nine was defeated at club’s AGM in December. As it stands, existing shareholders must be given first refusal on the available new shares, which could raise around £6.5m. The acquisitions made by King and the Park group give them a strong hand – and they could apply to buy up any shares not taken up when the issue goes ahead.

"Rafa Benitez managed Steven Gerrard for six years at Liverpool, including the two most iconic games of Gerrard’s Liverpool career: the Champions League win in Istanbul in 2005 and the FA Cup final victory of 2006. Benitez, now at Napoli where he last month won the Italian Super Cup against Juventus to add to last season’s Coppa Italia, writes exclusively for The Mail on Sunday on his memories of his Liverpool captain. When I became Liverpool manager my first job was to travel to Portugal where England were competing in Euro 2004 and speak with Steven Gerrard, Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher, who were all in the squad. I was telling them about my ideas and my tactics and they were incredibly attentive, analysing everything I said. And then I remember asking them what they could bring to the team. And Steven’s first word was: ‘Passion.’ That was his first thought always. And for years he has provided that for Liverpool, almost a representative of the Kop on the pitch. And, of course, it is the first word most people will come up with to describe him now that he has announced that he is leaving Liverpool at the end of the season. But important as that was to his game, it shouldn’t be allowed to overshadow the superb technical qualities, passing abilities and the physicality that he had. VIDEO Scroll down to see Steven Gerrard break the silence over his Anfield exit . Rafa Benitez (right, pictured in 2005) says Steven Gerrard is the Kop's representative on the pitch . The pair celebrate winning the 2006 FA Cup against West Ham at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff . He is a complete player, which is evident in the number of positions in which he played. On his most famous night, the Champions League final in Istanbul, he started in midfield before moving to be a second striker with Luis Garcia when Harry Kewell was injured. Then AC Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti put Serginho on the pitch and Steven played almost as a full back or a wing back. I know that he has had hundreds of great games for Liverpool and even in my time managing the club there were plenty. Everyone talks about the Olympiakos game in the group stages of the Champions League and the FA Cup final against West Ham in 2006. But it’s difficult to look beyond Istanbul when I’m choosing my favourite. Even when we were 3-0 down at half-time, the message was that if we can score one goal, we were back in the game. It was typical that it should be Steven who got us that crucial first goal on 54 minutes. Gerrard celebrates his (now famous) goal against Olympiacos at Anfield in the Champions League . Manager Benitez and club captain Gerrard discuss tactics in training at Melwood back in 2007 . In football, sometimes, there is a moment when something happens to change the dynamic — and that was it. Maybe if the goal had been scored by another player, it wouldn’t have had quite such a galvanising effect. But you can see from his reaction — cajoling the players and the crowd — that he was an inspiration for everyone and he started the feeling that the team could come back to win. After that final we were fortunate as a coaching team that we could work with him for another five years, as he almost left that summer for Chelsea. Eventually the pull of Liverpool proved too much and we had long meetings trying to explain our plans and ambition and how important he was to us. After that final in Istanbul he said to us on the coaching staff: ‘You have to make me the best midfielder in the world.’ That showed how ambitious he was — but also how hard he was willing to work. And he was as much an inspiration in training as he was in games. We were introducing some new ideas, with a more Spanish style of playing, more passing and maybe less direct football. He was always keen to absorb and learn. Benitez (pictured in 2008) said he was lucky to have so long with Gerrard as he almost left to join Chelsea . Gerrard and Benitez in coversation in 2008 before their Champions League clash with Atletico Madrid . I know Steven has joked about how difficult it was to get a compliment from me in those years. But I think he realises now how highly I regarded him. If you have a very clever son or daughter and your other child is not so clever, you would be telling the one who is not so clever: ‘Oh. That’s fantastic!’ But the one who is clever, you would be pushing all the time. That’s how they will improve. Of course, we did encourage him and say: ‘Well done’ — just not every day. In the end, it was Steven who made the most out of his ability and we were just the coaching team lucky enough to be in place at that stage of his career. It got to the point with Steven that even if he was having a rare bad day you would still be thinking: ‘He’s not playing well but still I have to keep him on because he can score inside or outside the box or from a free-kick.’ Whatever he does next, I’m sure he’ll be a huge success. And now that he is approaching the end of his career at Liverpool, I can safely say a huge: ‘Well done!’ And hopefully he knows just how much I appreciated him.

"The Professional Footballers Association are exploring ways of outlawing initiation ceremonies despite them being a tradition for many clubs in England. They are often used to welcome players joining a first team, be it from the academy or as a new signing, with singing a song in front of the rest of the squad a popular choice. But, as Gary Neville revealed in his autobiography 'Red', sometimes young players are forced into embarrassing acts for the enjoyment of first-team players. Gary Neville was forced to take part in embarrassing acts during his time as a Manchester United apprentice . Sky Sports pundit Neville, pictured with Jamie Carragher, wrote about his initiations in autobiography 'Red' Discussing his time as a young player at Manchester United, Neville wrote: 'Making love to Clayton Blackmore was one of the worst things about being an apprentice at United. Not the real Clayton Blackmore, obviously. He was sat in the dressing room p****** himself with laughter like the rest of the first-teamers. 'No, this was a lifesize picture of our pin-up defender which would be stuck on to the treatment table by a senior player with a vicious sense of humour. As Barry White music played, I, or whichever unlucky apprentice had been chosen, would have to dance around the table and pretend to get off with Wales's right-back. 'I can't tell you how excruciating that is for a 16-year-old in front of an audience of his heroes like Mark Hughes and Bryan Robson.' Neville also revealed that anyone who refused to take part would be hit over the head with a football wrapped in a towel or given a dead arm by a line of second-year apprentices. Apprentices at Old Trafford were made to 'make love' to a picture of Clayton Blackmore (right) Wimbledon's Crazy Gang of the 1980s and 1990s were famed for their initiation ceremonies and pranks . The former United defender, who spent 20 years at Old Trafford, added that another punishment for young players was having the entire United kit rubbed on to them in dubbin with a wire brush, while being thrown into a moving tumble dryer was also popular. Although initiations are often good natured, it may well be stories like these which have forced the PFA to take steps to stop ceremonies taking place. Speaking ahead of Monday night's clash against Liverpool, AFC Wimbledon midfielder Dan Bulman said: 'We have initiation songs but that's all getting ushered out by the PFA now. 'I was on a course the other day and they are now trying to put a stop to it. 'One player in the Premier League on his first away trip was told that he had to sing a song and he said, 'No, I haven't got to do that'. Former Aston Villa assistant manager Roy Keane is not a fan of initiation ceremonies . 'That is the way that the game is going and the PFA now want to catch up with the times.' Neville's former team-mate, Roy Keane, was never a fan of initiations as a player and believes there are better ways of making new players feel part of the squad. Speaking to ShortList magazine during his time as Aston Villa assistant manager, Keane said: 'No, I don't like that stuff. It happens now at Villa, but if I was a player at a new club and someone said, ""You've got to sing tonight,"" I just f****** wouldn't do it. I sing for nobody. 'People say it's banter, but I don't like that type of banter. I'd help players by making sure they settled in properly, making sure my wife touched base with their family. That was my way.'","Gary Neville revealed what he was put through at Man United in his book .

"They produced a retro match programme on Monday night to commemorate the 1962 FA Cup final between these two clubs at Wembley, back in the days when Burnley and Tottenham Hotspur were competing for the highest honours in English football. How sad then that the Jimmy McIlroy Stand at Turf Moor, named after one of the heroes of that Burnley side, was shut down in advance and left empty due to a glaring lack of local interest for the first FA Cup tie here in four years. It was a depressing indication of how far the old competition has fallen in the eyes of some supporters, particularly when two Premier League rivals meet in the early rounds; even more so on this occasion when the game was shunted back to a peculiar Monday night slot on the day most people were returning to work after a fixture intensive Christmas break.

Burnley sold a retro programme to commemorate the 1962 FA Cup final between them and Tottenham . That didn’t stop 2,500 Tottenham fans doing their bit after making the journey north, but it contributed to a flat atmosphere – especially in the first half - at a half-empty Turf Moor. ‘It’s a tough one for fans,’ admitted Burnley manager Sean Dyche. ‘Monday night is an awkward one. Both teams made the decision on that because of the physicality. 'There’s been a real amount of miles put on the clock by our players, so that worked for us as a small group. ‘It’s slightly different for Tottenham. They made seven changes and had £130million-worth of talent on the pitch so I don’t think there was a lack of quality with the players coming in. ‘But maybe that affected the ticketing and people coming to the stadium. 'And, of course, all these Premier League games. They’re not cheap for everyone up here so I understand that.’ Dyche revealed that his squad has been further depleted by the loss of defender Kevin Long, who will miss the rest of the season after rupturing a cruciate ligament in the draw at Newcastle on New Year’s Day.

"Ronny Deila is adamant Virgil van Dijk won’t be leaving Celtic next month — despite Sunderland weighing up an £8million offer for the star defender. Arsenal, Southampton, Everton and West Brom have all been linked with moves for the 23-year-old, who still has two years remaining on his contract. Sportsmail understands, however, that Black Cats boss Gus Poyet will be the first to step up to the plate with a bumper offer for the player next month. Gus Poyet wants a centre-back and Sunderland are willing to pay £8million for Virgil van Dijk . Everton and West Bromwich Albion have also asked about the 23-year-old, but he prefers Sunderland . Irrespective of what bids come in, Deila believes keeping the defender focused for the remainder of the campaign will no longer be an issue. Van Dijk was omitted from the squad which drew at Dens Park in the first game after the August window closed, giving rise to the notion he was angling for a move south. But Deila foresees no such problems if bids are now rejected – due to the Dutchman’s contentment with life in Glasgow. ‘He’s worth a lot of money,’ said the Norwegian. ‘But I am very calm. Virgil is enjoying his football, playing well and when I speak with him he’s happy here. That’s positive. He is such an important player for us.’ Asked, in the event that a bid is turned down, he might need to again drop van Dijk from his side at the start of February, Deila was insistent. ‘I think he has learned a lot from this,’ he added. ‘It’s not the first time a player has been affected. ‘Others have been through these things as well. Stefan Johansen was the same. He came from the Euro finals with Norway two years ago and played so badly for Stromsgodset. I have never seen him so bad because his mind was somewhere else. ‘You can see a bit of that in (John) Guidetti now, as well. If he can get his mind right, the goals will come again. Everton and West Bromwich Albion have also asked about the 23-year-old Van Dijk . ‘If you think too much about uncertainties, about what you’re going to earn, it takes energy out of what you’re going to do on the pitch. But Virgil learned from what happened in the summer and he knows that if he’s good enough things will happen. And this is the way he wants to do it - but now he’s enjoying football and that’s the most important thing.’ Celtic face Rangers, Dundee and Inter Milan in three high-profile knock out games early in the New Year with the two-legged clash with the Serie A giants the toughest of the three. And Deila believes the exposure van Dijk will gain from playing in a game of such importance is such that it can only increase his chances of a more eye-catching transfer at some stage in the future. ‘He is a very good player now but he can be a world-class player,’ the Celtic manager opined. ‘That’s a good opportunity to show yourself but you do this over time. ‘Teams now will not see you in one game and then buy you, that’s over. ‘Then see you 10 or 15 times and you need consistency. Your levels have to be very high especially in defence because they need people they can rely on. ‘That’s something I think he has done better now than earlier in the season.’","Sunderland manager Gus Poyet wants to purchase a centre-back .

"Cardiff cruised into the fourth round of the FA Cup as a fans protest resulted in a paltry home crowd. Goals from Joe Ralls, Kadeem Harris and Kenwyne Jones put the Bluebirds into the hat for the next round as they eased past League One strugglers Colchester. Former West Ham striker Freddie Sears grabbed a consolation for the visitors, but it was the sparse attendance which was the main talking point.

Ben Turner (left) tackles Dion Sembie-Ferris (right) as the defender wins back possession for his side . The third round FA Cup encounter at the Bluebirds' Cardiff City Stadium was played out in front of 4,194 fans .

Booked: Watt . Goal: Sears 74 . Referee: James Linington . Attendance: 4,194 . Just 4,194 turned up to watch Cardiff’s first win in six games as supporters began the latest series of planned protests against Vinent Tan’s controversial rebrand. It marked the lowest Bluebirds crowd since they moved from Ninian Park to their new home in 2009. It made for an eerie atmosphere, and did little to help a home side struggling for confidence after a miserable recent run that had seen them ship 13 goals in four games. Cardiff manager Russell Slade said of the poor attendance: 'I can’t make people come and watch the team. 'I am sure if we start winning football matches and get some momentum from this game then people will come back. 'But it is difficult for the players. You wouldn’t want to see this for a league game as you want an atmosphere and for it to be very difficult for the opposition when they come here. 'But there are factors I cannot control.' There was little for either goalkeeper to do until Cardiff took the lead in the 34th minute. Tom Eastman’s poor clearing header fell to Ralls on the edge of the area and the midfielder found the net in fortuitous fashion. His initial strike was on target, but would not have beaten Colchester keeper Sam Walker without deflections off both Kaspars Gorkss and Cole Kpekawa. Tom Adeyemi went close to doubling their lead as he dispossessed Sammy Szmodics and drove towards goal, only to see his low shot tipped round the post by the scurrying Walker. Cardiff goalkeeper Simon Moore dives to his right to deny Colchester's Gavin Massey . Szmodics almost atoned for his error instantly. His foraging run down the left took him to the edge of the Cardiff box where his clever lay-off found Gavin Massey. The striker looked certain to level but a superb full-length stop from Simon Moore preserved Cardiff’s lead. The miss proved costly to Colchester’s hopes of an upset and Cardiff moved further ahead eight minutes into the second half. Harris improvised brilliantly to dispatch an acrobatic volley into the bottom corner for his first Cardiff goal after Ben Turner had headed a Peter Whittingham corner straight up in the air. Whittingham set up the third on the hour, his pin-point delivery allowed Jones to head home with his first touch after coming on as a substitute. Sears got Colchester the consolation their visitors deserved as he calmly slotted home his 13th goal of the season from Massey’s lay-off, but it was too little too late.","Joe Ralls, Kadeem Harris and Kenwyne Jones netted for Cardiff .

"Liverpool defender Kolo Toure is hoping he will be offered a deal to stay at the Anfield club with his current contract running out at the end of the season. The 33-year-old, who arrived on a free transfer from Manchester City in 2013, has held no talks with the club yet regarding a new deal as he prepares to head out to the Africa Cup of Nations with the Ivory Coast. The centre back, who has only made 13 appearances for the club this season, could potentially miss eight games for Liverpool and acknowledges his absence could hinder his chances of landing a new contract at Anfield. Kolo Toure has only made 13 appearances for Liverpool this season as Brendan Rodgers' side has struggled . Toure, challenging in the air for the ball against Leicester, is out of contract in the summer . 'I know that while I'm in Africa other players will play [for Liverpool] and I won't be able to help the team. All I can do is go there, do my best, then come back and fight to show that I'm still a top player,' Toure told the Liverpool Echo. 'If I get the chance to stay for another year, I will be happy - but it's not up to me. If I was going to stay, I would maybe have expected to hear something by now . 'I don't think too much about the future. I will enjoy every single minute at this club and keep giving 100 per cent,' added Toure. The Ivory Coast international, battling against Wayne Rooney, hopes to earn a new deal with Liverpool . Toure is expected to play a part in Liverpool's visit to AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup third round on Monday evening before heading off to Equatorial Guinea for the tournament, which runs for three weeks from January 17 until February 8. After the tournament Toure plans to retire from international football to concentrate on prolonging the rest of his club career but insists missing the Africa Cup of Nations was never an option. 'My career has been great. I've played for three fantastic clubs. If I can continue playing for this amazing club, I would love that - but if I need to go somewhere else to keep playing then I will,' said Toure. 'This kind of situation when you leave your club during the season is always difficult,' he said. 'What do you do as a player? It's tough. You don't like to miss matches for your club. But when the time comes, for us as Africans, we want to make our continent and our country proud. 'At the end of the day, I'm African, I'm from the Ivory Coast. If I get a call from my country I have to go. I am finished after this. I hope I will finish on a high.'","Kolo Toure's Liverpool contract runs out at the end of the season .

"Leyton Orient, Crawley, Stevenage and Luton. Now there are just four of the FA Cup minnows who have surpassed Newcastle United by making it to the fifth round in recent seasons. Not since 2006 – in a pre-Mike Ashley era – have the Magpies progressed beyond the fourth round. You can add MK Dons, Oldham Athletic and Bristol Rovers to a list of lower-league teams who have outshone Ashley’s Newcastle in a competition they have won six times. Indeed, their tradition and history is best illustrated by the FA Cup and the team of the 1950s – led by Jackie Milburn – who lifted the famous trophy three times in five years. Leonardo Ulloa scored the only goal of the game as Newcastle were dumped out of the FA Cup . Toon goalkeeper Jak Alnwick is hopeless to stop the first goal of the game at the King Power Stadium . Today, however, they are the only football club in the land who have gone on record in deprioritising the 144-year-old competition. Such policy has certainly been played out on the pitch. In fact, no top-flight club better – or worse - demonstrates the demise of the FA Cup and its relevance in a climate where the Premier League cash cow is the only competition worth milking. Since gaining promotion back to the top division in 2010, Newcastle have won just one FA Cup match. They have been eliminated by Stevenage, Brighton (twice), Cardiff and Leicester. Twice they have made seven changes for a third-round defeat and twice they have made five. On Saturday, during the sorry 1-0 surrender at Leicester in which star players Daryl Janmaat, Fabricio Coloccini, Moussa Sissoko, Jack Colback and Ayoze Perez were rested by caretaker boss John Carver, supporters made their feelings known – ‘We’re s***t and we’re sick of it’ was the terrace put-down, followed by disgust when they waved their own players away as they attempted to applaud a 4,300-strong following. Newcastle players look dejected after the final whistle as Vurnon Anita applauds the travelling fans . Newcastle fans shout abuse at their team at the end of the FA Cup Third Round match . The Toon Army have had enough. Their team are tenth in the table, 10 points clear of the relegation zone, seemingly needing just 13 more to hit 40 and renew their Premier League status and, more importantly from a boardroom perspective, bolster the owner’s bank balance for one more season at least. Why, then, did they so brazenly disrespect this season’s FA Cup? Club legend Alan Shearer said he was ‘annoyed, angry and surprised’ when Alan Pardew named a weakened side in last year’s third round, while John Anderson, who played 337 times for Newcastle and was at Leicester on Saturday, is another former favourite who cannot understand the approach. ‘It’s baffling why they do not value the cups when they’re in the position they are in the league,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘I was at the game on Saturday and so were more than 4,000 Newcastle fans and I could not believe the team when I heard it - it’s taking a lend of fans when they’ve paid good money to be there. John Carver made a raft of changes for the FA Cup third round clash against Leicester . ‘They weren’t happy and they had every right not to be. It was like a practice match and, to be honest, neither team wanted to win it. ‘Leicester would have been just as happy to get beat you feel. But they’re fighting to stay in the league and you can understand their changes to a degree – their priority is survival. ‘But Newcastle only need another three or four wins and they’ll be fine. So now you’re left with a scenario where the season is pretty much over in January. ‘What are they playing for? To finish as high as possible in the league? Well you’d even doubt that because the Europa League is just as much as a distraction to them as the FA Cup.’ Anderson himself only made it to the fifth round on three occasions during 10 years on Tyneside. But the former Republic of Ireland international says there was never a question of certain competitions taking precedence. John Anderson played 377 times for Newcastle and was at Leicester on Saturday for the FA Cup match . Anderson (above) was critical of the team picked by Carver and said fans have every right to be unhappy . ‘Listen, our record in the FA Cup wasn’t great, but it wasn’t for the want of trying, we just weren’t good enough,’ he said. ‘We named our strongest side in every match and I appreciate things have changed in that respect, but clubs like Newcastle and those around them in the Premier League should be having a right good go at the cups. ‘They aren’t going to get in the top four, they aren’t going down and they’ve got supporters who work hard all week and follow them all over the country in their thousands. ‘Newcastle aren’t the only ones guilty of this but it’s killing the cup and you end up with matches like Saturday which just feel like an inconvenience for both teams.’ There, in one word, Anderson captures the sad slide of the FA Cup – has it really become an inconvenience?","Newcastle were dumped out of the FA Cup by Leicester on Saturday .

"Leeds United legend Peter Lorimer has warned Sunderland his former club are out for revenge after being part of the team that lost the 1973 FA Cup final in front of 100,000 fans at Wembley. The former Scotland midfielder was on the losing end of one of the competition's most memorable upsets as second division Sunderland beat Don Revie's Leeds, the 1972 winners and a first division giant. Lorimer thought he had equalised when the goal was gaping from six yards out, only for goalkeeper Jim Montgomery to divert the ball on to the crossbar for a save akin to Gordon Banks's against Pele in the 1970 World Cup.

'In that 1973 final we were the shortest-priced favourites there had ever been. We were the team. And we lost. Sunderland, like us now, were a second division side with nothing to lose.

"Neil Redfearn is proud of Leeds' history in the FA Cup and hopes he and his players can create some more at Sunderland on Sunday. United's head coach grew up a Leeds fan and experienced the highs and lows of knockout football following his team in the competition. He watched them beat Arsenal to win the 1972 final with an Allan Clarke goal, before they were denied back-to-back successes a year later when they were shocked by Sunderland in an all-time classic. Neil Refearn grew up as a Leeds United fan and wants to continue their proud FA Cup history . When Redfearn was growing up, Leeds were one of the powerhouses in English football. Nowadays, they are struggling in the lower echelons of the Championship table . The club has a very different feel about it now to then - owner Massimo Cellino has overseen a cosmopolitan overhaul that was unthinkable when Don Revie and his players were Wembley regulars - but Redfearn claims the club is still as focused on FA Cup glory as it was when he was idolising them on the television. 'It was a big day for us which would start at 10am with all the interviews and I would be glued to the telly,' the 49-year-old recalled. 'Being a Leeds fan and knowing about 1972 when we won against Arsenal, and then losing to Sunderland, they're the games that stick in your mind as a youngster. 'Obviously, the great players that Leeds had, Clarke, (Peter) Lorimer, (Billy) Bremner, these are people that have gone down in legendary history at Leeds United and they add to this romance that this football club has got with the FA Cup, so it's important that we go up to Sunderland give a good account of ourselves.' Sunderland are Leeds' opponents on Sunday, and the two teams contested a famous final in 1973 . Redfearn believes that Leeds' loss to Sunderland in 1973 will still be playing on some fans' minds . The sides have not met in the cup since that final 42 years ago, and such was Revie's impact at Leeds that Redfearn reckons revenge will still be on the mind of some connected with the club. 'I would have thought so, I would see it as that,' he said. 'I have to say there are a lot of people here that I have met in my seven years that are associated with the club that associate with the Revie ways.' Leeds could field players from as many as nine different countries at the Stadium of Light - players who by Redfearn's own admission have struggled with the demands of the Championship, where a winless December has left the Whites in relegation trouble. But the one-time semi-finalist with Oldham thinks his foreign legion know what it means to do well in the FA Cup. 'I think they do, the coverage of all aspects of football in this country is top notch and they see the FA Cup as being a prestigious tournament,' he said. Sunderland captain Bobby Kerr holds the FA Cup aloft after his side beat Leeds United 1-0 at Wembley . Sunderland goalkeeper Jim Montgomery (right) made a spectacular double save in the 1973 final . 'They understand it and they understand at Leeds United it's important to win. When you enter a competition you enter it to win it and we're in it to win it.' That is an ambitious claim considering Leeds' dreadful league form, with results leading to some reports suggesting Cellino is ready to sack a coach for the third time this season. It is understood there is no immediate desire from the Italian to fire Redfearn and send him back to his old job with the academy, with the pair having spoken this week and finalised transfer targets, with Sassuolo striker Leonardo Pavoletti likely to be signed on loan.","Neil Redfearn grew up as a Leeds United fan watching them on television .

"Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet will go into FA Cup third-round battle with former club Leeds saddened by their fall from grace. Less than 14 years ago, the men from Elland Road, with the likes of Nigel Martyn, Rio Ferdinand, Jonathan Woodgate, David Batty and Mark Viduka among their ranks, made it to the semi-finals of the Champions League. However, the intervening years have brought financial collapse and chaos on and off the field, and the recovery process is only partially complete. Gus Poyet (right) worked under Dennis Wise (left) during his time at Leeds United . Sunderland manager Poyet is disappointed by FA Cup opponents Leeds' fall from grace . Poyet spent a year at Leeds working as then manager Dennis Wise's assistant between 2006 and 2007, and retains a huge fondness for a club whose fortunes provide a salutary lesson. He said: 'It's sad because I think they have got everything to be in the Premier League - they should be in the Premier League - but they are paying the price of two or three incredible years at the highest level. 'It was well done, it was achievable, but as soon as they went down, there was so much money spent that to recover from that, you never know if you need three, five, 10 or 15 years and that's why they are still paying that price. 'All the enjoyment of that Champions League moment - now it's the other side, the darker side, and it's not easy. 'They are on the way back, but it's taking a little bit longer than I would have expected, to be honest.' Leeds currently sit in 20th place in the Sky Bet Championship table, just a point above the relegation zone and with manager Neil Redfearn - the third man to hold the post this season - reportedly under pressure after a run of five defeats in seven games. Championship outfit Leeds are currently just one point above the relegation zone . Leeds have gone from challenging for European honours to Championship strugglers . Sunderland are themselves on a frustrating run of form, having won just one but lost only three of their last 10 Barclays Premier League matches. However, a gruelling festive programme has left Poyet's resources stretched to the limit, particularly at the back, and he knows Sunday's tie, which rekindles memories of the famous FA Cup final meeting between the two clubs in 1973, will be no walkover. He said: 'It's a difficult game. It's a tricky one because it all depends how the game starts and how good you are on the day. 'We cannot relax. We need to be better on the ball, we need to impose our quality and difference between a Premier League player and a Championship player, it's as simple as that. Then we will see.' Sunderland midfielder Liam Bridcutt could face Leeds after recovering from concussion . Poyet will be without midfielder Lee Cattermole, who has a groin injury, but he has a ready-made replacement in Liam Bridcutt following his recovery from concussion. But three games in a week over Christmas and the new year have taken their toll, in particular on defenders John O'Shea, Wes Brown and Santiago Vergini, and there could be changes, although the 47-year-old Uruguayan will pay full respect to a competition which is close to his heart. He said: 'I played in the Copa del Rey, I played in the Coupe de France - I played in the cup in different countries and it doesn't mean too much, I promise you. 'Here, it means a lot. We know how important it is and if you get through the first two or three rounds, you are there, so the idea is to play. 'That's why I want to play the strongest team without playing any injured players. We will try to make sure we do the best thing. It's not easy. Especially at the back, it's tough, but we will try our best.'","Gus Poyet's Sunderland take on Leeds in the FA Cup on Sunday .

"Sunderland and Leeds United meet in the FA Cup for the first time on Sunday since the 1973 final at Wembley. Second Division Sunderland were the 1-0 victors over Don Revie’s holders thanks to a first-half goal from Ian Porterfield. But the match is best remembered for goalkeeper Jim Montgomery’s remarkable double save from Trevor Cherry and Peter Lorimer.

The night before there was a preview show on the television with Jackie Charlton and Brian Clough on a panel. They were talking about how Leeds were going to pummel us and give us a good hiding. That geed us all up. We didn't need a team talk after that. I roomed with Joe Bolton, who was just one of the young lads. We ate bags of sweets all night and watched the television. The next morning we had breakfast with all the television cameras and we all went down in our scruffs, while Leeds in the other hotel were there in their suits and ties. Sportsmail's Craig Hope (far left) talks with Micky Horswill, Dick Malone and Jim Montgomery . Stokoe holds aloft the FA Cup after second division Sunderland beat the holders Leeds United . Jim: I think the biggest thing for me on cup final day was that we'd already beaten the other two top quality sides with Arsenal in the semi-final and Man City in an earlier round, so there was no reason why we couldn't beat Leeds. I wasn't having to deal with Eddie Gray, Johnny Giles and Billy Bremner though! Micky: In those days you faced each other during the National Anthem, so I stared at Allan Clarke for some reason, because he was the top English player. That was the only time I was a little bit nervous. Dick: To be honest, I don't think we ever thought we'd get beat. We didn’t go into any game thinking that. Craig: Ian Porterfield put you ahead and then the moment we all remember, the save… . Jim: I've spoken to Peter Lorimer many times since and he says he hit it as sweet as he could. He always says he'd do the same again. Well, I'd do the same again too! Malone (centre) and Montgomery (right) remember they couldn't sleep a wink night before the final . Horswill (left), Montgomery (centre) and Malone reminisce as they look at a picture from cup final day . Micky: Monty made great saves all the time. You didn't realise it. Jim: I think it was just the occasion. I probably did a better one against Hull City two weeks before that, but there were only two men and a dog there. It's when the cameras are there and it's the occasion. If we'd lost the cup, no-one would talk about it. Dick: You should have held the first shot though! Jim: Well if I had we wouldn't still be sat here talking about it would we?! Craig: Then it’s full-time and Bob is running across the pitch… . Jim: For whatever reason, Bob chose to do that. That was Bob's way of releasing all his adrenaline. That was the way he was. I was looking around at all the supporters and waving, and then suddenly Bob appears. Horswill (left), Montgomery (centre) and Malone pose in front of the statue of former manager Stokoe . Billy Hughes and Montgomery hold the FA Cup as they parade the trophy in front of the Sunderland fans . Craig: What was that walk up to the Royal Box like? Dick: Well, when Bob ran onto the pitch and wrapped his arms around me, he stuck his thumb in my eye! So I couldn't see very well going up or going down the steps. Micky: When I was a kid, all I wanted to do was go up those steps, get my medal and turn around at the crowd. I remember afterwards in the dressing-room, Dave Watson came to me and said “do you fancy going back out on the pitch?”. So we went out with one of those red-and-white striped plastic bowler hats on and a bottle of champagne. There wasn't a person in the stadium, so we walked to the six-yard box and didn't say a word. We just took in this weird atmosphere, and thought back to the game. It was fantastic. Craig: There must have been some party? Jim: It was at The Dorchester. All the press expected Leeds to win, so all the cameras were at their hotel, but then they had to rush across to ours. Montgomery (left), Malone (centre) and Horswill pictured with the FA Cup trophy at the Stadium of Light . Micky: We'd been partying for hours, but we suddenly got hungry. Someone said do you fancy going for something to eat? We were on the end of Park Lane and we went to a burger place on Oxford Street. There we were, FA Cup winners in a burger place with a load of our fans at two o’clock in the morning. It was packed! Jim: The biggest disappointment for me was that we had a game at Cardiff City on the Monday night. So on the Sunday morning, the wives had the cup on the bus and were driving home. They had people passing them on the motorway, hooting at them with the cup. But we had to go to Cardiff so we had a night out afterwards - we were a bit green going back! Micky: We had to stop at Scotch Corner to get tidied up for the reception. Craig: That must have been an incredible homecoming? Stokoe holds aloft his hat as he leaves the field after his side's victory against Leeds in 1973 . Dick: There was just red and white supporters everywhere hanging off the tops of buildings as we drove through town. Jim: They pushed the beds out of the hospitals as we went past just so they could see it. Micky: When we got to the stadium, they had a coffin with RIP Leeds on in the centre-circle. Craig: You must have felt like superstars? Dick: Not at all. At the time, Micky was on £25 a week and £25 appearance money. Jim: I was on a lot more than that! Dick: I was on about £100 quid, so was Jim. It was decent money but we weren’t that much better off than the man on the street, we mixed with them. I mean, my car failed its MOT three times! It was a sportsback Nissan type, nothing flash. The Sunderland players take a lap of honour around the pitch after winning the FA Cup . Malone (left) recalls driving through Sunderland on the homecoming to see red and white fans everywhere . Micky: I had an old Ford Cortina. Jim: I had a white Ford Corsair. Then when we won the cup I must admit I got a flashy sporty one… . Micky: But we were just ordinary blokes really. I was living in Annfield Plain in a little council house with my mam and dad. When we won the cup I signed a form to take it home for a day. I took it to the village in the boot of my car. I put it in my lounge and everyone from the council estate came and lined up for their photo taken – they had their babies in the top and all sorts. Dick: I’m actually still living in the same house just outside of town. Jim: I was living up the street from Dick and our favourite pub, The Barnes, was just down the road. We’d meet there for a couple of pints at half five then go and pick up our wives or girlfriends – some would pick both up! Then we went to see some fantastic turns in town, the likes of Tom Jones and Bob Monkhouse, brilliant times. Bobby Kerr caried by teammates Billy Hughes and Montgomery after the FA Cup Final victory . Craig: That one game has defined your lives really? Jim: When I'm walking around the town now, they all know what we've done. But what I like is when they say they watched it at their aunty's because it was their first colour television. When they were getting their first colour TVs it shows you how long ago it was! Micky: What amazes me is that people who were born 20 years after that all know us. Their parents have drilled it into them, so we're still household names with people who were born in the 80s or 90s. Maybe if we'd won a cup or two since then, we might not be as well known in the town. Dick: It's a bit embarrassing still talking about it 42 years on though… . Listening to their tales, you get the impression they are far from embarrassed… and who can blame them?","Sunderland and Leeds meet in FA Cup for first time since 1973 final .

"His brief is clear: to inject some impetus into Reading’s ailing season before it becomes too late, to find some stability, solidity and momentum to rescue a campaign in danger of being tossed away. Yesterday, we started to see Steve Clarke’s blueprint emerge. This was not far off how the Royals boss would have pictured life when he took over from Nigel Adkins less than a fortnight ago. His team were purposeful, direct and pretty good to watch, certainly far too strong for a Norwich side whose performance was described by their manager Neil Adams as ‘chalk and cheese’ from recent weeks. Hal Robson-Kanu celebrates with his team-mate Oliver Norwood after he scores their side's first goal . Simon Cox doubles his side's lead with a finish past Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy . READING: Federici; Gunter, Obita, Pearce (c), Hector; Williams, Norwood, McCleary (Mackie 72), Robson-Kanu; Cox (Guthrie 73), Murray (Blackman 89) Subs not used: Andersen, Cummings, Kelly, Cooper . Scorers: Robson-Kanu (penalty) 25; Cox 34 . Norwich City: Ruddy; Whittaker, Martin (c), Bennett, Olsson; Howson, O’Neil (Hoolahan ht), Tettey (Redmond ht), Johnson; Hooper, Jerome (Grabban 64) Subs not used: Rudd, Turner, Lafferty, Miquel . Scorer: Johnson 71 . Booked: Johnson, Martin . Referee: James Linington (Isle of Wight) Attendance: 19,340 (2,311 away) There was an end to their Madejski goal drought, dating back to November 4, with strikes from Hal Robson-Kanu, a penalty, and Simon Cox. That monkey is off their backs. And there was warm appreciation from the home crowd, who have noticed a swift improvement and seemingly taken Clarke (right) to their hearts. He already has a ‘Barmy Army’ in any case, singling lustily in the second half. Frustrations from the 1-0 home loss to Watford in his maiden match before Christmas and Inigo Calderon’s last-minute equaliser for Brighton on Boxing Day were replaced with cheer as 2014 ticks over into 2015. ‘It’s nice for me, I can enjoy a glass of red tonight, which always tastes a little bit better when you win,’ said Clarke. ‘I’m delighted with the players. Their application in the short time I’ve been at the club has been great. And I’m delighted for the fans.’ ‘Application’ was one of three qualities demanded by Clarke in his programme notes. The others were ‘attitude’ and ‘character’. The first two were in evidence from the off, as Reading set about their business energetically and incisively, gaining a two-goal lead by half-time. Reading's Chris Gunter gestures to referee James Linington after Norwich City's Bradley Johnson (not pictured) scores his side's only goal of the game before Reading had a chance to complete their substitutions . The ‘character’ part came towards the end, after Bradley Johnson’s thunderbolt in controversial circumstances gave Norwich, who had scored 13 in their three previous outings, hope of an unlikely revival. Johnson’s goal prompted howls of derision from the crowd as Reading were down to 10 men after Garath McCleary required treatment and about to make a double substitution. But just as the fourth official was about to illuminate his board, referee James Linington waved play on and Norwich scored. ‘The referee seemed to take the law into his own hands,’ said Clarke. ‘For some reason he wouldn’t let us make that change, it was extraordinary.’ Reading boss Steve Clarke celebrates after his side claim the three points against Norwich . Adams argued his players had technically done nothing wrong since the referee had allowed play to continue. In the end, it didn’t matter. The late Norwich onslaught never materialised and Clarke claimed his first victory in charge at the third attempt. They led on 25 minutes when Johnson got into a muddle and hauled down Michael Hector at a corner. Robson-Kanu sent John Ruddy the wrong way with his penalty. Nine minutes later, the lively Glenn Murray was played clear down the right following a neat passing move and crossed for Cox to finish. Clarke is keen on signing Crystal Palace striker Glenn Murray on a permanent deal . With time up on Murray’s temporary loan deal from Crystal Palace, this could be the last Reading see of him but Clarke is doing everything in his power to keep him. ‘It was hopefully not a farewell,’ he said. ‘He deserves the reception, he’s contributed with goals and good performances. There is a structure in place where we can do a deal.’ He added, as a caveat, that the dismissal of Neil Warnock as Palace boss had rather left negotiations ‘in limbo’. The same could be said of Reading’s season at times. Having missed out on the play-offs by a point last time, 16th was not where their fans expected them to be. But, with Clarke at the helm, the green shoots of recovery are starting to sprout.","Hal Robson-Kanu scored Reading's opener from the penalty spot .

"Caretaker manager John Carver has defended his team selection after admitting that Newcastle went out of the FA Cup with a whimper against Leicester. Several star performers were absent from the starting line up for the third round tie, as Carver made seven changes to the side that drew 3-3 with Burnley in the Barclays Premier League two days previously. Some Geordie fans criticised Carver, who plans to apply for the job of head coach, after seeing their only hopes of winning a trophy this season go up in smoke at the King Power Stadium. Newcastle's stand-in boss John Carver reacts during the defeat at Leicester in the FA Cup on Saturday . Leonardo Ulloa headed the only goal of the game just before half-time. It was a rare moment of brilliance in a game low on quality, despite the tie being the only one played on Saturday between two Premier League teams. A large proportion of the 4,319 travelling support turned on their team late on and even booed the Newcastle players, together with Carver, at the end of the game as they came over to applaud the fans. But Carver insisted he played his strongest available team, with Ayoze Perez the only player actually rested. 'I put out the strongest team - other than Ayoze Perez,' said Carver. Newcastle fans shouted abuse at their team at the end of the FA Cup Third Round match defeat . Newcastle players look dejected after the final whistle as Vurnon Anita applauds the travelling fans . 'Perez is coming into a new culture from Spanish football and he's one of our best players - one of our shining lights in a season when we didn't even expect him to be in the team. 'We thought he'd be one for the future, but he's gone into the team and has been outstanding. 'If you had seen him after the Burnley game or the following morning at the training ground, he'd ran out of fuel. For me to take a massive gamble 48 hours later with him would have been too big a gamble.' Carver also explained the other big-name absentees. He continued: 'Daryl Janmaat had a problem with his groin. Newcastle caretaker manager John Carver saw his side lose to Leicester in the FA Cup on Saturday . 'Moussa Sissoko - both of his hamstrings were tight and I didn't want to risk that. '[Fabricio] Coloccini had a problem with a nerve leading into his buttock. Steven Taylor we lost because of a snapped Achilles. 'Even the morning of the game we had Jack Colback travel with us despite having a tight hamstring. Unfortunately he felt worse and didn't play. That's why I didn't take the gamble and he wasn't even on the bench. 'Sometimes you have to look at the bigger picture. This was just one game, the future of this football club is over the next few weeks.' Leicester boss Nigel Pearson was also left counting the cost of injuries. Leonardo Ulloa (left) scored the only goal of the game as Leicester beat Newcastle in the FA Cup . Esteban Cambiasso added to Pearson's problems when he limped off with a tight thigh in the first half, leaving four of Leicester's central midfielders - Cambiasso, Andy King (thigh), Danny Drinkwater (groin) and Dean Hammond (calf) - nursing knocks. 'Esteban came off as a precaution,' said Pearson, who, like Carver, also made seven changes to his starting line up on Saturday. 'Danny Drinkwater had a scan the other day, and is not a long-term problem. 'Andy King is out, but should be back by next week. Dean Hammond is out, he's got a tight calf so couldn't play. So, we've got a few players to nurse through this period.' Leicester manager Nigel Pearson, talking to Carver on the touchline, has a host of injuries in his squad . Riyad Mahrez is set to go to the Africa Cup of Nations, as is Jeff Schlupp, although his departure is now in doubt after he suffered a knee injury in the 2-2 draw at Liverpool. Schlupp is part of Ghana's provisional 31-man squad for the competition that begins on January 17 and was due to fly out for a week's training camp on Monday before the final 23-man squad was selected. Pearson said: 'I am not saying he won't go, what I am saying is we will see how he is this week before he potentially joins the training camp. 'He is our player and, while they [Ghana] may have the ability to utilise international rules and regulations about calling players up, we will make sure that his well-being is top of the agenda.'","Leicester beat Newcastle 1-0 in the FA Cup Third Round on Saturday .

"Karl Oyston missed seeing Blackpool cast further adrift at the bottom of the Championship. The controversial chairman was not at Hillsborough where Sheffield Wednesday should have won in greater comfort. But the Seasiders did force the save of the match when Keiren Westwood somehow kept out Ishmael Miller's point blank header in the second half. Sheffield Wednesday's Chris Maguire is congratulated after scoring his side's opening goal . Sheffield Wednesday ace Maguire sends Blackpool's Joe Lewis the wrong way from the penalty spot . SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY: Westwood; Palmer, Lees, Dielna, Mattock; Maguire, McGugan (Lee 79), Semedo, Helan, Drenthe; May (Nuhiu 85) Subs not used: Kirlland, Lavery, McCabe, Zayatte, Maghoma .

Miller, earlier cautioned for deliberately palming the ball into the net, was sent off in stoppage time for a lunging tackle that produced a second yellow. There was a certain inevitability about a sterile first half between the two lowest scoring sides in the Championship. Even bottom team Blackpool had mustered one more than Wednesday's 16 league goals. It took a penalty for the Owls to draw level on 17, courtesy of a rash challenge by visiting defender Peter Clarke. Until that 37th minute flashpoint Blackpool had suggested they could mount some sort of recovery from last Saturday's 6-1 home defeat to leaders Bournemouth. Blackpool's Jacob Mellis attempts to win the ball however Joe Lewis gets the ball under control . Beyond an apology to fans, manager Lee Clark had refused to overreact, confining himself to four changes. Jacob Murphy came close to giving them a shock lead as Wednesday threatened only sporadically. But Stevie May, who failed with an early chance, forced the breakthrough in a run down the right. The danger seemed to be over as he lost control and tried to recover it, but Clarke lunged in and an assistant referee flagged for the penalty - Wednesday's first in the league this season - as May tumbled. Chris Maguire netted convincingly from the spot. Later, May was brilliantly denied by Joe Lewis as Wednesday's second half dominance failed to produce further goals.

"Blackpool have sent Jacob Murphy back to Norwich after a picture circulated on social media this week showing the on-loan winger mocking the Seasiders' plight. The teenager apologised on Monday for a leaked image of Murphy and fellow Blackpool loanee Donervon Daniels which was accompanied by the caption 'We are going to lose... Again'. The photograph was believed to have been taken before the club's most recent defeat against Sheffield Wednesday on Boxing Day. Murphy's snapchat mocking their plight before their trip to Sheffield Wednesday went viral on social media . Blackpool's on loan midfielder Jacob Murphy has apologised for his dismissive snapchat about the club . Blackpool boss Lee Clark said the matter would be investigated internally and the struggling Sky Bet Championship club have now elected to send Murphy, who was due to remain with them until February, back to Carrow Road. 'Jacob is a talented player with a bright future ahead of him and his recent actions should not detract from that,' Clark said on Blackpool's official website. 'However, he realises that he made an error of judgement and understands why we have come to this decision. 'The players and the team need to be fully focused on our fight to stay in the Championship.' The Seasiders are rooted to the foot of the division having only won twice all season and they remain nine points adrift of safety heading into 2015. Murphy (front) started the Tangerines' Championship match at home to Rotherham on Sunday . Despite his involvement, Donervon Daniels (left) claims he knew nothing of the picture's intended purposes . In his apology on Monday, Murphy, 19, had stressed he was keen to make amends on the pitch in Blackpool colours. 'It was totally unprofessional of me and a foolish thing to do,' Murphy said in an statement on the club's website. 'I'd like to offer my sincerest apologies to the manager, my team-mates, the fans and everybody at Blackpool Football Club for the hurt and embarrassment that a recent photo message I sent has caused. 'I have loved my time at Blackpool so far, and I've been really grateful for the support I've received. Blackpool boss Lee Clark condemned Murphy's action via the club's official website on Monday . 'I know I have let the manager and fans down badly but I aim to repay them by working even harder and helping the team climb up the league table. 'I'd also like to make clear that Donervon Daniels had no part in this and I apologise for implicating him.' Murphy became Clark's first signing at Bloomfield Road when he moved to the club in November. He made nine appearances in total and scored on his debut in a 2-2 draw at Fulham while also finding the net in a draw with Bolton later that month.","Blackpool lost 1-0  at Sheffield Wednesday on Boxing Day .

"Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini has revealed he would be interested in signing Lucas Leiva if Liverpool were keen on selling the Brazilian midfielder. 'Lucas is a great player but he is a Liverpool player and it will be hard to get him,' said Mancini. 'It certainly would be useful to us as he could help our youngsters grow.' The Brazilian star has started in six Premier League games for Liverpool and is under contract with the Reds until June 2017. Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini has revealed he would be interested in signing Liverpool's Lucas Leiva . Liverpool midfielder Lucas has started just six Premier League games so far this season . Inter Milan, on the other hand, have dismissed reports they are interested in signing Tottenham winger Aaron Lennon during the winter transfer window. The Italian outfit are looking to reinforce their attacking line when the window opens in the new year, but the England international is not one of their targets despite media speculation in England suggesting otherwise. 'Lennon? We are not interested in the Tottenham player,' Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio told his club's official website. 'He does not have the profile we are looking for. 'When you build a team you follow the guidelines of the coach at the same and that is what we did. 'Now we have a new coach (Roberto Mancini) and we will see what we can do in the transfer market in January. 'We will try to make the coach happy although we and our fans need to be realistic as we must respect our financial plan.' Mancini has refuted claims he is keen on signing Tottenham winger Aaron Lennon . Mancini, who replaced the sacked Walter Mazzarri last month to return to Inter for a second stint, also denied an interest in Lennon. The 27-year-old midfielder has had limited playing time under Spurs coach boss Mauricio Pochettino, starting just three Premier League games this season. 'We have not spoken about Lennon but about other players,' Mancini said. 'We will see what we are able to do. '(Atletico Madrid winger Alessio) Cerci? He could be an aim of ours but right now he is an Atletico Madrid player and we have to wait and see what happens.'","Roberto Mancini is interested in signing Liverpool midfielder Lucas .

"Alan Pardew will sign a four-deal at Crystal Palace after being given permission by Newcastle owner Mike Ashley to hold talks with the south London club. With Pardew set to leave St James' Park, we asked Harry Savill from The Spectator's View to comment on his impending departure. Upon arriving on Tyneside in 2010, a conspicuous outsider, it was clear from the very beginning that the appointment of Alan Pardew would cause controversy among the ever-expectant Geordie faithful. His managerial record up until that point had been underwhelming, and he had become just another face on the managerial carousel that spins between the dregs of the Premier League and the top of League One. He was, one might say, an Alan Curbishley or an Iain Dowie: a generic manager associated with little beyond actually just being a football manager. And when juxtaposed alongside his club’s coaching predecessors of Kenny Dalglish, Sir Bobby Robson and Kevin Keegan, he appeared a less than ambitious choice. Newcastle boss Alan Pardew will sign a four-year deal at Crystal Palace . The Newcastle fans wanted Pardew out after a difficult start to the 2014-15 Premier League campaign . Newcastle supporters hold up a 'Pardew is a muppet' banner ahead of their team's  clash against Stoke in April . His appointment at Newcastle was without doubt a flattering anomaly on his CV, and though he had fashioned for himself an image of high self-regard, he had never actually done anything in his career that had warranted such a lofty appointment, a seat in charge at one of the country’s biggest football clubs. And it didn’t take long for him to be branded ‘Mike Ashley’s Man’, a symbol of the much-hated regime which had stagnated the growth of the club over the past seven years. It would be fair to say that opinion on Pardew among Newcastle fans has been divided. To some (a distinct minority), it would seem blasphemous to dare criticise the man who guided Newcastle to fifth in 2012, while to others his record in the Tyne-Wear derby and in the domestic cups remain unforgivable. Pardew’s integrity as both a football manager and a man forms the basis of the majority of pub punditry (of which there is no shortage) on the Tyne and has done so ever since his appointment. As the nature of modern football decrees, the league must be treated as a priority - and yet, under Pardew’s guidance, Newcastle’s league standings over the past four years have fallen some way short of expectation. From the outsider’s perspective, 12th, 5th, 16th and 10th might not look bad for a team that was playing in the Championship just five years ago, but Newcastle are not a small club. Newcastle fans portray Pardew as Pinocchio during their side's match against Stoke in September . Supporters of the Magpies hold up a 'sack Pardew' sign at Stoke's Britannia Stadium . In the eye of the modern fan, Newcastle have been consigned to an afterthought of ‘past-its’, rather than ever noted as serious contenders. This, in part, has been down to a lack of ambition. Pardew (and indeed Ashley) seem perfectly happy to tread water, to do just about enough to satisfy the very minimum of fan demands and to keep the club chugging along. As a result, many fans have accused Pardew of merely towing the party line, attempting to stay in the good books of his puppeteer, Ashley. Unfortunately, however, passivity and hollowness have been the least of our worries when it comes to Pardew: the headbutting of David Meyler sticks most readily in the memory, but one must not forget his swearing at the much-revered Manuel Pellegrini, a verbal attack that verged on criminal. When it comes to tactics, too, he appears to be way out of his depth. He seems to completely disregard the positional strengths of our players (Hatem Ben Arfa, Remy Cabella, Sylvain Marveaux to name a few) who, under the right direction, should be challenging for top-seven football. These managerial shortcomings have manifested themselves in our awful domestic cup runs, and his quite frankly embarrassing record against Sunderland. Pardew was involved in a confrontation with Hull's David Meyler in March 2014 . The 53-year-old was also involved in an altercation with Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini . However, in spite of all of these glaring managerial infirmities, he has somehow clung to a sense of entitlement that has only served to intensify the dislike that surrounds him. Instead of being humble, he’s been brash and self-celebrating. And as a fan, it has become intolerable. We tolerate arrogance in football these days, perhaps because we have become immune to it. Though it isn’t the most endearing of traits in a sporting idol, often it can be just about justified through success. We may roll our eyes when Zlatan Ibrahimovic reminds us of his brilliance, but his goalscoring record is so unbelievably good that we can at least grant him liberties when it comes to self-appraisal. When the posturing and prancing comes from Pardew, however, whose sense of self-entitlement is so odious it is almost tangible, it is far less acceptable. He was someone who could bring about short-term gains. However, as demonstrated during his time at Newcastle, he was also obviously flawed and incapable of preventing alarming slumps in form, and for a man who is tied down to an eight-year contract, that sort of flaw is unforgiveable. When the Chronicle, in October of this year, conducted a poll on whether Pardew should be sacked from the job, a staggering 94 per cent of Newcastle fans called for his head. And when bearing in mind the popular opinion that this remaining six per cent was comprised of Sunderland fans, it is pretty clear just how disliked this man is on Tyneside and how little he will be missed.

"Sam Allardyce has admitted that Winston Reid has 'no future' at West Ham and expects the defender to leave when his contract ends in the summer. Reid has refused to sign a new deal with the east London club and it now appears his five-year stay will come to an end on June 30 when his contract expires. The 26-year-old failed to impress in his initial years in England after moving from Danish side Midtjylland in 2010, but he has grown to become one of the most accomplished defenders in the Premier League. Arsenal are leading the chase to sign West Ham defender Winston Reid who is out of contract this summer . West Ham defender Winston Reid, challenging Eden Hazard, is set to leave the Hammers this summer . But Allardyce conceded: 'There is no future for Winston Reid at West Ham at the moment. His contract finishes on June 30. He hasn't said he's going to sign or that he's not going to sign. 'I'm airing on the side that he isn't going to sign by the feel of it and look of it. Knowing how the football world works, talking to managers about the situation it's very unlikely Winston will sign for us given what people are saying to me.' Reid, in action against West Brom, has made over 100 appearances for the Hammers since signing in 2010 . Currently he is only free to talk to clubs outside of England about signing pre-contract terms. Arsene Wenger has sent Arsenal scouts to watch him in every game since November and are planning a £4million move for him in January.

"Steven Gerrard has described it as the 'toughest decision of my life' after announcing he will leave Liverpool. Steven Gerrard has officially announced that he will leave Liverpool in the summer, sparking tributes from his current team-mates and those who once wore the club's famous red shirt alongside him. Reds manager Brendan Rodgers, who says the word 'legend' doesn't do Gerrard justice, and 23 members of his squad have all had their say on their club captain. Former Liverpool players including Xabi Alonso, Michael Owen and Jonjo Shelvey have also praised the 34-year-old midfielder on Twitter. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the reaction to the news that Gerrard is calling time on his career at Anfield. Steven Gerrard, pictured celebrating against Leicester, has announced he will leave Liverpool in the summer . Brendan Rodgers: 'It is almost an impossible task to find the words to appropriately sum up Steven Gerrard and his importance to Liverpool,' Rodgers told the club's website. 'This is an era where the word ""legend"" is vastly overused, but in his case it actually doesn't do him justice. 'From a personal point of view I will always have gratitude for the support he gave me, when I arrived here as manager. 'Steven came to see me and promised he would be 100 per cent behind me and do everything he could to help as we looked to introduce new ideas and a new way of working. He wasn't just true to his word, he vastly exceeded it.' Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers believes the word 'legend' does not do justice to Gerrard .

I hope to be similar to Gerrard but it isn't going to be easy because he's been so successful.' Adam Lallana: 'I grew up watching him. To my best mates, he's their legend. For me to be playing alongside him, not just at England but at club level, is quite surreal really.' Rickie Lambert: 'Stevie is his own man but he is Mr Liverpool.

"Caterham administrator Finbarr O'Connell is hoping to deliver a happy Christmas present to the team's 230 staff recently made redundant. O'Connell is currently in serious negotiations with a potential buyer who not only has the financial muscle required to compete in Formula One, but more importantly also has a background in the sport. The 54-year-old Irishman believes a deal could be completed within the next three to four weeks in the run up to Christmas, allowing just enough time for the team to be on the grid for next season. Caterham administrator Finbarr O'Connell is in serious negotiations with a potential buyer . 'I am honestly talking to somebody who would like to take this over within the next month,' O'Connell said. 'This is somebody who feels the same as me, that if we don't do something quickly then the team will drift away. 'This is a credible person with credible backers, somebody linked to Formula One, and I am delighted about that. 'Talking to people with no Formula One involvement at all adds that huge risk factor, but this is somebody who knows it and who wants to do it. 'They'd like to take it over with the same people and with the same infrastructure, as the same team, and that would be the dream result for me. It would be absolutely fantastic.' O'Connell has stated it was through Caterham being in the shop window in Abu Dhabi over the weekend that resulted in the interested party coming forward. The Leafield-based marque went into administration last month, but via a crowdfunding project organised by O'Connell was able to hit their initial £2.35million target, actually going over by £4,334. O'Connell believes a deal could be completed within the next four weeks, allowing enough time for the team to be on the grid for next season . Caterham then put up a credible performance on track with a skeleton staff of just 40 people at the Yas Marina circuit all operating on a consultancy basis. 'The weekend advanced the talks with the buyer as they saw we are not just the concept of a team,' added O'Connell. 'They could see the people here are committed, together, that we're an operational team, and that was really attractive.' Crucially for the buyer, there will be no trace of the two previous regimes following the fallout between the Swiss and Middle Eastern consortium who originally purchased the marque from Tony Fernandes in June, only to throw in the towel in October when a row ensued. Will Stevens talks with a team member during the first free practice at the Yas Marina racetrack in Abu Dhabi . 'A number of people have approached me over the past few weeks that they were not happy with this or that,' said O'Connell. 'One example is somebody paid for expensive paddock club tickets for one of the events and didn't receive them. Obviously we've other things on a much-bigger scale. 'So many people have come forward and been unhappy about things that have happened in the past, that they've been misled about things, and I'll be investigating that. 'But what happened with the previous owners doesn't affect a new buyer at all. The buyer buys things clean of any issues.'","Finbarr O'Connell in talks with potential buyer for Caterham .

"Caterham have been given dispensation to compete in 2015 with this year's car should a buyer be found for the team. The key decision was taken during last week's Formula One Commission meeting in Geneva, and allows administration-hit Caterham an opportunity to be on the grid next year. For a potential purchaser it now means there is no pressure to build a car for 2015, particularly as time is of the essence, and all the inherent costs that would apply. With the decision to be ratified by this week's meeting of the World Motor Sport Council in Doha, it would allow a new owner to at least be in F1 with a base on which to build for 2016. Caterham will be allowed to compete in the 2015 Formula One season should they find a new buyer . Speaking to Press Association, administrator Finbarr O'Connell said: 'The F1 Commission and FIA agreed if it would assist the weaker teams they can use the 2014 car next year, so giving them more time and options. 'That is of interest to all the parties I'm talking to because it gives them a choice, an easier start to get into F1 if they chose that route. It helps.' Following Leafield-based Caterham's appearance at the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi last month, O'Connell had stated a deal before Christmas was crucial if the team were to survive. The F1 Commission's decision has now taken some of the burden off of O'Connell to conclude a sale prior to the festive season. The struggling team have been desperately trying to raise funds to stay on the grid . 'Before Christmas would still be ideal,' added O'Connell. 'It now doesn't have to happen by then, but the earlier the better from my point of view, and I'm encouraging people as much as I can. 'It's a very difficult purchase decision for any party because of the huge costs involved in running a F1 team. 'I'm still talking to a few interested parties, and I'm hoping one of them can do the deal. 'The number of people I'm talking to has increased, with two very strong candidates, and a third less strong. 'All I can do is show what I have, show the team, the assets and the facilities, and facilitate in any way I can with them making a decision.

"Nick Compton will always remember the moment he heard that his great friend Phillip Hughes had been seriously hurt doing what they both loved to do, batting. 'I just broke down for hours and hours,' said the man with perhaps an unlikely but very firm bond with the Australian. 'I really struggled. I just spent two days indoors. It was the immediacy of it that was such a shock. That you could lose someone you're really close to in an instant. 'My first instinct when Phil was struck was ""I've got to get out there"". And when he died I knew I had to go to the funeral. I had been organising flights to go and see my family in South Africa over Christmas when I heard about the accident so I just booked a flight to Sydney as well.' Nick Compton attended the funeral of close friend Phillip Hughes, travelling to Macksville to pay his respects . Compton (left) and Hughes became close friends during their cricketing careers . What followed was a desperately painful but also uplifting experience for a man who credits Hughes with inspiring his own rise, from their days together as two young Sydney grade cricketers to opening the batting for their countries. 'It was a tragic and surreal experience but it also became very special,' said Compton. 'Seeing not only all the family and friends of Phil but also the Australian team and greats like Shane Warne, Steve Waugh and Brian Lara. 'It was a real celebration of Phil's life and I will always be thankful that I went. Driving up to Macksville from Sydney, walking around the town that he loved so much and getting a feel for the place. 'I was able to connect with everyone and appreciate just how much Phil meant to people. I went to his favourite Chinese restaurant with a group of his friends and we ordered his favourite dishes and shared our memories of him. 'The service itself was so emotional and moving. You meet people in life who you just click with and who touch you. We were such different characters in so many ways but that's how I was with Phil. 'It's funny. I thought I had something pretty unique with him but talking to people I realised there were at least 50 others who felt exactly the same as me about him and had the same relationship. That made me smile.' Compton credited the presence of Brian Lara (left) and Shane Warne at Hughes' funeral . Australia captain Michael Clarke gave an emotional reading at the funeral of Hughes . Compton and Hughes were clearly something of an odd couple, proof that opposites can attract. The straightforward Australian country boy with an extravagant and unorthodox approach to batting and Compton — a deep thinker and accumulator of runs rather than an entertainer, different in style not only to his Aussie mate but also his legendary grandad Denis. 'It was when I went to play for Western Suburbs in 2008 that I met Phil,' said Compton. 'We struck up an immediate friendship and he had a big influence on me. He was a very confident character who played with no fear and had a really infectious personality. 'We kept in touch and then Phil lived with me when he came over to play at Middlesex the following year. He was always a great support to me. I was older but I really looked up to him. It was impossible not to be uplifted by Phil.' Compton is adamant that his great friend would not want cricket to change in the wake of his tragic death following a bouncer delivered by Sean Abbott at the Sydney Cricket Ground that struck him on the back of the head and caused catastrophic brain damage. 'I can hear what Phil would say as if he was here in my front room now,' said Compton. 'He loved cricket, loved the team and loved talking about it. He would say it was a freak accident and he would want us all to get out there and keep on playing in the same way. I really hope the game doesn't change as a result. Bats line up in honour of late Australia cricket player Hughes during the first test between Australia and India . 'But it will change the way we all feel when we go into bat, I'm sure about that. As a batsman you always accept that you may get hit and hurt but I don't think any of us ever thought that we might get killed. We know we can now. 'I hope it brings cricketers closer together. That everyone will respect each other on the field and show more humility at times. Life can be very short. Phil was a big family man, the son of a banana farmer who spoke to his dad about four or five times a day. In the seven or eight days I spent in Sydney what struck me was how strong the traditional values he had were, a love of family life and going home whenever he could. I hope it makes us all realise what's important.' For Compton that reminder was timely. He has had, by his own admission, '18 months of introspection' following his axing from the England team just as he was on the verge of fulfilling his childhood dream of playing in the Ashes. He had been given his chance as Alastair Cook's opening partner in India in 2012 as a reward for the prolific county career he was having after leaving Lord's for Somerset. In nine Tests he scored two centuries but seemed to freeze when in sight of the big prize, scoring seven runs from 45 balls against New Zealand at Headingley in what proved to be his last Test innings to date. 'Was I too intense in that innings? Well, you can read a lot into it but I'm sure every batsman is tense at times, even Sachin Tendulkar,' said Compton. 'Alastair was going very well at the other end and I didn't think I was batting too slowly at the time. He was smashing it while I was struggling for timing, but I didn't feel the need to have a hack. It was only afterwards that I realised I might have done things a bit differently.

'The selectors did what they thought was right and who am I to argue, but it was a massive blow to me to miss the Ashes. It's something you work towards and dream about. 'It was tough after I was dropped. I couldn't help thinking 'what now?' And perhaps I didn't do myself any favours by speaking out about it. 'I would love to play for England again and I certainly haven't given up but if I don't play again I can look back on some special memories. 'Hitting the winning runs in Mumbai, with my mum there, was amazing, as was scoring a century against New Zealand in Dunedin in front of my dad. Just being in the England side with so many great players was special.' Compton will attempt to prove that, at 31, he still has time to play for England. He is again back at Lord's after a surprise return to Middlesex this month despite signing a new three-year deal with Somerset in 2013. 'It was a tough decision, but it came about after a challenging time,' said Compton. 'Being closer to family and friends had something to do with it but also after losing my England place I had to think about what direction I wanted to go in. Compton pictured in action for England during the tour match against Haryana in India 2012 . 'I'm returning to a club that's close to my heart and where it all started for me. Perhaps being back at Lord's might help me get back with England. I'm only just over 30 and I still feel young and at the peak of my powers. Somerset were very understanding and I will always be grateful for what they, and particularly (former director of cricket) Brian Rose, did for me.' The decision was taken before Hughes' death but the sense of a fresh start seems all the more apt for Compton now. And perhaps a new approach to batting. 'I certainly hope to have him with me when I go out to bat again,' said Compton. 'And I think after the introspection of the last 18 months it might be time for me to have a bit of the Phil Hughes attitude. 'He was a fighter who took it to the opposition and I want to have some of that. I've never believed intensity was a bad thing but it can't affect everything. I think there's more to my game than has perhaps been seen by England and it's up to me to show positivity and allow myself the freedom to prove it. 'I want to reignite my game. And I want to do it Phil's way.'","Nick Compton first met Phillip Hughes in Australia in 2008 .

"Caterham administrator Finbarr O'Connell has launched an investigation to determine whether there were any behind-the-scenes irregularities that may have resulted in the team's demise. The Leafield-based marque are back on the grid at this weekend's last race of the current Formula One season in Abu Dhabi after being given dispensation to miss the last two in the United States and Brazil. A crowdfunding project that has so far raised £2million has extended the life of the team and put them back in the shop window, with the hope a buyer will come forward and take them into 2015 and beyond. Caterham administrator Finbarr O'Connell is investigating if any irregularities lead to the team's demise . Caterham's new driver Will Stevens in talks with a team member during the first practice round . O'Connell sits at a telemetry booth in the pits during the second practice at the Yas Marina circuit . O'Connell, serving as interim team principal, concedes he has three weeks at most to secure a new owner otherwise the plug will have to be pulled. In the meantime, it is also part of his duty to look into why the team has ended up in such a mess following a takeover in June. A consortium of Swiss and Middle Eastern businessmen took up the reins passed on by Malaysian entrepreneur Tony Fernandes, owner of AirAsia and chairman of Barclays Premier League side QPR. The consortium, however, bailed out in October, citing an issue over the transference of shares, with Fernandes claiming he had not been paid. O'Connell is determined to get to the bottom of the matter for the sake of his creditors, on whose behalf he is working to ensure they get a return on monies owed. Speaking in the paddock at the Yas Marina circuit, the 54-year-old Irishman said: 'As administrator I'm clearly trying to sell the business. 'But another thing I have to do is investigate how the business was run. Anybody who was running it improperly or who owes it money I have a duty to investigate them. 'If I think they're guilty of an offence, like wrongful trading or misfeasance, then I have to pursue them and get money back for the creditors. 'My investigation has already started, but the thing about it is you can do it after the heat of the sale, so I'm just getting all the papers together and my lawyers are going through those. That is a different phase. Caterham's Stevens during the first practice day at the Abu Dhabi Grand prix . The finale of the Formula One season comes to a close in Abu Dhabi on Sunday . 'But a number of people have already said to me they really believe there were things that went on here that need to be investigated.' Naturally of more pressing concern for O'Connell is his desire to find a buyer and secure the futures of the 230 staff he had to make redundant last week. In Abu Dhabi there is a skeleton crew of 40 people readying the cars, all of whom are working on a consultancy basis for a nominal payment, with another five back at the factory in Leafield. O'Connell added: 'I've had 50 approaches, and I think there are four parties who are serious. 'My analysis shows who they are and what they've got. For a couple of them it would make perfect sense for them to buy it. 'One purchaser I'm talking to, who is a perfect fit, is talking about a couple of months down the road. 'They've asked me not to sell the building (the factory) yet and to give them time to get a deal together. 'I've said to them the employees will drift away, and they've said it's a huge decision, that they hear what I'm saying, but they'll do it in their own time. 'So that's one of the purchasers not going to chomp now. 'Then there are some wealthy Middle Eastern people I'm meeting while I'm over here who could be one of those multi-billionaires who buys a team because they want one. 'They want to be an owner in the most exclusive club in the world. 'But as Bernie Ecclestone says, it has to be run by people who have a financial basis.'","Caterham's Finbarr O'Connell launched an investigation into irregularities .

"This may not have been enough to persuade the Crystal Palace powerbrokers to hand Keith Millen the manager’s job on a full-time basis. But the coach, taking caretaker charge of Palace for the third time, did his chances no harm as the South London club collected a hard-earned point away at Queens Park Rangers. It wasn’t pretty; not that Millen will care. Keith Millen took temporary charge of Crystal Palace when they traveled to Queens Park Rangers on Sunday . Neil Warnock was sacked as manager of Palace after four months at the helm at the Selhurst Park club . It’s clear Palace’s players are behind Millen; as they mustered a gutsy performance at Loftus Road as if to say: ‘Millen’s our man’. In confirming he wants to be considered for top job, Millen said: ‘I’m ready for it, yes. ‘The players respect me. I’ve done it enough times. Now the chairman will decide whether he needs more experience and what names are available. It’s a big decision because it’s a vital time now. ‘I’ve not been told I’ve got a chance, I’ve not spoken to the chairman in regard to myself. ‘It’s not a conversation to have on the day of the game, so I’m sure I’ll speak to him tomorrow. ‘I’ve worked with them for two years. I know what makes them tick and what bring the best out of them. So it will be down to the chairman to make that decision.’ Harry Redknapp is deep in thought ahead of his centenary game as manager of Queens Park Rangers . Players line up to acknowledge a minute's silence for the passengers on the missing AirAsia Flight QZ8501 . Harry Redknapp, however, won’t be quite as positive as QPR toiled against a Palace side whose confidence levels were at rock-bottom following the dismal few weeks of Warnock’s reign. On his big chance to impress Parish – who was sat next to close confidant Mark Bright – Millen’s first big call was to employ winger Wilfried Zaha as a lone centre-forward in an attempt to breathe life into Palace’s misfiring frontline. And Millen would have been satisfied with his side’s opening 45 minutes, restricting Rangers to one long-range Charlie Austin effort that was comfortably saved by Julian Speroni. Warnock’s dismissal prevented the veteran manager from returning to QPR – the club he led to the Premier League in 2011 – , but the home supporters were intent on acknowledge their ex-boss as they broke into cries of: ‘There’s only one Neil Warnock,’ in the 21st minute. Crystal Palace's James McArthur takes on Queens Park Rangers' Clint Hill (left) and Karl Henry (right) QPR (4-4-2): Green 7; Isla 6.5, Dunne 6.5, Caulker 6.5, Hill 7; Hoilett 5, Henry 7.5, Barton 7, Fer 6.5 (Vargas 65, 6); Austin 6, Zamora 6 (Phillips 75, 6).

Their good nature would have diminished just a minute later if Jason Puncheon’s curling effort from the edge of the area hadn’t hit Robert Green’s far post. The effort was the highlight of a drab opening 45 minutes; the encounter having little to offer in terms entertainment value – though the half-time marriage proposal between two Rangers fans on the pitch helped lift spirits following the woeful first period. The female supporter was in tears as she accepted her new fiance’s hand in marriage; maybe she was despairing at the prospect of another dire 45 minutes. And the second half started much like the first: big on work-rate but little in the way of quality. It’s probably the reason why both sides are looking worryingly at the Premier League table going into 2015. Leroy Fer went close in the 59th minute, forcing Julian Speroni into an excellent save before the encounter finally sparked into life. Green tipped over another curling effort from Puncheon in the 66th minute before Steven Caulker, who was target for Palace in the summer, thought he made the breakthrough 15 minutes from time, rising above Damien Delaney to thump a header from Joey Barton’s corner past Speroni only for James McArthur to produce a brilliant goal line clearance. And the visitors came desperately close to claiming victory with virtually the last kick of the game as Green saved Puncheon’s low drive from 13 yards before Palace were denied a penalty as Fraizer Campbell fell in the ensuing melee.

"Kumar Sangakkara reached 12,000 Test runs but bowlers were otherwise dominant on day one of the second Test between New Zealand and Sri Lanka in Wellington. A total of 15 wickets fell on a green track at the Basin Reserve - four of them to Nuwan Pradeep - as the hosts were bowled out for 221 before Sri Lanka slipped to 78 for five, Doug Bracewell taking three for 23. Sangakkara, though, stood firm on 33 not out having become the fastest player, and the first from his country, to break the 12,000 barrier. He is only the fifth man to achieve the feat. Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara (left) is clapped off by New Zealand players after reaching 12,000 Test runs . Sangakkara became the quickest player ever to reach 12,000 Test runs, and the first ever Sri Lankan . But it was a day for the bowlers at Wellington as 15 wickets fell on the first day of the second Test . New Zealand made a steady start after being put in, openers Tom Latham and Hamish Rutherford putting on 31 in seven overs before the former was caught behind off Suranga Lakmal. Kane Williamson was the lynchpin of the innings with 69, adding 31 with Rutherford who then gave wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene his second catch. Williamson and Ross Taylor put on 79 before Taylor (35) chopped on to become Pradeep's second victim. Brendon McCullum, who before the match had been presented with the freedom of the city of Wellington, failed to celebrate as he slashed his second ball from Lakmal on to the stumps. New Zealand bowler Jimmy Neesham (right) leapfrogs the wickets but knocks off the bails . Williamson's half-century arrived with an unconvincing edge short of first slip which bounced away to the boundary. It was his eighth four in 75 balls. But he lost further partners in Jimmy Neesham and BJ Watling before becoming the seventh man out as he went in similar fashion to McCullum and Taylor, bowled off the inside edge. Tim Southee became Pradeep's fourth victim and Bracewell was last man out after an enterprising last-wicket stand of 26 with Trent Boult. Sri Lanka opener Dimuth Karunaratne edged Boult to slip and Kusal Silva joined the ranks of batsmen playing on, though in unfortunate fashion as a defensive push at Bracewell came off the toe end, bounced up and looped onto the top of his stumps. Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara bats during day one of the second Test between Sri Lanka and New Zealand . But Sangakkara tucked Boult through the leg side for two to reach his landmark, joining only Indian pair Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, former Australia captain Ricky Ponting and South Africa all-rounder Jacques Kallis. The scoreless Lahiru Thirimanne almost immediately fended Bracewell to McCullum at short cover and Angelo Mathews made 15 before edging Southee to keeper Watling. Jayawardene joined Sangakkara to see Sri Lanka through to the close, making six before falling in the final over to end the day's play.
