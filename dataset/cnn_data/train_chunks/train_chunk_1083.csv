"Anyone suspected of being a potential sex offender could have their internet use curbed and be banned from spending time with children without ever being convicted of an offence. Sexual Risk Orders will be handed to anyone who 'poses a risk of sexual harm' in Britain or overseas and will last for at least two years. Ministers said it was vital to making it easier for police to monitor sex offenders and would mean the UK has some of the toughest powers in the world. Monitoring: Anyone suspected of posing a risk of sexual harm could have their internet use curbed or be banned from being left alone with under-16s (file picture) Under the new regime police or National Crime Agency (NCA) officers will be able to apply to the magistrates' courts for a new Sexual Risk Order aimed at limiting the activities of individuals who they judge to be a risk but have not charged with an offence. A range of restrictions can be applied to individuals under the powers, such as limiting their internet use, stopping them from being alone with a child under 16 or preventing travel abroad. And breaching the order could see a person jailed for up to five years. Policing and criminal justice minister Damian Green said: 'The UK has some of the toughest powers in the world to deal with sex offenders. Warning: Home Office minister Damian Green said Britain would have some of the toughest powers in the world to deal with sex offenders . 'Today, we are going even further by giving police and National Crime Agency officers the power to place greater restrictions on any person they judge to be a risk. 'Our proposals support the Childhood Lost campaign to tighten the law on sex offenders and make it easier for police to monitor them. 'This is part of ongoing work by the Home Office led national group to look at how the police and other agencies can better identify and deal with sexual offending, ensuring victims are at the heart of the criminal justice system.' The proposals, tabled in the Antisocial Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill, also include a new Sexual Harm Prevention Order which can be applied to anyone convicted or cautioned for a sexual or violent offence, including where offences are committed overseas. The Sexual Harm Prevention Order lasts a minimum of five years and has no maximum duration, while the Sexual Risk Order lasts a minimum of two years and has no maximum duration. Both orders will have a lower risk requirement and their remit will be wider, meaning foreign travel restrictions can be applied. The new measures replace orders that can currently be imposed on sex offenders who have been convicted, cautioned, warned or reprimanded for an offence or those who pose a risk. Individuals will be able to appeal against the order and the police or the person concerned are able to apply for the order to be varied, renewed or discharged.","New Sexual Risk Orders for anyone who poses 'risk of sexual harm'

"Mayim Bialik rose to fame through her television . portrayal of a free-spirited teenager named Blossom and it seems her character's . personality traits are now mirrored in her own life. The actress, who played the lead role in Eighties American . sitcom Blossom, has written a parenting book titled Beyond The Sling: A Real-Life . Guide To Raising Confident, Loving Children The Attachment Parenting Way. The 36-year-old, who now stars in The Big Bang Theory as the brainy Amy Farrah Fowler, details how she breastfeeds her three-and-a-half . year-old son Fred and how she and her husband allow him and older son Miles, six, to sleep on mattresses on the ground with them every . night. Unconventional: Blossom star Mayim Bialik has a book about the attachment parenting method she has adopted. She has two sons, Fred, three and Miles, six . The Los Angeles-based star, who also has a PhD in neuroscience, follows the Attachment Parenting . method originally coined by Dr William . Sears, a U.S. pediatrician. The unconventional technique also involves potty training without . diapers, a natural birth and wearing a baby in a sling to ensure they remain . physically close to a parent’s body. Dr Bialik told Newsok.com: 'When we treat our children . kindly and expect love and give love, we hopefully are raising children that . then expect that and give that to the world around them. 'It is very consistent with a 'green' style of parenting.' Role model: The actress' unusual technique involves breastfeeding until her kids are three and co-sleeping with her children on mattresses on the ground . She and her husband of eight years Mike Roosevelt, 36, live . in a one-bedroom house. There is no playroom for their sons because the couple . do not believe in supplying their children with expensive toys. Dr Bialik, who is a spokesperson for America’s Holistic . Moms Network, said: 'Our society's obsession with consumerism, especially in . the realm of baby things, baby soaps and baby products… that's something that . my husband and I, partly for frugality and partly for environmental reasons, . have really rejected. Child star: Dr Bialik is most famous for her role in Eighties sitcom Blossom, playing the free-spirited teenager . New role: Dr Bialik currently stars as Amy on CBS's The Big Bang Theory . 'We figure everything out without spending a lot of money on . that kind of stuff.' She kept both of her children close to her person for many . of their first months by placing them in a sling across her body every day. The $35 sling was used for both Miles and Fred, who were . kept laid down rather than upright to ensure the baby kept its natural shape. Guide: The star has written a book about her unusual parenting methods . The couple have also allowed their children to develop correct . toilet habits as soon as they realise their body’s natural signals. Dr Bialik said in regards to diaper use: ‘You’re basically . training your child to use their pants as a bathroom and two years later we . have them turn around and do all sorts of complicated manipulations to get them . to unlearn.’ She added that she is motivated by a desire to be the best . parent she could possibly be. ‘Most of our life is centered around trying to be the parents . we want to be.’ The actress achieved her PhD in neuroscience in 2008. She looked to her doctoral thesis while she was researching her new book. She focused on the hormones of human attachment, which are often a big part in the emotional bond a parent forms with their child.","Actress Mayim Bialik, 36, co-sleeps with sons Fred, three and Miles, six months .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has revealed sledging was his only strength as a cricketer . As tensions between the Australian and Indian cricket teams reach boiling point, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has revealed sledging was his only strength as a cricketer. Speaking at an afternoon tea for the teams at Kirribilli House in Sydney on Thursday, Abbott spoke of his time as a cricketer during his student days at Oxford University. 'I couldn't bat, I couldn't bowl, I couldn't field, but I could sledge, and I think I held my place in the team on this basis and I promise there'll be none of that today,' said the former captain of Oxford's Middle Common Room team of the Queen's College. Emotions are riding high between the Australian and Indian sides following an explosive series that has featured plenty of sledging. Indian batsman Virat Kohli has been at the centre of the most recent quips, in which Australia's Brad Haddin called out while clapping provocatively: 'There he goes on his team again. It's all about you. It's all about the one.' The sledging appeared to be Haddin's way of getting back at Kohli for the still unknown remarks that were thrown his way on the previous day, as he walked out to bat with the game in the balance. His comment comes while emotions ride high between the Australian and Indian sides following an explosive series that has featured plenty of sledging. Pictured: Australian batsman David Warner and Indian captain Virat Kohli during a confrontation between Australia and India at the Adelaide Oval . Kohli (right) has been at the centre of the most recent quips, in which Australia's Brad Haddin (right) called out while clapping provocatively: 'There he goes on his team again. It's all about you. It's all about the one' Kohli was  recently criticised for revealing the heated words he shared with Mitchell Johnson (right) on the field: 'I was really annoyed with him hitting me with the ball and I told him 'That's not on: try to hit the stumps next time,' he told media . Kohli's response was to tell Haddin that this year would be his last series, Fairfax reports. 'It's very hard for them (Australia) to stay calm ... it really excites me and brings the best out of me, so they don't seem to be learning their lesson,' Kohli taunted after day three. However coach Darren Lehmann says he remains unperturbed by any remarks made on the field by either teams, so long as they actually stay between players and aren't repeated to media. His comment come after Kohli was criticised for revealing the heated words he shared with Mitchell Johnson on the field, which eventually forced the umpire to intervene. 'I was really annoyed with him hitting me with the ball and I told him 'That's not on: try to hit the stumps next time, not my body',' he later said. Pictured with Australian captain, Steve Smith Kohli, Mr Abbott made the remarks while speaking at an afternoon tea for the teams at Kirribilli House in Sydney on Thursday . Despite the opposing teams smiling broadly for pictures, it's feared things could get worse during next week's fourth and final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground . Abbott weighed into the debate over Australian captain Steve Smith's decision to delay the declaration in the third Test at the MCG as the hosts failed to take the remaining four wickets to win the match and take a 3-0 series lead .

Abbott weighed into the debate over Australian captain Steve Smith's decision to delay the declaration in the third Test at the MCG as the hosts failed to take the remaining four wickets to win the match and take a 3-0 series lead. The home side had to settle for a draw, but still reclaimed the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with an unassailable 2-0 lead in the four-match series. 'When I told people last night that I was lucky enough to be hosting the Australian and the Indian cricket teams here today, the only question that they assailed me with was 'What did you think of the declaration?',' Abbott said.","Abbott revealed sledging was his only strength as a cricketer during his student days at Oxford University .

"Lucas Tuppeny was born with a bowel defect and needed a colostomy but a series of mistakes by doctors left him in renal failure, needing a transplant . A 10-year-old who had to have a kidney transplant after mistakes by doctors at a private hospital left him in renal failure, has today been awarded £4.8 million in compensation. Lucas Tuppeny was born in January 2004 with a bowel defect, and required a colostomy, Judge Richard Parkes heard at London's High Court. A series of errors by medical staff at the Bupa Cromwell Hospital in Kensington, London, resulted in Lucas suffering renal failure. It left the youngster needing dialysis from the age of six months. In October 2005 he received a kidney from his father, Brock, who works in the oil industry. Lucas, who lived in Ruislip, Middlesex, at the time but is now settled with his mother, Therese, in Seattle, in the U.S., has had 28 procedures with a total of 149 days in hospital. And he will need another transplant in the future, the court heard. In spite of his problems, Lucas is an 'enthusiastic, optimistic, energetic and very sociable little boy', Christopher Johnston QC said. Asked how he was feeling by the judge, Lucas stood and said 'Good, your Lordship', adding he would be having a holiday in the Bahamas before going back to school. The judge, who approved the settlement against the hospital, which admitted liability, said: 'I am delighted to hear it. 'It is lovely to see you and I would just like to wish you all the best for the future. 'You are very lucky in your mum and your dad.' Both the judge and the hospital's counsel, Jeremy Hyam, paid tribute to the outstanding care shown by Lucas's mother. The judge, who had seen a video about Lucas, told Mrs Tuppeny: 'What extraordinary devotion you have lavished on your son throughout these difficult years. 'I don't think anyone on the outside would know what is involved. 'One can only watch with huge respect what you and indeed your former husband have done. 'Having seen the video makes one realise what a splendid young man Lucas is and what potential he has, thanks to you.' London's High Court heard the Bupa Cromwell Hospital in Kensington admitted liability. Judge Richard Parkes awarded Lucas's family £4.8 million in compensation to pay for his medical costs and future loss of earnings . Alison Eddy, a partner with lawyers Irwin Mitchell, said outside court: 'It is a huge relief for his family that the hospital and medical staff who cared for him have now agreed an adequate and fair settlement to cover his care needs both now and in the future. 'This young boy has suffered a catalogue of medical issues throughout his childhood and will face numerous problems in his future as his condition deteriorates. 'We are pleased that we secured this settlement for him and his family, who now have the financial security and reassurance that costs for his future treatment will be met. 'We hope that lessons are learnt by the hospital and their staff so that patient safety in this situation can be improved and each and every patient receives the best quality of care at all times.' The damages will cover Lucas's medical and care costs and anticipated future loss of earnings. A spokesman for the Bupa Cromwell Hospital told MailOnline: 'We did not own the hospital in 2004. 'However, we are very sorry that Lucas suffered these problems and would again like to apologise to him and his family. 'We hope that this settlement will give Lucas and his parents the security of knowing that his future care and support needs can be met. 'We wish Lucas and his family well for the future.'","Lucas Tuppeny was born in January 2004 with a bowel defect .

"Manchester United have announced that season ticket prices will be frozen for the 2015-16 campaign. It is the fourth consecutive year that prices have remained the same, despite a summer splurge that approached £150million and United's anticipated return to the UEFA Champions League next season. Based on information from the start of this season, the cheapest United season ticket for an adult aged between 21 and 64 is priced at £532 while the most expensive comes in at £950. Manchester United fans will pay the same amount for their season tickets during the 2015-16 campaign . United spent big on the likes of Angel di Maria last summer but that has not led to an increase in prices . Under 16s can buy season tickets for £190 and the most expensive over 65 ticket is £380. A club statement read: 'The club is delighted to announce that season ticket prices have been frozen for the 2015-16 season. This represents the fourth consecutive season and the fifth time in six years, that prices have been held.' The club's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward was writing to all current season ticket holders plus fans groups IMUSA and MUST on Friday to inform them of the freeze.

The club announced in November that revenue was down by almost 10 per cent for the first quarter of the financial year, a consequence of the failure to qualify for this season's Champions League. However the record kit deal with adidas and a 49 per cent growth in sponsorship income means the club remains profitable and United is able to absorb the financial shortfall without resorting to raising ticket prices.","Manchester United keep prices the same for a fourth consecutive season .

"Ronny Deila believes new signing Jo Inge Berget is a 'perfect match' for Celtic. The Norwegian international completed a six-month loan deal from Cardiff City on Monday and went straight into the Hoops squad for the first-leg of their Champions League third qualifier against Legia Warsaw in Poland on Wednesday night. The 23-year-old former Molde forward played for Deila at Norwegian club Stromsgodset and is happy to play 'anywhere up front', and it is that versatility which the Parkhead boss believes is crucial at this point in the season. New signing: Jo Inge Berget poses with a Celtic shirt at the check-in desk at Glasgow airport . Thumbs up: The new Bhoy joins his team-mates for the first time ahead of their Champions League trip . Speaking at the team's hotel in Warsaw, Deila said: 'I know Jo Inge from the past, we worked together at Stromsgodset. 'He is a very intelligent player, he is a player who knows my systems, he can play all the four forward positions - the two wings, the number 10 and number nine. 'So I am comfortable and I know he will bring something new to the team. 'We don't have many options in the wide positions and it is very hard these days when there is so much time left before the window closes to get people in and get people who know the way we want to play, so Jo Inge is a perfect match in that matter.' Acquired: Ronny Deila's side face Legia Warsaw in a Champions League qualifier in Poland on Wednesday . Berget is looking to achieve his ambition of playing in the Champions League following his whirlwind move to the Scottish champions. 'It happened pretty fast,' he said. 'I heard a couple of days ago that Ronny was interested and I am really happy that it worked out. 'I played for him for a year and a half, I know him well and he knows me. 'He wants to play football, entertaining football, the same as me. 'I have been in the qualification (rounds) before but have never played in the Champions League so hopefully I will be able to get there. 'That is the goal for the club and it should be a goal for the club as big as it is. 'This is a great opportunity for me, it is a great club and I hope it works well. 'It is up to me. It didn't really work out for me in Cardiff, I didn't play as much as I wanted to but hopefully it will turn around here.' Shipped over: Berget was brought to England by Cardiff boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in January . Deila, in what is becoming a familiar way, straight-batted questions about other possible new signings, saying: 'We are working very hard to improve the squad, working on different players. 'You need to have a list as you can't always get your first choice. 'But we have a good scouting department and we have a lot of options.' The Norwegian insists the squad he has at his disposal now is improving daily and was particularly impressed by the way Celtic dispatched Iceland side KR Reykjavik 4-0 in the second-leg of their second qualifier at Murrayfield to win 5-0 on aggregate. 'In the last game against KR Reykjavik we controlled the game and we were good when we lost the ball so I am pleased,' he said. 'The passing has to be even better and the awareness and defensive marking, so we still have things to work on. Signed: Jo Inge Berget has joined Celtic on loan from Cardiff after failing to impress Ole Gunnar Solskjaer . Void: Berget is set to fill the gap left at Celtic Park by Tony Watt following his move to Standard Liege . 'But the players are working very hard and there is a lot of quality in the squad so I am very happy right now.' While Berget was added to the squad, striker Tony Watt has left after signing a five-year contract with Belgian club Standard Liege for a reported fee of £1.2million, a deal, which Deila insisted, suited both parties. 'He wanted to go, he wanted the opportunity,' he said. 'It is a big club so I think it is a good move for him, to grow up as a person and develop as a player. 'You never know what is going to happen in the future. 'I hope he succeeds because he is a very nice boy but right now I think it was the right time to try something else.'","Norway international joined on loan from Cardiff City on Monday .

"Boris Johnson was roundly criticised today after calling for British citizens travelling to Iraq and Syria to automatically be stripped of their passports. Richard Barrett, a former MI6 security chief, said the threat from ISIS was ‘unproven’ and needed to be better understood before new laws were rushed through. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg added that new legislation to combat the threat posed by British jihadists returning from the Middle East would not remove the danger from Islamic State extremists. Former MI6 security chief Richard Barrett (left) and Nick Clegg (right) have dismissed Boris Johnson's call for new laws to strip British citizens of their passports for travelling to Iraq or Syria . London Mayor Boris Johnson said he would like to see 'Jihadi John' killed in a bomb attack on Syria . Intelligence agencies are close to identifying the brutal killer of US journalist James Foley, believed to be a British extremist who has been dubbed ‘jihadi John’. Mr Johnson said Britain must take on ISIS and ‘try to close it down now’, warning that doing nothing would mean a ‘tide of terror will eventually lap at our own front door’. The mayor, who has overall responsibility for the Metropolitan Police, called for new laws that would mean anyone visiting Iraq and Syria would be automatically presumed to be terrorists unless they had notified the authorities in advance. Writing in his Daily Telegraph column, Mr Johnson said: ‘Young men such as this killer are famously told that if they die in 'battle' they will be welcomed in heaven by the sexual ministrations of 72 virgins. ‘Many of them believe it - even though scholars have suggested that the reference to 'black-eyed virgins' is in fact a promise of 72 raisins. I suspect most of us don't give a monkey's what happens to this prat in heaven, whether he meets virgins or raisins - we just want someone to come along with a bunker buster and effect an introduction as fast as possible.’ But Mr Barrett, former global counter-terrorism director of MI6, told The Guardian: ‘This fundamental tenet of British justice should not be changed even in a minor way for this unproven threat - and it is an unproven threat at the moment.’ He said the Government needed to understand better the domestic threat posed by ISIS before introducing new laws. ‘I don't think we should change the laws without a very much more thorough assessment and understanding of the threat,’ he said. ‘Sure, there's a problem with people who go to Syria and they may have broken the law if they joined organisations like Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, but there should be some sort of effort to prove that, rather than assume they've done so.’ And former attorney general Dominic Grieve said Mr Johnson's suggestion that those travelling to Iraq and Syria should be presumed guilty was ‘draconian’. One suspect in the brutal murder of US journalist James Foley is the British 23-year-old Abdel-Majed abdel Bary . Bary - an amateur rapper from London - is believed to have travelled to Syria last year. His Egyptian-born father was extradited from London to the States in 2012 for his alleged connection to Osama bin Laden and the 1998 US Embassy bombings in Africa . Speaking during a visit to India, Mr Clegg added: ‘I think the issue is incredibly important, that we should make sure that those young men, and it is invariably young men, who are attracted to this hateful ideology that draws them to the bloodshed and conflict in places like Syria and Iraq, they shouldn't be able to come back and do harm on the streets of British towns, villages and cities, and that is now our number one priority. ‘It's what the police, the authorities and security services are working flat out on; I have huge confidence in the outstanding work they do. ‘With the greatest respect to Boris Johnson, I will listen to what they tell me they need rather than what he says. ‘We actually have a number of measures already on the statute book which allow us to keep a very close eye on those people who aren't in prison, aren't sentenced, but nonetheless are perceived to be a threat to the United Kingdom. ‘And of course, we will continue to review all the powers on the recommendation of the police and security services that may be deemed to be necessary to deal with this very serious issue.’ He added: ‘I sometimes wish it was as simple as Boris Johnson implies: all we need to do is pass a law and everything will be well.’","London Mayor called for those fighting abroad to automatically lose passport .

"Tartan terrorist: An undated picture of Scottish separatist Adam Busby who has been charged with emailing a series of bomb threats to Pittsburgh University . The founding member of a Scottish terror group has been charged with emailing 17 bomb threats to the University of Pittsburgh which caused widespread panic and forced the evacuation of more than 100 buildings. Adam Stuart Busby, 64, currently in custody in Dublin, Ireland, allegedly sent a series of threats to the school between April 6 and 21, and sent similar emails to federal courthouses in Pittsburgh, Erie and Johnstown in June. Busby is also charged with threatening Pittsburgh-based U.S. Attorney David Hickton - who led the investigation that resulted in Busby's indictment - in a June 20 email. A prolific hoaxer, Busby was convicted in Ireland in 2010 for sending a series of emails claiming . that there were explosive devices on flights between London's Heathrow . Airport and New York City. He was sentenced to four years in . prison but was released early this year and allegedly sent the Pitt . threats before he was returned to prison last month. It is not clear when he will be brought to Pittsburgh to face the new charges. Curiously Busby has no known ties to Pittsburgh or the university, and Mr Hickton wouldn't comment on why he allegedly sent the threats or whether they're related to his activities with the Scottish National Liberation Army, an outlawed militant group that seeks Scottish independence from the United Kingdom. Busby is now charged with threatening to poison some English water supplies and then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2010, along with some bomb hoaxes he allegedly called in to hotels and the media. He suffers from multiple sclerosis and appeared in a wheelchair before the High Court in Dublin last month. The university began receiving bomb threats written on bathroom stalls in mid-February, for which nobody has yet been charged. Investigators don't believe those threats are tied to Busby, who allegedly sent his emails to capitalize on the momentum from the earlier threats. The university was eventually the target of more than 40 emailed threats - some sent to the school, and others to local journalists who alerted authorities - all of which are attributed to Busby, though he's charged with sending only 17 of them. Hickton said the investigation involved complex efforts to trace the emails through overseas computer servers. Typically, federal authorities in wire fraud cases file charges for only a representative sampling of counts for which they have the most evidence. In all, the university received 52 threats against 160 buildings that prompted 136 evacuations, Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg said Wednesday. Students wait on the street after being evacuated from the University of Pittsburgh after a bomb threat was received in April . Prosecutors also announced new charges . against two Ohio men, including one previously charged in June, for some . YouTube threats that claimed university computers had been hacked. Those threats are not directly related to the bomb scares, but were . uncovered as a result of the same investigation . Some emailed threats claimed to be sent by a group calling itself The Threateners - now identified as Busby - who expressed anger that the university issued a $50,000 reward for what the email suggested were harmless pranks. Busby, as The Threateners, allegedly emailed the student newspaper, The Pitt News, promising to stop if the university withdrew the reward. The university complied on April 21, although school officials didn't explain then why the reward was being withdrawn. Busby faces 17 counts of wire fraud, each carrying up to 20 years in prison, 16 counts of sending false information or hoaxes each carrying up to 10 years, and two counts of international extortion, which carry up to two years each. The April 21 reward ultimatum wasn't deemed a hoax because the threats stopped after the university withdrew the reward. The extortion counts relate to the ultimatum and a similar April 10 email that the university disregarded as unreliable because it contained misspellings and factual errors, Nordenberg said. The threats cost the school more than $300,000 in direct expenses, including overtime for police and other staff, bomb squads and special equipment to detect such devices. That doesn't include time lost by faculty and students, who were evacuated from dorms at all hours. Busby is the only person so far to be charged in connection with the bomb threats, though federal authorities charged an Ohio man in June with the YouTube video. That man, Alexander Wakeland, 24, of Loveland, Ohio, was charged again Wednesday along with Brett Hudson, 26, of Hillsboro, Ohio, with conspiracy to target Pitt with Internet threats for the video and related emails and tweets from April 25 through May 23. The men, allegedly claiming to be part of the hacking group Anonymous, threatened to release the computer files unless Nordenberg publicly apologized for not safeguarding students from the bomb threats. Pitt officials determined the computer information was never hacked. The men declined to comment when reached by the AP. Hickton said Wakeland and Hudson will turn themselves in next week to be arraigned on the charge, which carries up to five years in prison.","Hoaxer Adam Stuart Busby, 24, accused of emailing 17 bomb threats .

"A seven-year-old boy has died in hospital the day after being hit by a stray bullet as he walked to a July 4 fireworks display with his father. Brendon Mackey was only a few steps behind his father when he collapsed in the car park of a Virginia restaurant at about 9pm. It wasn't until he was being treated in hospital that doctors discovered the gunshot wound in the top of Brendon's head. Shooting victim: Brendon Mackey was killed by a stray bullet as he went to a fireworks display with his father . Investigation: Police cordon off the restaurant car park where Brendon was hit by a stray bullet . Police believe the shooting was an accident, and said it was possible someone near the Boathouse Restaurant in Midlothian had fired a gun in the air to celebrate Independence Day, according to CBS 6 . 'We don’t think this was an intentional . shooting. We think that somebody in or around the Brandermill area was . celebrating the Fourth of July,' Chesterfield Police Captain Brad Badgerow said. 'Unfortunately we think they were . shooting a gun in a reckless manner and this young boy is a victim.' Brendon, who was due to join the 3rd grade at C. E. Curtis Elementary in Chester, had been walking to the crowded fireworks display at Swift Creek Reservoir in Brandermill when he suddenly collapsed to the ground, bleeding. At first his father, Ryan Mackey, thought he had passed out and knocked his head. Tribute: The parents of Brendon Mackey remember their son, who loved golf and SpongeBob Squarepants . Emergency teams who were working at the display rushed to his aid. When he was taken to hospital, doctors discovered he had been shot in the head. Celebratory gunfire is responsible for a number of deaths in the U.S. every year. Because most victims are hit in the head by falling bullets, the chance of being killed is 32 per cent compared with 2 per cent to 6 per cent for most gun shot wounds. A study of celebratory gunfire victims treated at a Los Angeles hospital found that between 1985 and 1992, 118 people were hit and 32 were killed. A US Davis Medical Center study found across the U.S. 317 people were injured by stray bullets between March 2008 and February 2009. Of those 20 per cent died. Most victims are nowhere near where the gun was fired, such as Amish teenager Rachel Yoder who was killed in 2011 by a bullet fired into the air 1.5 miles away. Many cities and built up areas have banned firing a gun unless in self-defense. Celebratory gunfire has been banned in several states including California, Texas, Arizona and Ohio. Mr Mackey has paid tribute to his young son, who loved golf and SpongeBob SquarePants, according to NBC12. Michelle Ryan, who lives near the reservoir, said: 'I haven't known this area to be violent or for people shoot guns.' 'It's really devastating,' she told WTVR. As news of the shooting spread . residents and staff at the Boathouse Restaurant called on anyone who saw . someone firing a gun to contact police. 'Put yourself in the family’s shoes and . think about how terrible it is that they are going through this tragedy . and reach out to us so we can help them,' Captain Badgerow said, as he called for witnesses to come forward. Lieutenant Randy Horowitz said police . believe the fatal shooting 'was a result of someone shooting randomly . into the air, likely from a distance, and not an intentional act', . according to the Times-Dispatch. Young Brendon was not the only victim of celebratory gunfire during the July 4 festivities. A 26-year-old woman who was watching a fireworks display with her brother in Florida, was shot in the leg. April Johnson was sitting by the edge of a street in Fort Lauderdale when she felt a pain in her thigh and saw blood coming from her leg. Family outing: Brendon and his father Ryan were on their way to see fireworks near the Boathouse Restaurant . 'This is exactly what we always warn against - people celebrating by firing their guns into the air,' sheriff's spokesman Veda Coleman-Wright told the Sun Sentinel. 'Those bullets come down just as fast as they go up and the last thing you want is for someone to be injured or killed by a stray bullet.'","Gun fired in the air as revelers celebrated Independence Day, police say .

"Antonio Valencia's absence from Manchester United's squad for the New Year's Day clash against Stoke was because of a thigh strain. The Ecuador star was replaced by Rafael at half-time as Louis van Gaal's side drew 0-0 with Tottenham at White Hart Lane last Sunday. Valencia has emerged as United's first-choice right back under Van Gaal and had started the previous 10 Premier League games.

The extent of the injury and the length of time Valencia will be missing is not yet known, but Van Gaal will hoping it is not serious as the Dutchman has lost faith in Brazilian right back Rafael, who was left on the bench for the clash at the Britannia. It is a position that United are prioritising in the January transfer window. The injury will irk the former Holland manager further after the 63-year-old has vented his frustration at the number of fixtures during the traditionally busy festive period. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal speaks during a press conference on Tuesday . Ahead of the New Year's Day clash Van Gaal told Sky Sports: 'You cannot recover your body. That's my opinion, but it's also scientifically proven. I don't think you have to do that to the players.' The United boss was echoing his complaints made on Tuesday where he insisted the players' safety was being jeopardised by the quick turnaround of fixtures. 'Everybody knows that a body cannot recover within 48 hours. A frustrated Van Gaal makes a point to the fourth official during the match at White Hart Lane on Sunday . 'Therefore, there is a rule at UEFA and FIFA that you cannot play the games so close. OK, that I have said. 'That’s scientifically proven, I have said that also. Everybody knows that and in spite of that, we have to play. 'It’s the culture of England. I don’t mind but it is not good for the players, for the health of the players and what I say now is it is not good for the game because I think that the FA, but also the fans, want attractive games.'","Antonio Valencia was taken off at half time against Tottenham last week .

"It was hailed as the first proof of Viking exploration to the America and the earliest known map of the New World. Moreover, the Vinland Map was used by some to claim that the Vikings had discovered America 50 years before Christopher Columbus. Now a Scottish independent researcher has used simple Google searches to investigate the map and claims to have uncovered new proof that suggests it is an elaborate fraud. The Vinland Map was uncovered in the 1950s and was hailed as the first map showing the New World (circled). However, amateur researcher John Paul Floyd has found evidence that suggests it is a fake . Historians believed the map was proof of Viking exploration to the Americas before Christopher Columbus . John Paul Floyd, 43, from Glasgow, says the controversial map that has divided experts since it was uncovered in 1957, was forged and drawn on a 15th Century parchment. He claims the genuine parchment was stolen and the map drawn on its back was a fake. The map emerged on the international book market in the 1950s bound within two medieval documents,  the Tartar Relation and the Speculum Histioriale . According to Mr Floyd's research, the documents were ironically put on display in 1892 at an event commemorating Columbus but no record of the map exists. He believes this is because it was not drawn until decades later. The Vinland Map was verified in 1965 by experts from Yale University and the British Museum, who said it dated from about 1440. It depicted exploration of the east coast of the U.S., including Hudson Bay, Labrador and the Gulf of St Lawrence in Canada. However, its authenticity was immediately suspected by other academics who questioned where this hugely important historical document had lain hidden for so long. Mr Floyd said its display at the Columbus exhibition in Madrid is a 'remarkable twist'. Although archaeologists later found that Vikings had been to the Americas, Mr Floyd's research appears to show that the Vinland Map is a fake and was forged on 15th Century parchment . The Glasgow-based researcher said: 'The historical irony is breathtaking. 'The aim of the exhibition was to illustrate the richness of European civilisation around the time of the Columbus expedition. It is evident that there was still no map associated with the documents at that time.' Mr Floyd has also uncovered another reference to the two genuine documents, dated from 1926, in which the map was found. He says it was examined by Spanish priest and scholar Cristóbal Pérez Pastor but again there is no reference to the Vinland Map. The researcher has taken his detective work a step further. The Cathedral Church of Zaragoza provided the manuscripts, which contained the map parchment, to the Madrid Columbus exhibition. Mr Floyd, who is writing a book on the subject, says hundreds of rare books and manuscripts were stolen from the Zaragoza Cathedral Library in the 1950s - only a few years before the map emerged. Enzo Ferrajoli, the Spanish-based Italian dealer who sold the Vinland Map in 1957, was later convicted in connection with the thefts. The Vinland Map was verified in 1965 by experts from Yale University and the British Museum (pictured) Mr Floyd said: 'The fate of the Zaragozan items raises disturbing ethical questions. 'Many were acquired by respectable institutions which refused point-blank to return them.' His claims about the provenance of the Vinland Map have intrigued academics, who say they will investigate further. Peter Barber, the British Library's head of cartographical and topographical materials, told The Sunday Times: 'The map community is taking this seriously. 'Sometimes it takes an outsider to see the obvious.' Mr Floyd also believes that the forger of the Vinland Map copied the shapes from a 1463 world map attributed to the Venetian cartographer Andrea Bianco. He said slight deviations in a 1782 engraving of the Bianco Map, which differ from the original, show up in the Vinland Map. Despite the suspect provenance of the map, archaeologists have definitively proved that Vikings settled in the U.S. as early as the year 1000. In the 1960s a Norse settlement was excavated at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland by archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad and her husband Helge Ingstad.","Vinland Map hailed in 1950s and 60s as earliest depiction of New World .

"Microsoft has submitted a patent that could see the company track every TV show and advert watched via its Xbox One console and other devices. The application called 'Awards and Achievements Across TV Ecosystem' was submitted to the US Patent and Trademark office earlier this month. It details plans for Microsoft to reward viewers for watching adverts, TV shows or series, with virtual  scores, or physical awards such as coupons and products - although it is expected the plans will be opt-in, and not turned on by default. Scroll down for video . Microsoft's new Xbox One console has improved voice controls that can switch TV channels, for example, and an updated Kinect sensor that can monitor users' movements. A patent applied to the US Patent and Trademark Office by Microsoft has unveiled plans to potentially use such technology to track what TV shows and adverts users watch, and then reward them with virtual points or physical products . Drawings submitted by Microsoft in its Awards and Achievements Across TV Ecosystem patent show how the company plans to track and reward users for watching adverts and TV shows. In this image the Kinect sensor is highlighted on top of the TV, as is the console on the right-hand side. Although it is unclear exactly what platform the plans will launch on. Microsoft has filed the patent in a bid to launch a system that could see viewers given virtual scores and points to put towards new items for their avatars, or download TV and videos from the Xbox Live system . The patent submitted by Microsoft earlier this week doesn't confirm what platform the plans will apply to, or exactly how the viewing habit information will be stored. However, the application does states that once a user watches a relevant advert, TV show or series - called a 'user-viewing goal' - a response will be triggered. The user-viewing goal will be confirmed and an award will be granted. The type of award is expected to then depend on the type of show or advert watched - for example an advert might award virtual points, whereas watching a whole series might result in a physical product or free download. Virtual scores can be saved up and put towards new items for avatars. They can also be accessed remotely on other computers and devices. The application, originally found by Games Industry International, said: 'Television viewing tends to be a passive experience for a viewer, without many opportunities for the viewer to engage or have interactive experiences with the presented content. 'To increase interactive viewing and encourage a user to watch one or more particular items of video content, awards and achievements may be tied to those items of video content. 'Producers, distributors, and advertisers of the video content may set viewing goals and award a viewer who has reached the goals. 'By providing content viewing goals and awarding the viewer for reaching the goals, the present disclosure provides for an interactive television viewing experience. 'Additionally, by tying the awards and achievements to particular items of video or advertising content, viewers may be encouraged to increase their viewership of the content, thus increasing advertising opportunities.' The Xbox One has a built-in TV guide that can be opened using voice controls. If a patent application submitted by Microsoft is successful, users will be able to use this guide to search for specific TV shows and series that have rewards attached. Users can then watch these shows to earn the rewards and put them towards new items for their avatars, or media downloads . The new Kinect sensor can register even the slightest of movements because it uses 'time of flight' that records photons of light bouncing from the viewers body. Under the patent's plans, the Kinect would potentially be able to record where on the screen your eyes look, and measure your heart rate to tell how involved you are in a TV show or gauge your response to an advert . A chart, submitted in Microsoft's patent application, shows how its TV awards and achievements system could work . Examples given in the application include rewarding users for watching an episode, watching an 'entire series of linear video content', watching 'one or more commercials contained within the linear video content' and rewarding users for 'performing a specific action while watching video content.' This includes one-off events such as the Super Bowl, or watching series' which could include the Halo TV spin-off announced last week, being shown exclusively on the Xbox One. It is thought that the plans will be opt-in, and users can additionally search for and actively watch reward shows and adverts, to increase their achievements. The application doesn't specifically state what platform the plans will relate to. When asked about the plans, Microsoft told the MailOnline: 'Microsoft regularly applies for and receives patents as part of its business practice; not all patents applied for or received will be incorporated into a Microsoft product.' It is thought that if the plans are successful they will apply to the new Xbox One console, because of its new TV features. The latter reference in the application to 'performing a specific action' suggests that the plans will tie in somehow with Microsoft's motion-sensing technology Kinect. The new Kinect sensor can record eye movements and monitor heart rate. Under the patent plans, this means Microsoft would potentially be able to record where on the screen your eyes look, and measure how involved you are in a TV show or gauge your response to an advert based on your heart rate changes. It can also watch you in the dark. Photographers take photos of the new Xbox One console at the launch event in Washington last week. In a patent application filed earlier this month, the new console could track viewing habits of every user and reward them for watching certain shows or adverts . Microsoft goes on to say in the application that achievements would be in the form of 'virtual awards' - including a viewer score that could be linked to a user's avatar and would give those avatars 'new outfits, new vehicles, new homes' and 'virtual money to purchase different avatar items'. This score would then be visible to other users 'thus creating an incentive for each user to increase his or her score.' Microsoft continues that the virtual awards would be accessible on more than one computer or device. Elsewhere, Microsoft also adds that physical awards may be granted. These are described as 'coupons, . products, etc' and could be used to put towards downloading content such . as TV shows, videos and games through Microsoft's Xbox Live service. Microsoft's completely redesigned  Xbox Kinect sensor uses 'time of flight' and captures 2GB of data including heart rate, weight transfer and the slightest movements of joints. Under patent plans, users may soon be able to perform certain actions - that will be recorded using the Kinect sensor - while watching TV shows and earn rewards . Microsoft unveiled its latest Xbox console - the Xbox One - at an event in Washington last week. It was described as an 'all-in-one entertainment system for a new generation' and can be completely controlled using voice recognition and hand gestures. A new Instant Switching feature lets users ask the Xbox to 'watch TV', 'open Internet Explorer' or use it to change channels quickly without having to find the remote control. Microsoft's Xbox One also comes with a multi-tasking Snap Mode that lets users run more than one service at any one time, such as watch a film while checking emails on Internet Explorer. The awards and achievement plans outlined in the recent patent application are similar to those already used by gamers on the Xbox 360 console. According to the head of Civil Liberties Australia, Tim Vines told GamesFix: 'Microsoft’s new Xbox meets the definition of a surveillance device under some Australian laws, so they need to be upfront and tell customers whether anyone else can intercept their information or remotely access their device. 'The Xbox One continuously records all sorts of personal information about me. 'My reaction rates, my learning or emotional states. These are then processed on an external server, and possibly even passed on to third parties. The fact that Microsoft could potentially spy on my living room is merely a twisted nightmare.' A group of journalists try out the improved motion-detecting capabilities of the new Kinect sensor for Microsoft's Xbox One console system. The new Kinect, which will come standard with the Xbox One can also see users in total darkness and has a wider field of view than the previous Kinect device in use with the Xbox 360 .","Application submitted to the US Patent and Trademark office shows Microsoft's plans for tracking viewing habits of Xbox owners .

"A California man received a hospital bill following a straightforward appendicitis operation for so much money that it was surprising it didn’t make him unwell again. The 20-year-old was so shocked that the operation requiring just one overnight stay at Sutter General Hospital in Sacramento came to a whopping $55,000 (£33,000), that he posted scans of the bill on social media site Reddit.

Fortunately, his insurance company footed $43,000 of the bill, but he has been left with $11,000 to pay, which he said ‘is still a ton at this time in my life’. He described the costs of the services he received as ‘outrageous’, explaining that the recovery room he spent two hours in cost $7,500, the room and board nearly $5,000 and that they apparently used $4,500 worth of anesthesia on him. According to Healthcare Blue Book, a fair price for the whole procedure would have been $10,091, with anesthesia costing just $724. The bill showed the breakdown in costs, which included $7,500 for time spent in a recovery room . The site, which is designed to help users look up the fair market cash price for thousands of medical procedures, recommends that patients shop for the best possible price.

"The most exciting all-round talent in English and perhaps world women’s cricket was born in Tokyo and played football in a Polish youth league before finally taking up the game that would make her name. That most cosmopolitan of upbringings was the result of her mother working for the foreign office. But Nat Sciver is very much a product of Surrey, Loughborough University and an ever expanding English set-up. Now she is at the forefront of a group of young players, which includes Kate Cross and Tash Farrant, who will carry the flag for a professional England team as they attempt to establish cricket as the No 1 choice for elite sportswomen. Natalie, or Nat, Sciver was born in Tokyo and played football in a Polish youth league before taking up cricket . Charlotte Edwards, England’s long-serving and outstanding captain, is still the face of women’s cricket. But it is the new breed who will determine the long-term profile of the English game, not least the engaging Sciver. Sciver, 22, is a batting all-rounder good enough as a seam bowler to take a hat-trick in a Twenty20 international against New Zealand. Crucially, she is as powerful a striker of a ball as any woman in world cricket. Significant investment in the women’s game has seen the England team make great strides, but one of the biggest criticisms of them has been their lack of real strength, a failing summed up by their inability to regularly clear the ropes. That is where Sciver comes in. When she played tennis she struggled to keep the ball in play and when she plays golf she regularly drives the ball as far as most men. Most importantly, she can give a cricket ball a real whack. The 22-year-old considers her powerful striking of the ball to be one of her best strengths . ‘I’d like to think I’m the biggest hitter around,’ said Sciver coyly during one of England’s regular training sessions at Loughborough. ‘We’ve put quite a bit of emphasis on powerful striking, not necessarily hitting sixes, but everyone has been working hard on the technique of that. ‘It’s one of my strengths which I want to use in a game more often. ‘When I played tennis I couldn’t keep the ball in the court but luckily there are no restrictions in cricket. I guess I’m naturally strong.’ Strength is what England need. They have led the way in many of the improvements in the women’s game but their lack of collective power was summed up by the fact that they did not hit a single six between them in the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh in March and April. ‘The game is moving forward so quickly that this was always something we’d need to work on,’ said Sciver. ‘You can’t stand still. ‘Women’s cricket is getting more and more competitive and we have to keep up. Sciver celebrates taking a wicket against South Africa during the WT20 semi-final in Bangladesh . ‘We’ve taken a bit of baseball, both the technique and using the whole body, and it’s something we’ve been working on for a few months. ‘It’s hard to tell how far I can hit it now because I’ve only got the hall at Loughborough to go by but it’s something I want and need to take into games.’ It has been quite a journey for Sciver to where we are now, at the ECB Performance Centre at Loughborough where she has studied for the last three-and-a-half years and now shares a house with four other England cricketers. She spent the first two years of her life in Japan before a brief return to England and then a prolonged spell in Europe which saw her family based in Holland as well as Poland. Sciver played football competitively and tried her hand at other sports before settling on cricket when returning home for good at 14. ‘It has been brilliant,’ she says of her cricketing conversion. ‘My dad played at school and university and every summer after he left Cambridge he would have this weekend where he would get back together with his mates and play. Next on the agenda for Sciver is a tour of New Zealand, while another Ashes series awaits England’s women . ‘I used to go along with him and join in but they didn’t like it when a girl got them out! ‘So I started properly at Stoke D’Abernon because it was the only club with a women’s section near where I lived and I was lucky enough to have a Surrey coach. I was put forward for a trial and I went through the county system.’ She made her England debut just 18 months ago but has already become a key performer in all formats, while cricket became her career in May when the ECB took the momentous step of making the elite players full-time. Next on the agenda for Sciver is February’s tour of New Zealand, while another Ashes series awaits England’s women as well as men this summer. ‘Professional contracts have been a huge step not just for women’s cricket but women’s sport,’ said Sciver. ‘We’re standing on our own two feet which is really nice and there’s more and more development through the pathways and grass-roots. It’s growing all the time and it’s a really exciting time to be involved. As well as working on her hitting, Sciver wants to get faster with the ball - closer to the 75mph mark . ‘It has made everyone a bit more competitive and the battle for places is brilliant. You have more time to work on the game rather than having to work, too. I’ve got six months left on my studies [she is doing a sports and exercise studies degree] and have been balancing cricket and uni for a while now. Loughborough have been very accommodating and I’ve sat exams in Bangladesh and Australia among other places.’ As well as working on her hitting, Sciver wants to get faster with the ball and hopes to move towards the sort of speeds, 75 miles per hour plus, that have made her house-mate, Katherine Brunt, England’s fastest bowler. ‘I’ve been playing in the England set up for a year-and-a-half now and hopefully this isn’t it yet,’ she said. ‘It has gone pretty well. I haven’t had a down spell yet but, touch wood, the only way is up.’ She is certainly one to watch.","England's Nat Sciver is one of the brightest young stars of women's cricket .

"The Pakistan Cricket Board decided on Saturday to send only one of its two suspended offspinners, Mohammad Hafeez, to India next week for unofficial testing of his bowling action, while Saeed Ajmal will stay in Pakistan. Former test spinners Saqlain Mushtaq and Mushtaq Ahmed, who have worked with Hafeez, agreed that the offspinner should now be tested at an ICC-accredited laboratory in Chennai, India, before going to the world's governing body for official testing. Ajmal will continue to work on his remodeled bowling action with Saqlain and a bio-mechanist at the National Cricket Academy in Lahore. Mohammad Hafeez will travel to India to have his action assessed ahead of February's Cricket World Cup . Ajmal was suspended in September by the ICC while Hafeez was banned from bowling in international cricket earlier this month after his action was found to be illegal during the first test against New Zealand. Time is fast running out for Ajmal to get into Pakistan's World Cup squad which is due to be named by Jan. 7. The PCB believes the offspinner needs more time to bowl within the allowed elbow extension of 15 degrees. Ajmal has been unofficially tested three times at the ICC-accredited laboratory at Loughborough University in England since being suspended, but is yet to bowl within the allowed parameters. Saeed Ajmal faces a race against time to be ready for the World Cup, with the squad decided in January . PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said Friday that if the 37-year-old Ajmal undergoes official ICC testing - and his bowling action is found illegal - the offspinner faces a ban of two years which means the end of his international career. 'The PCB fully supports Ajmal in his attempt to regularize his action and to return to cricket as Pakistan's top performer in the future,' the board said in a statement on Saturday. The PCB also announced that Naveed Akram Cheema has been recalled as team manager for the World Cup. He will replace Moin Khan, who had been both team manager and chief selector, and will still accompany the team to Australia and New Zealand. Ajmal is attempting to adjust his action but the PCB are not yet satisfied that it meets regulations . Pakistan's players underwent fitness tests Saturday though injured captain Misbah-ul-Haq, fast bowler Junaid Khan and middle-order batsman Sohaib Maqsood did not participate. Misbah is yet to recover from a hamstring injury while Junaid is nursing a knee injury and Maqsood has a fracture of a small bone in his left wrist.","Mohammad Hafeez was suspended for an illegal action in November .

"Rain ruined day two of the second Test between South Africa and the West Indies as only six overs of play were possible at Port Elizabeth. Faf du Plessis, on 99 overnight, reached his century with a four from the first ball of the day after a delayed start, but was then dismissed off the very next delivery. It was just as well the action was so tightly packed into what play was possible, as the covers would soon be on and, despite hopes of salvaging the evening session, the players never returned with play finally abandoned at 5.05pm local time.

South Africa, on 270 for two overnight, were seeking to set a big target but may need to adjust their tactics now with so much time lost. Play was delayed by an hour due to wet conditions, extending Du Plessis' nervous wait on 99, but he seemed unaffected as he flicked away Jerome Taylor's opening delivery behind square. However, perhaps he relaxed too much after that as, with the very next ball, the West Indies appealed for a catch behind.

Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers put on 15 between them before the weather closed in once more, forcing the players off only half an hour after they had begun.

"The father of one of the British drug mules jailed for attempting to smuggle cocaine out of Peru has revealed his daughter is living in 'horrendous conditions' in prison. Billy Reid said there would be no Christmas celebrations at the Reid family home in Glasgow until his daughter Melissa was freed from jail. Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly were jailed for six years and eight months last year after they were caught with £1.5m worth of cocaine hidden in their luggage, which they attempted to smuggle out of Peru. Mr Reid said his daughter, 21, had already missed key events while she was in prison such as her 21st birthday and her brother's wedding. Scroll down for video . Billy Reid, father of British drug mule Melissa, has described horrible conditions his daughter is enduring in a Peruvian prison after she was convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to almost eight years in prison . 'It's had a tremendous impact on us both emotionally and financially,' he said. 'It's horrendous to see your daughter in handcuffs and the living conditions that she has to put up with. Melissa has spent her own 20th and 21st birthdays in prison in Peru. 'She missed the significant event of her only brother's wedding. Events such as Christmas are non-existent for us. There'll be no celebrations in our house, there'll be no Christmas tree until we get her back home.' Mr Reid was speaking on a video filmed for a Home Office campaign, Mules are fools, Don't be an ass, aimed at deterring people from taking part in drug smuggling. In the 2013-14 financial year, 717 British nationals were arrested abroad for drug-related offences, according to the Foreign Office said - with arrests recently increasing in Australia, Spain and Turkey. Shaun Attwood, who also features in the three-minute video, ended up in the prison with the highest death rate in America after being sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in Phoenix, Arizona for distributing ecstasy. He said: 'I thought drugs were glamorous, I'd never get caught, my parents would never find out.' 'I had to get used to the sounds of heads getting bashed against toilets, bodies getting carried out on stretchers, people who looked like they were dead,' he added. Mr Reid said his daughter Melissa (right) has already spent her 21st birthday and brother's wedding in prison . The mules are fools campaign aims to target young people who may be tempted to act as drug mules by warning them about the heavy consequences they will face serving long sentences in poor conditions in prisons abroad. James Duddridge, minister for consular affairs, said: When it comes to drugs our message is clear - don't take risks, it is never worth it. You only have one life so don't waste it. 'The consequences can be devastating for both you and your family and so it is important to be familiar with the local laws. Penalties and sentences vary considerably around the world and the FCO cannot interfere in another country's legal system. So stay safe and do not break the law.' Pauline Crowe, chief executive of Prisoners Abroad, said: 'We urge people to consider the severe consequences of overseas imprisonment; from unsanitary conditions that breed disease and infection, to a severe shortage of food, clean water and the most basic of medical care. 'Overseas laws can be far harsher than in the UK and committing a drugs crime, whether intentionally or not, could result in a lengthy sentence in life-threatening conditions.' Melissa Reid, 21, of Belfast, and Michaella McCollum Connolly, 20, of Dungannon in Northern Ireland, were working in Ibiza. The pair were arrested in August last year as they attempted to leave Peru airport. A search of their luggage revealed 24lb of cocaine, worth about £1.5million, was hidden within food packets. The two women initially denied that they had willingly taken the drugs and claimed Colombian drug lords who kidnapped them at gunpoint forced them to board a flight with the cocaine. However they later pleaded guilty to drug trafficking, saying they were doing so to get a more lenient sentence. They were both jailed for six years and eight months in December last year. Both women were sent to the Santa Monica prison in Chorrillo to begin their sentence, which will last until April 2020. The jail - which is notorious for its crowded and unsanitary conditions - has housed most foreign women prisoners in the past. The two women are still hoping to be transferred to Britain to serve their sentence under Britain's extradition treaty with Peru. Earlier this year José Luis Perez Guadalupe, head of Peru’s prison service, said the two women may be able to apply for release under an 'expulsion law' once they have served a third of their sentences. If they are successful they could be freed in November 2015.

"Wasps euphorically claimed to have ‘got the monkey off our backs’ with this first away win in nine months, but Gloucester’s own pesky primate continues to weigh them down after yet another setback at home. There was a full house at Kings-holm on Sunday but the mood of festive cheer in the renowned Shed was soon wiped away. The hosts were desperate to atone for the emphatic loss at the hands of Bath at the same ground eight days earlier but instead they slumped to a fourth defeat in their last five home games in the Aviva Premiership. What was once an intimidating stronghold has become far too welcoming. Man of the match Andy Goode kicks one of his two penalties to add to his three conversions for Wasps . Wasps hit back with Tom Varndell providing the pass for Christian Wade to cruise in for their first try . While Gloucester remain ninth with persistent problems to address, Wasps have risen to sixth after their first victory on the road since beating Worcester on March 21. First-half tries by Christian Wade, Tom Varndell and Nathan Hughes came as an astute kicking game spread panic in the Cherry-and-White ranks. Despite Gloucester’s stirring second-half fightback, Wasps held on to claim a win which was arguably more significant even than the success on their first outing at the Ricoh Arena last week. Director of rugby Dai Young said: ‘We got the monkey off our back. Coming into this we’d won all our home games and lost all our away games. It was nice to get that away victory. ‘In the first half we controlled the game and I was really pleased. At half-time we talked about things we needed to do in the second half and we pretty much did none of them. We turned over the ball eight or nine times and put ourselves under pressure. We were really poor. ‘But I was pretty pleased with how we closed the game out. We found a way to win. It gives us confidence to go away and grind out a victory, especially in the last five minutes because I’ve lost count of how many games we’ve lost in the last five.’ Gloucester's England centre Billy Twelvetrees is tackled by Wasps' Ben Jacobs . Jonny May initially reaches just short of the line but continues his move to chalk up Gloucester's first try . England wing May composes himself on the slide before putting the ball down in the corner . Gloucester's Scotland international Greg Laidlaw kicks one of his two conversions - he also kicked three penalties at Kingsholm in the one-try loss . Wasps half-backs Andy Goode and Joe Simpson had Gloucester in disarray with their aerial onslaught in the first half, but only after Jonny May had given the home side a first-minute lead. When James Hook’s cut-out pass reached Mark Atkinson, he picked out England wing May, who cut inside to score and Greig Laidlaw converted. What followed was grim viewing for the Shed as their heroes unravelled in defence. In the ninth minute, Varndell broke through Steve McColl’s tackle on the flank and offloaded superbly for Wade to go over from close range. Goode’s conversion began his flawless return which yielded 12 points from three conversions and two penalties. In the 20th minute, the veteran fly-half’s high kick into the 22 bounced awkwardly behind Charlie Sharples and Varndell was able to gather and surge past the flailing McColl to touch down. There was a powerful riposte as Gloucester’s pack rumbled forward from a lineout for Matt Kvesic to strike but they were soon exposed again at the other end, in identical fashion, as the Wasps eight drove Nathan Hughes over to score. Varndell then bagged a five-pointer of his own after picking up a speculative kick from Andy Goode . Wasps turned down a kickable penalty before Nathan Hughes finished off a strong line-out drive . After a dressing-down at half-time, the home side rallied strongly and three penalties by Laidlaw brought them back to within a point on the hour. But there was to be no glorious comeback as Goode and Elliot Daly struck late penalties. Gloucester’s director of rugby David Humphreys said: ‘At the start of our year, one of our targets was to make Kingsholm a difficult place for teams to come but our recent results here haven’t backed that up. ‘After another home defeat, the long-term plan doesn’t seem as important as getting short-term results. We all know we are in a results business and we want to win. But we also know we have good players and there are aspects of our game that are improving. We are four months into a long-term project. The fans know that we’re not where we want to be, but they realise that we are a work in progress.’ John Afoa, Gloucester’s World Cup-winning All Black prop, delivered his own damning assessment, adding: ‘It was really disappointing. You look at the body language of the boys — really down and out. We let another game slip through our fingers. We are down in confidence. Maybe some guys are not making the right calls.’","Jonny May and Matt Kvesic scored Gloucester's two tries at Kingsholm .

"Saracens survived a late fightback from Newcastle to walk away from Kingston Park with victory by two points. Neil de Kock, Nick Tompkins and Chris Ashton all scored tries while Owen Farrell contributed 10 points with the boot to give the visitors a seemingly comfortable 25-13 lead with 10 minutes remaining. But replacement Chris Harris — on his Premiership debut — set up a grandstand finale by scoring with five minutes to go and then crossed again with the final play of the match, leaving Juan Pablo Socino with a tough conversion from out wide which would have seen the match drawn at 25-25. Juan Pablo Socino missed a last-gasp chance to level the game for Newcastle . Socino of Newcastle Falcons reacts after match against Saracens . The Argentinian’s kick shaved the post as Saracens hung on to claim their seventh win of the season, while the Falcons’ losing bonus point keeps them second-bottom of the Aviva Premiership. But they can take heart from an encouraging performance in front of 9,192, their biggest crowd for several seasons. Newcastle boss Dean Richards said: ‘We have a five-year plan but on the evidence of this we look like we’re two years ahead of that. I’m disappointed with the result but delighted with the effort. We’re on the way to being a side who can compete with the top sides and we’ll see again how far we’ve come when we go to Northampton next Friday. ‘Chris Harris looks like our super-sub,’ added Richards. ‘I don’t think he’ll be going back to Rotherham on loan now.’ Nick Tompkins (centre) celebrates with his team-mates after Saracens second try against Newcastle . Newcastle made a strong start, with Socino putting them ahead in the seventh minute with a penalty, but Alex Tuilagi’s try after a 60-metre dash was chalked off after the TMO judged the wing had put his foot in touch. In a double blow, the 33-year-old injured himself in the process and was replaced by Harris. Saracens engineered a try with their first real attack as Farrell put in De Kock in the left corner.The Falcons almost responded immediately when Socino burst through the Newcastle 22 but hesitation between him and Ally Hogg meant the hosts had to settle for a penalty to close the gap to 7-6. However, Farrell put Saracens 10-6 ahead after Newcastle were penalised for not releasing in the tackle. But the Falcons came firing out of the blocks at the beginning of the second half, with Tom Catterick hacking the ball upfield when Billy Vunipola could not hold a high pass. Kieran Brookes (centre) of Newcastle Falcons goes on the attack against Saracens . Chris Ashton (centre) celebrates scoring Saracens third try of the afternoon . Sinoti Sinoti set off in blistering pursuit and held off Saracens centre Marcelo Bosch as he kicked ahead again and touched down for a 44th-minute try, which Socino converted. Saracens hit back as they upped the power in the pack and extracted a penalty which they kicked to the corner. They then drove the line-out, rolled infield, and Tompkins dived through for a well-worked try converted by Farrell in the 56th minute to give Saracens a 17-13 lead. It seemed to take the wind out of Newcastle’s sails, especially when Farrell kicked another penalty six minutes later after it was ruled the Falcons had gone off their feet. Then Ashton scored wide out with just 10 minutes left after the Saracens pack rumbled up to the line and Richard Wigglesworth popped the ball up for the winger to score and make it 25-13. But Newcastle launched a frenetic attack and Harris dumped Ashton after he had intercepted a wild Sinoti pass and picked up to score. Then he scored again with the last play. Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall said: ‘I felt we deserved the win, but Newcastle must be the most improved side in the Premiership and pushed us all the way.’","Neil de Kock, Nick Tompkins and Chris Ashton scored Saracens tries .

"Julian Salvi's late converted try sealed a superb second half comeback from the Leicester Tigers as they secured an unlikely 32-30 victory over Sale Sharks at the AJ Bell Stadium. The first half proved to be an outstanding spectacle with both teams showing plenty of ambition, but it was ultimately Sale who generally controlled the opening period and went 25-15 up through Chris Cusiter, Will Addison and Nathan Hines tries. Leicester's response came via Seremaia Bai and Mathew Tait touchdowns while Freddie Burns also added five points from the boot. Sale try-scorer Nathan Hines holds on to Leicester fly half Freddie Burns during a combative first half . Sam Tuitupou secured the bonus-point for the Sharks after the break and that looked to have garnered the win, but the Tigers produced an outstanding response. Miles Benjamin's try and Owen Williams' penalty reduced the arrears before Salvi's converted score sealed the win in the closing moments. Richard Cockerill's men looked to move the ball wide early on but a needless mistake allowed the Sharks to build their first attack. Mike Haley and Sam Tuitupou both made significant inroads before the ball was shifted wide and Cusiter found enough to space to touch down. It was a disastrous start for a team struggling to find their rhythm but, to their credit, they soon managed to string together a wonderful move which allowed Bai to go over. Miles Benjamin is brought down by two Sale defenders as Leicester ran in four tries to steal the win . Sale were caught short of numbers on the openside which meant Vereniki Goneva could slip through a gap and pass to Benjamin. The wing made it into the opposition 22 and further pressure on the hosts' rearguard eventually gave the Leicester centre a clear run to the line. But back came the home side. The Sharks' back three were a constant menace to the Tigers' defence and a neat attack almost ended in their full-back crossing the whitewash. Although he was adjudged to have knocked on, they were rewarded for their endeavour when Danny Cipriani added a penalty. Seremaia Bai goes over in the corner to score Leicester's first try despite a desperate defensive tackle . It was proving to be a free-flowing affair and, after Sale had once again gone close, the visitors, perhaps unjustly, went back into the lead when Ben Youngs spotted space on the blindside and Tait finished well in the corner. Burns kicked the extras to take them 12-8 ahead, but they were unable to build on that four-point buffer as Steve Diamond's men continued to display plenty of verve with ball in hand. Johnny Leota, as he has done so often this season, showed his power and skill to provide Addison a clear run to the line. Cipriani converted before the respective stand-offs traded three-pointers as Sale went into the latter stages of the half 18-15 in front. Matthew Tait touches down for the visitors' second score but Sale went in ahead at half time . In an enthralling opening period there was more action to come when another Addison foray almost saw Eifion Lewis-Roberts touch down. The gargantuan prop was stopped short but, under pressure, the Tigers infringed and Jamie Gibson was sent to the sin-bin for a cynical infringement at the contact area. Down to 14 men, the Tigers succumbed as Hines powered over from close range. The Sharks' stand-off was once again successful from the tee and the home side took a deserved 25-15 into the interval. Sebastian de Chaves of Leicester is tackled by Nathan Hines Eifion Lewis-Roberts of Sale Sharks . Having been dominated for the final 20 minutes of the first half, Cockerill needed a response from his charges, but it initially failed to materialise and Sale completed the bonus-point when Tuitupou touched down unopposed. However, there was still plenty of spirit left in the Tigers' ranks and they managed to reduce the deficit through Benjamin's well-taken try. Williams then scored a penalty as the visitors began the mount the pressure on the home side. And following Addison's yellow card, Salvi crossed the whitewash to end a remarkable game with Williams' penalty securing a crucial win for Leicester.

"Celtic have completed a six month loan deal for Cardiff City’s £1.5million rated attacker Jo Inge Berget. And the Norwegian international could be plunged into a Champions League baptism of fire in Warsaw on Wednesday night. One of a raft of countryman signed by Cardiff’s Norwegian manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in January the 23-year-old failed to settle, managing just two appearances. Signed: Jo Inge Berget has joined Celtic on loan from Cardiff after failing to impress Ole Gunnar Solskjaer . Well known to Parkhead coach Ronny Deila after a successful season on loan at Stromsgodset in 2010-11, however, Berget has been given a second chance in British football – penning a deal until January with an option to buy. Berget will join the squad on this morning’s flight to Poland for the Champions League third qualifying round first leg clash with Legia Warsaw after beating last night’s signing deadline. 'I feel really happy, and I’m excited,' said Berget. 'It’s all happened pretty fast. I heard that the manager wanted me, so it was an easy decision for me. It’ s a good opportunity for me and hopefully it’s going to go well. 'I know Stefan Johansson, having played alongside him for Stromgodset before, and also for the national team, so I know him well. He’s a good lad and I’m glad he’s here at Celtic. 'It helps having one or two familiar faces, and it means I’ve got someone to speak a little Norwegian to as well.' Shipped over: Berget was brought to England by Cardiff boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in January . Berget can play as a striker or a creative number 10 and fills the void created by Tony Watt’s £1.2million departure for Belgian club Standard Liege. Insisting he is ready to go straight into Deila’s team against Legia tomorrow night he added: 'We started back at Cardiff around about the same time as Celtic so I’m ready to play. 'I’ll be travelling with the squad to Warsaw and I’m glad about that, and hopefully I can make an impression pretty soon. I’ll be ready for the game if the manager wants me. 'I’m an attacking player. I can play almost any role attacking-wise. I make things happen, I make goals happen and hopefully I can get the crowd going as well.' An Udinese player for three seasons in his teenage years Berget spent a season on loan under Deila, who is credited with changing his career. 'I have some caps for the national team which will help when it comes to playing in Europe, and I’ve also played in the Europa League for Molde, so I’ve played in these sort of games before.' Void: He is set to fill the gap left by Tony Watt's departure . Acquired: Ronny Deila's side face Legia Warsaw in a Champions League qualifier in Poland on Wednesday . Snapped up by Solskjaer’s Molde, the Manchester United legend signed him for Cardiff last January. 'I’m really pleased that we have been able to add Jo to our squad. I know his qualities and I am sure he can add something new to the team. 'He is a player who will work hard and give everything to the team. I hope he can enjoy a successful time at Celtic.' Also on the Celtic flight to Warsaw as Deila stamps his mark on the club will be new first team coach Haakon Lunov. Employed for his match analysis skills the 31-year-old worked with his countryman at Stromsgodset and also worked at Everton. 'I know Haakon well and I know the great work he will bring to Celtic,' said Deila.","Jo Inge Berget joins Celtic from Cardiff on six-month loan .

"This did not have quite the same snarling intensity to match the East Midlands derby at Welford Road last week but Bath showed enough devil against their West Country rivals to prove that again they are serious Premiership players. Exeter took the field with the intention of repeating their autumn victories over heavyweights Saracens and Northampton. But they finished dominated, defeated and floundering against the ropes as Bath hit them with wave after wave of muscular attacks. When Anthony Watson scythed through Exeter’s tired defence with two minutes left to score the home side’s fourth try, and secure an important bonus point, Mike Ford’s men could reflect on a job emphatically done. Anthony Watson scores a late try for Bath to add a bonus point to an already impressive win . Exeter's Matt Jess (right) beats his opposite number Matt Banahan to run in the first try of the match . Jess slides in for a five-pointer after an intercept, which was converted by Gareth Steenson . Just as they did in the European Champions Cup against Montpellier a fortnight ago, Bath demonstrated an unstinting determination to complete the mission. The Chiefs will come again but this was a sound lesson for their youngsters. ‘It was pleasing to get that last try from Anthony because I thought he was outstanding, as were a lot of people,’ said Bath head coach Ford. ‘We’ve got threats all over the park and we’re in a good place. We’ve not won anything in 2014 but the one thing we are doing is getting better. I’m delighted with the intent we showed.’ Bath’s victory was again built on the cornerstone of an immensely impressive forward display — with Stuart Hooper, Leroy Houston and Francois Louw the pick of a very good bunch — which enabled their hugely gifted backline to cut Exeter to ribbons. Four tries to two was the least the home side deserved, with both the visitors’ scores coming as the result of forced mistakes rather than any creative brilliance. Chiefs winger Jess points to a message on tape on his wrist, which reads 'Mum' Bath's Argentinian winger Horacio Agulla eases over for the hosts' first try of the match . Exeter centre Sam Hill drives Bath's Henry Thomas back and forces the prop to lose the ball . Much as Exeter’s highly promising threequarter line attempted to pick holes in Bath’s defence, they were starved of possession and overpowered with ball-in-hand. Time after time they coughed up possession in the first half and despite some bullish charges from centre Sam Hill, the Premiership’s third-placed side at kick-off made few inroads. Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter, whose side lost at Sale last week, said: ‘I’ve got no complaints about the result, although I’m disappointed with the amount of ball we turned over. ‘Yes, it’s back-to-back defeats but we’ve had two away games during a tough period. I’m not worried. That result won’t decide if we win the Premiership.’ As is customary, George Ford pulled the strings for Bath, with centres Kyle Eastmond and Jonathan Joseph playing flat to the line and cutting clever angles as the back three of Matt Banahan, Horacio Agulla and Watson went looking for work with enthusiasm and intelligence.

Nowell celebrates his try but Steenson's conversion of the five-pointer was the last points for the Chiefs . Dave Attwood had the ball in hand as Bath pushed over for a third try . It would have been a travesty if Bath had not claimed a bonus point. Banahan had a first-half try correctly ruled out for a marginally forward inside pass from the outstanding Eastmond and they spent the past 20 minutes almost permanently camped in the opposition 22. When Watson finally sealed the bonus point, which could prove invaluable come the end of the season, Bath’s dominance was complete. Agulla, Eastmond and replacement lock Dave Attwood scored Bath’s earlier tries, while Jack Nowell and Matt Jess both took advantage of mistakes to briefly give the visitors hope of an upset by levelling at 14-14 after 46 minutes. But Bath’s superior strength and depth told. After Attwood drove over with 53 minutes on the clock, and fly-half Ford added a penalty, head coach Ford was able to bring on rugby league convert Sam Burgess for an 18-minute cameo. The 18st powerhouse had little chance to make an impact but his cult status at The Rec is assured, judging by the reaction of the 13,349 capacity crowd to his entrance.","Bath clinched bonus point win and kept second place with win .

"Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert has called for a winter break and insists it would benefit English clubs. The Scot has added his name to a growing list who want the Barclays Premier League to stop over Christmas. Jose Mourinho, Gus Poyet and Wayne Rooney have all insisted a break would be good for the game. Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert said he thinks a winter break in the Premier League would be a good idea . Lambert is not alone in his beliefs and is joined by fellow Premier League manager Jose Mourinho of Chelsea . Sunderland manager Gus Poyet has also showed his dislike for the fixtures over the festive period . Villa host Crystal Palace on New Year's Day, their third match in less than a week, and then face Blackpool in the FA Cup on Sunday. And, ahead of the Eagles' visit, Lambert is keen to see a league hiatus during winter. 'From a manager's point of view, I guarantee if you went up and down the country and did a survey on it, I'm pretty sure 99 per-cent of managers and staff and players would want the break,' he said. 'I guarantee you fans would enjoy it, too. 'Fans up and down the country are brilliant. They follow their teams everywhere. I have no issues with that. Lambert commended the Aston Villa fans for their efforts to travel to watch games over the Christmas period . 'My point of view is that you will have a lot better quality in the second half of the season with a break. 'I just think it would help everybody, the national team, everything. 'You're asking the players to play (again) in two days. You're not going to get the best quality from the game. 'It's difficult to do that 48 hours after playing a tough game.' Villa are 13th in the table after their 0-0 draw with Sunderland on Sunday and host Palace who could have Alan Pardew in charge by the time they come to Villa Park. Aston Villa haven't beaten Crystal Palace in a Premier League match at Villa Park since March 1998, when Savo Milosevic (right) struck twice in a 3-1 victory for the Villans . Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor will return from suspension following his red card against Manchester United . Lambert is without the suspended Fabian Delph and injured Ashley Westwood and Nathan Baker (both knee). Gabby Agbonlahor is back after a ban and Joe Cole is available following a hamstring injury but the club will assess Tom Cleverley (foot) and Ciaran Clark (back). Lambert played for Borussia Dortmund between 1996 and 1997 and had a winter break and reckons it would help the players' fitness. 'I had a long break when I played in Germany and it was fantastic,' he told the Birmingham Mail. Lambert played for Borussia Dortmund between 1996 and 1997 and was gifted with a winter break . 'You shut down and everyone comes back refreshed and ready for a massive push in the second half of the season. 'It's brilliant for everybody. 'People think footballers are super-human but they're normal guys. 'If you're selling a product to millions of people you sell it when everybody is fresh. 'Games come thick and fast and you have to manage players and get them through games. 'You look at them and see that they're tired but they have to go again. It is what it is.

"On Boxing Day it was the batsmen and on Saturday the bowlers but Sri Lanka's punishment at the hands of New Zealand remained consistent at the Hagley Oval. Having seen Brendon McCullum take to their attack as though it were a Twenty20 on day one of this opening Test, the tourists would have hoped for some quality time in the middle on day two.

"A man had admitted scrawling 'Lee Rigby's killers should hang' on one of Britain's most prominent war memorials after the soldier's death - without realising what the memorial was. Daniel James Smith, 21, daubed the green graffiti on the RAF Bomber Command Memorial in central London's Green Park. Smith also wrote 'EDL', known as an acronym for the English Defence League, and 'F*** the police' on the memorial, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. Scroll down for video . 'Offence to many': Daniel Smith, 21, admitted daubing green graffiti saying 'Lee Rigby's killers should hang' on the RAF Bomber Command Memorial - without realising it was a tribute to more than 55,000 war dead . But the court heard he had 'no idea' of the significance of Bomber Command, which was unveiled by the Queen last year in memory of more than 55,000 fallen airmen. Colleen Gildernew, defending, said: 'He had no idea that the war memorial was a war memorial. 'He is very disgusted with himself, even more so because of that.' The court heard Smith, of Grecian Street North, Salford, had 44 previous convictions - many of them for shoplifting - and has appeared in different courts five times this year. He had applied for a . job in the British Army but was unsuccessful 'because of his . convictions as a young boy'. Ms Gildernew added the experiences of . Smith’s two army friends - one who lost both legs and another who suffered memory loss from a bomb blast - had an 'emotional . impact on him'. The court heard Smith, had planned to attend Fusilier Rigby’s funeral but because he was arrested he could not go. The graffiti, shown before it was covered up, read 'Lee Rigby's killers should hang'. Daniel Smith, from Salford, admitted defacing the memorial, which only opened last year. The man pictured is unrelated to the case . Officers were later seen cleaning the graffiti, left, which was one of several criminal incidents after the killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby, right. Daniel Smith, 21, from Salford, admitted daubing the green lettering . District Judge Quentin Purdy described the content of the graffiti inflicted on June 5 by Smith, and its location, as 'highly emotive'. He added Smith’s actions clearly challenged the 'tolerance we all seek to see in society'. Judge Purdy said people would want to know what the court is doing about people, 'brains in gear or not', who inflict such damage. The court was told Smith has . spent the past 11 weeks in Feltham Young Offenders’ Institution and was . released only yesterday. Judge Purdy said he would explore all options to avoid returning Smith to jail, but added 'there may be no alternative' to a prison sentence. He told Smith his punishment should 'reflect the public’s concern about your criminal conduct', adding Smith's actions 'caused offence to many'. He added it was 'slightly worrying' that Smith was released with few arrangements in place. Ms Gildernew said Smith was brought up by his grandmother and had little in terms of family support, describing his childhood as 'unsettled'. National monument: The RAF Bomber Command memorial, in London's Green Park, was opened last summer in memory of the 55,573 airmen from Bomber Command who lost their lives in the Second World War . The court heard he left school at the age of 15 with no qualifications, battled cannabis addiction in his teenage years and struggled with homelessness. Ms Gildernew said Smith, dressed in a colourful T-shirt, was 'shaking and very tearful' before the hearing. The damage to the memorial amounted to £870, the court heard. Smith also pleaded guilty to causing £510 of criminal damage to a wall of a commercial property in Knightsbridge. The graffiti was one of two incidents of vandalism to the memorial following the death of Fusilier Rigby, whose killing in Woolwich, London, on May 22 shocked the nation. The capital also saw a number of attacks on Islamic centres and mosques. Michael Adebolajo, 28, from Romford, and Michael Adebowale, 22, from Greenwich, have pleaded not guilty to Fusilier Rigby's murder and are due to stand trial from November 18. Smith was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on Tuesday. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Daniel Smith, from Salford, left school at 15 and has 44 convictions .

"Swansea City manager Garry Monk is adamant he has no plans to sell England midfielder Jonjo Shelvey in January. Monk criticised Shelvey ahead of the Barclays Premier League game at Liverpool when he told the 22-year-old to 'wise up' and said he would not tolerate his 'laziness' any more. Shelvey was selected against his former club on Monday, but had an unhappy night in Swansea's 4-1 defeat as he failed to track Adam Lallana for Liverpool's third goal and then headed into his own net to cap a miserable night for Monk's men. Jonjo Shelvey has been charged by the FA for throwing an elbow at Emre Can at Anfield on Monday night . Swansea City boss Garry Monk insists he does not 'want' to sell Shelvey in the January transfer window . There was further bad news to come on Tuesday evening as he was charged with violent conduct by the Football Association. Shelvey clashed with Emre Can when he appeared to fling back an arm into the face of the German. The incident was not seen by the match officials. If found guilty, Shelvey, who was sent off at Everton at the start of November, could face a four-match ban, starting at QPR on New Year's Day. Monk, though, insists that Shelvey, who joined Swansea in a £5million deal in the summer of 2013, is going nowhere in next month's transfer window and has a key role to play at the Liberty Stadium. Shelvey catches the Liverpool midfielder in the face during another performance that prompted criticism . 'It is often the case (to sell) when a manager talks about a player,' Monk said. 'But that is absolutely not the case. It was not my intention to give the impression I do not want Jonjo here. 'When I talked about him I was talking about the specific instances where he can do better, in relation to the yellow cards he has picked up. 'When I talked about laziness I meant the situations he gets into to get bookings, not his overall performances. Shelvey clearly threw his arm in the direction of Can as Swansea slumped to defeat . 'Yes, he can do better, but so can all our players. With Jonjo it is a case of me trying to help him, him trying to help himself and pushing on. 'He is going to get a lot better and I want that to happen here at Swansea, not anywhere else.' Shelvey won his solitary England cap in 2012 and was called up to Roy Hodgson's squad last October for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia. But he has picked up seven bookings and a red card this season and Monk feels his disciplinary problems have been down to a lack of focus and application. Can reacts after being hit in the face with Shelvey's flailing arm . And Sky television pundits Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher saw Shelvey smiling and laughing with Lallana ahead of the corner from which he headed into his own goal as a further loss of focus. 'I have not seen the Sky footage and I was not aware of that,' Monk said. 'But you need to be focused in those situations, especially a dangerous situation like a set-piece. 'I was disappointed with that goal as it was avoidable but I thought Jonjo's performance was good. 'We analyse the players and get all the feedback from their performances and on the ball he was one of our highest passers in the game. 'I thought he put himself about, had good energy and he was possibly our best passer on the day. He was probably our most threatening midfielder on the ball but I know he can be even better. Shelvey capped off a forgettable evening by scoring an own goal for Liverpool's fourth . 'Performance-wise, he's capable of running a game, grabbing it by the scruff of the neck and really dictating it, but what you forget is that he's a really young player.' Swansea have had a demanding festive fixture list with the Boxing Day visit of Aston Villa sandwiched in between trips to Hull and Liverpool. They travel to QPR before heading to Merseyside again for a third-round FA Cup tie at Tranmere on Saturday. 'You have to take into consideration the quick turnover of games, the physical output for the players,' Monk said ahead of two away games in the space of 48 hours. 'But each team I put out there I try to have the best team to win the game taking everything into account. The 22-year-old watches as his headers finds the back of the net at Anfield . 'You live and die by the result and performance and you think about it afterwards. 'So far this season, with the games we've played and the teams we've put out there, we've done very well. 'We're disappointed with what happened at Liverpool but it wasn't about application or effort. 'It was about mistakes and we made way too many against a very good side.'","Jonjo Shelvey has been charged by the FA with violent conduct for an apparent elbow on Liverpool's Emre Can on Monday night .

"Danny Ings would only leave Burnley in January for a stupid fee, admits boss Sean Dyche. The in-form centre forward heads to St James' Park to face Newcastle United on New Year's Day where he is very much admired in the corridors of power even though manager Alan Pardew is departing. But Burnley will only even consider thinking of letting the 22-year-old - who is out of contract in the summer - go if they get silly money. Danny Ings has impressed during his first season in the Premier League . And their summer spending - only about Â£8 million - means there is no need to cash in.

'My point is you can never say never but, generally speaking, there's no figure that's been set. Ings has been linked with a number of Premier League clubs in recent weeks . 'Financially, we don't have any worries there because we only bought a couple of bags of chips in the summer and that was it.

"Virgil van Dijk’s Dutch agent has fired the starting gun on a New Year auction for the Celtic defender.

As Sportsmail reported, Sunderland are keenest on van Dijk and are willing to pay £8m to sign him next month, although Chin insists his client is in no rush to leave. ‘The situation of Virgil is pretty clear,’ Chin told Voetbal International. ‘He’ s happy in Scotland. ‘At Celtic, he plays for the championship, he is active in the Europa League and features in the orange (Dutch) squad. But the fact remains that he is ambitious.’ Van Dijk’s former club FC Groningen are entitled to a slice of any transfer fee Celtic receive.

"Nicky Law could become the next player through the exit door at Rangers after emerging as a potential target for Huddersfield Town. Star performer Lewis Macleod was edging closer to a £1million move to Brentford on Tuesday night after undergoing a medical at the Championship outfit. And now fellow midfielder Law is attracting attention as another English second-tier side considers raiding Ibrox. Nicky Law (pictured) could become the next player out of the door at Rangers . It’s thought the interest from Huddersfield remains in its early stages but a reasonable offer may prove hard for Rangers to resist given their perilous financial position. The latest transfer developments came as the club’s board appeared ready to enter into negotiations with the trio of wealthy fans who made a £6.5m investment proposal last week. Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor offered to buy up all the new shares issued, but the result of an AGM vote means existing shareholders must instead be given first refusal. Despite that outcome, they remain intent on acquiring a significant stake and have already given proof of their funding to under-fire Rangers PLC chairman David Somers. The businessmen have now received a reply from Ibrox directors thought to include a variety of investment options, including via a share issue or secured loan. It’s understood boardroom representation could also be on the table after the group’s initial proposal sought two director’s seats. A spokesman for the consortium said: ‘Representatives of the company have made contact with our group following our original proposal and we are considering our response.’ Law (right) has emerged as a target for Huddersfield Town . A statement released on behalf of Sandy Easdale confirmed the chairman of the Rangers football board would be willing to speak to the group. ‘Sandy would welcome investment from Douglas Park and his friends,’ said Easdale’s adviser, Jack Irvine. ‘As regards board seats that is not his decision.’ Numerous hurdles will have to be overcome to reach an agreement and there remains caution about a positive outcome eventually being delivered. But the development did offer some hope to a beleaguered Ibrox support left dismayed by Macleod’s imminent departure. Brentford, who have former Rangers skipper David Weir as assistant manager, shot to the front of the queue for the talented 20-year-old over the weekend. Star performer Lewis Macleod was edging closer to a £1million move to Brentford on Tuesday night . Talks over personal terms accompanied Tuesday’s medical and, barring any late hitches or competition emerging, the Championship outfit hope to register him once the January transfer window opens. Macleod has been a shining light in a dismal season for Rangers and the club’s willingness to accept the money on offer further underlines the extent of the turmoil they are facing. Doubt persists over the ability to meet next month’s wage bill, while the most recent accounts admitted an £8m funding shortfall was faced in 2015. The SFA – aware of the alternative on offer – last week rejected a request from the club to allow Newcastle owner Mike Ashley to up his stake to 29.9 per cent. Park, Letham and Taylor believe they have the answer to the funding crisis, but it remains to be seen whether any deal can be reached with those currently in power at Ibrox.","Nick Law has emerged as a target for Huddersfield Town .

"Tony Pulis is expected to be named West Bromwich manager on New Year's Day before watching from the West Ham stands as he decides where he needs to strengthen his squad in the transfer window. Pulis has agreed a two-and-a-half year contract and will be in The Hawthorns dug-out for the first time when Gateshead visit in the FA Cup on Saturday. The 56-year-old, who quit Crystal Palace on the eve of the season, is clear to work again from today under his severance deal with the south Londoners. Tony Pulis is set to take over at West Brom after turning down the job at Newcastle United . Pulis has been out of work since leaving Crystal Palace before the start of the Premier League season . Chairman Jeremy Peace has agreed to amend Pulis’s contract so the former Stoke manager is satisfied he has total control of transfers — a potential stumbling block. It is clear Pulis, who takes the title ‘head coach’, will have a much greater role in player recruitment than predecessor Alan Irvine, who came from an academy role. Pulis left Selhurst Park, having been named Manager of the Year for his relegation rescue mission, following a fallout over transfers. He will compile a list of transfer targets he hopes can help him maintain a remarkable record of never being relegated in 22 years as a manager. Peace had been focused on loan signings but is now expected to make funds available for permanent deals. On the way out are Sebastian Blanco, Jason Davidson, Giorgos Samaras and Chris Baird. Record signing Brown Ideye, who cost £9million, has also failed to impress. Caretaker boss Rob Kelly is expected to leave the club when Pulis' arrival is officially announced . Record signing Brown Ideye has failed to impress since joining the Baggies in the summer . West Brom technical director Terry Burton retains his job and will help identify targets for Pulis but it remains to be seen how their relationship develops. Mervyn Day, head of recruitment, also stays. West Brom have been prioritising a new, mobile striker and want pace on both flanks. Another full-back would be welcome too. Ben Marshall, the Blackburn winger, has been tracked and would cost £3m, while Wigan’s Callum McManaman could be available for £5m. Rob Kelly and Keith Downing will take charge of West Brom but both are likely to leave once Pulis brings in trusted assistants David Kemp, currently in Florida, and Gerry Francis.

"Billy Jones knows Sunderland have blown the chance to put serious distance between them and the bottom three. The Black Cats drew 0-0 at Aston Villa on Sunday despite the hosts playing most of the second half with 10 men.

Sunderland's Billy Jones, seen here competing with Ron Vlaar (left) and Fabian Delph (right), knows his team passed up a golden opportunity to put daylight between themselves and the Premier League bottom three . Sunderland could only draw with Aston Villa on Sunday despite playing against 10 men in the second half . Sunderland only have a four-point cushion to the Premier League relegation zone . They are 14th in the Barclays Premier League, four points above the drop zone, and Jones knows they have missed an opportunity after their 1-0 derby win at Newcastle. 'It could easily have been two wins, and that would have made it three wins on the bounce after Newcastle,' said Jones, ahead of the New Year's Day trip to Manchester City. 'When Villa went down to 10 men, we saw how we need to improve in the final third - create more chances and take more chances. 'At times, we looked a bit vulnerable because we were so gung ho. 'But we feel it's two points lost. The gaffer knows how disappointed we are as a collective. Villa's Fabian Delph was sent off by referee Martin Atkinson but Sunderland failed to take advantage .

Jones played against Hull and Villa after overcoming hamstring problems and feels the two games prove his injury woes are over. 'Every time it happens, and unfortunately for me it's happened a few times over the last year, there's always a big inquest,' the 27-year-old told the Sunderland Echo. 'You have a chat about it and you want to get to the bottom of it. 'One of the things (former club) West Brom had talked about was seeing this particular specialist. Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan makes an important save from Sunderland's Connor Wickham . 'The Sunderland staff thought there was a need for it as well, and I had a number of injections into the nerve.

Villa striker Bent (right) was not been a regular in the team under manager Paul Lambert . 'I just want to play and I'd reached my boiling point,' Bent told BBC Sussex. 'It was hard not playing in Paul's first season, but this was worse. The team was struggling, not scoring goals and you still don't get a chance. There are only so many slaps in the face you can take.' Bent is looking forward to getting some more first-team football under his belt at Brighton. The 30-year-old forward joined the Midlands club for £18m but struggled to get into the team . Hyypia's side currently occupy 20th place in the Championship table and Bent is eager to help his new side rise up the table in the coming months. 'Anyone who knows me knows I just want to work hard all week and play on Saturday,' added Bent. 'I want to slot in at Brighton and do everything I can to help them improve. I'm just desperate to play football because it's been far too long.'","Darren Bent joined Championship side Brighton on loan from Aston Villa .

"Alan Irvine became the second managerial casualty in the Premier League when he was sacked as West Bromwich Albion head coach on Monday night. Former Stoke manager Tony Pulis is set to be named the club's new boss on New Year's Day after he rejected the chance to join managerless Newcastle. With things all change at the Baggies, what type of player is likely to be targeted by the new manager in the January transfer window? Former Crystal Palace and Stoke manager Tony Pulis is set to be named the new West Brom boss . Alan Irvine was sacked as Albion's head coach on Monday night after a dismal run of results . What are West Brom looking for? Anticipate a busy January transfer window. Plans were already being put in place to bring in a number of players while also shifting some out. As many as four for four. Sebastian Blanco, Jason Davidson, Chris Baird, and Georgios Samaras are available to clubs. Chairman Jeremy Peace has spoken of preferring a 22-man squad, so there will be a balance struck. With Tony Pulis set to arrive there is likely to be even greater change. He will have his own clear ideas but West Brom have prioritised a new, mobile striker and want pace in wide areas, on either flank. Another full-back would be welcome too. Blackburn winger Ben Marshall is a player that West Brom have shown an interest in and could be available for £3million, while Wigan's Callum McManaman is a more expensive option. Wigan wide man Callum McManaman has been touted as a potential target for the Baggies . Blackburn's Ben Marshall is a target for West Brom and could be available for £3million . How much do they have to spend? Prior to the change in head coach, West Brom were primarily looking at loan deals, short-term fixes to boost the squad. January is a notoriously difficult month to find value and rarely have the club spent big. But Pulis’s arrival could change that. He is likely to be given cash to bring in players he feels will enhance West Brom’s chances of staving off relegation. Given the cost of dropping to the Championship, that could be as much as £10m. Georgios Samaras is one of four West Brom players free to leave the club in the window . Pulis tried to sign Gylfi Sigurdsson while in charge at Crystal Palace before midfielder moved to Swansea . What players Tony Pulis likes to buy . Steven Caulker and Gylfi Sigurdsson were the two players Pulis wanted at Crystal Palace, only for each to move to Queens Park Rangers and Swansea respectively. Both are composed ball-players, so expect that theme to run through. West Brom could do with a cultured No 10 and a young centre-back as it happens. In his final summer at Stoke, Pulis brought in the likes of Steven N’Zonzi and Geoff Cameron – so a midfielder of stature could also be on his wanted list. West Brom probably need more power to their game. Tony Pulis could be given as much as £10million to spend on new players in January . Saido Berahino's goals have dried up with the 21-year-old failing to find the target in his last 11 appearances . Hopes for the rest of the season… . Simple: stay up. That will rely mainly on their ability to improve their goalscoring. West Brom have been pretty good defensively – apart from at set pieces, something Pulis will look to remedy – keeping six clean sheets. But with Saido Berahino’s goals drying up it is difficult to see where they win games. Record signing Brown Ideye, who cost £9m, has proved woefully short of Premier League level. Finding a reliable centre-forward is paramount. Brown Ideye has only scored twice since moving to West Brom in the summer for £9m .","Alan Irvine was sacked as West Brom head coach on Monday night .

"Chelsea powerhouse Nemanja Matic hasn't lost a game for his club since April and heads into the new year threatening to be the Premier League's most dominant player of 2015. While Jose Mourinho's men lost their chance of emulating Arsenal's unbeaten season when they were beaten at Newcastle United, they still have an Invincible in their midst in Matic. The 26-year-old Serbia midfielder – strong, powerful, tactically and technically excellent and hailed as a 'giant' by Mourinho – proudly boasts a personal record of 23 wins and seven draws in his last 30 games for the club in all competitions. VIDEO Scroll down for Matic's stunning FIFA Puskas award 2013 nominated goal . Nemanja Matic has impressed at the heart of the Chelsea team since rejoining for £26million in January . When Matic (left) has been in the Chelsea team, they have not lost since a 2-1 defeat by Sunderland in April . Matic's last 30 games for Chelsea, since April 19, 2014 . Played 30: Won 23 Drawn 7 Lost 0. Matic's goals: 3 . *In all competitions since a 2-1 home defeat against Sunderland . And as Chelsea chase an unprecedented quadruple, something even Mourinho hasn't managed before, Matic is the player he can least afford to lose, including John Terry, Eden Hazard and Diego Costa. Lest we forget, Chelsea are currently top of the Premier League, in the last 16 of the Champions League, semi-finals of the Capital One Cup, and the FA Cup is about to start. 'It is possible. We are all ready to play in every moment,' insists Matic, and if they pull it off, he would be a shoo-in for Footballer of the Year. It is no coincidence he was out with suspension when Chelsea crashed 2-1 at Newcastle at the start of December to lose their own unbeaten run. It is the only time since mid-September Chelsea have conceded more than one goal in the game. As they prepare for their first test of 2015 at Spurs on New Year's Day, he is the player who separates Chelsea from the rest. Their rivals boast such glittering names as Alexis Sanchez, Wayne Rooney and Raheem Sterling but where Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool miss out is the lack of a truly world-class holding midfield player. Manchester City have the closest thing to Matic in Brazilian midfielder Fernando, which is why it's no coincidence they are next best to Chelsea in the table. Matic (right) celebrates after scoring during a Champions League group stage match against Sporting Lisbon . Jose Mourinho has hailed his central defensive midfielder as a 'giant' - he is a 6ft 4in wall of steel . Mourinho says of his 6ft 4in wall of steel: 'He's a giant. Not for his size, but for the way he plays. He is a giant.' The eye-catching £26million paid to Benfica to bring Matic back to the Bridge in January now looks a bargain. Players are normally physically or technically excellent. Matic is both, combining outstanding power and a calmness on the ball that allows him and Cesc Fabregas to be the launchpad for so many Chelsea attacks. Intriguingly, it has taken more than five years for Matic to become an overnight success in England. He originally signed for Chelsea as a 20-year-old in the summer of 2009, his official start date coming exactly a month after the appointment of Carlo Ancelotti as manager. Had Middlesbrough been quicker off the mark, they would have got him first. He spent a week on trial at the Riverside after Boro had been tipped off by the manager of his Slovakian club Kosice, Allen Bula, but the Teessiders never followed it up. Chelsea sold Matic (left) in 2011 to Benfica, but bought him back in January and he has become a big success . He came up against his current club in the Champions League in 2012, while playing for Benfica in Portugal . Instead, the £1.1m paid by Chelsea to Kosice looked money well spent when Matic's first three appearances for Chelsea ended in wins by 4-0, 5-0 and 8-0. But after a season on loan to Dutch club Vitesse Arnhem to gain first-team experience, the midfielder was surprisingly sold to Benfica in the summer of 2011. Even though the £21m transfer fee represented a tidy profit for Chelsea, the absence of a Matic-type player in midfield was felt as Roman Abramovich tried to build a new attacking Chelsea around the likes of Hazard and Oscar. The experiment with Andre Villas-Boas didn't work and Roberto Di Matteo and Rafa Benitez's stints were always going to be brief given Abramovich's uncertainty towards RDM and the hostility of the Stamford Bridge crowd to Benitez. When Mourinho arrived back in 2013, he realised halfway through his first season that Chelsea were too flimsy. Out went Juan Mata to Manchester United for £38m in the January transfer window in 2014 and back in came Matic, at an increased price . Chelsea have a number of crucial players, but Matic (far left) is vital to the way Mourinho's side play . It was a surprise when Chelsea sold Matic to Benfica in 2011, but less of a shock when they bought him back . Chelsea had been able to keep a direct watch on the left-footer while he had been in Portugal. Matic played for Benfica against the Blues in the 2012 Champions League quarter-finals, which the English club won 3-1 on aggregate, and the Europa League final the following year, which Chelsea won 2-1. Back at the Bridge, Matic impressed towards the tail-end of last season but it's been this campaign where he has excelled. After an uncharacteristically loose start to the season for a Mourinho team, including a 6-3 victory against Everton, Chelsea have become masters of the clean sheet again. Going forward, he is also a threat, mainly through his passing but also when he decides to unpack his fierce shot or show his aerial ability at set-pieces. Not one to shirk a tackle, Matic flies into a challenge with Southampton's Graziano Pelle on December 28 . Matic runs with the ball between Southampton pair Jose Fonte (left) and Maya Yoshida (right) Two of his three goals have come in the Champions League – in which Chelsea qualified with ease – including a header on his return to Portugal when Chelsea won 1-0 in Sporting Lisbon. Perhaps his stand-out display came in a hard-fought 2-1 win at Liverpool in November. He was voted man of the match at Anfield as Chelsea resisted a strong performance from Brendan Rodgers' side. Matic didn't misplace a pass and even gave the team talk before the game. 'It was very inspiring,' said skipper John Terry. 'He is a real player for the team. He has been the heart of our performances week-in, week-out.' With Mourinho currently in a paranoid state about a 'campaign' against Chelsea, he will probably remember having Fernando Torres sent off at White Hart Lane season by referee Mike Dean. Still, with Matic in the side, you wouldn't put money on Chelsea losing their opening game of 2015 or many beyond that.","Chelsea have not lost with Nemanja Matic on the field since April .
Since then, he has played 30, winning 23 and drawing just seven .
Matic is strong, powerful, tactically and technically excellent for Chelsea .
The Blues can still win four trophies this season, and Matic will be at the heart of the team as they strive to make history ."
"It was one of the most audacious missions of World War Two that saw false information about Allied plans to invade Italy planted into the hands of a German intelligence officer. And today a Jolly Roger flag from HMS Seraph - which had a crucial role in the clandestine mission known as 'Operation Mincemeat'  - has emerged, 70 years after the famous event. In April 1943 the senior crew of the Royal Navy submarine dropped the body of a Welsh tramp, dressed up as a uniformed commando, a mile off the Spanish coast. A piece of history: A Jolly Roger flag denoting a Royal Navy submarine's clandestine mission known as 'Operation Mincemeat' has emerged after 70 years . Secret mission: The corpse of Welsh tramp Glyndwr Michael was dropped into the sea near to Spain by HMS Seraph's commander Lt Bill Jewell - a moment imagined in the film The Man Who Never Was, above . False identity papers showed the corpse to be that of Major William Martin of the Royal Marines and attached to his wrist was a briefcase containing secret bogus plans. The highly-sensitive papers falsely stated the Allies planned to invade Italy through Greece and Sardinia. As planned, when the body washed ashore in southern Spain the documents ended up in the hands of a local German intelligence officer. As a result the German high command diverted troops to Sardinia and Greece - away from Sicily where the Allies successfully invaded two months later. It gave the Allies a foothold on Hitler’s fortress in Europe for the first time since Dunkirk. 'Operation Mincemeat': Mr Michael's body, pictured, was taken from a London hospital and kept aboard the HMS Seraph in a canister - which most thought held a meteorological device . The extraordinary deception was later the basis of the film The Man Who Never Was. To mark the special operation the flagman on HMS Seraph added a dagger emblem to the submarine's Jolly Roger to go alongside five others for clandestine missions. It was tradition for Royal Navy submarines to have its own skull and cross bones after a World War One Admiral famously compared submarine warfare to piracy. Emblems were added to the flags each time the submarine sunk an enemy or completed a mission. One of the other daggers on the flag signified a bizarre special operation which involved the entire crew speaking in American accents to appease an English-hating French general they were rescuing. General Henri Giraud refused to board a British craft and so the sub hoisted the Stars and Stripes and pretended to be American. The HMS Seraph's Jolly Roger was kept by a junior rating, whose role was to update it, after it was replaced by a new one in 1944. He handed it on to his son who has now made it available for sale at auction and is estimated to fetch £10,000. Auctioneer Steven Bosley, of Bosleys of Marlow, Buckinghamshire, where the flag is to go on sale said: 'It is rare for these Jolly Rogers to come on the open market because most of them went to the submarine captain or ended up at a museum. 'It is hard to value it because they are so rare but this one does carry a premium because of the association with Operation Mincemeat. Imagined: A scene from film The Man Who Never Was shows the body being carried through the streets . The plan was the brainchild of an . eccentric 25-year-old RAF Flight Lieutenant named Charles Cholmondeley - . who took it to the chief of Section 17M, naval Lieutenant Commander . Ewan Montagu. Section 17M of the . British Intelligence Service was a group so secret that only 20 people . even knew of its existence. Codenamed . Operation Mincemeat by Montagu - as a bleak joke on the fact that it . hinged on the discovery by the enemy of a corpse - the cunning scheme . was hatched in a tiny basement beneath the Admiralty building in . Whitehall which had once been used as a wine cellar. It . was a plan that was to make history - but first it had to be approved . by British Intelligence's inter-service Twenty Committee (named after . the Roman numerals XX, or double cross), which oversaw the use of double . agents. Cholmondeley . told the Committee that his plan was simple - they would obtain a body . from a London hospital, dress it up in a military uniform, fill the . corpse's lungs with water, provide it with misleading documents, and . then drop it from an aircraft so that it washed up on the coast of . Spain. The plan . was all the more important as Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill, above, . had agreed with the U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt in January 1943 . that - in the wake of the Allied success in North Africa - the next step . would be to attack Sicily, as the first step to the invasion of Italy. The troops would then aim to take on the rest of Europe from the country. However, . as Churchill himself famously remarked, 'Everyone but a bloody fool . would know' that their objective was to attack Sicily - and so the . clandestine plan was hatched. It was hoped that if the Germans and their Italian . partners could be made to believe the Allies were going to attack . Greece, some 500 miles to the east, and Sardinia, the Germans might . divert some significant part of their forces, which would help the . invasion succeed. Attack: American soldiers landing on the coast of France in the Normandy landings June 6th 1944 - a year after the successful 'Operation Mincemeat' mission . So, at 4.30am on April 30, 1943, HMS Seraph . surfaced a mile off the Spanish coastal town of Huelva, and the vessel's commander Lieutenant Bill Jewell . and a few senior officers gently pushed the body into the sea. The body was supposed to be that of Major William Martin of the Royal Marines. It was found washed up by a fisherman at 9.30am and was reported to German agent Adolf Clauss. As . well as the ‘top secret’ documents, love letters from the body's . pretend fiancee were also placed on his body. By doing so, the men from the Ministry believe they saved the lives of some 40,000 British servicemen and women. 'The flying of a Jolly Roger on a submarine is a British tradition that still goes on today and whenever an operation has been completed a new emblem is stitched on to it. 'The provenance for this one is excellent. The vendor’s father served aboard HMS Seraph as a junior rating but it was his remit to look after the Jolly Roger and update it. Man with a plan: Lt Commander Montague, section chief of British Intelligence Service group Section 17M, pictured, worked with RAF Lieutenant Charles Cholmondeley to create the corpse's identity . 'A new Jolly Roger was taken into service when the submarine had a new captain in March 1944 and this one was preserved by the vendor’s father who took it with him on leaving the vessel.' HMS Seraph was chosen to take part in Operation Mincemeat because of its previous success with special operations. Its commander, Lieutenant Bill Jewell, knew the truth of the operation but he had to tell his men the canister carrying the body of the dead tramp, whose real name was Glyndwr Michael, contained a meteorological device. At 4.30am on April 30, 1943, HMS Seraph surfaced a mile off the Spanish coastal town of Huelva, and Lt Jewell and a few senior officers gently pushed the body into the sea. It was found washed up by a fisherman at 9.30am and was reported to German agent Adolf Clauss. As well as the ‘top secret’ documents, love letters from the body's pretend fiancee were also placed on his body to give the deception more credence. After the war HMS Seraph was broken up. Its conning tower was preserved as a memorial at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina, US. It is the only shore installation in the US where the Royal Navy ensign is allowed to be permanently flown. The Jolly Roger flag, that measures 31ins by 48ins, is being sold by Bosleys on November 6.","Jolly Roger flag from HMS Seraph has appeared after 70 years .

"Arsenal and England forward Theo Walcott could make his return from injury in time for Sunday's crucial clash with Liverpool at Anfield. Manager Arsene Wenger revealed the 25-year-old, who has made just two appearances this season as a substitute before another spell on the sidelines, is back in training after a groin problem he suffered while on international duty with England. While Wenger will take no chances on Walcott's rehabilitation, the imminent availability of the jet-heeled forward will come as a welcome boost ahead of the hectic Christmas schedule, which could also see both defender Nacho Monreal and midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain shake off their fitness problems. VIDEO Scroll down for video of Arsene Wenger on Thierry Henry and our match preview . Arsenal and England forward Theo Walcott has suffered several setbacks but is ready to resume full training . It has been a frustrating time for the speedy forward, with much of this season spent looking on . Walcott  taunted Tottenham fans while being stretchered off against Spurs in the FA Cup last Janaury . 'There is a slight chance of (Nacho) Monreal being available and a very slight chance for Walcott. We hope that Oxlade-Chamberlain will be fit. We will see that on Saturday,' Wenger told Arsenal Player. 'He (Walcott) is back in training today (Thursday), but only today. I might take him (to Liverpool), I don't know yet until he is back to full training. Let's see.' Oxlade-Chamberlain limped out of the closing stages of Arsenal's 4-1 Premier League win over Newcastle last weekend with a groin problem which the club hope will prove to be minor. Training has being intensified for Walcott as he nears full fitness ahead of the crucial Liverpool match . On one of Walcott's rare outings this season - an Under-21 encounter against Blackburn . 'That's what we'll see on Saturday after a test. He is not in training at the moment,' Wenger added. Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil is another who is stepping up his rehabilitation, having been out since the defeat at Chelsea on October 5 because of a knee problem. Wenger also confirmed both goalkeeper David Ospina and midfielder Tomas Rosicky are also close to being available again following their respective thigh problems. However, captain Mikel Arteta (calf), midfielder Aaron Ramsey (hamstring) and centre-back Laurent Koscielny (calf) are still out, but 'progressing as planned', according to the Gunners boss. Arsenal will be looking to remain within striking distance of the top four with a positive result at Anfield to continue their upturn in form, which has seen five wins from six across all competitions. The knock-out stages of the Champions League await Arsenal, who have been paired with Monaco, the French club where Wenger made his name as a young coach. Wenger won the Ligue 1 title in 1988 and the French Cup in 1991, as well as reaching the European Cup Winners' Cup final and then the semi-finals of the Champions League in 1994, and went on to have a spell managing in Japan before being a surprise choice for the Arsenal job in October 1996. He has never since faced Monaco in a competitive fixture, and is looking forward to his return to the Stade Louis II stadium for the second leg of the tie in March next year. 'We had very few chances to get Monaco and I think it's a strange coincidence in life because I have spent 25 years of my life at Monaco and Arsenal together, so it's a little bit like my life meets my life,' Wenger added. 'It is good as well because I go back to basically where I started. 'I have never [been back], because I was always very busy and since I have been here in England we have played every three days basically throughout the whole season. I have been back to the city a few times but never to the stadium.' Monaco were considered one of the weaker seeds, having come through Group C ahead of Bayer Leverkusen but scored just four goals - two of those coming in the final tie with Zenit St Petersburg. 'Overall, it is an opportunity for us to get through to the quarter-final,' said Wenger, whose side were knocked out of Europe by Bayern Munich in the past two seasons. 'Having said that, Monaco is a tough draw because they have come top out of a very tough group and that means it is a signal for us to be ready to meet a tough team who defend very well and are very quick on counter-attacks. We need a good defensive performance against them.'","The 25-year-old has made just two appearances this season .

"Didier Drogba is not concerned if Chelsea lose 10 Premier League games this season - provided they win the title when it is all over. The Blues' storming start to the campaign led many to believe they could replicate Arsenal's 'Invincibles' who went the entire 2003-04 season unbeaten. However, Drogba is not bothered after those hopes were ended by defeat at Newcastle in their last away game. He told the Evening Standard: 'We just want to be top of the League, to win the League. Even if we lose five or 10 games and win the League, for me it's a very good season. Didier Drogba is more interested in winning the title than Chelsea's unbeaten record being broken . Blues players react after being defeated by Newcastle in their last away game . Drogba is expected to be available after recovering from a knock picked up against Derby in the League Cup . Drogba, who won three titles during his first spell at the club, was brought back to Stamford Bridge on a free transfer by Jose Mourinho - and the Ivorian insists the relationship between the pair is as strong as ever. He said: 'To be in Chelsea with him (Mourinho) is really special. He trusts me and I try to give things back when I am on the pitch. Even outside in the dressing room with everyone, we have a good spirit.'

"Alan Pardew is expected to be at Villa Park for Crystal Palace's opening Premier League match of 2015 as he edges closer to being named the next Eagles boss. Sportsmail understands an official announcement that Pardew has signed on as manager could be made before Palace's match with Aston Villa. And the former Palace midfielder is still expected to complete his Selhurst Park homecoming, but not in time to take charge of the New Year's Day trip. Alan Pardew is set to be confirmed as Crystal Palace's new manager after deciding to leave Newcastle . Keith Millen is set to continue as Palace caretaker manager for the New Year's Day clash at Aston Villa . Newcastle United manager Pardew had hoped to complete his Eagles switch from Newcastle United and oversee the first Premier League clash of the year, but Keith Millen will remain in caretaker charge instead. All of the details have been resolved in Pardew's negotiations with Palace and an official announcement is expected imminently. The former Palace midfielder met with the club's coaching staff on Wednesday evening and is expected to be at Villa Park on New Year's Day. Palace sacked Neil Warnock on December 27 following a run of just one win in 12 games; the Eagles remain in the Premier League's relegation zone after Sunday's goalless draw at QPR. Palace chief Parish had always envisaged Millen taking charge for the Villa trip even if the Pardew deal was complete, so the Selhurst Park bosses are not concerned by any hiatus. Pardew is set to be announced as the new Crystal Palace manager imminently . Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish (left) has paid compensation to secure Pardew's services . Croydon-born Millen will remain as part of Pardew's backroom staff despite once again pressing for the full-time managerial role. The former Bristol City boss said he is content to stay at his hometown club, and bide his time for a return to frontline management. 'I want to manage again, without a doubt,' he said. 'But I'm patient at the moment because I enjoying working at Crystal Palace. 'As long as someone comes in, sees what you're about and values you, I'm happy.' Pardew back in his playing days scored a memorable winner over Liverpool in the FA Cup back in 1990 . Pardew played more than 100 games for Palace during a four-year spell at the south London club . Newcastle face managerial limbo until Pardew's Palace move is signed and sealed. John Carver has assumed caretaker charge for the next two matches while the club seek Pardew's replacement, with Steve Stone and Peter Beardsley also on hand. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has tasked managing director Lee Charnley with identifying a head coach to replace Pardew, with chief scout Graham Carr retaining control of recruitment. The Magpies host Burnley at St James' Park on New Year's Day, with boyhood Newcastle fan Carver refusing to shy away from superstitious preparation. All was quiet at Crystal Palace's Beckenham training on Tuesday, with no Pardew announcement imminent . Carver has invoked the spirit of the late Sir Bobby Robson, under whose reign the 49-year-old worked on Tyneside. 'For some reason, I started reading Sir Bobby's autobiography last night,' said Carver. 'There was a message on the front of the book - 'Thanks for a fantastic, successful five years, it should have been a lot longer. Cheers, Sir Bobby'. 'When he gave me that book, he said to me, 'You do realise how big this football club is, and if ever you get an opportunity, don't be scared of it, enjoy it and take it with both hands'. So I am sitting here now and I'm going to take it with both hands.'

"Jose Mourinho cares little that Chelsea's eight-point advantage over Manchester City has been cut to three at the halfway stage of the Premier League season. And the Chelsea boss and his players looked in high spirits ahead of the New Year's Day trip to Tottenham as they braced the cold weather during a training session on Wednesday morning. John Terry, in particular, appeared to be enjoying the session as the Blues captain was left in stitches after the players piled on top of John Obi Mikel  at Cobham. John Terry is in stitches as the Chelsea players enjoy a joke at training on Wednesday morning . Manager Jose Mourinho was in high spirits too as he shared a joke with his players . Chelsea have been pace-setters since their opening win at Burnley, with only New Year's Day opponents Tottenham temporarily overtaking them on goal difference after two rounds of matches. Now, after playing all the other 19 teams in the Premier League and ahead of the first return fixture of the season, Mourinho has reflected on a strong start by his side. 'Everybody starts with the same points and if we have one more point than them (Manchester City), we did well,' Mourinho said. 'We are top of the league at the end of the first round because we deserve it and because it is a consequence of what we did. Striker Diego Costa takes a tumble during the session, much to the amusement of Cesar Azpilcueta . Chelsea players pile on top of John Obi Mikel as the squad lark about in training . 'Chelsea is playing very well since the beginning of the season. That's the only thing we work at, the only thing we concentrate on. 'And in the second part of the season we are going to try to do exactly the same thing. 'Against Tottenham, we will be there again trying to get a good result.' Mourinho is chasing a third Premier League title and Chelsea's first in five years. Seven times he has led a championship on Christmas Day - in Portugal, England, Italy and Spain - and each time his team has gone on to win the title. Chelsea dropped points for the fourth time this season against Southampton on Sunday . Chelsea, who were eight points clear of defending champions City during November, are indebted to Burnley that their lead was not cut to a solitary point. The Clarets last Sunday fought back from two goals down to draw at City on a day when Chelsea had earlier been held to a 1-1 draw at Southampton. Mourinho's men have drawn four times and lost once this season in the Premier League, but won all nine of their home matches. City's revival has coincided with a difficult spell on the road for Chelsea, who have dropped points in three of their last four away games in drawing at Sunderland and Southampton and losing at Newcastle. Eden Hazard cancelled out Sadio  Mane's opener as the sides drew 1-1 at St Mary's . 'We had very difficult fixtures away from home,' Mourinho added. 'We lost one game that we didn't deserve to lose (at Newcastle). We are doing well.' Chelsea's only other dropped points were at City and at Manchester United, who are 10 points adrift in third in what appears already to be a two-horse title race. Mourinho has a full squad to choose from for the trip to White Hart Lane to play a Spurs side who are without a win in 10 matches against their London rivals. Tottenham have not beaten Chelsea since April 2010.","Chelsea travel to White Hart Lane on New Year's Day to face Tottenham .

"Aberdeen legend Willie Miller has urged the board to back Derek McInnes in the January transfer window to help keep the title heat on Celtic. The Pittodrie club confirmed that Jonny Hayes and Andrew Considine have become the latest first-team players to sign contract extensions. Miller, though, hopes there will also be leeway to add to their current options after recently wiping out historic debt of nearly £15million. Dons boss Derek McInnes has earned the right to strengthen his squad, says Willie Miller . The former Dons captain, manager and director is not advocating risky spending, but feels McInnes deserves a reward after guiding Aberdeen to within two points of the champions. ‘Derek McInnes has earned the right to be allowed to strengthen his squad when the transfer window re-opens later this week,’ said Miller. ‘He’s delivered all that has been asked of him at Aberdeen so far. But for three games it has been an almost perfect year for the Dons. ‘The only black marks have been those Scottish Cup defeats by St Johnstone and Dundee and that final day league defeat by Motherwell.

Hayes has signed a new contract that will keep him at Aberdeen until the summer of 2018 while defender Considine – in his testimonial season – has agreed terms until 2017. The deals follow similar agreements with Niall McGinn and Adam Rooney last week. ‘Both Jonny and Andy have shown a great deal of consistency in their play and a high level of performance in my time here as manager and I’m delighted they both see their future at this club, which is striving to deliver success,’ McInnes told the club website.","Aberdeen trail Celtic by two points in the Scottish Premiership table .

"Fernando Torres’ return to Atletico Madrid is being delayed by Alessio Cerci,  who wants to go to Inter rather than swap for Torres' temporary home AC Milan, reports Italian media, . While Spanish papers As and Marca, and Milan Channel, have all been confident an agreement has been made for Torres to return to his first club for the remaining 18 months of his loan from Chelsea, Corriere dello Sport and others say winger Cerci is stalling the deal. Roberto Mancini has said Cerci is an Inter transfer target and it’s reported the Italian believes a loan move there would be his best chance of a permanent deal away from Atletico. Spanish media have reported Cerci's been warned he’ll spend six months on the sidelines if he doesn’t accept the loan swap arrangement. If Alessio Cerci goes to the Serie A he would prefer Inter over AC Milan, stalling swap for Fernando Torres, while Bayern Munich’s Xherdan Shaqiri is top of Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri’s transfer wish list . TuttoSport adds fuel to reports that Juventus is making a play for Bayern Munich’s Xherdan Shaqiri, saying he’s top of Massimiliano Allegri’s wish list. ‘A trequartista wouldn’t go amiss,’ the Juve manager says, and the Swiss attacker who’s struggled to hold down a place at the Bundesliga champions could be the man. Jose Mourinho is ‘Mr Stubborn’, according to Spain’s Marca, after the Chelsea boss has an apparent dig at Real Madrid while his London side keep a firm grip on the top of the Premier League table. “Now I have the players I want...I’ve missed that for some time,” he is quoted, with the paper interpreting it as a ‘dart from Mou towards the World champions’ now managed by Carlo Ancelotti. Luis Enrique is preparing champions at Barcelona while Marca calls Jose Mourinho 'Mr Stubborn' Also in Spain, Barcelona manager Luis Enrique is challenged to ‘prepare a champion’, says Mundo Deportivo, as he looks to ‘exploit his assets and provide personality to achieve a more solid team’.

"Bolton boss Neil Lennon will this week step up his efforts to sign Kris Commons from Celtic. Commons has become an increasingly peripheral figure under Ronny Deila and again had to be content with a place on the bench in Saturday’s goalless draw with Ross County at Parkhead. Celtic maintain that contract talks with Commons and his representative are on-going but, as yet, there has been no breakthrough to keep the player in Glasgow beyond the summer. Bolton Wanderers boss Neil Lennon will this week step up his efforts to sign Kris Commons from Celtic . Lennon is prepared to sign Commons on a pre-contract agreement but would prefer to pay for him next month . At 31, the former Scottish internationalist is ideally seeking a long-term deal but the club have been reluctant to offer such contracts to players of that age. Deila has denied that the best Commons can hope for is a flat one-year extension - but it’s thought that clauses which would potentially trigger additional years would be appearance-related. Former Parkhead boss Lennon, however, is willing to offer the player the long-term deal he craves at the Macron Stadium as he seeks to add to a squad that is now eyeing the Championship play-off places.

Commons hit 31 goals last term to land the player of the year awards from both the Scottish Football Writers’ Association and PFA Scotland but has often found himself surplus to requirements under the new Celtic regime. With midfielder Stefan Johansen the preferred option for his fellow Norwegian Deila in the role behind the striker, Commons has largely been demoted to the bench this campaign. And, although his preference is to stay in Glasgow, the offer of long-term stability south of the border looks set to take the former Stoke, Nottingham Forest and Derby player back there.","Kris Commons has struggled for appearances at Celtic this season .

"Bayern Munich reject Xherdan Shaqiri looks set to snub Liverpool when he leaves the German giants next year. The Switzerland midfielder has made only three league starts for Bayern this season, and has long been angling for a move away from the club. Liverpool have led the race to sign Shaqiri for over a year - and the player looked set for a move to Anfield in the summer before the Bundesliga champions blocked the move - but new reports suggest that the player is set to join  Wolfsburg. VIDEO Scroll down for Xherdan Shaqiri scores ridiculous overhead kick in Bayern training . Bayern Munich star Xherdan Shaqiri is said to be keen on a move a move away from the Allianz Arena . The Switzerland star has started just three Bundesliga games during the course of the season . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers will be disappointed with news of Shaqiri's potential move to Wolfsburg . However, despite being persuaded to persevere at Bayern, the 23-year-old has still failed to break into the first team and he repeatedly claims to feel undervalued by Pep Guardiola. 'I felt that (former Bayern coach) Jupp Heynckes had more belief in me,' he said recently. Guardiola himself stated last month that 'if someone wants to leave the club, they can'. Reports in November also revealed that Bayern would allow Shaqiri to leave in January, if a club was willing to pay the £16million asking price. That may be within Liverpool's budget, but it is also a reasonable demand for Wolfsburg, who are funded almost exclusively by German car manufacturer Volkswagen. The links to Volkswagen also set Wolfsburg in good stead when it comes to transfer deals with Bayern, as the company's chairman Martin Winterkorn occupies a seat on the Munich board. For Shaqiri, though, there is one reason above all why Wolfsburg may be more attractive than Liverpool. The Wolves are flying high in second place in the Bundesliga this season, and are on course for Champions League football next season. Judging by the current situation, it is unlikely Brendan Rodgers' side will be able to offer that perk come next summer. Shaqiri could join fellow countryman Ricardo Rodriguez at the Volkswagen Arena . Under the clever guidance of coach Dieter Hecking and director of sport Klaus Allofs, Wolfsburg have freed themselves from the legacy of former boss, the Fulham flop Felix Magath, and begun to build a formidable looking side around the likes of Kevin de Bruyne, Ricardo Rodriguez and Ivica Olic. The relationship between Bayern and Wolfsburg does have a tendency to spoil the transfer plans of Premier League clubs. Luiz Gustavo was set to move to Arsenal in 2013 before Wolfsburg swooped on the Brazilian midfielder. In 2011, the then Wolfsburg striker Mario Mandzukic had been linked with Chelsea and Tottenham before he was snapped up by Bayern. It seems Liverpool may suffer the same fate, particularly if they can't convince Shaqiri that he will be playing Champions League football at Anfield next season.","Brendan Rodgers is said to be keen on landing Bayern's Xherdan Shaqiri .

"Bayern Munich are listed by many bookmakers as favourites to win the Champions League this season – rated above even Real Madrid and Barcelona. The German champions are unbeaten in 22 matches in all competitions, so what price Manchester City to stop the Guardiola juggernaut on Tuesday night in order to keep their own European hopes alive? It is certainly a daunting task as you can see. Sportsmail takes a look at six reasons why Bayern are almost impossible to beat. Bayern Munich players celebrate Robert Lewandowski (left) scoring against Hoffenheim on Saturday . 1. They have the best goalkeeper in the world . Manuel Neuer has taken the No1 position to new levels, becoming the ultimate sweeper-keeper that every other top club in the world is trying to replicate. Not only is he like an extra defender if teams try to get in behind the back-four, he is utterly commanding on set-pieces, successfully claiming 95% of the corners, free-kicks and crosses he went for in the Bundesliga last season. Winner of the Golden Gloves for being the best goalkeeper at the last World CupThom, he has repaid every penny of the £18million it cost Bayern to lure him from Schalke in 2011, . Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer pulls off a save during his side's 4-0 victory against Hoffenheim on Saturday . 2. They have the best manager in the world . Jose Mourinho is the only serious rival to Guardiola's crown, and Pep fans will recall how his Barcelona side totally humiliated Mourinho's Real 5-0 in the famous 2010 Clasico. Guardiola gave the world tiki-taka at Barcelona, winning the Champions League twice, and has reinvented himself in Munich, responding to heavy defeats against Real Madrid last season by giving his side greater physical strength through summer signings Robert Lewandowski, Xabi Alonso, Juan Bernat and Mehdi Benatia – without losing any of the flair. Manchester City keep a close eye on Guardiola's tactical reformation in case he shows any interest in succeeding Manuel Pellegrini in 18 months time. Pep Guardiola, pictured in his pre-match press conference, has experienced huge success as a manager . 3. They are proven winners . Bayern have won the last two German League titles and are already seven points clear this season after an unbeaten start to the campaign. Besides that, six of their team – Neuer, Jerome Boateng, Philipp Lahm (currently injured), Mario Gotze, Thomas Muller and Bastian Schweinsteiger won the World Cup with Germany this summer. Gotze scored the only goal in the final against Argentina and 2010 World Cup winner Alonso was added to an already star-studded Bayern squad in the last transfer window. Six of Bayern Munich's players helped Germany lift the World Cup in Brazil last summer . 4. Bayern love Manchester . Arjen Robben's spectacular late strike against Manchester United at Old Trafford in 2010 took the Germans through to the Champions League final on the away goals rule. Last season, they visited Manchester twice and enjoyed highly satisfactory results on both occasions. Goals from Franck Ribery, Muller and Robben earned them a deserved 3-1 win at Manchester City in the group stages. And they returned to the north-west for a quarter-final against United, earning a 1-1 draw in the first leg at Old Trafford that set up an easy second-leg win. Thomas Muller scores in Bayern's 3-1 win against Manchester City at the Etihad stadium last season . 5. They have new attacking teeth . If there was one criticism about Pep Guardiola's teams, it was they occasionally over-played and didn't make their possession superiority count in terms of goals. You couldn't say that about Bayern this season. They have scored 31 goals in 12 Bundesliga games and conceded only three. At the weekend, they won 4-0 away to Eintracht Frankfurt with Muller scoring a hat-trick and Swiss star Xherdan Shaqiri also netting. Those Bayern fans who complained last season the team was less exciting under Guardiola than his predecessor Jupp Heynckes have been silenced. Their last three away games have yielded 14 goals, including seven at Roma in their last Champions League fixture outside Munich. The signing of Robert Lewandowski, pictured celebrating against Hoffenheim, has improved Bayern's attack . 6. They have English know-how . Arjen Robben was a Premier League title winner at Chelsea, and has improved immeasurably since then. If Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are the best two players in the world, the Dutchman is considered by many to be the third-best on current form. Alonso won the Champions League with Liverpool and regularly topped the statistics for making the most tackles in matches, beside being an excellent playmaker. Boateng had one unhappy season at City, starting only 14 Premier League games, but knows the stadium well. And on the bench is Pepe Reina, who spent nine seasons as a Liverpool player. Bayern duo Xabi Alonso (left) and Jerome Boateng (right) both have Premier League experience . Winger Arjen Robben enjoyed plenty of success during his days as a Chelsea player under Jose Mourinho . AND SOME CRUMBS OF COMFORT... Bayern have already qualified for the knockout stages and Pep Guardiola admits his team aren't at their best when too relaxed. Recent history supports that, last season Arsenal forced a draw in Munich after losing the first leg 2-0, while City actually won at the Olympic Stadium in the group stages when Bayern knew they could afford to lose and still progress into the last 16 as group winners.","Manchester City host Bayern Munich in the Champions League .

"For Peterborough, the first half of this season turned out much like last. A strong start, some raw talent unearthed by shrewd dealing in the transfer market; followed by a slump that has seen them fall away from automatic promotion contenders to play-off outsiders. In fact, Darren Ferguson’s side are far closer to the League One drop zone in terms of points than they are the top two – 16 off second-placed Swindon yet only eight clear of Crewe in 21st. Peterborough made a strong start to the season but have fallen out of the League One play-off places . The damning statistics go on. Following Sunday’s 0-0 draw at home to Doncaster, Peterborough have won just once in their last 10 league games. That is relegation form. Now, while you’d be a brave man to tip Posh to go down, chairman Darragh MacAnthony knows the club must arrest this slide quickly. They cannot afford to stagnate. On Monday, he announced on Twitter that he would be conducting a full review in to 2014 as we head in to the new year. Peterborough chairman Darragh McAnthony (left) has announced he will be conducting a full review in to 2014 . In all competitions, Posh played 57 games this year, winning 22 and losing 25. That is not good enough for a club wanting Championship football. But they have no divine right. Sheffield United and Preston are both in their fourth consecutive seasons in the third tier. As they will both testify, the longer you stay down, the harder it is to get back up. There was a sprinkling of quality added to Ferguson’s side over the summer, not least with the addition of winger Marcus Maddison from Gateshead, but it has not been enough to account for the loss of Britt Assombalonga. Marcus Maddison, signed from Gateshead this summer, celebrates scoring against Port Vale in September . Peterbrough have missed the goals of Britt Assombalonga who left the club for the Championship in August . Posh made a £4million profit in just over a year on the 22-year-old striker. Selling him to Nottingham Forest for £5.5m in August represented a fantastic piece of business for a League One club. When mulling over that offer, MacAnthony will have cast his mind back to the summer before when Peterborough sold top scorer Dwight Gayle to Crystal Palace and managed to replace him with Assombalonga, spending less than a quarter of the fee received for Gayle. But, despite all showing flashes of promise, young strikers Conor Washington, Luke James and Kyle Vassell have not hit anywhere the heights of Assombalonga, or of Gayle before him. And Assombalonga’s 23 goals could only take Posh to a play-off semi-final in May. Selling Assombalonga to Nottingham Forest for £5.5m represented fantastic business for a League One club . Ferguson will no doubt want more money to spend in January and will perhaps expect it given the three promotions he has earned at the club in two spells and the money earned from selling Assombalonga. But the fact of the matter is that at least six of the nine sides above Peterborough in the League One table heading in to 2015 went in to the season with lower expectations and are working on tighter budgets. Ferguson needs to get the best out of what he’s got already and with nearly two weeks until their next match while that review of 2014 takes places, the training field is where he has to find the answers. He has tinkered plenty with formations and players over the course of the year with frustrating consequences for the Posh faithful. Ferguson needs to settle on a team and show his managerial credentials, because Peterborough can’t afford another year like this one. Dwight Gayle signed for Premier League side Crystal Palace from Peterborough in the summer of 2013 . Good Christmas for… NEWPORT . A maximum six points from two games has seen the Welsh side leap up in to the League Two play-offs. Sunday’s 1-0 win at Cheltenham was followed a 2-0 home defeat of Plymouth - results which see Justin Edinburgh’s side enter 2015 in fifth place and just three points off the automatic promotion places. Bad Christmas for… MILLWALL . While the likes of Bolton, Fulham and Reading have been upwardly mobile in the bottom half of the Championship in recent weeks, Ian Holloway’s side have been sinking like stone. A 6-1 drubbing at Norwich on Boxing Day was followed by a 2-0 home defeat by league leaders Bournemouth on Sunday. With the resources available to Wigan and Brighton beneath them, the Lions are now second-favourites for the drop behind stranded Blackpool. Ian Holloway's Millwall lost to Norwich on Boxing Day before going down 2-0 to league leaders Bournemouth . Talent scout: Tom Bradshaw (Walsall) After making his debut for Shrewsbury aged 17, Welsh striker Bradshaw has long been tipped for big things and now, aged 22, he is really beginning to fulfil his promise. Three goals in two games over the festive season have seen Bradshaw takes his tally for the season to 12 in just 15 League One appearances. A summer move to Walsall has kickstarted his career but Bradshaw may not be at the club much longer if he keeps scoring at this rate.

"Sports stars and their Twitter accounts…sometimes brilliant, occasionally controversial, often fist-bitingly ill-advised. From Mario Balotelli’s request for a kiss from the Queen, to the poignant #putoutyourbats Tweets in honour of Phillip Hughes, 2014 has been an eventful year for famous athletes and their social media accounts. Here are the highlights (and lowlights) from the past year. Funnies . Mario Balotelli’s expert trolling of Manchester United after their shock 5-3 defeat by Leicester became the most retweeted tweet from a sports star in 2014. Liverpool forward Mario Balotelli mocked Manchester United after they fell to a 5-3 defeat against Leicester . George Groves was searingly honest following his defeat by Carl Froch in front of 80,000 fans at Wembley in May. You did get 'knocked the **** out,' George!

Colombia got knocked out by Brazil, James Rodriguez tweeted: ‘I can only say thank you Colombia.’ Not many failed to notice the massive grasshopper on his arm. After Colombia's defeat by Brazil, Rodriguez tweeted this, unknowingly with a grasshopper on his right arm . Balotelli again, and this time he was demanding a very particular prize if he helped England into the last-16 of the World Cup. Unfortunately he failed. Balotelli cheekily tweeted that he wanted a kiss from the Queen if Italy beat Costa Rice in the World Cup . After Rory McIlroy dumped Caroline Wozniacki days after sending out wedding invites to friends, our Queen of Twitter got a (small) measure of revenge with this dig at McIlroy’s height. Caroline Wozniacki sent out a sarcastic tweet mocking her former partner Rory McIIroy's height . Michael Owen. Need we say more?

"However pleasing the updated Scottish Premiership table may have been for James McArthur on Sunday evening, he scarcely required smelling salts to revive him for the short taxi ride from Glasgow Airport to Mar Hall. As one of Hamilton’s most celebrated graduates of recent times, the Crystal Palace midfielder has long been able to testify that nothing at the Lanarkshire club happens completely by chance. If there’s every possibility that the 1-0 victory at Celtic Park which took Accies back to the summit of Scottish football will be a short-lived pinnacle for Alex Neil’s side, then who would bet against the newly-promoted outfit yet finishing in the top six or possibly troubling the European places? Hamilton Academicals beat champions Celtic at Celtic Park, something that hasn't happened for 76 years . Since an opening-day wobble at home to Inverness, Accies have now gone 10 games in all competitions without defeat. St Johnstone, St Mirren, Motherwell and now Celtic are among the sides lying in their wake with not a hard-luck story between them. Those who once questioned the benefit the top division would gain from a team with a fan-base edging into four figures have long since been silenced. The real beauty of Hamilton’s success is its simplicity. A policy of augmenting an experienced spine with their finest youth players isn’t just proving successful – it’s also self-funding. McArthur’s initial £500,000 fee to Wigan has recently been topped up by a generous slice of the £7million Palace subsequently paid for him this summer. Likewise, James McCarthy’s initial £1.2m switch to Wigan and his £13m move to Everton plus Brian Easton’s £350,000 switch to Burnley. So much for provincial clubs being unable to turn a coin post-Bosman. James McArthur said he was very proud of his former side, who now top the Scottish Premiership . The conveyer belt just keeps turning. Ali Crawford, Stephen Hendrie and Ziggy Gordon are just a few of the names seemingly destined for bigger things as direct a result of being regularly exposed to the demands of the professional game from a young age. ‘It has been amazing,’ said McArthur with no little understatement. ‘Alex Neil has done a remarkable job in the time he has been involved. Billy Reid needs to get credit, as well, because he took these kids, nurtured them and brought them through. Alex took it on from there. ‘Giving players a chance is the reason why they’ve done so well. You look at the boys who are there - they have not just become good players this year. They’ve played 80-100 games and learned a way of playing. ‘When you play reserve football, you don’t get as much out of it. You only learn so much. They are getting the chance to learn the right way and when you need to go and win a first-team match, you are playing for your career, really. ‘Hamilton are a prime example ... not of the way Scottish football has to go, but in the way they are producing young talent. I think that’s good for the Scotland national team, as well.’ From his own perspective, McArthur finds it impossible to underplay the role the club played in making him into an English Premier League player with international credentials. The Crystal Palace midfielder's recent transfers have brought considerable sums of money to his old club . Asked bluntly if he’d be weighing up the possibility of playing against Georgia on Saturday had he started out elsewhere, he replied: ‘I don’t think I would be. I really believe that being at a club like Hamilton and getting that chance to progress is vital. ‘If you were at another club, you might not get that chance. You play reserve football and don’t progress as fast. I owe a lot personally to Hamilton. ‘I played quite a lot of games and the boys there now have done that, as well, and you learn from playing games. ‘From a personal point of view, I wouldn’t have changed anything – I would always have wanted to be at a club like Hamilton. It’s a small club but it’s run so well. They are such a good club – everyone is so close. ‘But they deserve that (financial rewards), not only for our transfers but for the work they are doing behind the scenes. Starting kids at a young, young age takes time and money and they will continue to progress as a club.’ Perhaps it was the loyalty that Accies seem to instil in their players that led to McArthur thinking twice when Wigan’s own story turned sour a year ago. McArthur playing for Hamilton Academical before his move to Wigan in 2010 . Relegation – even if it did come on the back of an FA Cup – might have been the signal for key players to agitate but a sense of personal responsibility kicked in. ‘It’s where everyone wants to be,’ the 27-year-old said of the top division. ‘But I wanted to stay with Wigan last year and get the club back into the Premier League because I was part of the team that went down so was partly to blame when they got relegated. ‘Everyone had to take their share of responsibility for that so I wanted to stay and try to get them promoted. ‘It didn’t work out like that. I wanted to give it a year and an opportunity came to get back in the Premier League and I’m happy it went through.’ McArthur’s contentment at his new club is understandable. As Palace’s record signing, he was the man the incoming Neil Warnock was prepared to move heaven and earth to land on deadline day. Two defeats in six matches suggest the disquiet that engulfed the club following Tony Pulis’s shock departure has long blown over. McArthur is enjoying playing for Neil Warnock at Crystal Palace, he was Warnock's highest transfer priority . ‘It’s been brilliant,’ he added. ‘The lads are great and we’ve done fine as well, which makes it more enjoyable as well. The manager is very good. I’m happy because he signed me but he keeps everybody in high spirits and is a good laugh. He’s got us organised and we are getting results from it. ‘He has got a funny side to him and that’s good because managers can be too serious sometimes. ‘He builds a happiness in the camp and everyone feeds off that, but when it’s time to do business, he is ready to work hard.’ As was pointed out to him, he might as well have been talking about Gordon Strachan. Also a man who preaches the importance of ensuring the whole of greater than the sum of the parts in any team, the Scotland manager is a stated admirer of McArthur. At Ibrox on Saturday, though, dilemmas abound. Charlie Mulgrew may be missing but the return of Scott Brown, the continuing presence of Darren Fletcher and the omnipresent James Morrison make central midfield places hard to come by. Gordon Strachan's Scotland side face Georgia and Poland in the next European Championships qualifiers . ‘It’s not just the midfield – all the way through the squad there’s competition,’ McArthur continued. ‘It’s the best squad I’ve been involved with. It’s getting harder and harder for the manager to pick the team. That can only be a good thing.’ Whatever side Strachan does select, and no matter the pre-match platitudes, Georgia at home has ‘must win’ stamped all over it. That sense of injustice felt by all in the immediate aftermath of a narrow defeat to Germany was all very well but only by making an authoritative start to the first home match will the sense of belief continue. ‘I think we take a hell of a lot from that performance,’ McArthur reflected ‘We were playing against the world champions and we ran them very close. ‘We want to win every game and we will go into this one trying to get three points as we do in every match. We believe we can do that so we’ll try our best.’","Hamilton Academical beat Celtic 1-0 to go top of Scottish Premiership .

"Jacob Murphy has issued an apology to Blackpool after the on loan winger's dismissive Snapchat about the club went viral on social media. Ahead of their Boxing Day 1-0 defeat at  Championship rivals Sheffield Wednesday, Murphy snapchatted a picture with team-mate Donervon Daniels sarcastically mocking the club's plight in England's second tier. Murphy, who started the clash at Hillsborough, accompanied the photo with the caption 'We are going to lose... Again.' Blackpool's on loan midfielder Jacob Murphy has apologised for his dismissive snapchat about the club . Murphy's snapchat mocking their plight before their trip to Sheffield Wednesday went viral on social media . On Monday, the 19-year-old released a statement on the Tangerines' official websiteÂ apologising for his misdemeanour. 'I'd like to offer my sincerest apologies to the manager, my team-mates, the fans and everybody at Blackpool Football Club for the hurt and embarrassment that a recent photo message I sent has caused,' it read. 'It was totally unprofessional of me and a foolish thing to do. 'I have loved my time at Blackpool so far, and I've been really grateful for the support I've received. 'I know I have let the manager and fans down badly, but I aim to repay them by working even harder and helping the team climb up the league table. 'I'd also like to make clear that Donervon Daniels had no part in this and I apologise for implicating him.' Murphy (front) started the Tangerines' Championship match at home to Rotherham on Sunday . Despite his involvement, Donervon Daniels (left) claims he knew nothing of the picture's intended purposes . Daniels took to Twitter on Monday to distance himself from Murphy's snapchat . Blackpool boss Lee Clark added: 'I'm extremely disappointed because I expect nothing but total professionalism from my players. 'We will now investigate this matter internally before deciding upon an outcome.' Earlier in the day, Daniels tried to distance himself from the Snapchat picture claiming,Â via his Twitter account, he didn't know what the photo's intended purpose was meant for. 'For the record: I do not have snapchat and I was unaware what the selfie was being used for. I appreciate the continued support from BFC,' he tweeted. Blackpool boss Lee Clark condemned Murphy's action via the club's official website on Monday . Despite his indiscretion, Murphy has impressed during his loan spell at the Seasiders from fellow Championship side Norwich City.

"Crystal Palace and Swansea are keen on Hamilton's rising star Stephen Hendrie. The talented left-back is already being tipped to follow in the footsteps of Hull City's Andrew Robertson who has flourished since his £2.8million move from Dundee United and developed into Scotland's first choice. Scouts from both clubs watched Hendrie in a behind-closed-doors friendly at West Bromwich Albion earlier this month and were at Saturday's victory over St Mirren. Hamilton defender Stephen Hendrie is being tracked by Premier League duo Crystal Palace and Swansea . Cardiff have also watched Hendrie who is valued at around £2m by the Scottish Premiership side. The 19-year-old has been part of Hamilton's first team since 2011 and has also featured for Scotland's youth teams. Hendrie made his debut for Scotland Under 21s in September and has featured for them twice more in the months since. Hendrie, still only 19-years-old, has represented Scotland at Under 17, Under 19 and Under 21 level .","Stephen Hendrie has impressed for Hamilton this season .

"Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana feels the team may have finally begun showing their best form after knitting together a cohesive performance which produced goals. The 4-1 home win over Swansea was the first time since late March the side had scored that many in the league. Goals, over 100 of them, were what the Reds built their title challenge on last season but their strength up front disappeared with the sale of Luis Suarez and loss of Daniel Sturridge to injury. Adam Lallana is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring his second goal of the night at Anfield . Lukasz Fabianski (left) fires the ball into Lallana's shoulder, resulting in the midfielder's first goal . However, they are approaching the time when, 12 months ago, they went on an incredible run which saw them almost pip Manchester City for the Premier League crown and with Sturridge to return in the next few weeks optimism is beginning to grow again. 'The last two or three weeks we really feel as if we have turned a corner,' said Lallana. 'We've been picking up results and playing better - that was missing for the first three months of the season. 'Against Arsenal we felt hard done by to only get a point (they dominated the game but drew 2-2), we put in a gritty performance against Burnley (to win 1-0) and it was important we got the win against Swansea. Lallana scored twice during Liverpool's 4-1 Premier League win against Swansea on Monday . Lallana claims Liverpool are finally beginning to show their best form as the season reaches the halfway stage . 'We knew the Christmas period was a great chance for us to pick up maximum points and slide up the table and we are looking for more of the same against Leicester on Thursday.' Lallana produced arguably his best performance in a Liverpool shirt since his £25million summer move from Southampton with two goals against Swansea. He accepts he has had a tough time settling in, especially with a number of other new arrivals, but believes everyone is starting to find their feet. 'It's been difficult, we're not going to shy away from that, for one reason or another,' he added. 'The lads are slowly settling into the team and Emre Can (playing as the third centre-back) was brilliant. Liverpool celebrate their fourth goal against Swansea, the first time in nine months they have scored four . 'I thought Alberto Moreno and Javier Manquillo put in really disciplined performances. 'It's not easy for them coming from abroad, being young, not being able to speak the language, so I'm really happy for them as well as the team.' Lallana was happy with his own performance, which was the first time since March 2012 he has scored twice - those goals coming against Barnsley in the Championship. His first may have had a touch of good fortune when goalkeeper Lucasz Fabianski's clearance rebounded off him but the second involved some nifty footwork and a clinical finish. Lallana celebrates with Alberto Moreno (left), and the midfield heaped praise on his young Spanish teammate . Moreno, one of Brendan Rodgers' summer signings, scored Liverpool's first goal on Monday night . 'It was nice. The first one people can say it was lucky but if you don't close down the keeper then you don't get the goal,' he added. 'I've played lot of my football in a central role and I feel more relaxed and comfortable there with a bit more of a free role.' After an odd performance at Burnley, where they were second best but came away with three points, the display against Swansea was more akin with the way they played against Arsenal just before Christmas. Manager Brendan Rodgers has tinkered with formations and selections but he now feels everyone is on board with how he wants to play - and that is on the front foot in a 3-4-3 set-up. 'That was what was missing from our way of working for the first period of the season,' he said. The 26-year-old slides his second goal past the onrushing Fabianski during the second half at Anfield . 'We are a team that plays with a big pressure, we have got technically-gifted players in the team, but that ability to press the ball allows them to get chances and create chances at the far end of the field. 'If you look at how we played against Manchester United we were very unfortunate and we conceded poor goals but the creativity started that day. 'We looked at a shape and system that could get us back to how we played last year. 'We didn't quite get that result but I saw enough. We moved on to Bournemouth and played really well, Arsenal we deserved more and again the performance was better. 'We had to show a different side against Burnley and Burnley's result against Manchester City (a 2-2 draw) showed what a great result we had at Turf Moor. 'Against Swansea we came out with the intensity and work-rate and got a reward. 'Our creativity was very much there but a solid base behind it and that is key for us.'","Liverpool scored four times for the first time in the league since March .

"Garry Monk has warned ‘lazy’ Jonjo Shelvey that he faces the axe from the Swansea team unless he ‘wises up’. Monk’s patience with the 22-year-old is close to snapping as Shelvey prepares to face his former club Liverpool on Monday. It will throw into sharp relief how much Shelvey has, or has not, developed since leaving Anfield in 2013. Swansea midfielder Jonjo Shelvey has been booked six times already this season . He has already warned Shelvey about his habit of picking up cheap bookings and the latest flashpoint came on Friday, when the midfielder picked up his sixth yellow card of the season for needlessly hauling down Gabriel Agbonlahor in the first half of the win over Aston Villa. Shelvey was then pulled off early in the second half and his place in tonight’s fixture at Liverpool is also in jeopardy. Monk said: ‘I have spoken to him clearly about it. Silly bookings, we can’t afford it. ‘I have spoken to Jonjo and he has to wise up. The yellow card came from being lazy and he has to be better than that. ‘There are only so many times you can say it — he has to learn very quickly and make sure he works instead of being lazy and risking a red or coming off.’ Shelvey has been in distinctly patchy form since his England call, with four of his next 10 games coming from the bench. Monk is known to have concerns about Shelvey’s maturity, but while his age has been used in mitigation in the past, Monk is no longer granting him any leeway. He said: ‘It is about doing your job properly and understanding the role you are playing, not just for yourself, but for the team. I have spoken to him about this and he has to learn, otherwise he won’t play games. ‘I don’t want to be in that position where he gets a yellow and I’m thinking the rest of the game that there could be a sending-off. I shouldn’t have to worry, so it isn’t my problem, it is Jonjo’s. I see him every day and his ability is frightening. I have said I am more than willing to give him the chance to show it, but you also need to want it yourself. I think he does want it, but he also needs to understand the time for being lazy with it is gone. He has to push himself. He’s not a kid any more.’ Liverpool look set to recall goalkeeper Simon Mignolet after Brad Jones injured his thigh against Burnley on Boxing Day. Shelvey has struggled to find his best form for the Welsh club in recent weeks . Swansea boss Garry Monk (left) revealed he has warned Shelvey about his conduct . Mignolet has had a rotten season and came in for heavy criticism before he was dropped. But he has since held a frank conversation about his form with Brendan Rodgers. He said: ‘We spoke together, cleared up a few things and that was a positive discussion. I will keep my head down and work hard and try to do my best. ‘I will not discuss what we said, but it was an honest meeting. That is always a positive. The negative thing was being out of the team but you try to make it a positive and that is what I am trying to do. Sometimes you can reflect on certain things when you are out of the team because during the busy periods you maybe don’t get a chance to. ‘That is what I have done with the goalkeeper coach and the gaffer and you learn a lot. We can move on and hopefully build on that. I don’t have to prove anything.’","Jonjo Shelvey has tested the patience of Swansea boss Garry Monk .

"Fabricio Coloccini was never going to get the Newcastle job, Mike Ashley will look elsewhere for his next manager after Alan Pardew decided to head back to Crystal Palace. But it got us thinking… whatever happened to the player-manager? The man who would call the shots and occasionally turn to himself when all else failed? They are a dying breed. Ryan Giggs gave himself 20 minutes of playing time for Manchester United at the end of last season – 20 more than Garry Monk afforded himself at Swansea in the same campaign – and you have to go back to 2000, when Stuart McCall led Bradford for two matches, to find the previous Premier League player-manager. Here, Sportsmail has a look at some good and bad player-managers from down the years. John Toshack . The past 40 years have contained not one but two Swansea surges from bottom division to top. The first of those was led by Toshack, who was so keen to get into coaching that he took his badges at 18. Having enjoyed a stellar playing career that included a European Cup win with Liverpool, he became Swansea’s player-manager in 1978, aged 28. He led them from the Fourth Division to the top flight in four seasons, during which he actually scored the goal that clinched promotion to the second division. John Toshack (left) pictured with Phil Boersma during the pair's time at Swansea City in the 1980-81 season . Kenny Dalglish . The Liverpool legend certainly pulled his weight. He took over as player-manager from Joe Fagan in 1985 and in his first season won the First Division and FA Cup. Poetically, he also scored the goal that sealed the league title. He went on to score six goals in 18 games the next season (1986-87), but willingly sacrificed himself to bring younger players through and only played twice in the 1987-88 campaign as Liverpool won their 17th title. He made his final league appearance in 1990, aged 39. Liverpool player-manager Kenny Dalglish poses with the FA Cup (left) and the league trophy in 1986 . Graeme Souness . Souness rounded off his remarkable playing career by turning out 50 times for Glasgow Rangers over a five-year spell as their player-manager. They won three league titles and three League Cups under Souness, who retained his fiery side in the role. Recalling a huge row he had in 1989 with St Johnstone tea lady, Aggie Moffat, he said: ‘My marriage had hit problems, I was living in a big house in Edinburgh on my own, I was getting followed everywhere, I was banned from the touchline. Then the tipping point came when we went to St Johnstone. ‘We'd been there earlier in the season and there had been an incident with the tea-lady. Then we went back again for a night game and there was another incident. The boys were cleaning their boots in the dressing room and she took exception to that. She stormed up to see her chairman and I followed up behind her. I had an argument with their chairman and I knew within myself that I was ready to explode.’ Rangers player-manager Graeme Souness (right) pictured with his assistant Walter Smith (left) in 1991 . Glenn Hoddle . The first in a line of three successive Chelsea player-managers. Hoddle had been player-manager at Swindon in the early Nineties and took them to the Premier League via back-to-back promotions, including a goal in the 1993 play-off final. He followed promotion by taking the same dual role with Chelsea and in his first season led them to the FA Cup final. Hoddle also reached the Cup Winners’ Cup semi-final and signed Ruud Gullit. Chelsea player-manager Glenn Hoddle looks on as his side beat Luton Town 2-0 in the 1994 FA Cup semi-final . Ruud Gullit . Iconic and magnificent as a player, Gullit was initially a success in management. He took over at Chelsea after Hoddle left to manage England in his first season won the 1997 FA Cup, even though he did not play in the final. In doing so, he became the first non-British manager to win the trophy and also landed Chelsea’s first significant silverware in 26 years. He was controversially sacked in 1998, with chairman Ken Bates reportedly saying: ‘I didn't like his arrogance – in fact I never liked him.’ Chelsea player-manager Rudd Gullit (back centre) joins in the celebrations after winning the 1997 FA Cup . Gianluca Vialli . Just as Hoddle was replaced by a man he signed, so was Gullit. He took over as player-manager with Chelsea in the semi-finals of the League Cup and quarter-finals of the Cup Winners’ Cup and he won both. In winning the latter aged 33, Vialli made history as the youngest manager to win a UEFA competition – a distinction he held until Andre Villas-Boas won the Europa League in 2011. The following season, Chelsea finished third, which was their highest placing since 1970. Vialli scored against Derby in his final competitive appearance for Chelsea at the last game of that 1998-99. Gianluca Vialli (right) on the training pitch during his time as Chelsea player-manager in 1999 . Stuart Pearce . Responsible for one notable managerial mishap when he took his first foray into the business as player-manager of Nottingham Forest in December 1996. Having replaced Frank Clark, who had resigned, his task was to lift Nottingham Forest off the bottom of the Premier League. His first game was at home against Arsenal and he was delighted with his attempt at selecting a team, until his wife pointed out he had picked 11 outfield players and no goalkeeper. He was manager of the month in January but moved aside for Dave Bassett in March 1997. He played on for five more years. Stuart Pearce, then player-manager of Nottingham Forest, salutes the crowd before a match in 1996 . Romario . A World Cup winner as a player, a politician and a general manager of a club who once sacked his old team-mate Bebeto – it is only fitting that the former Brazil striker will have held the player-manager role at some point. In October 2007, he was appointed player manager at Vasco da Gama in Brazil and scored 15 goals, aged 41. He then tested positive for a drug that can act as a masking agent for anabolic steroids, though he claimed it was for an anti-baldness treatment. He was later sacked over a row with his bosses about interference in team selection. Vasco da Gama player-manager Romario gives instructions to his players during a match in October 2007 . Edgar Davids . Davids was playing park football in London when a friend of a friend called and asked if he fancied a few games for Barnet in 2012. He became player-manager, telling Sportsmail that year: ‘I am not ready to stop. I might go on to be a great manager, but really I want to have few more games right now. I don’t want to be paid for this, not a dime.’ It was colourful. One afternoon, he sent his team bus to pick up supporters stranded on the hard shoulder of a motorway. He also gave himself the No 1 shirt, despite playing midfield, and picked up three red cards in eight games at the start of the 2013-14 season. He resigned in January 2014.

Harlequins fielded a much weakened line-up with Chris Robshaw, Nick Evans and Luke Wallace all absent through injury. Joe Marler and Nick Easter were also rested, while Danny Care started on the bench. Fly-half Swiel, and number eight James Chisholm both made their first Premiership starts. Newcastle made eight changes from last week's defeat at the hands of Stade Francais. Skipper Will Welch returned as did fellow forwards Scott Wilson and Ally Hogg. Tuilagi, Mike Blair and Sinoti were recalled to take up places in the back division. Newcastle began with a thrilling movement, which almost resulted in the game's first try. Inside his own half, Sinoti fielded a clearance kick, before exploding past three defenders to set up a position in the opposition 22. The ball was recycled for Tuilagi to bounce off Marland Yarde's attempted tackle before being forced into touch, inches short of the try line. Newcastle dominated but only had a solitary try from Alex Tuilagi, which was converted by Juan Pablo Socino . However Quins relieved the early pressure to take a ninth minute lead when Swiel kicked a penalty. Incisive breaks from Karl Dickson for Quins and Sinoti then followed but though neither resulted in tries, although they certainly contributed to a highly entertaining first 20 minutes. Newcastle continued to be the better side but Socino spurned their first chance for points when his penalty attempt went badly astray. The Falcons then suffered two further blows in quick succession. First, lively full back Simon Hammersley left the field with an injury to be replaced by Noah Cato before lock Dom Barrow limped off with Kane Thompson coming on. Tuilagi goes over in the first half, it was all the Falcons had to show for their efforts . The second quarter was nowhere as good as the first as it was frequently disrupted by treatment for injuries. However there was still some creative running with bursts from George Lowe and Blair testing the opposition defences. Quins had a chance to extend their lead by kicking an easy penalty but they opted for an attacking line-out. This proved to be the wrong call as hooker Joe Gray's throw went straight to a Newcastle jumper. The visitors made them pay for that error by scoring the opening try in first-half stoppage time. From a line-out in the home 22, the Falcons pack drove forward and Tuilagi was on hand to force his way over, with Socino converting for a deserved 7-3 lead at the interval. Swiel's remarkable kicking game saved Quins from defeat and took them nine points clear of Newcastle . Quins began the second half poorly so they made two replacements after nine minutes of the half with David Ward and Will Collier being introduced into the front row. Ugo Monye soon followed onto the field as he replaced Asaeli Tikoirotuma. Against the run of play, Quins reduced the arrears to one point. Lowe and Matt Hopper made strong runs to get the hosts into the Newcastle half and earn a penalty. Swiel made no mistake with the kick. Tom Catterick's restart went straight into touch, which handed Quins the initiative, and when Newcastle were again penalised Swiel put them 9-7 ahead on the hour-mark. Care became the fourth Quins' replacement just in time to see Swiel kick his fourth penalty after George McGuigan was penalised for not releasing. The home side then had their best period of the match and another Newcastle infringement saw Swiel again on target to send the Falcons home without even a bonus point.

"Everton have often been the architects of their own downfall this season and it was more of the same in the 3-2 defeat by Newcastle at St James' Park on Sunday. Aiden McGeady's misplaced pass led to Ayoze Perez's strike and Ross Barkley's poor control allowed Jack Colback to score the winner, meaning the Toffees have now made 10 errors leading directly to goals this season. Not only is that the highest amount in the Premier League, no other team in Europe's top five divisions has had more serious mistakes punished. Everton's Leighton Baines, Seamus Coleman, Samuel Eto'o and Antolin Alcaraz (left-right) appear dejected . Newcastle midfielder Jack Colback (left) pounces on a mistake by Ross Barkley to score against Everton . Toffees boss Roberto Martinez has seen his side make 10 errors leading to goals already this season . Everton (Premier League) - 10 . Parma (Serie A) - 10 . Evian (Ligue 1) - 9 . Borussia Dortmund (Bundesliga) - 9 . Granada (La Liga) - 8 . Italian strugglers Parma, who are bottom of Serie A with just six points from 16 games, have also managed to cost themselves 10 goals because of poor decisions and execution. Everton's figure is almost double the amount made by Sunderland and Liverpool (six), who sit joint second in the table of goal-costing errors. The Toffees had only conceded 18 goals at the same stage of last season but it's been a different story under Roberto Martinez since August, with 31 let in already. Liverpool have conceded six goals due to defensive errors - the joint second highest amount in the division . Everton striker Romelu Lukaku (fifth left) scores at the wrong end against Southampton as Tim Howard dives . Sunderland players look shocked after allowing James Chester to score for Hull on Boxing Day . Sylvain Distin, Phil Jagielka, Gareth Barry and Tim Howard have all made howlers, leaving the Merseyside outfit much closer to the drop zone than a coveted spot in the top four. Below Sunderland and Liverpool in the table sit Newcastle, West Brom and Crystal Palace, each of whom have made five errors leading directly to goals so far. Aston Villa, Leicester and Arsenal have all made four, while Tottenham, Manchester City, QPR and West Ham have all made three. Phil Jones (right) and Manchester United's defence have made just one error leading to a goal this season . Despite only being out of the relegation zone on goal difference, Steve Bruce's Hull have made just mistakes which have led directly to goals - the same amount as high-flying Southampton. But the best record in the division is shared by Manchester United, Burnley, Chelsea, Stoke and Swansea, all of whom have conceded just once because of an individual error. Everton - 10 . Sunderland - 6 . Liverpool - 6 . Newcastle - 5 . Crystal Palace - 5 . West Brom - 5 . Aston Villa - 4 . Leicester - 4 . Arsenal - 4 . Tottenham - 3 . West Ham - 3 . Manchester City - 3 . QPR - 3 .

"Former Chelsea defender Frank Leboeuf has warned Paris Saint Germain that new signing David Luiz is not a central defender because he forgets his responsibilities to rove forward. Despite the Brazilian joining the Ligue 1 champions for a world record fee of 50 million euros (£39.9m) for a defender after having won the Champions League and Europa League in his favoured position, Leboeuf still thinks he would be better used in midfield. Speaking to RMC, the World Cup winner said: 'He's a great player, but he's not a central defender because he forgets a huge amount of things. t's up to him to work and be focused.' Scroll down for videos... Hair raising! David Luiz has signed for Paris Saint Germain in a world record fee for a defender . Food for thought: Frank Leboeuf has warned former teammate Laurent Blanc that Luiz is not a defender . Leboeuf has urged the 27-year-old to learn from former teammate and PSG coach Laurent Blanc - whom he replaced in the 1998 World Cup final in France . 'He is fortunate to have a coach who was a defender and who can help him. He's going to have to work because he only thinks about going forward and that creates gaps at the back. 'When he played in midfield with Chelsea, I thought he was very good. He gets through an extraordinary amount of work. 'I'm critical of him because when he plays at the back, he doesn't think like a central defender. He goes beyond his pay grade, because he only goes forward.' Meanwhile, Angel Di Maria will not be joining Paris Saint-Germain from Real Madrid this summer because he is 'too expensive'. Forward thinking: David Luiz is too focussed on surging forward than defensive responsibilities . The French champions were expected to complete a deal in excess of £50million for the Argentine winger with Manchester United also interested. But PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi revealed at a press conference on Thursday, where new signing Luiz was also unveiled, that Di Maria's fee was too much. Al-Khelaifi said: 'We spoke with Real Madrid about the possibility of signing Angel Di Maria, but it was too expensive.' CLICK HERE to start picking your Fantasy Football team NOW!

"Amir Khan says he will travel to Pakistan before the end of the year to show his support for the victims of the army school massacre in Peshawar. Khan, who returned to England from Las Vegas where he saw off Devon Alexander last weekend, is one of the most high-profile sportsmen in Asia and hopes his trip will 'send a statement' as the country of his parents' birth tries to recover from the atrocity committed by the Taliban where 141 people, mainly children, were killed. 'I will be going to Pakistan between Christmas and New Year,' he told several national newspapers. Amir Khan has been affected by the atrocity committed in Pakistan, and has pledged his support to the cause . A Pakistani soldier stands guard at the Peshawar school building splattered with the blood of victims . 'Talking about this stuff could be threatening for me, but I just want to speak the truth and tell people what is happening is wrong. 'I think it's more important now than ever to go over there. I think it will send a statement to a lot of people that Amir Khan is going there to make a difference. I want it to be a better country. It's just a shame - I cannot believe how sick some people are.' Khan, who has already donated the gold shorts worth £30,000 he wore during the Alexander fight towards rebuilding the school, says the appalling act hit him especially hard after becoming a father for the first time in May.

'The news hurt me even more having a little girl,' he said. 'Imagine sending my daughter to school and hearing that she got killed. Innocent kids, killed over nothing. They had nothing to do with anything, they had not done anything, and the Taliban went and killed them. 'They are killing their own people and I'm thinking to myself, 'Why are these people doing that? Have they got no brains?' Setting the teachers on fire in front of the kids? These people are ruthless. 'It's very disgusting seeing or hearing stuff like this.

"We've all been there. The ball takes a bobble when you're six yards out, and you fire it high over the bar. You swing too early and the sweet strike you've pictured in your head is but a distant memory. Fortunately, it happens to professional footballers too... even the very best. Step forward Adam Szalai, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and - twice - Junior Malanda. Sportsmail counts down the top 10 Bundesliga misses of 2014... 10) Johannes Geis - Mainz . 'High, wide and not very handsome,' as the commentator described it. Admittedly, this isn't your typical miss from close range. Attempting to whip a free-kick in from the left wing, Johannes Geis' cross ends up in Row Z of the Mainz crowd. As he steps up to the ball, his left foot lifts up the turf and the final ball looks more like a rugby conversion than a football free-kick. A chunk of turf is ripped out by Johannes Geis' remarkable free-kick for Mainz, which balloons over the bar . 9) Adam Szalai - Hoffenheim . Partly a terrible miss, partly a cracking save. As if facing Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich wasn't hard enough, Adam Szalai will be kicking himself that he didn't make the most of this gilt-edged opportunity. Dead centre, in the 16-yard-box, the ball fell to the Hubgarian striker, who chested the ball down ready to fire it home. Unfortunately for him - and his team, who went on to lose 4-0 - the ball had little power, and Manuel Neuer was able to poke it away from danger. Adam Szalai of Hoffenheim (centre) has the whole goal to aim for but finds the foot of Manuel Neuer . 8) Klaas-Jan Huntelaar - Schalke . 'The Hunter' as he has been affectionately named, has scored 66 goals in 112 appearances for Schalke. 38 in 69 for the Netherlands, too. But when the ball fell to the 31-year-old in the centre of the goal, he was simply not able to stick it in the back of the net. Proof, it seems, that it happens to the best of us. Thankfully for Huntelaar, Schalke went on to beat Hertha Berlin 2-0. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar (third left) has a simple finish into the bottom corner but puts the ball wide of the mark . Huntelaar has been nicknamed 'The Hunter' due to his impressive scoring record, but he missed this chance . 7) Christian Gentner - Stuttgart . Stuttgart's stalwart Christian Gentnder had a moment to forget at Werder Bremen this year. His team lost 2-0, so it's firmly a case of what might have been had he headed home from close range. Somehow, he gets it all wrong and heads the ball directly into the ground, before it bounces up over the bar. An empty goal, and what should have been an easy finish... Stuttgart's Christian Gentner should have cushioned his header into the net, but he puts it high and wide . 6) Raffael - Borussia Monchengladbach . From a contender for goal of the season, to a contender for miss of the season in a split-second. What starts as a wonderful team move finishes with a disappointing miss. To be fair to Raffael, there's a brilliant piece of defending on the line to save a certain goal. But it's a strike that would have been his side win, with the scores at 1-1 with less than two minutes remaining. Raffael didn't show the touch of a Brazilian when he shot at the defender on the line . 5) Sebastian Freis - Freiburg . It's a striker's dream. Right place, right time. A shot is spilled by the opposition goalkeeper and you're there to mop up and collect the praise. But for Freiburg's Sebastian Freis, he had a moment to forget when the ball fell to his feet in a match against Stuttgart this year. He shot, but the ball flew high and wide of a target that was gaping in front of him. To rub salt in the wounds, his team went on to lose 4-1. Not their day. Sebastian Freis was gifted with a chance when the keeper spilled it, but he put the ball wide . 4) Roel Brouwers - Borussia Monchengladbach . He did everything but the finish. Roel Brouwers is the second Borussia Monchengladbach player in this countdown, after his terrible miss against Bayer Leverkusen. The corner flew in from the right, and Brouwers got lucky with a touch off the defender. He is left with just the keeper to beat, but puts the ball over the bar. Roel Brouwers got lucky when the ball fell to him from a corner, but he puts it well over the bar . 3) Junior Malanda - Wolfsburg . Wolfsburg's Junior Malanda is in at three... and it's not his only appearance on this countdown. A fantastic ball is whipped in from the right, but the Belgian defensive midfielder gets himself in a tangle and can not put the ball in the back of the net. Junior Malanda's first entry sees him get in a tangle while playing for Wolfsburg . 2) Junior Malanda - Wolfsburg . The phrase, 'It was harder to miss' has never been more true. Junior Malanda, take a bow. Less than a yard out, his initial shot lands at his feet for him to poke home. But alas, he somehow - inexplicably - puts the ball wide. In a quite remarkable miss, Malanda puts the ball wide from very, very close range . 1) Philipp Hofmann - KC Kaiserslautern . There aren't sufficient words to describe this miss. Simple doesn't do it justice. Easy isn't strong enough. This is, quite simply, atrocious. Philipp Hofmann of Kaiserslautern certainly won't be living this down for a good few years to come. In at number one, Kaiserslautern's Philipp Hofmann manages to put the ball over the bar from a yard out .","Adam Szalai's miss against Bayern Munich makes the list .

"Click here for your ultimate stats guide from the game including Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey's heat map . Arsene Wenger and Neil Adams will wake up on Monday morning knowing they both face critical weeks. The burden of Arsenal’s nine-year trophy drought will weigh heavily on Wenger’s shoulders in the coming days as he prepares his team for Saturday’s FA Cup Final against Hull. Adams, meanwhile, will discover on Tuesday whether he will be handed the chance of trying to secure an instant return into the Barclays Premier League after Norwich’s relegation was confirmed by Sunday’s defeat. The rookie boss wants the manager’s job on a full-time basis, but his team hardly did their best to ensure he has a chance of landing the role on a permanent basis as their top-flight journey ended with a whimper.

Attendance: 26,848 . *Ratings by SAMI MOKBEL at Carrow Road . ‘I’ve made my intentions clear, I want to stay on, to carry on working with the first team,’ said Adams. ‘I will find out by the end of the week. We are off on Monday, but we are back in on Tuesday and we’ll about it talk then. ‘It . is inevitable clubs will be looking at our best players and it will be . difficult to keep them, while one or two will be looking to leave. ‘But we want to keep as many as we can because we want to have a proper crack at coming straight back up.’ With . Malky Mackay available to work again after dropping his legal case . against Cardiff chief Vincent Tan and Tim Sherwood set to be on the . market following his expected dismissal as Spurs manager, Adams’ chances . look slim. Adams’ job prospects are unlikely to register in Wenger’s thoughts this week, however.

I'll be over there: Jack Wilshere started on the bench for Arsenal but came on with just over an hour gone . He's back: Jack Wilshere made his comeback from injury as a second-half substitute against Norwich . Jack Wilshere proved his fitness for Brazil with a second-half cameo for Arsenal that will ease Roy Hodgson’s fears. The England boss would also have been encouraged by the performance of John Ruddy. The Norwich goalkeeper made several excellent saves to ensure his side weren’t embarrassed on the final day of the season. ‘I wish Monaco well, but there is no interest there,’ said Wenger. ‘Today was a good basis to prepare for the Cup final. The fact we got 79 points is proof that we have made progress. ‘Unfortunately . it’s the first time a club finishes fourth with 79 points. It was a . tight Premier League. Liverpool, Chelsea and us can be frustrated, the . number of points made by the top teams is top quality. ‘Whoever . wins it deserves it, but Manchester City just got over the line without . the brilliance they showed at the start of the season. They came from . behind after having three games in hand.’ With . Norwich’s relegation into the Championship virtually secured and .

And . it showed as the clash got off to a subdued start, with the first . effort of real note arriving in the 18th minute when Lukasz Fabianski - . making his first league start of the season - parried Nathan Redmond’s . long range effort. The home . side had John Ruddy to thank for not going in a half-time well behind as . the England goalkeeper made three brilliant stops to deny Lukas . Podolski and Olivier Giroud - his stop to thwart the Frenchman’s first . effort particularly eye-catching. The . largely dour first-half was all forgotten in the 53rd minute, when . Aaron Ramsey smashed home an exceptionally well-executed volley from 14 . yards after Giroud’s pinpoint cross to put Arsenal ahead.

"A former SAS soldier died after he plummeted 100ft to the ground in a paragliding accident. Experienced glider, Bill Young, 64, from Southampton, lost control when a gust of wind got caught in the wing of his craft and crashed to the ground. The former TA reservist, who had served with the SAS, had carried out 97 jumps in the UK and across Europe in his training. Bill Young, 64, lost control of the craft when a gust of wind caught its wing and he began falling to the ground . He began falling when his wing collapsed but quickly corrected it, before once more falling to the ground at speed. Emergency services and friends rallied round in a desperate bid to save him, but despite their best efforts he was pronounced dead at the scene at Combe Gibbet in Hungerford, Berkshire. His three children have since paid tribute to him, saying he died doing what he loved most. Gary Young, who learnt of his father's final moments from a friend, said: ‘He was in a good mood, he was happy and bubbly, his goal for the day was that he landed safely. The former SAS soldier, who has three children, attempted to fix broken wing but glider plummeted 100ft . He cycled 13,000 miles for 13 months during 1993 and 1994 from Perth, Scotland, to Perth, Australia, to raise cash for a Wessex Heartbeat campaign . ‘The wing collapsed. He managed to correct it, flew for another couple of seconds, got to around 100 feet and then he fell to the ground at speed. ‘He died doing something he loved. He would rather have gone that way.’ The grandfather-of-seven was also enthusiastic about kitesurfing and snowboarding – sports that took him around the world. He added: ‘Dad loved to kitesurf all over the world. He most recently travelled around Morocco and had been to Vietnam and Brazil. He always carried his board and kites in his van. ‘He also loved to snowboard and in his earlier years he would cycle, which saw him competing in a triathlon and marathons. ‘He even rode from Perth, Scotland, to Perth, Australia for charity and to visit his friend Tony. ‘It was a family joke that he rode all the way across the world to see Tony, but when he knocked at the door in Perth, Australia, he was not in. The children of the grandfather-of-seven have paid tribute to him saying Mr Young 'died doing what he loved' He was also enthusiastic about kitesurfing and snowboarding – sports that took him around the world . ‘Paragliding was his most recent love and again took him travelling the world. He flew in France, Spain, Morocco, and all over the UK. ‘We are not sure how he got into it, but we think it is because it is a light wind alternative to kitesurfing. ‘He was happily single with no ties but he had seven grandchildren, who share his love of the outdoors and his eldest has his love of travel, too.’ Guy Young, 37, said: ‘He was very proud that he brought us up and loved us all greatly.’ Their sister Kay, 38, added: ‘He would try everything - he always said he never wanted to grow up. ‘He would check the wind first thing in the morning before he started work. That was his life. He was always there if you needed him.’ Mr Young was a member of 21 SAS Unit attached to D squadron, which he joined in February 1973 and served nearly 15 years, without being called up.

The couple hinted at their nuptials by . both wearing gold bands on their wedding fingers to the premiere of The . Best Man Holiday in Los Angeles on November 5. Staff at Mira's restaurant, the Shabu Shabu bar in Santa Ana, this week confirmed the couple had wed - but admitted they had no idea they were even dating until their marriage.

Model: Mira Pak poses at the HIN Hot Import Nights Bikini Models Gogo Battle 2012 . Bride: Mira Pak married actor Terrence Howard - just one month after meeting him . Indeed, it's believed the pair were only going out for a month before they tied the knot. And one staff member said: 'Mira does what she pleases, we never know when we're going to see her. 'It's all a bit crazy this thing with Terrence. We didn't have a clue that she was even dating him, then we all heard that she'd married him, and now we don't know where she is.' When asked to comment on actor's marriage, his ex-wife Michelle Ghent - whom he only divorced in May - made it clear she was aware of the union, but told MailOnline: 'I can't say anything about this.'

His marriage to Michelle ended in acrimony after three years - and last week, it was revealed she has accused the star of not paying his court ordered spousal support, which amounts to more than $100,000, reported RadarOnline. Wedding rings: Terrence Howard and his new wife Mira Pak flaunted their wedding bands as they turned up to a charity event in LA on December 7 . Debut: Terrence Howard and wife Mira made their debut as newlyweds at the premiere of The Best Man Holiday in Los Angeles on November 5 . Court papers also reveal Michelle has accused Terrence of leaving her with a credit card bill for their failed reconciliation attempt in Costa Rica earlier this year. She claims: 'Since the commencement date of 5/15/12, Terrence Howard has only made sporadic payments to me totaling $18,435 and owes an arrearage sum of $63,303… Terrence Howard owes me $122,221.64 including interest… legal fees to my lawyer, $15,500.' Michelle also said that Howard’s alleged failure to pay her has ruined her credit score and forced her to move out of her apartment. 'During our recent reconciliation, Terrence Howard frequently made charges on my credit cards as Respondent does not have his own credit cards and promised to reimburse me for his charges,' she alleges. The pair tried to rekindle their relationship earlier this year with a trip to Costa Rica, and Michelle says Howard still owes her for that holiday. 'At Terrence Howard’s request, I charged our 7/2013 trip to Costa Rica on my credit card. The unreimbursed charges for the Costa Rica trip and prior charges are approx. $18,282.' The filing also reveals Terrence earned $856,442.77 between May 2012 and June 2013, reports Radar. Michelle's accusation is just the latest in a bitter saga between the former couple. She was granted a temporary protection order by a Los Angeles judge in August, preventing Terrence from coming within 100 yards of her after claiming he beat her during their Costa Rica trip in July. Fourth time's a charm: Terrance Howard tied the knot with his girlfriend of one month . It does the job: Terrence, left, and Mira, right, showed off their simple wedding bands at the premiere of Best Man Holiday on November 5 . Terrence countered saying he did not . lay a finger on her and that she had attacked him with a pepper spray, . striking his adult daughter and another family member as well. Though . the pair went their separate ways when divorce papers were finalised in . May, the two tried to rekindle their relationship as they travelled . together to the Central American country with Terrence's family. The . termination of their relationship in 2011 was notoriously acrimonious, . with Michelle accusing her husband of turning violent within months of . their quiet marriage in 2010.

"Former Chelsea midfielder Florent Malouda has has signed for French Ligue 1 side Metz on a one-year deal. The 34-year-old has been without a club since leaving Turkish side Tranbszonspor at the end of last season, and returns to his native France for the first time since he left Lyon for Stamford Bridge in 2007. Malouda had been linked with a move to a host of Championship clubs, including Birmingham, but dismissed any possible move out of hand via his official Twitter account. Florent Malouda reveals his signing for French club Metz on Instagram . FC Metz announce the signing of Malouda on their official Twitter page .

Malouda then tweeted the next day: 'So Now they pretend to talk with my agent... I wish one day they introduce me to that mysterious agent... I simply don't have any #ownboss.' It has since transpired, however, that Malouda's agent didn't actually contact the player to tell him of Birmingham's interest, which led to Blues boss Lee Clark responding with ire to the tweets of the winger. 'A member of my staff (head of recruitment) Malcolm Crosby, was contacted by the player’s agent,' Clark told the Birmingham Mail. 'We were asked if we were interested.

"The starting point for the bamboo train of Battambang wasn't quite a station, more a collection of tumbledown rural buildings. But commuters on this line don't need much of a station, because there is no waiting. So many 'trains' are available, it is more like picking up a rail taxi. Scroll down for video . Inventive: The line runs through the countryside in Battambang province in the rural north-west of Cambodia . These trains are the travel solution along several stretches of partly wrecked Cambodian track. Here proper trains no longer run - so people make their own. Originally, the bogies for these trains were made from the wheels of tanks abandoned after the civil war. Now they are made in local workshops, as are the trains' flatbed trucks - bamboo platforms called 'nori', which carry passengers, livestock, rice and market goods. Take me home, country rails: The abandoned rail line forges through lush scenery in rural Cambodia . At the 'station', a driver settled my friend and me onto a nori right away, and started up the 6hp motor. The single line has 3ft-wide tracks that are warped and misaligned in places, so the nori's small handrail was reassuring. Clattering along at about 25mph, through miles of lush, remote scenery felt peaceful, despite the engine noise. The meditative rhythm of the journey was interrupted by a nori with four passengers heading right for us. I wondered about brakes, but there weren't any. Each driver stopped his engine and drifted until the trains were almost bumper to bumper. On the rails: The 'nori' trains have become a major attraction for tourists seeking to try an unusual sort of travel . Our driver asked us to get off; we had to give way. The other driver helped us pick up the bamboo nori, the engine and wheels, and take them to the side of the track. He helped us reassemble our small train, and we were back on our way. Not for long. Two more nori came towards us. Again, our train had to be dismantled - the number of nori, the number of passengers or size of cargo dictates who has to vacate the track. Faster than you expect: The trains, powered by rudimentary engines, hit speeds of up to 25 miles per hour . We did seem to be coming up against an unjust number of crowded nori. We were growing anxious to make it in time to visit the reputedly charming cafes in the village at the end of the line, and for our driver, who surely couldn't spend all day with one set of passengers and make a living. Then we met one nori, with two tourist passengers - the same as us. Who had the right of way now? Our driver started shouting. The other, younger one got down and asked his passengers to dismantle their train. Our driver grinned. 'Sometimes no rules, only which driver shouting most,' he said. Helping hand: Riders may have to move their train if they meet another carriage coming in the other direction . We had a clear run then to the pretty village. The train back would be at our convenience. This is definitely one of the world's more interesting train journeys. And perhaps an inspiration to frustrated commuters everywhere.

"They were the terrifying rockets that weren't unveiled until the final months of the Second World War, yet still killed thousands. Around 1,500 V2 rockets - the V stood for Vergeltungswaffe, or Vengeance Weapon - were fired at London and the south east of England, in what was seen as Hitler's last throw of the dice. As this interactive map shows, London bore the brunt of the V2 strikes, which began 70 years ago this week with an attack on Chiswick, in the west of the capital, and ended a year later, leaving more than 7,000 Britons dead. Scroll down for video . Precursor of the space race: The V2 rocket, or Vengeance weapon, was designed by the Germans to retaliate for devastating Allied bombing strikes on German cities . The rocket you couldn't see coming: Faster than the speed of sound, the V2 appeared to come out of nowhere,and you only heard the noise after it landed . Deadly missile: The first V2 strike on Britain came on 8 September 1944 and hit Chiswick, west London, killing three people and injuring 17 . Begun five years ago, the map is crowd-sourced, and includes photographs, eye-witness accounts and details about individual V2 rocket attacks on London and its surrounds supplied by individuals. Each strike site can be seen in more detail by zooming in and clicking on the yellow site markers.  A work in progress, the map is still believed to be short of many strike sites, some of which can still be seen using the Sat[ellite] tab in the top right hand corner. Unlike its predecessor the V1, this was a rocket you couldn't see coming; a space age piece of technology that laid the path for the post-war space programmes of the United States and the Soviet Union. Designed in Germany to attack Allied cities in retaliation for increased Allied bombing strikes against German cities, the V2s were also Hitler's answer to his country's disappointment that the V1s (or doodlebugs) didn't, as billed, knock Britain out of the war. Launched from mobile units, the 46ft (14m) tall rockets were fuelled by liquid ethanol and oxygen and weighed almost 14 tons, and were the most advanced weapon used in the war until the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The missile was launched vertically and could travel at more than 3,500mph to hit targets more than 200 miles away, making it the world's first long-range combat-ballistic missile. A V2 rocket launch site in Germany - the V2s were launched vertically, going straight up 50 miles into the air, before flying in a trajectory of 120 miles . Desperate: The launch of the V2s against Allied targets was seen as Hitler's last throw of the dice . When it landed, it left a crater 60ft wide and 16ft deep, and threw up around 3,000 tonnes of rubble into the air. Such was its speed, the noise of the rocket rushing through the air came after it landed. Notable V2 strikes on British soil included the first one, which hit Chiswick, west London, on 8 September 1944, killing three and injuring 17, and an attack on a Woolworths store in New Cross, south east London, in November that year which left 168 dead - England's worst death toll. In total, the V2 attacks resulted in the deaths of around 7,250 British military personnel and civilians. Meanwhile more than 9,000 civilians and soldiers were killed in total in V2 attacks on the Allies. That excludes the estimated 12,000 labourers and concentration camp prisoners killed while making the missiles. But despite the hype, and just like the V1, the V2 did not quite live up to its propaganda. Despite its sophisticated and pioneering guidance system, the V2 often missed its target. This situation was made worse when Britain leaked the misinformation that most V2s aimed at London were overshooting the capital by between ten and 20 miles. As a result, Germany modified the rockets' guidance, and most subsequent rockets landed short of the city, often in underpopulated areas of Kent. And the rocket was extraordinarily expensive to produce, using vast amounts of fuel alcohol when Germany was desperately short of it. At a point when the German army desperately needed cheap and effective weapons that could be manufactured en masse, production of the V2s required huge investment for relatively little return. One statistic shows that the average death toll per V2 dropped on Britain was just two people.  Compared to the hundreds of Allied bombers deployed in one air raid, which could leave thousands or tens of thousands dead, the V2 did not come up trumps. Devastation: The worst V2 attack on Britain struck a Woolworths store in New Cross, south east London, one afternoon in November 1944, leaving 168 people dead . Designed by German engineer Werner Von Braun, the V2 had four key points that marked the V2 out: large liquid fuel rocket engines, supersonic aerodynamics, gyroscopic guidance, and rudders in jet control. The automatic guidance system was perhaps the most important: this meant that once the rocket was in the air, with its destination programmed into the analogue computer, its gyroscopes could track its positioning, using the rudders to shift its course if needed. Even today, rocket launchers still have similar engines and use gyroscopic guidance, and most are still rocket-fuelled. The technology that went into the V2 was so sophisticated, that once the war was over, American and Soviet engineers picked the left over rockets to bits to understand how they worked. With the help of Von Braun, who surrendered to the Allies and later became a hero of the space age, the technology was harnessed to develop rockets that would go into space. Germany's solution to the expense was to get concentration camp prisoners to manufacture them. Buried deep underground in a factory near the Buchenwald concentration camp, the prisoners lived in filthy conditions. Those who weren't executed for attempted sabotage - there were reports of prisoners hanged from cranes above the workers - died from lack of food, sleep and daylight. There was one positive legacy of the V2 rockets, though, and that was their contribution to the space race. Given the V2's ability to power 50 miles up into the air before arcing in a trajectory of 120 miles, it was effectively the world's first space rocket. Thus as soon as the war ended, the US and the Soviet Union began a race to capture as many V2s as they could. America shipped 300 railcar-loads of V2s and their parts across the Atlantic, in what was known as Operation Papercclip, and used the skill of Germany rocket engineers - many of whom had surrendered to the Allies in a bid to avoid being shot dead by the Nazis to avoid their capture - to develop further rockets. They fired them in tests and studied their range and how to better it. Meanwhile, the Soviets used engineers to completely recreate a V2 rocket, called the R-1, before moving on to develop more powerful versions, the R-2 and the R-5. In October 1946, the first photograph was taken from space using a US-fired V2 rocket. It was the first outward sign that the Allies had moved on from the war and were harnessing the technology of massacre to create more sophisticated rockets which would, ultimately, reach the moon. The first V2 strike ever came on the morning of 8 September 1944, landing in Charentonneau à Maison-Alfort on the edge of a newly-liberated Paris, and killing six people. A few hours later that same day, a V2 struck Chiswick, in west London, killing three and injuring 17. A third strike just a few seconds later hit a field outside Epping, Essex, leaving no-one hurt or injured. Initially British politicians tried to cover up the new threat to their people, blaming gas explosions, but this ruse was quickly seen through, and people began to refer to V2s sardonically as 'flying gas pipes'. Another V2 attack on the capital: People gather round to help those trapped in the splintered wreckage of Smithfield market in London in March 1945 . On 8 March 1945, a V2 hit Smithfield Market in London.  Many of the victims fell through the ruined building onto the railway below, and many women and children who had gone to the meat market to buy rabbits were killed, putting the final death toll for the bomb at 110. The worst attack on Britain came on 25 November 1944, when a V2 hit a Woolworths department store in New Cross, south east London, mid-afternoon, killing 168. The final two V2 attacks on Britain came on 27 March 1945, and one of these attacks killed the last British civilian to be felled by a V2 - Mrs Ivy Millichamp, 34, who was at home in Orpington, Kent.","First striking Britain in September 1944, V2 - V for 'vengeance weapon - was Hitler's last throw of the dice .
Around 1,500 'vengeance weapons'  were fired at London and the south east, ultimately leaving around 7,250dead .
The rockets used astonishingly advanced technology to shoot 50 miles into air, before arcing in a 120-mile trajectory .
Unlike the predecessor the V1, you could not see - or hear - a V2 coming as it travelled faster than the speed of sound .
The sophisticated technology from the V2s was later harnessed by the US and Soviet Union to pioneer space travel ."

"Neil Warnock says Crystal Palace loanee Wilfried Zaha only struggled at Manchester United because the club don't give enough time to youngsters. Zaha made just two Premier League appearances for United following a £15m move from Palace, but has now returned to South London. And Warnock has criticised United's mishandling of their young players, despite Louis van Gaal's insistence that he will give them a chance. You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here . VIDEOS Scroll down to watch... Neil Warnock says Wilfried Zaha was mishandled by Manchester United and is happy to have him back . Zaha has returned to Crystal Palace after making just two Premier League outings with United last season . 'Wilfried has something to prove,' he told the Evening Standard. 'It will make such a difference that the fans are behind him. At Man United they don't seem to have time for the youngsters but he won't find that a problem here. The comments from the new Eagles boss contradict those of Van Gaal, who was speaking at a press conference on Thursday addressing the sale of Mancunian Danny Welbeck to Arsenal. He said: 'I am always willing to give players chances but they have to take them. I can't do that for them. The possibility is there and all the youngsters have to know that. Manchester United have come to me because of that. 'When you don't let go of players to other clubs then you never allow to give youth players a chance. Because of this policy, we will give youth players a chance. Louis van Gaal has insisted that Manchester United will give young players a chance despite big signings . Crystal Palace were busy in the last few days of the transfer window, securing the sevices of James McArthur, Zeki Fryers, as well as Zaha and Andy Johnson. Johnson is another player set to make an emotional comeback, having impressed in red and blue 10 years ago. But despite the relationship between the fans and the players, Warnock insists he brought the duo back for purely professional reasons. Andy Johnson has also returned to Crystal Palace on a free transfer from QPR . Wilfried Zaha scored a late equaliser as Palace snatched a 3-3 draw against Newcastle at St James' Park . 'They (Zaha and Johnson) have Palace in their hearts and the fans will relate to them. It wasn't a case of panicking. 'It is one of the reasons why I brought Andy back to the club, not just for playing but pushing people to get into the first team. I asked him if he would do a bit of coaching with the strikers and he's enjoying it. 'We have Fraizer Campbell, Dwight Gayle and Zaha and they're all young lads with a lot to learn. He is the ideal person to teach them a few things.' Zaha netted on his second debut for Palace, a late equaliser against Newcastle at St James' Park.

"Adam Johnson was thrilled to hand Sunderland supporters the perfect Christmas gift after firing the club to a fourth successive derby victory at Newcastle. The 27-year-old winger struck with seconds of normal time remaining at St James' Park to silence the home crowd and condemn the Magpies to a third consecutive home defeat by their arch-rivals. Johnson and his team-mates celebrated on the pitch in front of the travelling fans high in the stand at the Leazes End long after the final whistle as the bragging rights remained on Wearside. Adam Johnson proved Sunderland's matchwinner in Sunday's 1-0 Premier League win at Newcastle . Johnson (left) scored the only goal of the game in the final few minutes with a sweet left-footed strike . He said: 'We've given them something to make their Christmas even more special now. It's great to win four-in-a-row. Whatever happens now, we're in the history books as the team who did it. 'I'm not sure how many more times that will happen.' If Sunderland had to wait to prolong Newcastle's agony, it was no less deserved as they created a series of chances to win the game long before they did. Indeed, Johnson himself was guilty of a bad 77th-minute miss, although head coach Gus Poyet revealed after the game that he was about to substitute the England international until he saw him get in behind the home defence to create that opportunity. Poyet's change of mind was richly rewarded when the midfielder started and finished the game's decisive move and fired past keeper Jak Alnwick from substitute Will Buckley's lay-off, his third goal in as many visit to St James'. Johnson's (left) goal means Sunderland have won the last three Tyne-Wear derbies at St James' Park . Johnson said: 'I've done well there in recent years and it was a great highlight. To be honest, the chance I missed, I should have scored. 'We had so many opportunities to kill the game, but we stuck with it and luckily I got another chance and put it away. 'It was a little bit end-to-end in the second half and they pushed their attacking players on, but I thought we always looked a threat on the counter-attack.' Newcastle were intent on restoring local pride and started at break-neck speed, buoyed by the visitors' misfortune in losing specialist full-back Anthony Reveillere to a calf injury during the warm up. With skipper John O'Shea asked to line up at left-back it meant that Gus Poyet's rearguard comprised of four central defenders and the Black Cats found themselves defending deep and in numbers and under extreme pressure. But they survived and eventually eased themselves into the game, and with Sebastian Larsson and Jordi Gomez orchestrating and Steven Fletcher and Connor Wickham menacing, they forced their way into the ascendancy. Johnson praised Sunderland captain and John O'Shea who performed diligently at left back on Sunday . Fletcher was denied by the crossbar and Wickham by young keeper Alnwick before the break, while both Gomez and Johnson might have scored. Costel Pantilimon had to pull off stunning saves to keep out goal-bound shots from Ayoze Perez and Moussa Sissoko, and his heroics were ultimately embellished by Johnson's last-gasp intervention. The win was just Sunderland's third in the Barclays Premier League so far this season and ended a frustrating run of draws, and they will hope to build upon it on Boxing Day when struggling Hull head for the Stadium of Light. Johnson said: 'It's been coming, I think. We have played quite well in games, but just don't seem to have won them or struggled to score goals. But you only need one and we did that. 'Newcastle had had a tough week with a young keeper in goal. We tried to put him under pressure and I think we were quietly confident going into the game thinking we could win again. 'It made it difficult with Anthony pulling out - I don't think Sheasy has played there for 10 years - but they didn't cut us open as much as they'd have liked and we looked solid.'","Sunderland won 1-0 away at bitter rivals Newcastle on Sunday .

"Around three to seven per cent of children, or 400,000, are believed to have ADHD in the UK (picture posed by model) More children - and adults - than ever are being diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Yet many of those may not have the behavioural disorder but could instead be suffering from sleep deprivation, says a leading U.S. doctor. He estimates more than a third of children and a quarter of adults diagnosed with ADHD actually have sleep problems. Sleep deprivation, especially in children, does not - as might be expected - cause lethargy, but very similar problems to ADHD, including hyperactivity, an inability to focus, aggression and forgetfulness. The similarity between the symptoms, coupled with many doctors' poor understanding of sleep disorders, is what is causing the confusion in some patients, says Vatsal Thakkar, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine. 'While there is no doubt that many people have ADHD, a substantial proportion of cases are really sleep disorders in disguise,' he says. ADHD is characterised by problems with attention, concentration and impulsiveness. Around 5 per cent of British children are thought to be affected, with prescriptions for drugs to treat them rising by 70  per cent between 2005 and 2011. Prescriptions for Ritalin, the most popular drug for ADHD, have quadrupled in the past decade, with children as young as three taking the powerful medication. ADHD is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of three and seven and is four times more common in boys than girls. In around half of cases, the disorder continues into adult life. But now some experts are questioning whether the real problem is poor quality sleep. Numerous studies have shown that many children with ADHD also have breathing problems during sleep such as snoring and apnoea - where breathing becomes slow or interrupted by the muscles and soft tissue in the throat collapsing, causing a blockage - and are more likely to have disrupted delta sleep. This is the deep, rejuvenating kind which starts about 30 to 50 minutes after we fall asleep. Children need delta sleep for proper growth and development. One study, published in 2004 in the journal Sleep, looked at 34 children with ADHD. Every one showed a deficit of delta sleep, compared with only a handful of the 32 children in the study who didn't have the disorder. Meanwhile, a study of more than 11,000 British children published last year found those who suffered breathing problems during sleep in infancy were more likely to have behavioural difficulties later in life. No 'off' button: The distraction of 24-hour TV, computer games and mobile phones is a major factor in child sleep deprivation . These children were 20 to 60 per cent more likely to have behavioural problems at the age of four, and 40 to 100 per cent more likely to have such problems at seven. Tellingly, when sleep problems are resolved, the behavioural problems attributed to ADHD can disappear. A study published in the journal Paediatrics in 2006 found that removing tonsils to improve sleep seems to banish ADHD symptoms. A year after the surgery, half of the children who had previously been diagnosed with ADHD no longer had it. Professor Thakkar's theory is supported by British sleep experts, who say it is no coincidence that the rise in ADHD diagnoses in the Nineties came at a time when people were getting less sleep. The latest figures suggest that the number of adults who sleep fewer than seven hours each night has risen from 2 per cent in 1960 to more than 35 per cent in 2011. According to Dr Neil Stanley, a British sleep expert, children today get at least an hour less sleep than they did 100 years ago. Many ten-year-olds do not get the recommended ten hours a night. The distraction of 24-hour TV, computer games and mobile phones is a major factor because they not only stimulate the mind but suppress levels of melatonin, a hormone that helps to regulate sleeping and waking cycles. The light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye are more sensitive to the light emitted by screens - which tricks the body into thinking that it's still daytime, so it disrupts the production of melatonin. 'Ask any parent to describe a sleep-deprived child and the characteristics are not dissimilar to ADHD,' he says. 'Some children do have ADHD, but others are sleep-deprived and we are calling it ADHD. 'Some perfectly normal children who, for whatever reason, are chronically sleep-deprived, are being diagnosed with ADHD by their GPs. Many doctors also  have very little knowledge of  sleep disorders.' Slee-pea children: 'Some perfectly normal children who, for whatever reason, are chronically sleep-deprived, are being diagnosed with ADHD' More controversial is his belief that it may also be easier for doctors to tell parents their child has a medical condition rather than that he or she needs more sleep, with the parenting implications that involves. 'For some children it may be a diagnosis of convenience. Yet by misdiagnosing sleep-deprived patients as having ADHD, we are not only doing a disservice to those who really have ADHD but may be treating thousands of patients with poor sleep with medications designed to control or modify daytime behaviour.' Furthermore, drugs for treating ADHD can have side-effects, including poor appetite, stomach pain and, in rare cases, heart problems, chest pain, liver problems and suicidal thoughts. Professor Thakkar's interest in the link between ADHD and sleep disorders was prompted by his own experience after being diagnosed with ADHD as an adult. For nearly a decade he suffered from profound cognitive lethargy and difficulty focusing - he needed a daily nap and spent much of the weekend sleeping. Initially he was told that the problems were the result of psychological issues. Then, in 2005, he was diagnosed with ADHD. Not convinced, he underwent a sleep study which showed, at the age of 33, that he had an unusual form of narcolepsy, a neurological disorder which usually causes intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep. 'I'd never fallen asleep while eating or talking, but it turned out that just 5 per cent of my sleep was delta sleep. With the proper treatment my cognitive problems came to an end. My daytime focus is remarkably improved.' Professor Thakkar says there is more going on in our nocturnal lives than we realised. 'However, it is impossible to know how well you sleep unless you undergo tests - that's because sleep is partly biological and partly behavioural,' he says. 'Even if parents and children do all the right things to make sure they get enough sleep, they may be getting too little quality sleep. 'Limiting time on devices, especially in the evenings, is a good first step for children with these types of symptoms.' If that doesn't work, parents should ensure that their child gets enough sleep for their age (ten to 11 hours for school-age children, seven to eight for adults). If that does not help, seek medical help and consider undergoing a sleep study.","Sleep deprivation in children causes similar effects as ADHD .

"A pair of pranksters dressed up as a pantomime horse were thrown out of a Tesco supermarket after trotting around the frozen beef burger aisle shouting 'murderers'. A video of the incident, believed to have taken place in a Welsh store, has already racked up nearly 50,000 hits on YouTube. The mobile phone footage shows the pantomime horse rolling on the floor near the frozen food aisle shouting 'where's my mum?' before a security guard asks them to leave. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Earlier this week Tesco was one of several UK supermarkets revealed to have quantities of horse meat in its frozen burgers. The alert was first raised by Irish food watchdogs after horse DNA was found in burgers sold through Tesco, Iceland, Aldi, Lidl and Dunnes in Ireland. It subsequently emerged that burgers from the same batches were sold in the British outlets of both Tesco and Iceland. Incredibly, the beef content in one Everyday Value burger sold by Tesco was actually 29 per cent horse meat. Supermarket giant Tesco was one of several UK chains revealed to be selling frozen beef burgers which contain quantities of horse meat . More than ten million burgers have now been removed from sale, including more than 100,000 made at the Yorkshire factory of Dalepak. Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and the Co-op immediately decided to remove thousands of packs of frozen burgers as a precautionary measure. David Cameron reacted angrily, condemning Tesco yesterday, saying: 'People in our country will have been very concerned to read this morning that when they thought they were buying beef burgers they were buying something that had horse meat in it.' 'This is a completely unacceptable state of affairs,' he added, calling for an urgent investigation by Britain's Food Standards Agency. Scandal: How the Daily Mail covered the story on Wednesday . Labour says comprehensive food tests are needed to let families know how far horse meat contamination has spread into the food supply.

"James Ford, 26, was high on drink and drugs when he swerved into the path of the car driven by John Miller, 81, fatally injuring him . A motorist who swerved into the path of a Vauxhall Corsa driven by an 81-year-old had drunk alcohol and taken cocaine and cannabis before he got behind the wheel, a court heard. James Ford, 26, has been jailed for just four years and nine months after admitting causing retired policeman John Miller's death after he smashed into him in Newcastle-under-Lyme in Staffordshire. The court heard how Ford, from Silverdale, seemed worried about getting points on his driving licence in the immediate aftermath of the smash which left fitness fanatic Mr Miller, 81, of Knutton, fatally injured. Mr Miller, who played football for his local team until he was 70, died five days after the crash, which happened shortly after 11pm on 1 December 2012. Ford left the Great National Hotel in Clayton, where he had been drinking with friends, and was driving round a bend in Milehouse Lane, Newcastle-under-Lyume when he lost control as he drove between 30-40mph and ploughed into Mr Miller. Prosecutor David Bennett said: 'A . taxi driver saw the Fiat travelling at some speed. It swerved and went . on the wrong side of the road. 'There was a significant collision with the Corsa. 'The . defendant got out and screamed in pain as he tried to walk. He seemed . to show concern that he was going to lose his licence. 'Paramedics arrived and the defendant was given morphine.  Mr Miller was trapped and unconscious. The roof had to be cut away and he was taken to hospital.' Ford, who spent six weeks in hospital recovering from his injuries, pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving when unfit through drink or drugs and possession of cocaine. The court heard Ford was just below the legal blood alcohol limit, and that his sample contained cocaine, cannabis, and morphine.  Ford was also found to have 0.21g of cocaine on him. Simon Warlock, defending, said: 'This is a terrible example of what happens when drink and drugs are mixed together. 'The defendant lost control at just the wrong moment.' Killed: John Miller, 81, pictured as a young man, died five days after the smash in Newcastle-under-Lyme . Jailed: Ford, pictured outside court, had been drinking with friends before he swerved into Mr Miller's path . The . court heard Ford had previous convictions for driving without due care . and attention and failing to stop after an accident in 2006, as well as . drink-driving in 2010. Yesterday, Ford was jailed for four years and nine months and given a six-year driving ban at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court. Judge . Paul Glenn told him: 'John Miller’s life came to an untimely end because . you chose to drive when you must have known you were in no proper fit . state to do so. 'You drove . too quickly, having consumed drugs as well as alcohol. In the immediate . aftermath your concerns were totally selfish. 'You were unfit through a cocktail of two different types of controlled drugs which the law makes it illegal to possess.' Today Mr Miller’s nephew, Kevan Miller, 54, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, said: 'This has had a devastating effect on the family. 'We have to suffer a life sentence and live with losing John in such a horrible way.  He was 81 but was fighting fit and had a lot of years left in him. He will be missed by a lot of people.'","James Ford, 26, lost control of his car after drinking in a hotel with friends .

"The wealthy scion who allegedly gave John Edwards over $700,000 which was used to hide a love-child from his dying wife has spoken for the first time. In the first interview for a quarter century, 100-year-old Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon said her sympathies lay with Edwards, and not his dead wife Elizabeth. Speaking to Newsweek, the blind and reclusive Mrs Mellon - who has an estimated $400 million fortune - said the former North Carolina senator, 'would have been a great president'. Outspoken: Bunny Mellon (left) is seen here with her stepdaughter Eliza Lloyd in 1964. In her first interview for a quarter century, the 100-year-old said her sympathies lay with Edwards and not his dead wife Elizabeth . Reclusive heiress: Rachel Bunny Mellon, centre, . pumped $4million into Edwards' presidential campaign but says it was a . gift to him . Money from Mellon - who will turn 101 in . August - is at the centre of Edwards' criminal charges as it is alleged . that he used the finances she gave him as hush money. Bunny Mellon is the eldest child of Gerard Barnes Lambert who rose to fame and wealth after marketing his father's invention Listerene. Her second marriage to banking heir Paul Mellon in 1948 cemented her status as a member of American high society. In fact so gilded was Mrs Mellon, that The Washington Post once pronounced her the 'Most Envied Hostess in the Country Today'. Her marriage to Paul Mellon was an odd one however, with 'Bunny' sleeping in a separate bed to her husband, who was notorious for his dalliances with other women. Living a life that revolved around art, horses and the social scene, the couple were well known for entertaining British royalty at their farm in Virginia as well as their close friendship with John and Jacqueline Kennedy. Mrs Mellon was so close to the First Lady that she was invited to redesign the White House Rose Garden and also began work on the White House’s East Garden. A keen gardener, she was brought in to make floral arrangements for JFK’s funeral, and remained a close confidant of Jackie’s until her death. Tragedy struck in May 2000 when her daughter Eliza Lloyd, was struck by a truck as she crossed a Manhattan street. Left with severe brain damage and rendered a paraplegic, Eliza was cared for at her mother’s farm until she died eight years later. The disgraced politician is said to . have turned to Mrs Mellon to request financial support after he . allegedly visited her sprawling Virginia estate for lunch - just as his . attorneys were in last-minute talks with the Justice Department. Talking up their relationship to Newsweek, Mrs Mellon said of her friendship with Edwards: 'He and I were great friends. 'Every time he’d go on a debate against Hillary (Clinton), he’d call and we’d talk.' Mrs Mellon, lives on her sprawling 2,000 acre Virginia farm with 120 servants and retainers, added she was: 'So surprised when this thing came up.' Her lawyer Alex Forger added his client: 'Was not enamoured of his wife and didn’t want his wife to know that he was getting money.' Mrs Mellon first came into contact with Edwards when ran for vice president in 2004. Impressed with the handsome senator, she began sending campaign contributions during his subsequent run for president in 2005 and . 2006. Also speaking to Newsweek, other members of the Mellon family were less kind to Edwards, with Mrs Mellon's grandson Thomas Lloyd, 35, saying: 'I . wish I could have 10 minutes in a room with John Edwards to explain . that he’s doing nothing but tarnish her legacy and really taking . advantage of her. 'As I . explained to the jury, imagine a very handsome man who is well liked and . respected, and there are two women vying for his affections. 'He’s done a very good job of . maintaining the sense that ‘Bunny, I want to be your friend; Bunny, feel . sorry for me in this predicament, we’ll get through this together.'' 'I think it’s awful.' Landed: This is the 2,000 acre Virginia estate where Mrs Mellon lives in isolation with 120 servants and retainers . In teh Newsweek article, 'Bunny' added she was drawn to Edwards': 'Very deep intelligence. 'He was wise, he was clear, he was a very good person. I don’t like complicated people.' Acting on her belief in Edwards, Mrs Mellon began financially bankrolling the former senator after he was famously attacked for having a $400 hair cut. The subsequent indictment noted Mrs Mellon as: 'I was sitting alone in a grim mood, furious that the press attacked Senator Edwards on the price of a haircut. 'But it inspired me. ‘From now on, all haircuts, etc., that are important for his campaign, please send the bills to me. 'It is a way to help our friend without government restrictions.''

Tender: John Edwards kisses his daughter Emma Claire, left, while daughter Cate looks on at right as they leave the funeral service for their mother Elizabeth . Earlier this year, a source who spoke to ABC news . claimed that the amount given by Mrs Mellon was definitely in the millions of dollars. According to the indictment, Edwards' former campaign finance chairman Fred Baron donated  $200,000 while Mrs Mellon gave $725,000. That money was used to pay for Edwards's mistress Reille Hunter's living and medical expenses and for chartered airfare, luxury hotels, furniture and rental for a house in Santa Barbara, California, to keep her and the couple's love child Quinn, now three, hidden from the public, it added. It was Edwards' former aide Andrew . Young who came out and claimed that the money was being used as hush . money - after originally covering for the disgraced politician. He has said that Edwards agreed in 2007 to solicit money directly from Mrs Mellon and claimed he received hundreds of thousands of dollars in cheques from the heiress - some even hidden in boxes of chocolates.

"Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann has been under the protection of federal law enforcement officials since last week, a news report revealed today, in response to a death threat she received from ISIS. Law enforcement officials would not give out details on the threat Bachmann received other than to say that it occurred online and the congresswoman's office declined to discuss the incident, according to Politico, the news publication that broke the story. However, police indicated to Politico that the Minnesota lawmaker will be under watch until her final term in Congress ends early next year. Bachmann opted not to run for reelection this fall and is set to return to public life in January. Scroll down for video . Rep. Michele Bachmann speaks at the annual Faith & Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference in Washington in D.C. in June. Bachmann has been under the protection of federal law enforcement officials since last week after receiving an online threat from ISIS . Throughout her congressional career Bachmann has been one of the most vocal opponents on Capitol Hill of radical Islam. At times she has come under fire from her colleagues - Republican and Democrat alike - for being overzealous in her quest to find and expose terrorists. In a Washington, D.C. speech before a conservative audience last month, Bachmann went after ISIS directly and said in no uncertain terms that the group should be decimated. While criticizing President Barack Obama's approach to crippling the extremist group, the Republican firebrand said the correct response to their killing spree in Iraq and Syria is to 'kill their leader, you kill their counsel, kill their army until they wave the white flag of surrender!' 'I believe if you have an evil of an order of this magnitude, you take it seriously,' she said moments before. 'You declare war on it, you don’t dance around it. Just like the Islamic State has declared war on the United States of America.' Watch full speech here . Bachmann, right, is pictured here on Capitol Hill last year. Law enforcement officials told a news publication today that the four-term congresswoman will be under 24-hour police protection until she leaves office for good in January . Bachmann has used her little remaining time in the House to try to pass legislation torpedoing ISIS' ability to infiltrate the United States to commit acts of terror. The four-term Congresswoman said in September that the Federal Bureau of Investigation told her that American who go overseas to fight with ISIS will be allowed to come back to the U.S., where they will be simply be put on a watch list. 'We need to ‘get a brain in the United States and wake up,' Bachmann told Newsmax. 'Because the Islamic State has been very clear about their intention. 'That’s why they call themselves the Islamic State. They see that the global caliphate literally goes around the world, including the United States.' Before Congress left for a six-week recess last month Bachmann introduced legislation that would strip Americans who join the ranks of ISIS of their citizenship. Bachmann has not said what she plans to do when she leaves Washington, but she told Fox News last year that she plans to stay active in politics. 'I’m not retiring,' she said. 'I’m not going silent. I’m not the quitting my public involvement. In fact, I may run for another public office. 'But for right now I think I’m going to find a different perch in order to be able to weigh in on the matters. Sometimes you be more effective on the outside than on the inside.'

"David Cameron's 'nods and winks' that he might back Britain leaving the European Union is putting the nation's future prosperity in danger, Ed Miliband claims. The Labour leader will use a speech tomorrow to warn the UK is being left increasingly isolated and is now on a 'conveyor belt towards exit with no idea how to get off'. It comes as Home Secretary Theresa May warned that politicians who argue that the UK is better off in the EU 'whatever the terms, are wrong'. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured (left) at the Remembrance Sunday ceremony in Whitehall today, will accuse David Cameron (right) of 'giving succour' to the argument that the real answer to Britain's problems is leaving the EU . David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. But Labour has refused to match the promise of giving voters a say on leaving the EU. In a speech to the CBI tomorrow, Mr Miliband will accuse the Prime Minister of putting millions of jobs at risk. He will also pledge not to play 'political games' with Britain's EU membership and insist Labour has a credible and clear plan to secure reforms. He will say: 'There are some people in our country who advocate exit from the EU. There are others who flirt with it, thinking they can do so without consequence. Both are equally dangerous. 'Giving succour to the argument that the real answer is leaving the EU, or contemplating it, simply drags us closer to exit. 'And every nod and wink to those who want to leave sends a message to potential investors in our country that we are not open for business. 'It is a betrayal of our national interest. It is a clear and present danger to our future prosperity. 'The way to overcome these false solutions is not to pander to them. Not to posture about finding ways of accommodating them. Not to make promises everyone knows you cannot keep.' Efforts to secure concessions from Brussels were undermined by a shock demand for an extra £1.7billion from Britain last month. On Friday Chancellor George Osborne boasted that he had halved the bill to £850million. But critics accused him of 'smoke and mirrors', by bringing forward a rebate payment from 2015 which was always going to be paid. Home Secretary Theresa May has warned Britain cannot stay in the European Union at any cost . Critics have claimed the reduction in the £1.7 billion bill had been achieved by bringing forward a rebate to which the UK would have been entitled anyway. Mr Miliband will say Britain must build alliances rather than burn them to help change the EU so it works for Britain. 'Under a Labour government, there will be no further transfer of powers to the European Union without the explicit consent of the British people in an in/out referendum,' he will say. 'But we have seen over the last couple of years that trying to use exit as a threat has simply weakened our influence, not strengthened it. 'A country making ever-more incoherent demands, ever-more isolated from its partners, is one on the conveyor belt towards exit with no idea how to get off. 'We have seen it again with the controversy over the EU budget: banging the table one day, then paying up the next. 'Instead of posturing, Britain should be forging alliances now to make real reform happen and taking our rightful place in forging the future of Europe.' He will add: 'I make you this promise: if I am prime minister I will never risk your businesses, British jobs or British prosperity by playing political games with our membership of the European Union. 'We will reform the European Union, not threaten to leave, not pretend that is the answer, not playing fast and loose with Britain's future, Britain's prosperity and your businesses.' Mrs May, the Home Secretary, today suggested Britain should leave the EU unless it changes. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs May made a wider plea for major reforms to the way the EU operates to work in the UK's interests. She said: 'While access to the world's biggest single market is in our national interest, the EU's rules and regulations hold back not just our economy, but also the economies of every other member state. That is why we need to argue for changes that make the EU more competitive, more outward-looking and more open to global trade. 'These are the reasons I believe that the politicians who argue that we are better off in the EU, whatever the terms, are wrong. But I also believe that the politicians who argue that we are better off out, whatever the terms, are also wrong. 'Because if we can make Europe work differently - if we can work towards a more flexible union of sovereign member states who use treaties and institutions to trade freely and co-operate in the fight against crime and terrorism - it will surely be in our national interest to remain members of the European Union.'","Labour leader to use CBI speech to warn against hist of exit from EU .

"Roberto Mancini recorded his first league victory back in charge at Inter Milan with a 2-0 win at 10-man Chievo Verona on Monday. Mateo Kovacic and Andrea Ranocchia scored for Inter, which had goalkeeper Samir Handanovic to thank for several crucial saves. 'It's an important victory against a Chievo side which plays well,' Mancini said. 'We didn't concede, I'm satisfied. It went well. The lads are putting into practice in the match what we are working on in training, that's good.' VIDEO Scroll down to see Mancini speak about his second coming as Inter boss . Mateo Kovacic took advantage of poor defending by Alessandro Gamberini to score in the 19th minute . Ten minutes into the second half when Andrea Ranocchia volleyed home from 12 metres to settle the tie . Chievo midfielder Ruben Botta - who is on loan from Inter - was sent off for dissent 18 minutes from time. Inter moved into 11th spot with its first win in six matches, while Chievo, which was undefeated in five, slipped to 17th, a point off the relegation zone. Torino leapfrogged Chievo with a 0-0 draw at Empoli in a relegation battle which the home side dominated. Inter had lost twice and drawn once since Mancini replaced the sacked Walter Mazzarri last month. Chievo started brightly and almost took an early lead but Handanovic did well to stop Alberto Paloschi's header from point-blank range. Inter went ahead in the 19th minute when Mauro Icardi headed down Yuto Nagatomo's cross and the Chievo defense failed to clear, allowing Kovacic to fire home. The Inter players crowd in to congratulate Ranocchia after his brilliant effort in the second half . Roberto Mancini finally won a league game in his second spell with Inter Milan . Chievo almost leveled in spectacular fashion, but Handanovic was alert again, diving smartly to his left to keep out Riccardo Meggiorini's overhead kick. The Inter goalkeeper went close to gifting Chievo the equaliser, however, as he misjudged Gennaro Sardo's cross but it crashed off the woodwork and out to safety off Bostjan Cesar's face. Chievo again went close immediately after the interval when Paloschi's effort went inches wide of the right upright. Inter doubled its advantage in the 55th when Ranocchia slotted Danilo D'Ambrosio's cross into the bottom left corner.

Earlier, promoted side Empoli stretched its unbeaten run to five Serie A matches. Empoli, which was two points above Torino, almost took an early lead but Matias Vecino sent a 30-yard effort just wide of the top corner and Simone Verdi's free kick was palmed round the upright by Jean-Francois Gillet. Empoli had Torino pegged back in its own half for much of the second period but Gillet was in fine form.

"A coroner fired from his job after cops caught him joking as he swirled his finger around in a victim's gunshot head wound was previously charged with a car bomb attack on a woman that cost her both her feet, it has been revealed. Coroner Terry Jarnigan, of Cocke County, Tennessee, was barred earlier this month from disturbing or touching dead bodies and attending crime scenes after he stuck his finger in a victim's gunshot wound, pulled it out with brain matter and exclaimed 'oh brains'. It casts doubts on a countless number of cases which Mr Jarnigan worked on since being appointed to the position of coroner after having his citizenship rights restored in the late 1990s on serving time for 'wilful injury to another by explosives'. And now the family of at least one of the deceased that Coroner Jarnigan handled has called for their son's case to be reopened. Coroner Terry Jarnignan was barred from touching dead bodies or attending crime scenes  after he was caught sticking his fingers in a gunshot head wound of a victim. He resigned from his position . On November 2, Jarnigan attended an autopsy at Newport Medical Center  to determine whether the 39-year-old shooting victim committed suicide or had been murdered. The corner stuck two fingers into a bullet exit wound on the victim's head and on realizing he had brain matter on his fingers, put it back into the wound and made a remark 'Oh, brains', according to a police affidavit seen by News 10. A detective, Paula Wilson, who was taking forensic photos, said Jarnigan was 'twisting his finger around' in the head wound, according to documents. The District Attorney's office applied for an injunction against Jarnigan and said on November 2 that the coroner had 'inserted his finger into the wounds of a deceased victim thereby completely contaminating any investigation for crime-related DNA, not to mention the effect such activity has on the victim's family'. Jarnigan resigned this month from his appointed position. Repeated attempts to contact the former coroner for comment have been unsuccessful. Medical Examiner Dr David McConnell, declined to comment on Mr Jarnigan's resignation. Deputy District Attorney Brownlow Marsh told MailOnline on Wednesday that no criminal charges would be brought against Jarnigan. He added that he was not aware of any medical training that the coroner received, adding that the position did not require it. Deputy DA Mr Marsh told MailOnline today that Jarnigan's role as coroner was to order autopsies and that he was not cleared to sign on behalf of the medical examiner. Don and Annette Heitman (pictured with their son Alex) have called for the investigation into his death to be reopened after the coroner who oversaw the scene resigned for mishandling of bodies and investigations . Following the coroner's resignation, details of Jarnigan's violent criminal past have emerged. According to court documents seen by MailOnline, and reported by WBIR and WATE, Terry Lee Jarnigan, previously known as Terry Lee Lackey, was charged with 'willful injury to another by explosives' in 1977. Jarnigan was charged along with his wife Diane, according to court records, for planting explosives in the car of Edna Stamey. Mrs Stamey's husband, John Stamey, was also charged with the attempt on his wife's life and pleaded guilty. Jarnigan was sentenced to at least 15 years in prison and Diane Jarnigan received ten years. According to court records, Mrs Stamey's Chevrolet was blown up with dynamite in Newport, Tennessee on April 14, 1977. She lost both of her feet, broke her leg and right wrist, and had her hand mutilated in the attack. On the evening of April 14, John Stamey reportedly asked his wife to drive her car to a shopping center and park before going with him to a neighboring town. When they returned, he dropped her about 40 feet from her car 'and shot out of the parking lot like a bullet', she told prosecutors. While she was gone, 'someone had placed dynamite and a blasting cap in the car and had attached wire to the parking lights', records revealed, so that when the lights were turned on, the dynamite would explode. Mrs Stamey reportedly had several insurance policies of which her husband was beneficiary - although unknown to him, she had recently changed the beneficiary's name. The couple allegedly targeted Mrs Stamey because she was going to turn her husband John in to police for a bank robbery, according to court documents. John Stamey had used Terry Jarnigan's gun during the heist. In 1977, Jarnigan, then known as Terry Lackey, was convicted of felonies including 'willful injury by explosives' and arson and detonation of explosives with intent to harm a person. Cocke County attorney Carter Moore confirmed to MailOnline on Wednesday that Jarnigan had his citizenship rights restored in the late 1990s. A court decided that he had 'the character of a person of honesty, integrity, respectability and veracity'. He assumed the position of coroner a short time later and held that position up until this month, . In the years leading up to his resignation, a family whose son's death investigation involved Coroner Jarnigan have repeatedly called for Cocke County authorities to reopen the case. The Medical Examiner's report - signed by Terry Jarnigan - on which Alex Heitman's name is incorrectly written as John Heitman. The signatures of both the ME and the coroner appear to have been written in the same handwriting . Alex Heitman, 29, was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head in July 2011 in remote woodlands of Cocke County, 70 miles from his home in Knoxville. Mr Heitman, a business supervisor at Oak Ridge Schools, had moved to Tennessee in 2008 with his new wife Kristie. She was eight months' pregnant at the time of his death. His parents, Don and Annette Heitman, from Wisconsin, remain unconvinced of the official verdict of suicide. They have repeatedly asked that Alex's death be re-examined by authorities who have given the family little cooperation. The Heitman family provided an Order For Autopsy following their son’s 2011 death to MailOnline - one of the few pieces of official documentation they have been granted access to. The document was signed by Coroner Terry Jarnigan - and the Medical Examiner David McConnell’s signature appears to be written in the same hand. Their son’s name is incorrectly written as John Heitman. Deputy DA Mr Marsh told MailOnline today that Jarnigan's role as coroner was to order autopsies and that he was not cleared to sign on behalf of the medical examiner. He said that the DA's office was aware of no cases involving Mr Marsh which required further investigation. The Heitmans' Tennesee representative, Oak Ridge City Councilwoman Trina Baughn told MailOnline that according to 911 audio files and logs, Coroner Jarnigan supervised the scene of Alex Heitman's death for five hours. However, there exists no evidence that even a basic investigation took place - other than an order for autopsy. No fingerprints, ballistics, coroner’s report, police report or credible crime scene photos were ever discovered to have been taken, the family have claimed. People who lived near the scene found evidence that had been left behind the following day, Ms Baughn said. According the Heitman family, this included portions of Alex’s brain matter and a shotgun shell casing. In a statement to MailOnline this week, the Heitmans said: 'We are so sorry to learn of another family whose loved one was not treated with the proper respect they deserved. 'We do not know how Terry Jarnigan treated our son’s body, but it is inexcusable that he allowed partial remains to be left at the scene of his death. 'We would like to know how Mr Jarnigan obtained the authority to sign for the medical examiner without any proper training or appropriate credentials. We cannot say for certain that our son's case was compromised by the coroner's actions. 'But Cocke County authorities have failed us in every way possible, we deserve an investigation of the matter.' Their representative, Ms Baughn, added: It’s disturbing to know that someone like that [Jarnigan] was entrusted with such a sacred responsibility. 'In light of countless errors and omissions in this case, Mr Jarnigan’s recent behaviors and his history with the courts, I expect that local authorities in both Cocke County and Oak Ridge will be compelled to honor the family’s requests. It is the least they can do. It is the moral and compassionate thing to do.'","Coroner Terry Jarnigan, of Cocke County, Tennessee, was barred this month from touching dead bodies or attending crime scenes .

"FIFA say Barcelona will not get special permission to sign a defender after Thomas Vermaelen was sidelined by injury for several months. Barcelona sought an emergency signing under 'exceptional situations' in Spanish federation rules, despite facing a one-year FIFA transfer embargo.

Thomas Vermaelen underwent surgery on a hamstring injury that will keep him out for several more months . The defender (left) is yet to make a single appearance for Barcelona since his summer move . The Belgium international joined the Catalan club from Arsenal for £15million . FIFA's ban was imposed because Barcelona broke rules on international signings of young players.

"Alex Rodriguez faces a diminished role in his return to the New York Yankees, who have stripped him of his third-base job and plan to limit his role to full-time designated hitter, at most. A-Rod's days as an everyday fielder are over, general manager Brian Cashman said on Tuesday, and Chase Headley will start at third after agreeing this week to a $52 million (£32.24m), four-year contract. Coming off a season-long suspension for violations of Major League Baseball's drug agreement and labor contract, Rodriguez will have to compete with Martin Prado for time as Headley's backup at third. New York Yankees' Alex Rodriguez returns to baseball battling for a place as his team's third base back-up . 'I can't expect Alex to be anything,' Cashman said during a telephone interview with The Associated Press. 'I've got to think the worst and hope for the best. Even before the suspension, he wasn't the same player at third base on the defensive or offensive side. And that was before the suspension. 'And now he's been out of the game for a year. He's approaching 40 years of age. And just to automatically assume, given his circumstances, that he'll be able to plug right in, play third as an everyday guy and hold up and be productive, that would be dangerous thinking from my perspective.' Rodriguez turns 40 in July and has not played a full season since 2007 because of leg injuries, operations on both hips, and the suspension. Cashman said A-Rod will have to prove to manager Joe Girardi he can play the field. General manager Brian Cashman expects 'nothing' from A-Rod as he makes his comeback after a year  ban . Cashman said he has not spoken with Rodriguez about his new role. 'I don't need to. I've been very consistent with my conversations publicly from October on,' he said. 'I have not heard from Alex on any of that, and I know he reads all this stuff.' Rodriguez is owed $61mn (£39m) by the Yankees in the final three seasons of his contract, and New York could use improvement at DH - its players there combined to hit .230 this year (12th in the American League) with 18 homers (11th), 63 RBIs (13th), a .290 on-base percentage (14th) and a .372 slugging percentage (12th), according to STATS. New York anticipates Headley, a 2012 Gold Glove winner, will be joined in the infield most days by Didi Gregorius at shortstop, Prado at second, and Mark Teixeira at first. 'We believe we now have a very strong defensive infield,' Cashman said, 'that will serve our pitching staff and our run prevention well.'","Alex Rodriguez will be battling to be back-up for third base at the Yankees .

"Last year, 12-year-old Max LaDue missed over 100 days of school due to a painful gastrointestinal syndrome. While the seventh-grader's health issues are still not over, his life is beginning to return to normal thanks to a robot that allows him to attend classes and socialize with his peers all from the comfort of his home. This year, LaDue became the first student in North Carolina to use a VGO Telerobot, a robot which he can steer from class to class to watch lectures and even interact with his teachers and classmates via a webcam that transmits his image on the robot's screen. If LaDue wants to ask or answer a question, he simply pushes a button which flashes a light, alerting his teacher. Scroll down for video . State of the art: The Durham Public Schools became the first school district in North Carolina to invest in VGO Telerobots this year, which allow sick kids to attend school from home. The robots cost $12,000 each . 'Being there makes it much easier than not being there. I'm a very hands-on kind of person,' Max told WNCN. 'I feel like I'm very lucky to get such an experience, because otherwise I'd just be sitting here 12 hours a day doing absolutely nothing.' The Durham Public Schools was the first district in the state to invest in the cutting-edge technology, buying three of the $12,000 robots for sick students. One of the robots is being used by a little girl with a compromised immune system, who now gets to attend kindergarten and socialize with children her age for the first time. Chrissy Pearson, chief communications officer for the school district, told Fox News that they are proud to be the first to invest in the robots for their students. 'One of the things we started noticing was that there were kids who really wanted to be in school but couldn’t for medical reasons,' Pearson said. 'Max is the perfect candidate for this new technology. It’s just been really inspiring to watch him.' Back to school: 12-year-old Max LaDue is one of three students using a VGO  in Durham Public Schools. He steers his from home to attend two classes a day at the School of Creative Studies, a magnate school . Not missing out: Max is even able to ask his teachers a question by pressing a button which flashes a light to draw attention to his camera . Just like everyone else: Above, Max is seen sitting in on a class, listening to the teacher's lecture alongside another student . For Max, missing out on school was even more disappointing since he won a spot to the School of Creative Studies through a lottery. Now he's back at the magnate school to attend four different classes, two each day, which he supplements with an at-home math class and home-bound tutor provided to him through the  Durham Public Schools Hospital School. Max's mother Julie says the technology has made a world of difference in her son's life. 'It was almost like homework prison for him before, and now, he's doing projects with kids. He's collaborating on things with other kids at school,' Julie LaDue told ABC 11. 'I want my child to be a normal kid and the VGO lets him be a normal kid.'","Seventh-grader Max LaDue became the first student in North Carolina to use a VGO Telerobot this year to attend classes from home .

Udinese goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis could only get a hand to Angelo Palombo's cross and when the ball dropped to Pedro Obiang, he fired the ball into the net.

Chievo snatched victory in the other derby of the day but replays showed Alberto Paloschi was offside as he headed in Ervin Zukanovic's superb cross into the box with nine minutes remaining. Both sides also had penalty claims turned down. Nene had gone closest for Verona when he headed a corner just over the crossbar, while Chievo's Ivan Radovanovic almost scored a wonder goal but Verona goalkeeper Francesco Benussi was alert to turn the effort from near the halfway line over his bar.","Sampdoria were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Udinese .

"A man who suffered itching and skin sores on his return from a trip to Africa was found to have 20 maggots living under his skin. The man, known only as Ma, from Guangzhou in China, went to see his local doctor complaining of painful, blistering skin sores after working across the continent for six months. After two weeks, his condition failed to improve, so he visited a dermatologist at the Shenzhen Nanshan Hospital. Scroll down for video . Wriggling: The man, from China,  was discovered to have 20 live maggots nestled under his skin . The dermatologist examined him and determined that maggots were living beneath the skin of his abdomen and right thigh. A blood test showed high levels of eosinophils, white blood cells for combating parasites and infections, which confirmed the diagnosis. The man later underwent a minor surgical procedure to extract a total of 20 live maggots from his body. The maggots were identified as tumbu fly maggots, a type of blowfly whose larvae feeds on human tissue . The maggots were then identified as tumbu fly maggots, a type of blowfly whose larvae feeds on living human tissue. The  fly, also known as the skin maggot fly, is a species of blow-fly found in East and Central African countries. It is a parasite of large mammals, including humans, during its larval stage. First, the tumbu fly lays its eggs on the ground. Then the larvae, known as Cayor Worms, wriggle over the soil until they come in contact with man or a mammal, penetrate the skin and lie in the 'subcutaneous' tissue, causing the formation of tumours. The candiru - also known as the vampire catfish. This tiny urophilic life form is known to swim  stream of urine and can swim up into the urethra or anus. It has sharp spines that it digs into your flesh and can only be removed by  surgery. The ascari worm infects pigs and humans via contact with food or water that's been contaminated with fecal matter. Once in the gut, the worms 'migrate' by chewing their way from the intestines to the lungs. This causes ascaris pneumonia which can be fatal. It takes eight to 12 days developing through three larval stages before it reaches  full growth, when ot falls to the ground, bury themselves and pupate. Parasitic flies are prevalent in Africa, and travellers are advised to take precaution against insects.","Man, from Guangzhou, China, known only as Ma, complained of itchy skin .

"Serious: Ben Monksummers was alarmed when he saw his high-velocity rifles on the baggage carousel . A Team GB rifle shooter accused easyJet of committing a 'serious offence' after they put his £11,000 guns arsenal on a public airport baggage carousel. Ben Monksummers, 22, of Gillingham, Dorset, who has competed in international rifle contests for Team GB, booked a return flight back to the UK to see his family, with the no frills airline. But on his return trip to Holland, Mr Monksummers, was shocked to see his high-velocity rifles making their way around the public luggage collection carousel at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. 'Anyone could have walked out of that building with restricted firearms of a value of £11,000. This is a very serious offence' he said. And it wasn't the first event in which the budget carrier had left him reeling. Ben, a diabetic, had already been fined 55 euros (around £44) to take his medication on board the flight to the UK. The sportsman has since lodged a formal complaint with easyJet over the incidents, which occurred at the end of October. An easyJet spokesman said: 'We apologise for any inconvenience Mr Monksummers experienced. 'We have procedures in place to ensure that any firearms baggage goes through specific channels, therefore we are currently investigating why this didn't happen on this occasion. 'The safety and security of its passengers and crew is easyJet's highest priority. 'We always advise passengers to contact us in advance if they need to carry medication on board the aircraft.

'In these instances our customer service team advises passengers that it is only possible to carry medical equipment or medication in the cabin as additional in-cabin baggage upon presentation of a doctor's certificate stating the necessity of it.' Arms and explosives such as handguns, automatic weapons, munitions, fireworks, flares, smoke canisters and crackers, are strictly forbidden on easyJet aircrafts. But firearms and ammunition for hunting and sporting purposes may be accepted as checked Baggage. The airline's website says: 'The carriage of firearms is strictly limited. Passengers must produce the original of the valid documentation showing proof of ownership and legal authority for the possession of the firearm(s), photocopies of such documentation will not be accepted. Without such documentation, firearms WILL NOT be carried.'","Ben Monksummers, of Dorset, has competed in international rifle contests .

"The NYPD is on high alert for potential terrorist attacks as the trial of hate preacher Abu Hamza starts later this month. The first day of the terrorist’s trial coincides with the beginning of Jewish holiday Passover on April 14. Speaking to a conference of Jewish leaders in New York on Tuesday, NYPD officials said they are aware that the trial may ‘inspire’ terrorist acts. Trial fears: Radical Islamist cleric Abu Hamza, seen in a courtroom drawing with his defense attorney Joshua Dratel last month, is due to stand trial on April 14, something which has put the NYPD on high alert . A decade after Abu Hamza was first arrested in Britain on a US warrant for terrorism charges, he is finally due to go on trial in Manhattan. The hook-handed cleric is facing allegations that he controlled a global network of jihadists. This week, Hamza, who was extradited from Britain in 2012, was described as a ‘star’ among terrorists, by Rebecca Weiner, director of intelligence analysis for the NYPD. ‘We are attuned to the possibility that his upcoming trial may inspire more terror,' Ms Weiner told religious leaders during a pre-Passover conference, the NYDailyNews reports. 'It is a major priority for us in the next couple of weeks.' Hate preacher: Abu Hamza, pictured in London in 2004, was first arrested in Britain on a US warrant for terrorism charges ten years ago, but was not extradited until 2012 . Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence John Miller asserted that although the NYPD is on high alert during the trial, there is 'is no specific, credible threat' at this time. Last month, Hamza was dubbed a ‘terrorist leader of global reach’ by the US government who claims he sent ‘lieutenants’ to terror camps worldwide. Prosecutors have lodged legal papers ahead of his forthcoming trial alleging that: ‘The [American] government will show that the defendant was a terrorist leader of global reach who ... sent his young lieutenants around the world to engage in terror training.’ Risk: The NYPD fears that Hamza's trial, which coincides with the beginning of Jewish holiday Passover on April 14, may inspire terror acts . The prosecution will say the preacher used Finsbury Park mosque in north London as a recruiting base, not only inspiring jihadists with his hateful sermons, but also allegedly directly providing support to Al Qaeda from Britain. Court papers show prosecutors consider Hamza so dangerous that they have argued jurors should be given anonymity and an armed guard for their safety. He faces 11 terrorism charges spanning America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia which go back as far as 1998. If convicted, he faces spending the rest of his life in a maximum security US prison. The trial, scheduled to last six weeks, could prove embarrassing for the British security services and previous governments who allowed the preacher to operate freely for years after he arrived here from Egypt, despite openly giving sermons praising Osama bin Laden in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Court papers allege one of his ‘lieutenants’ from London was sent to Afghanistan for ‘violent jihad training’ and said he was prepared to take part in attacks against American and Jewish targets. Hamza is separately accused of trying to set up a ‘jihad training camp’ in Bly, Oregon where one of his followers is said to have penned a letter to Osama bin Laden saying: ‘We love you here.’ Hamza is also charged with involvement in a hostage-taking incident in Yemen in 1998 that led to the deaths of three Britons and an Australian. The preacher was first arrested in Britain in May 2004 on a US extradition warrant and charged with 15 terrorism offences. In 2006 he was jailed for soliciting murder and stirring up racial hatred. He was extradited to America in 2012 after a costly and protracted legal battle invoking human rights law. He denies all the charges.","Abu Hamza's trial for terrorism charges in New York starts this month .

"A Saudi cleric who once headed Mecca's religious police has received death threats after his wife appeared with him on TV  wearing make-up without a veil. Sheikh Ahmed al-Ghamdi and his wife told the audience of a  chat show that Islam does not require women to hide their faces behind a niqab in public. However his 'radical' views have created a storm of controversy after his smiling wife, Jawaher bint Al-Sheikh Ali, was seen uncovered, even wearing nail varnish. Scroll down for video . Controversial: Sheikh Ahmad al-Ghamdi, seen here, and his wife told the audience of national television show that Islam doesn't require women to hide their faces behind a niqab in public. 'Happy now? Every mobile phone now has a picture of your wife, you pimp,' one outraged post on Twitter read. On the show, Al-Ghamdi told viewers: 'The Prophet did not order women to cover their faces. Wearing make-up is allowed.' 'No one is saying that it is not allowed for a woman to cover her face, but I am saying that it is not obligatory and I have evidence in jurisprudence of this.' It's a shocking U-turn for the  former head of the religious police who was responsible for policing the dress code and behaviour of Saudi citizens to ensure that they met strict religious requirements. The 'police' work on behalf of King Abdullah and make sure that people do not go against strict Islamic rule. They patrol the streets checking dress code and strict separation of men and women. Confusion? Al-Ghamdi suggested that Muslims became confused about ancient texts that mentioned the head scarf and the robe that women were commanded to wear . King Abdullah: The King employs a religious police to enforce behaviour that goes against strict Islamic rule . The host of the TV show,  Badria al-Bishr, also appeared  with her face uncovered in a move praised by liberals. At the time of writing, the interview had racked up over a million views on YouTube since it aired over the weekend. But Al-Ghamdi told local paper, Al-Watan, that he had received several death threats with one radical cleric allegedly  calling for him to be 'tortured.' Saudi Arabia's most senior cleric, the Grand Mufti, Sheikh Abdulaziz al-Sheikh joined the chorus of condemnation against him and urged him to 'ask repentance from God, and back away from this mistake.' Al-Sheikh told news website Sabq: 'My message to Sheikh al-Ghamdi is to fear God.' Meanwhile, a group of Saudis from Jeddah said they will take legal action over the stunt. Yet, despite receiving widespread criticism, Al-Ghamdi believes that there has been confusion over  the veil. He suggested that Muslims became confused about ancient texts that mentioned the head scarf and the robe that women were commanded to wear. He said: 'Later, people confused the hijab, which was imposed only on the wives of the Prophet Mohammed, with what Allah imposed on Muslim women in general.' Saudi laws do not require women to wear the niqab, but women who appear in public with uncovered faces may face harassment from religious police. Al-Ghamdi previously faced a backlash for suggesting that women should be able to go out in public without a male guardian and mingle with the opposite sex in appropriate environments. These are all violations of customs in Saudi Arabia.","Sheikh Ahmad al-Ghamdi and his wife appeared on Saudi television .

No pain no gain: Spain's Rafael Nadal suffered a hand injury during his quarterfinal match against Grigor Dimitrov in Australian Open . Care: Rafael Nadal receives medical attention during the game in Melbourne after a blister appeared in the palm of his racquet hand . Nadal played with taped up fingers to . fend off blisters, but ended up with an open wound after a blister burst . in the palm of his hand during the game.

'I . was very lucky in the tiebreak, on one set point he missed an easy . forehand, I felt anything could happen.

"The number of NHS managers who were paid  more than £300,000 a year has doubled in just 12 months, according to a report. The highly-paid executives, who often worked on an interim basis, were hired by struggling health trusts which paid them hefty salaries worth more than the Prime Minister’s wage of £142,500. A report by The Telegraph found that during 2013-14, 44 temporary executives were paid a staggering £1,000 a day — the equivalent of £228,000 a year. Struggling: Earlier this month, officials said there have been more emergency admissions to hospitals than ever before . However, the large payouts have been widely criticized by patients groups, especially as junior staff have been unable to secure a one per cent pay rise. According to the report, in 2013/2014 a further 22 executives received salaries of at least £300,000 a year. This salary was usually paid through an agency  which allowed it a share of the money. Yet, NHS Trusts have suggested that it is vitally important to offer executives high salaries to attract the right kind of employee, particularly at short notice. The report also uncovered evidence that some managers stayed in their role for more than a year, taking home exorbitant salaries. The most highly paid NHS executives included -  Michael Morgan, chief executive of Rotherham Foundation Trust. He was paid the equivalent of £621,000 a year. But many of the NHS hospital trusts who shelled out large sums to executives are facing problems  with patient care. Last month, Colchester Hospitals foundation trust advised patients to keep away from A & E unless their condition was 'life-threatening.' Response time: There could be a move to  double the time ambulances can take to reach critically ill patients . But it took on two temporary executives, Kim Hodgson and Evelyn Barker, on rates of £387,000 a year. Earlier this month, The Mail on Sunday uncovered a secret plan to double the time ambulances can take to reach critically ill patients. The current target is for an emergency vehicle to reach those in life-threatening situations within eight minutes. But a document seen by the newspaper revealed that the target time to get to those suffering a range of serious problems including strokes and seizures is to be increased to 19 minutes. Hospitals in England are admitting a record number of patients and say the service is being permanently run at a crisis level because pressures on A&E services 'continue to increase.' Earlier this month, there were 111,062 emergency admissions - the highest figure in more than a decade since records for emergency admissions began.

"A British journalist who filmed a Greenpeace protest on a Russian oil platform could face up to 15 years in prison after being charged with piracy. Freelance video producer Kieron Bryan was arrested along with 28 activists and another journalist, including six Britons, following a protest last month against Russia’s oil drilling in the Arctic. Yesterday, his father said that he was ‘shocked’ by the actions of the Russians and ‘disappointed’ that the UK Government had not done more to help the Brits. Facing time: Freelance videographer Kieron Bryan, 29, from Devon, has been charged with piracy by Russian state prosecutors, a charge which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years . Seized: One of the activists on the ship managed to film the Russian coast guard entering the ship with drawn weapons on a mobile phone . The Russian Coast Guard seized the . Greenpeace ship and the 30 people on board after activists attempted to . scale an oil rig owned by Russian state-controlled energy giant Gazprom. But . Greenpeace condemned the charges as ‘extreme and disproportionate’ and . said the Russian actions were an ‘assault’ on the idea of a peaceful . protest. Mr Bryan, 29, is . one of three members of the crew with links to Devon currently being . held in Russia following the protest on September 18. Kieron's . father Andy Bryan, from Shebbear in Devon, said: ‘We are quite shocked . at the actions the Russians have taken against what is a peaceful . organisation. Under siege: Russian coast guards board the Greenpeace ship the Arctic Sunrise, following a protest by  activists at a Russian oil platform in the Pechora Sea, off the coast of Russia. ‘We were hoping the situation would be higher profile, given there are six Brits in the group.’ Mr . Bryan said he was not aware of any statement or information being . issued by the government, which he said he was ‘surprised and . disappointed’ about. The . Foreign Office said that they were providing consular assistance. Alex . Harris, 27, who was brought up in Devon, and engineer Iain Rogers, 37, . from Exeter, are also being held.

President Vladimir Putin said last week that the protesters were . clearly not pirates but that they had violated international law. The . investigators said the Greenpeace ship, the Arctic Sunrise, had . violated the 500-metre (550-yard) security zone around the platform and . that it was carrying equipment for an unknown purpose.

Jailed: Ten Greenpeace activists were remanded in custody by a Russian judge on Thursday, including Greenpeace spokesman Roman Dolgov (left) and protestor Dmitry Litvinov (right) Greenpeace . said that its ship stayed out of this zone but its inflatable boats . used by activists to reach the platform and then scale it posed no . danger. Fourteen Greenpeace activists, including at least four from the UK, have now been charged with piracy. The . Arctic rig is due to begin operation by the end of the year and will . likely produce six million tonnes of oil per year by 2019. But . Greenpeace says scientific evidence shows any oil spill from the rig . would affect more than 3,000 miles of Russia's northern coastline. Russian judge Dmitry Krivonosov handed 10 Greenpeace activists two month jail sentences for their protest in Russian waters last week. Last . night, Mr Bryan’s family told the Mail: ‘Kieron is a freelance . journalist who was employed by Greenpeace on a short term contract to . make films for both media and promotional distribution during the trip . to the Arctic. He is a journalist not an activist. ‘He is passionate about his work and is particularly interested in political and environmental issues. ‘We . are stunned and shocked at the charges the Russian authorities have . produced against him and urge the UK and Russian Governments to do . everything possible to secure his release as soon as possible. ‘Kieron . is a very kind and caring person. His family, in particular his . parents, are extremely worried about him and we just want him home.’ Greenpeace International executive director Kumi Naidoo said: ‘It is an extreme and disproportionate charge. These dramatic tweets from the Arctic Sunrise describe the moment armed Russian coastguard officials boarded the vessel . An armed coastguard points a gun at an activist aboard a Greenpeace boat as they attempted to disrupt the Russian oil drilling operation . The armed assault by the Russian coastguard on the Greenpeace vessel Arctic Sunrise came after activists attempted to board an oil platform to prevent it drilling in the Arctic . Water cannons were used to try and stop Greenpeace activists climbing onto the oil platform . ‘A . charge of piracy is being laid against men and women whose only crime . is to be possessed of a conscience. This is an outrage and represents . nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest. ‘Any . claim that these activists are pirates is as absurd as it is . abominable. It is utterly irrational, it is designed to intimidate and . silence us, but we will not be cowed.’ He . added that Russia's treatment of the protesters was ‘the most serious . threat to Greenpeace's peaceful environmental activism’ since its ship . Rainbow Warrior was bombed in New Zealand in 1985, when the group was . protesting French nuclear testing in the Pacific. The activists have been in custody in the northern city of Murmansk since last week. A . Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: ‘We are providing . consular assistance to all six British nationals arrested in connection . to the protest by Greenpeace. ‘Consular . officials have travelled to Murmansk, raised the issue with Russian . authorities and are providing support to the British nationals and . liaising with Greenpeace.’","Videographer faces piracy charge with a maximum sentence of 15 years .

"Charged: Former PCSO Peter Bunyan was found guilty at Taunton Crown Court of abusing his position to have affairs with five women while on duty . A married PCSO has been jailed for seven years for misconduct in public office after he engaged in sexual affairs while he was supposed to be on uniformed patrol. Peter Bunyan, 40, would track down phone numbers and addresses of women while on duty using the database with Devon and Cornwall police. Father-of-two Bunyan had affairs with four women before and during his policing shift - sleeping with one lover up to ten times when he was on duty. He was found guilty of neglecting his duties after it emerged he would turn his police radio down on shifts while having sex with women, as well as encouraging one mentally ill woman to send explicit pictures of herself on email to the police station. He even had sex with one woman at a neighbourhood policing unit as he worked a late shift on a housing estate in Cornwall in 2009. Bunyan admitted wasting police time but insisted he had not neglected his duty because he kept his radio on during the dates while working for Devon and Cornwall police. The former car park worker denied 12 charges of misconduct in a public office but was found guilty of eight counts at Taunton Crown Court yesterday. He was convicted of sleeping with four women and illegally accessing data relating to three lovers on the Criminal Information System. Bunyan, who joined Devon and Cornwall police in 2003, was also found guilty of accessing the system to look up the details of a man without reason. The jury acquitted Bunyan of having an affair with a fifth woman and falsely borrowing money from her, as well as looking up the woman and two others on the police computer. Bunyan, of Redruth, Cornwall, remained emotionless as the verdicts were returned at Taunton Crown Court yesterday. His honour Judge Graham Hume Jones remanded Bunyan in custody following his convictions. The judge said: 'I will sentence this matter on Tuesday. In the meantime you will be remanded in custody. You may go down now.' Bunyan stated his affairs never got in the way of his duty but admitted to sleeping with one lover up to 10 when he was supposed to be on patrol. He said his beat would take him past the address of the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and he repeatedly called in to continue their affair. Bunyan told the jury: 'I tended to see her during the day time. I was on duty a lot of the time. 'I would have been in full uniform with my radio on, I was supposed to be on foot patrol. I was not taking advantage of my position, I don’t feel I was doing that at all. 'I would not say I was abusing my position but I was not doing what I should have been doing. 'I admit I was wasting police time and being negligent and not attending to my duty.' Bunyan admitted that over the course of the affairs, between 2006 and 2011, he failed to correctly fill in police notebooks and records - leaving some days blank. The court heard how he researched his lovers using the Criminal Information System - one up to 17 times - to find out their mobile phone numbers and pasts. On trial: Police community support officer Peter Bunyan (pictured, left, outside court and, right, in his uniform) was accused of using highly sensitive police data to strike up affairs with vulnerable women while on duty . Bunyan, who worked as a PCSO in . Redruth and Camborne, Cornwall, even kept a secret mobile phone hidden . at the police station, which he used to organise liaisons with lovers . while on duty. During the trial, Bunyan denied being . in uniform while sleeping with all his lovers - who were described as . 'vulnerable' and cannot be named for legal reasons. Devon and Cornwall police suspended Bunyan when an investigation into his conduct was launched in 2011. During the trial his defence lawyer, Michael . Melville-Shreeve, told the court Bunyan was a ‘rat’ – but said the . prosecution case was ‘piffle’. He . said: ‘The prosecution say if he’s off duty having sex with these . women: not misconduct. If he’s on duty, if he’d stopped off to have tea . with them or coffee with them: not misconduct. 'But if he has sex with them, it is misconduct. Why? How is that? ‘He . [Bunyan] is a rat. He’s a disgrace as a married man. But somehow, my . learned friend [prosecution counsel Simon Burns] wants to turn that into . criminal misconduct. ‘If it’s not serious crime to have tea with someone for half an hour, it is not a crime to have sex consensually with them.’ Redruth police station, where Bunyan would openly view explicit pictures of his victims . Referring . to the four-year affair between former Prime Minister Sir John Major and ex-minister Edwina . Currie, Mr Melville-Shreeve said: ‘What about John Major and Edwina . Currie? ‘She’s even written . a book about it. That was a public office. I don’t know if it was on . duty or off duty. I don’t know whether a prime minister is ever off . duty.’ Caught: Bunyan confessed to sleeping with a woman up to ten times while on duty . He continued: . ‘I remember people were raucous about those Conservatives. But it is not . a crime. Nobody ever called for their prosecution.’ Bunyan, . a father of two, denied 12 counts of misconduct in a public office, . over a five-year period in the Camborne and Redruth areas of west . Cornwall. Of the five women he was accused of sleeping with, he admitted having sex with four, but said it happened in his own time. All of the women said the sex was . consensual. Earlier, prosecutor Mr Burns had argued that Bunyan, of . Carharrack near Camborne, ‘was not there when the public needed him’. He told the court: ‘He abused his position as a police officer. ‘He’s targeted vulnerable individuals . who are either people who have suffered from mental issues or . individuals who have been at the receiving end of violence. ‘He has conducted sexual relationships, totally and utterly inappropriately, while on duty. ‘He’s ignored police radio transmissions while on duty, while turning down the radio or turning it off. He added: ‘He has accessed the police computer . system without legitimate policing purpose. It is clearly a conflict of . interest with his work.’ But Mr Melville-Shreeve described the . prosecution case as ‘piffle’, saying: ‘The police are desperate to get . him [Bunyan] because he is one of their own.’ He added: ‘[Bunyan] is a disgrace to the uniform. He should be publicly humiliated. But he’s not a serious criminal.’","Police community support officer slept with several women while on duty .

"Wanted man: Ryan MacDonald, 20, was captured today by armed police after 10 days on the run . A man who escaped from a prison van when it was ambushed as it took him to court was recaptured tonight in an armed raid. Ryan MacDonald, 20, was caught just after 5pm by armed officers at a house in Ordsall, Salford, said Greater Manchester Police. He and another man were freed by a trio of armed men in Salford as their van made its way to Manchester Crown Court from a prison in Merseyside on April 30. Detective Chief Superintendent Darren Shenton said: 'We said on that day that we would return both men to custody and we have today made good on that promise. 'The last ten days has seen intense and continued activity from the force as part of our ongoing commitment to find not only the two men but those responsible for the attack on the van. 'As well as this latest arrest, we have arrested and charged a number of other people in connection with what happened and the people of Greater Manchester can be assured that we will not rest until every single person behind this incident is located and brought to justice.' MacDonald was due to be sentenced for conspiracy to commit robbery and aggravated vehicle taking when he escaped. He was part of a gang who . targeted pawnbrokers in Manchester and Salford where jewellery was . stolen in daylight smash-and-grab raids. His delayed hearing was held in his absence last Friday at Manchester Crown Court as he was jailed for seven years and 10 months. The defendant, of Allendale Walk, Salford, had pleaded guilty to the offences at an earlier hearing. Police had issued a £10,000 reward for information leading to MacDonald's arrest.

Recaptured: Both men have now been found by police, with McMullen caught on Sunday and MacDonald today . Another man, Stevie McMullen, 31, appeared in court last week charged with escaping lawful custody in connection with the incident and was remanded in custody. Police caught McMullen on Sunday, when he was travelling in a car with two other men on the A6, near Lancaster University. At the time of the escape, he was due to appear on trial for conspiracies to kidnap, rob, commit arson . and possess a firearm. Arrested: Stevie McMullen, 31, has appeared in court charged with escaping lawful custody in connection with the incident . While MacDonald was still missing, GMP Assistant Chief Constable Steve . Heywood said: ‘A £10,000 reward was put . forward for information leading to the capture of these two men. 'This . full £10,000 reward still stands for anyone who gives us information . that leads to MacDonald's arrest and will be paid when he is back behind . bars.' Shortly after 9am on April 30, a prison . van carrying prisoners from HMP Altcourse to Manchester Crown Square . was attacked on Regent Road, Salford, by at least three men wearing dark . clothing and balaclavas. The men had arrived at the location in a dark coloured Saab and threatened staff transporting the prisoners with a shotgun. Five men - believed to be three . offenders and the two escaped prisoners - then got back into the Saab, . which was driven a short distance and abandoned. It is believed three ran towards a nearby estate and two may have further escaped on a motorbike that was later found abandoned. On Tuesday, April 30 a 28-year-old . woman and 24-year-old man were detained at a house on the Ordsall . estate, Salford on suspicion of being involved in assisting an offender. They have been released on bail pending further inquiries until June . 26.

"This burned out battery is what has caused a worldwide grounding of Boeing’s ‘revolutionary’ 787 Dreamliner jets. Photographs of the charred remains of lithium ion batteries . from two separate incidents resulting in the grounding of Japanese Boeing Dreamliners indicate it . operated at a voltage above its design limit. Today U.S. officials joined Japan's . probe into the jets after all 50 of the 787s in use around the . world have been stopped from flying. Scroll down for video . Culprit: The Boeing 787's lithium battery can self heat as a result of temperature and pressure changes, which may have caused this battery fire on a Dreamliner at Logan Airport, Boston on January 7 . The new generation of light lithium . batteries was going to deliver equal power at half the weight, but it . appears that the chemistry inside the ‘thermal runway’ can self-heat . if external temperature and pressure change, something which frequently . occurs in aviation. Concerns over the battery, . prompted by an emergency landing of an All Nippon Airways plane on . Wednesday, has seen the plane grounded across the globe. The American investigators - one each . from the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation . Safety Board and two from Boeing Co. - today inspected the ANA jet on the . tarmac at Takamatsu airport in western Japan. An initial inspection by Japanese . officials of the 787 found that a flammable battery fluid known as . electrolyte had leaked from the plane's main lithium-ion battery beneath . the cockpit. It also found burn marks around the battery. Eight airlines fly the ‘plastic . plane’, so-called because its fuselage is ‘spun’ from super-strong but . lightweight carbon fibre, which cuts weight and fuel consumption, rather . than constructed from aluminium. Grounded: Passengers are forced to evacuate a Japanese Boeing Dreamliner using the plane's escape slides following an emergency landing at Takamatsu airport . yesterday . Japan's two largest air carriers All Nippon Airlines and Japan Airlines voluntarily grounded their 787s  following the emergency landing at Takamatsu airport . A . Japanese All Nippon Airlines Dreamliner was forced to make an . emergency landing after a cockpit message warned of battery problems . What are the problems with the new Dreamliner? The 21st-century plane entered service in October 2011, three years late, following a spate of design and safety-related issues. What are the safety issues? Of foremost concern is the aircraft's lithium battery system. Lithium technology, which is used in electric cars and laptops, is considered potentially unsafe and has been known to start fires. What were the other problems? The first three 787s were found to be overweight. There were also problems sourcing certain parts and in the development of the on board software. Test flights were delayed by a machinists strike and Rolls Royce was said to have struggled to supply the engines on time. In June 2010 Boeing stunned the aviation industry by postponing the first flight indefinitely after engineers discovered  structural flaws. Then in November that year a test flight had to make an emergency landing in Laredo, Texas, after crew notice smoke in the cabin. Are they safe? Boeing insists they are but is reviewing the plane's design and assembly together with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. The company issued a statement saying they stand behind the 787's overall integrity. Chief executive Jim McNerney said in a statement. 'We will be taking every necessary step in the coming days to assure our customers and the travelling public of the 787's safety and to return the airplanes to service.' What does it mean for Boeing? Boeing shares fell 2 per cent on Wednesday and are expected to fall further. Some experts have suggested the 787, which has a list price of $207 million, may never make a profit. The manufacturer faces stiff competition from European firm Airbus who build the Superjumbo, the world's largest passenger aircraft. Why have airlines rushed to buy the 787? The Dreamliner has the longest range of any passenger jet. More significantly it is the most efficient, this is vitally important as fuel costs now represent airlines' largest expenditure. Passenger comfort is also paramount with bigger windows, more room for carry-on baggage, and lower cabin pressurisation to make long flights more bearable. 787s also have wider aisles and higher ceilings and offer a smoother, quieter journey. British Airways has ordered 24 and . holiday firm Thomson Airways has ordered 8 of the planes – with their . deliveries starting from next month – but say they are standing by the . stricken airliner. Thomson is scheduled to be the first British flyer of . Dreamliners in May. GS Yuasa Corp., the maker of the . lithium-ion batteries used in the 787s, said Thursday it was helping . with the investigation but that the cause of the problem was unclear. It . said the problem could be the battery, the power source or the . electronics system. European air safety bosses acted just . hours after America’s Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) issued an . ‘Emergency Airworthiness Directive’ to halt flights of the planes - the . first time a fleet of aircraft has been grounded across the world in 34 . years. The FAA’s emergency  directive said . the action was ‘prompted by recent incidents involving  lithium ion . battery failures that resulted in the release of flammable electrolytes, . heat damage and smoke’ on two aircraft.’ It said: ’The cause of  these failures . is currently under investigation’ but warned more ominously: . ’These . conditions, if not corrected, could result in damage to critical . systems and structures , and the potential for fire in the electrical . compartment.’ The decision to ground the 50 planes currently . in service is a humiliating blow to the world’s . biggest aircraft maker, which has seen its shares plummet since the emergency ANA jet emergency landing on Wednesday. Some 137 passengers and crew members on an All Nippon Airlines . flight were evacuated down escape chutes when smoke was detected on . board. The Dreamliner is the first airliner . to make extensive use of lithium-ion batteries. They charge faster and . can be better moulded to space-saving shapes compared with other . aeroplane batteries. But the electrolyte fluid also . conducts electricity, so as it spreads it can cause short-circuits and . ignite fires. Its corrosiveness also raised concern about whether a . leak might weaken a key support structure of the plane. Paul Czysz, professor emeritus of . aeronautical engineering at St. Louis University said: . ‘Unfortunately, . what Boeing did to save weight is use the same batteries that are in the . electric cars, and they are running into the same problems with the 787 . as the problems that have shown up in electric cars.’ The battery fire is just one of  a . series of problems  - including  two fuel leaks, a wiring problem, brake . computer glitch and cracked cockpit window – to afflict the 787 which . got off to a bad start when launched three years late. The plane made the landing in Takamatsu after a burning smell was also detected in the cockpit. Both All Nippon Airlines and Japan Airlines have grounded their entire fleets of the problematic aircraft . Both Japan and the United States have opened investigations into the plane after a series of incidents have raised safety concerns . Among the 50 planes grounded are the . six Dreamliners owned by United Airlines, the only U.S. airline to . operate the plane.

"There are few obvious similarities between superstar Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard and Hull's Scottish keeper Allan McGregor but both share the honour of being penalty perfectionists. Hazard is understandably confident from the spot, having scored 17 goals from 17 attempts in domestic competition for Chelsea and his previous club Lille - but David Meyler says McGregor is the man to stop the Belgian should he get the chance on Saturday at Stamford Bridge. The former Rangers keeper has been impenetrable from 12 yards since his move to Hull, saving three penalties starting with Frank Lampard's effort in last season's opener against Chelsea. Hull goalkeeper Allan McGregor starred in their 0-0 draw with West Brom after saving a penalty . Graham Dorrans couldn't beat McGregor, who has now saved all three Premier League penalties he's faced . Dorrans reacts after McGregor was up to the task to save a draw for Steve Bruce's 18th-placed side . Since then he's saved a penalty from QPR's Charlie Austin and last week he was hailed Hull's hero as his stop from West Brom's Graham Dorrans helped Steve Bruce's side salvage a scoreless draw. While Hazard's record from the dot is impressive, the best in any of Europe's top five leagues, he's faltered in Europe and McGregor's team-mate David Meyler says McGregor could have his number. 'He's a fantastic keeper,' Meyler told The Sun's Graeme Bryce of McGregor, who joined Hull from Besiktas. Eden Hazard is deadly from 12 yards, having scored 17 from 17 attempts in domestic competitions . Hazard has been flawless in leagues for Lille and Chelsea, but is yet to take a penalty against Hull's McGregor . David Meyler says his keeper has been an inspiration since his move last season from Besiktas . It was was not so long ago that McGregor was the subject of Republic of Ireland international Meyler's abuse from the Celtic stands while he was in goal for Rangers. Meyler's no doubt happy to have the 32-year-old on his side after he famously saved Georgios Samaras's penalty late in the season in 2011 in an undoubted turning point in that year's Scottish title that went the way of Rangers. 'He's been inspirational since day one ... He works really hard on penalties with our other goalies Steve Harper and Eldin Jakupovic, as well as Gary Walsh our goalkeeping coach. 'They all talk through penalties and go through the information about whatever side we're playing. Allan really studies up on all that stuff and he's clearly doing it well, as the stats prove.'","Chelsea's Eden Hazard hasn't missed in his 17 Premier League penalties .

"A museum which yesterday became the victim of one of the biggest art heists in history has admitted that there were no guards on duty at  the time. Seven paintings worth around £100million, including works by Picasso and Monet, were stolen from the Kunsthal Museum in the Dutch city of Rotterdam after thieves broke in at 3am. The gang managed to bypass the sophisticated alarm system, in what police say was a well-prepared robbery. Scroll down for video . Expensive haul: Police stand guard at the Kunsthal museum where paintings worth millions of pounds were stolen . Chris Marinello, director of the Art . Loss Register, which tracks stolen artworks, said the smooth nature of . the theft suggested the gang must have had inside information. ‘Those . thieves got one hell of a haul,’ he added. The paintings included Monet’s . Waterloo Bridge and Charing Cross Bridge (both 1901), Picasso’s . Harlequin Head (1971), Matisse’s Reading Girl In White And Yellow . (1919)  and Lucian Freud’s Woman With Eyes Closed (2002). Gauguin’s Girl in Front of Open Window (1898) and Meyer de Haan’s Autoportrait (1890) were also taken. Dutch police confirmed a total of . seven paintings were stolen from a museum exhibition showcasing a . private collection of over 150 exhibits, and had only been open for a . few days. The theft is one of the art world's most dramatic in recent years, and one of the biggest ever in the Netherlands. Roland Ekkers, a spokesman for Rotterdam police, said they received a . call alerting them to the theft at around 3 a.m. local time on Tuesday. Investigation: Evidence is secured inside the museum from the privately owned exhibition on display at Kunsthal where a total of seven paintings disappeared . Invaluable: The works stolen were on display at the Avant-Gardes show featuring paintings from the Triton Foundation collection including work by Matisse, Picasso and Freud . ‘The alarm system in the Kunsthal was supposed to be state of the art,’ Ekkers said. ‘Somehow the people responsible for this found a way in and a way out . and they found time to take seven paintings. So that's something that is . part of our investigation right now.’ The paintings stolen include two Claude Monet's: 'Charing Cross Bridge' and 'Waterloo Bridge', part of his famous London series. Also taken were Pablo Picasso's 'Tete d'Arlequin', Henri Matisse's 'La Liseuse en Blanc et Jaune' and Lucien Freud's 'Woman with Eyes Closed', Paul Gaugin's 'Femme Devant une Fenetre Ouvertem dite La Fiancee' and Meyer de Hann's 'Autoportrait'. Jop Ubbens, chairman of Christie's in Amsterdam, said the paintings would be worth ‘more than several million euros,’ with the Picasso the best known of the stolen works. ‘It's all about name and fame. So the Picasso is the best known. The least well-known is Meyer de Haan, which looks like a Gauguin, so maybe it was a mistake,’ he added. Stolen: Claude Monet's Waterloo Bridge was one of the paintings taken last night . Painted by masters: Woman with Eyes Closed by Lucian Freud and Tete d'Arlequin by Pablo Picasso . Famous: Charing Cross Bridge by Claude Monet is part of the French impressionists London series . Ubbens said the art heist was one of . the biggest in the country, but ‘not as big as The Scream’, referring to . the work by Edvard Munch, a version of which was stolen from a museum . in Oslo in 2004 but later recovered. In 2010, five paintings were stolen . from the Musee d'Art Moderne in Paris including a Picasso and Matisse . and estimated to be worth a combined $124 million. However there is hope for a swift recovery of the stolen pieces as experts said it would be next to impossible for the thieves to sell such well-known works on the open market. ‘They are going to learn very quickly that these things cannot be sold,’ said Christopher Marinello, executive director of The Art Loss Register, which helps track down stolen works of art. ‘They don't even think about it sometimes. They may try and call and entice a ransom.’ Gone missing: A Dutch police handout of Paul Gaugin's Femme devant une fenetre ouverte, dite La Fiancee . Lost art: Both La Liseuse en Blanc et Jaune by Henri Matisse and . Autoportrait by Meyer de Haan disappeared from Kunsthal, Rotterdam on . Tuesday morning . Empty place: Two hooks on the wall marks the place where the stolen Henri Mattise's La Liseuse en Blanc et Jaune painting was hanging before it was taken . He added, however, that it was . unlikely the works had been stolen ‘to order’ from a wealthy collector, . dismissing such theories as the realm of Hollywood. ‘I'm confident these will find their . way back’"" he said. ‘The police in this area are very good, very well . organised. I would not be surprised to see them surfacing over the next . few weeks.’ The Kunsthal exhibition, displaying a large part of the Triton Foundation's avant-garde . collection for the first time in one gallery, opened a few days ago to celebrate Kunsthal's 20th anniversary. The Kunsthal, meaning 'art gallery' in Dutch, is a display space that has no permanent . collection of its own. The . Triton Foundation exhibition was showing works by more than 150 famed artists, . including Alexander Calder, Paul Cezanne, Marc Chagall, Salvador Dali, . Edgar Degas, Marcel Duchamp, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, August . Rodin, and Andy Warhol. Investigating art: A forensic expert talks on his mobile phone from a police van parked near a statue outside Kunsthal museum . Although a private collection, the . curators at the Triton Foundation aim to have their art on display for . the public, and pieces have been shown in the past. However, the current presentation was the first time the entire collection had been exhibited together. The collection was put together by . the Cordia family, which made its fortune in shipping and oil and which . ranks among the 100 richest families in the Netherlands, according to . Dutch media. The family is estimated to own about . 330 million euros' worth of assets, according to Dutch magazine Quote, . which makes lists similar to U.S. magazine Forbes's ranking of . billionaires. In a statement, the museum's chairman . Willem van Hassel said the museum will be closed Tuesday, and he . referred all questions to the police.

Detective Chief Inspector Les Newman said he and his colleagues were ‘utterly disgusted’. Mr Newman said some of the intended recipients may not see another Christmas. ‘This is a despicable crime committed by heartless individuals,’ he said. ‘I urge the thief to think about their actions and do the decent thing and return them.

If it means putting their face on lorries and driving them around London, that is what we will do.’ Mr Newman said the crime is the ‘No 1 priority’ for his team, which specialises in thefts. Police believe the thief was caught on camera but face a substantial task because the presents went missing during a three-day window before the discovery on Monday afternoon.

"Neil Lennon hopes to follow in the footsteps of Sam Allardyce as Bolton pushes for a late season resurgence with the help of some stars whose best is undoubtedly behind them. Short-term signing Eidur Gudjohnsen, 36, will be part of the Wanderers squad on Saturday for their trip to Reading after playing under-21s on Monday. The former Barcelona and Chelsea star could soon be joined by Emile Heskey, also 36, who is on a two-week trial at Bolton following a stint in Australia's A-League with Newcastle United Jets.

The whole scenario has shades of now West Ham manager Allardyce's 2004–05 Bolton side that finished sixth and qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time with veterans Fernando Hierro, Jay-Jay Okocha and Youri Djorkaeff key cogs in his line-up. Having vastly improved since Lennon's arrival from Celtic, Bolton is now targeting a second half of the season run and a play-off position. 'Sam's a great manager and knew exactly what he was doing,' Lennon told The Sun. 'He recognised these players still had class and quality and they made a huge contribution towards what he did. 'I'm not saying I'm going to replicate everything Sam did, but we have two talented players here in Eidur and Emile. 'They may be coming toward the twilight of their careers but they could have a lot to offer us.' Gudjohnsen, who last played at Club Brugge in Belgium, appeared for Bolton's under 21s on Monday . Heskey most recently turned out up front for Australian A-League club the Newcastle United Jets . Lennon expressed his delight after signing Gudjohnsen on Friday. 'I think he will be a big game player and he is relishing getting back out on the field,' Lennon said. 'It may take him a little time to adjust to the Championship and the style of play that is required of him, but that said however, he has come in with a completely open mind – he's motivated, he's done everything that has been asked of him on the physical side of things and he can only get better. 'In terms of his footballing ability, we all know what he is capable of and that is an exciting prospect. Sam Allardyce enlisted Fernando Hierro, Jay-Jay Okocha and Youri Djorkaeff in their career twilight in '04-'05 . Unimpressed at being substituted, Okocha showed the fire was still there as Bolton finished sixth . Djorkaeff (left in a legends match in Bangkok on Friday against Paul Scholes) was also a star of Allardyce's golden oldies side that saw the club to UEFA Cup qualification for the first time . 'He is a quality player, and he knows exactly what we expect of him going forward – he is definitely looking forward to the challenge ahead of him.' The Nothern Irishman has also been impressed by Heskey, his former Leicester team-mate.

"Scotland Yard murder detectives have travelled in secret to a Thai island where two British backpackers were brutally murdered amid concerns two Burmese bar workers may have been wrongly arrested in connection with their deaths. The three investigators from London arrived into Koh Tao by helicopter from Bangkok, avoiding the long ferry voyage from the mainland, and visited Sairee Beach where Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were killed last month. During their visit, the officers, who were joined by two further Met detectives who arrived on the island earlier in the week, asked questions of a handful of local officials, who had been informed of the top-secret visit. Scroll down for videos . The investigators from London arrived into Koh Tao by helicopter from Bangkok, avoiding the long ferry voyage from the mainland, and visited Sairee Beach (above) where the British backpackers were killed last month . Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were murdered on Sairee beach on the southern island of Koh Tao . Local police were sidelined for the visit and the British officers were accompanied by Jarumporn Suramanee, an advisor to the national police chief, and Suwat Jaengyodsuk, acting deputy commander of Thailand's Metropolitan Police Bureau. Police Major General Suwat is the chief investigator in the case, who had been assigned earlier by national police chief Somyot Pumpanmuang to take over from regional officers. Police General Jarumporn is a forensic expert who has been involved in the investigation since the bodies of the couple were discovered on the beach on September 15. The trip to the beach was kept secret, with no regional police officers being informed, the Bangkok Post reported today. A source reportedly revealed to the newspaper that at least one British officer is a homicide detective and another is an experienced crime scene expert. The reason for the secrecy was not officially explained, but observers in Bangkok said the visit reflected the concerns of British authorities about the way the murder inquiry had been conducted. Burmese suspects Zaw Lin (left) and Win Zaw Htun (right), both 21, claim they were made their confession under torture and were forced to perform re-enactment of the murder of the two British backpackers . Police said the arrested men (pictured) had confessed to the crime - despite the fact that the two had yet to appear in court to face any charge and speak for themselves . Thai police have been criticised for allowing bystanders to trample over the crime scene and to have issued a number of conflicting statements as the investigation continued. Two Burmese men have been arrested for the murders but after allegedly confessing to the crimes, they later retracted their statements claiming they had been forced by torture to admit to carrying out the killings. During their visit this weekend, the British team not only stood at the water's edge on the beach, but also inspected a nearby residence where the two suspects had been staying.

The agreement was reached, but it is understood the London team were told they could only observe and advise and not become actively involved in the ongoing investigation.

"With a question mark hanging over Steven Gerrard's future beyond this season, West Ham has stepped up as a willing - if unlikely - suitor. The London club's vice-chairman Karren Brady believes there's plenty of game time left in the 34-year-old and that it is his critics, not the Liverpool legend himself, who should be put out to pasture. 'It is Gerrard’s critics who should be written off,' says the hammers vice-chairman in her column for The Sun.

The Reds lifer, so far, is off contract in the summer but yet to agree to a deal despite an offer being confirmed by manager Brendan Rodgers. Rodgers rested Gerrard last week, with the veteran coming off the bench against Stoke, but returned to the starting line-up with a goal in Liverpool's 3-1 win over Leicester.

'Gerrard is capable of playing in all manner of roles, he’s a terrific example to his team-mates and clearly a sound adviser of the manager’s.

Further speculation has Gerrard potentially picking up a final big pay cheque abroad in either Asia or in the footsteps of Frank Lampard, to the MLS - although the former Chelsea ace, two years Gerrard's senior, has excelled on loan at Manchester City with his future too under debate.","Steven Gerrard has been offered a new deal beyond 2014 at Liverpool .

"A woman accused of arranging the murder of her Australian businessman husband in Bali could face charges carrying the death penalty. The development in the case comes as the couple's Perth-based sons arrive in Bali to mourn their father, Robert Kelvin Ellis. The body of the 60 years old was found wrapped in plastic and dumped in a ditch in the rice field near Sedang Village on Tuesday. He was set upon in his own Bali kitchen by five killers who slashed his throat 'like killing a pig', police say. SCROLL DOWN TO VIDEO .

British man Robert Kelvin Ellis (left), here with wife Noor Ellis (right) was found in a rice paddock with his throat cut on Tuesday . His wife of around 20 years, Indonesian Julaikah Noor Aini, known as Noor Ellis, is accused of ordering the crime while furious over money and infidelity. 'The motive is because his wife felt embittered with the victim,' Badung police chief Komang Suartana told News Corp. 'Because of many things. She said that her husband is often cheating on her.' Police will allege she paid Arli (also known as Adrianus Ngongo or Ariel), the boyfriend of her maid known as 'F', $14,000 to kill Mr Ellis, most of it to be paid after the crime. Police spokesman Hery Wiyanto says the wife, Arli, 'F' and a second maid known as 'Y' will be charged. F is accused of 'lifting and dumping' Mr Ellis' body, while Y apparently cleaned up the bloody kitchen. Mr Hery said two charges were being weighed - murder, carrying up to 15 years jail, and premeditated murder - which carries a maximum penalty of death. Officials said Mr Ellis, who has been living in Australia, had a UK passport, and is believed to have moved to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife . Four others were still wanted for assisting Arli, he said. 'Some have fled out of Bali and some are still hiding in Bali,' he said. 'We urge them to surrender.

"The mystery over Kim Jong-un’s whereabouts for the past five weeks has deepened as a surprise new claim emerged suggesting he was receiving drastic weight loss treatment in China. Following the leader's public re-emergence yesterday, the North Korean Ambassador in London, Hyon Hak Bong, told the BBC that there was ‘no doubt about it’ that Kim was healthy. But his comments came as a source told the Daily Mail that the 31-year-old had spent the past few weeks in a Beijing hospital having his stomach tied, or ‘banded’, to help him fight his weight gain. Last month it was claimed Kim has been putting his health at serious risk due to his dangerously high consumption of Emmental cheese, which he got a taste for while a student in Switzerland. Scroll down for video . Kim has finally resurfaced with the help of a walking stick after an unexplained and prolonged absence . Recent appearance: North Korean Leader Kim Jong-Un had last been seen in the state media five weeks ago at a concert on September 3 (above centre, with his wife Ri Sol-Ju), and he missed several high-profile event . Joy: Kim Jong-un inspects a substance believed to be cheese at a North Korean factory. A unhealthy appetite for Emmental is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning in recent months . Issues: Kim is reported to be suffering from gout, from diabetes, from a brain haemorrhage, from a heart ailment, from a leg injury that required surgery from a doctor, from mental illness or from a cheese addiction . The reputable source, who has connections with intelligence agencies in the West, said Kim’s stay in hospital in China was the reason for his no-show at the recent 69th anniversary celebrations of the ruling Korean Workers’ Party. He has also been treated in recent weeks for sprains or fractures, to his ankles - a problem that developed after he injured a leg while joining troops in a military exercise in August. It has since been speculated that, as he continued to limp around, his weight added to the pressure on both legs, resulting in him seeking medical treatment for both that injury and his weight gain. A unhealthy appetite for Emmental, also known as Swiss cheese, is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning in recent months. Experts believe Kim may have been deliberately gaining weight in order to look more like his late grandfather Kim Il-sung, who is venerated in North Korea as the nation's founder and still holds the title Eternal President of the Republic, despite having died 20 years ago. His absence fuelled speculation about his health and even rumours of a coup in the nuclear-armed state . Smiling: This photograph from North Korean newspaper Rodong Sinmun shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un during an inspection tour of a newly-built housing complex in Pyongyang . Another photograph from Rodong Sinmun of Kim during an inspection tour of a newly-built housing complex . Enemy: A South Korean man watches a TV news program showing Kim Jong-un using his cane yesterday . Not un-well: TV monitors in South Korea show a news report about the health of the North Korean leader. The captions mockingly refer to the 'Honorable Kim Jong-un' The Ambassador’s comment that Kim was healthy would still hold true even if the leader was in hospital, as stomach banding would be classified as cosmetic, rather than treatment for an illness. The North Korean regime has made no mention of Kim being in Beijing and the claim by the source - a former government official of a European country who retains close ties with Western intelligence agencies - could not be independently verified. But Pyongyang officials have admitted that Kim has been suffering ‘discomfort’ - while emphasising that he is still very much in control of the country. Kim Jong-un's unhealthy obsession with Emmental has led to him importing vast quantities of the cheese for his own consumption - despite millions of North Koreans struggling to find enough to eat. The mystery over Kim Jong-un’s whereabouts had deepened as a surprise new claim emerged suggesting he was receiving drastic weight loss treatment in China . Kim has been treated in recent weeks for sprains or fractures, to his ankles - a problem that developed after he injured a leg while joining troops in a military exercise in August . Weight gain: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un got a taste for the cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities despite Western sanctions . Adored: Earlier this year it was revealed that Kim Jong-un tried to send a team of food experts to the French city of Besancon for a crash course in dairy production so he would no longer have to import his cheese . Malnutrition is widespread and famines often break out in the country, which is still reliant on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s. But despite the suffering of his 25 million citizens, Kim continues to gorge on Swiss cheese in such vast quantities that his waistline is expanding at a dangerously rapid rate. Earlier this year it was revealed that Kim tried to send a team of food experts to the French city of Besancon for a crash course in dairy production. Tired of his country's bland attempts to produce a top quality local cheese the despot ordered the three specialists to spend several months at the National Dairy Industry College. Although the college 'politely but firmly' rejected the request, Kim remains determined to improve standards at the country's main cheese factory. He is understood to be furious that the Pyongyang Dairy has continually failed to produce an Emmental-style cheese of a high enough quality to satisfy his demands.","Lengthy absence fuelled questions over the state of Kim Jong-un's health .

"The wife of murdered Australian businessmen Robert Kelvin Ellis has told Indonesian police she played no part in his killing, blaming her housemaids and local thugs in Bali. Robert Ellis' body was found by a farmer in a ditch in a rice field on Tuesday, wrapped in plastic and bedding, 25 kms from the couple's luxury Bali villa. Julaikah Noor Aini, known as Noor Ellis, has told police she slept through the murder in a guest room of the home, next door to the kitchen where three attempts were made to slit her husband's throat, Fairfax reports. According to police, Robert Ellis was set upon  by five killers who slashed his throat 'like killing a pig.' The autopsy has confirmed he died from a 'deep cut to the throat'. 'The cut severed an artery - blood would have spurted and it would have been a quick death after that. The victim didn't show much sign of a struggle, and there were no signs that he was defending himself. We saw bruising on both arms indicating that he was restrained,' Dr Ida Bagus Putu Alit from Denpasar's Sanglah Hospital told Fairfax. Police allege Ms Noor had admitted ordering the hit on her husband, paying the couple's two housemaids and  five men 150 million rupiah ($14,200) to carry it out. But her lawyer says she only organised some men to 'talk' to her husband about financial problems and things went wrong. If found guilty of premeditated murder, Ms Noor faces the death penalty in Indonesia. SCROLL DOWN TO VIDEO . British man Robert Kelvin Ellis (left), here with wife Noor Ellis (right) was found in a rice paddy with his throat cut on Tuesday . Police allege Noor Ellis paid Arli (also known as Adrianus Ngongo or Ariel pictured), the boyfriend of her maid known as 'F', $14,000 to kill Mr Ellis . According to her lawyer Nyoman Wisnu Yasa, Ms Noor had asked her maids to organise some men to give her husband a 'talking to' because he was withholding money from her. 'Noor said specifically and several times: ""Do not harm Bob, do not injure him in any way""', the lawyer told Fairfax Media. She claims she only knew her husband  was dead when she was awoken by a knock on her door and a thug saying: 'Ibu [Ma'am], the job is done.' Ms Noor told Police she found her husband in blood on the kitchen floor and was forced to get rid of the body. 'She was only following instructions. She was saying, ""I don't want this,"" but the executioners were saying, ""You do it or we'll kill you too"". She had no idea where to go, it was them telling her, ""Go straight, go left, go right,""until they reached the middle of nowhere and dumped the body,' reported her lawyer. But Police allege Ms Noor organised the murder of her husband of 25 years because she was furious over money and infidelity. They say she and the two housemaids had already confessed. 'The motive is because his wife felt embittered with the victim,' Badung police chief Komang Suartana told News Corp. 'Because of many things. She said that her husband is often cheating on her.' Police allege she paid one of the maid's boyfriends, Arli (also known as Adreanus Ngongo or Ariel) and other men $14,000 to kill Mr Ellis, most of it to be paid after the crime. Police spokesman Hery Wiyanto said Ms Noor, Arli, maid 'F' and a second maid known as 'Y' will be charged. F is accused of 'lifting and dumping' Mr Ellis' body, while Y apparently cleaned up the bloody kitchen. Mr Wiyanto said two charges were being weighed - murder, carrying up to 15 years jail, and premeditated murder - which carries a maximum penalty of death. Arli  is now in custody but police are looking for four other men, identified as Martin, Deni, Angel and Urga who they believe were involved in the killing. 'Some have fled out of Bali and some are still hiding in Bali,' said Wiyanyto. 'We urge them to surrender. Wherever they are, we will hunt them down.' Officials said Mr Ellis, who has been living in Australia, had a UK passport, and is believed to have moved to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife . The couple's sons Jon and Peter Ellis, both Perth-based students, arrived in Bali on Thursday. They released a statement on Wednesday saying their father was a huge influence in their lives.

'One of the wounds to the throat was fatal, but he also had several bruises around his head, suggesting he had been knocked to the ground before receiving the fatal throat wound,' said Mr Ida Bagus Putu Alit, who heads the district's forensic team. The body Mr Ellis, 60, was found in a rice field on Tuesday morning local time by residents . Police guard the home of Mr Ellis and his Indonesian wife, Noor Ellis . Flowers were seen being delivered to Mr Ellis' widow at the home they shared . Detective Wisnu Wardana said the body is believed to have been lying in the ditch for several days as it was in a state of decay. The rice paddy where the body was found lies between the popular coastal area of Kuta and the hillside town of Ubud. 'There was a deep wound to the neck that had almost completely cut the head,' said Detective Wisnu. Police believe the mat found in the ditch was used to wrap the body and carry it to the rice paddy to be dumped. It is understood Mr Ellis went missing in the early hours of last Sunday morning. There were bruises around his mouth and his right cheek, as well as on both his upper arms, suggesting he had been restrained. It is understood that Mr Ellis and his wife had been living in the Emerald Villas, a luxury complex in the Balinese seaside district of Sanur.","Noor Ellis denies involvement in the murder of her  Australian-British husband Robert Kelvin Ellis, blaming housemaids and thugs .

"Kim Jong-un does not appear to be any slimmer more than a week after it was first rumoured he'd had his stomach stapled in an operation in China. The bloated autocrat was pictured touring a home for retired scientists south of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, with his usual coterie of advisers and military men. The newly completed Yonphung Scientists Rest Home was well served with pools and water features, but Kim, still walking with a cane, did not don his own swimsuit and test the water for himself. Scroll down for video . Tubby: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspects the newly completed Yonphung Scientists Rest Home . Wide load: The young autocrat is just 31, yet he is clearly carrying a few more pounds than his countrymen . Restful: Kim rests his weary legs and sits by the side of a pool in the rest home . Last week Kim reappeared following a five-week disappearance. He looked a shade slimmer and it was claimed he had drastic weight loss treatment in China after developing an addiction to the Swiss cheese Emmental. A a source told the Daily Mail that the 31-year-old had spent the past few weeks in a Beijing hospital having his stomach tied, or ‘banded’, to help him fight his weight gain. It was claimed Kim has been putting his health at serious risk due to his dangerously high consumption of Emmental cheese, which he got a taste for while a student in Switzerland. The reputable source, who has connections with intelligence agencies in the West, said Kim’s stay in hospital in China was the reason for his no-show at the recent 69th anniversary celebrations of the ruling Korean Workers’ Party. Kim finally resurfaced with the help of a walking stick after an unexplained and prolonged absence . Joy: Kim Jong-un inspects a substance believed to be cheese at a North Korean factory. A unhealthy appetite for Emmental is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning in recent months . Issues: Kim is reported to be suffering from gout, from diabetes, from a brain haemorrhage, from a heart ailment, from a leg injury that required surgery from a doctor, from mental illness or from a cheese addiction . Kim has also been treated in recent weeks for sprains or fractures, to his ankles - a problem that developed after he injured a leg while joining troops in a military exercise in August. It has since been speculated that, as he continued to limp around, his weight added to the pressure on both legs, resulting in him seeking medical treatment for both that injury and his weight gain. A unhealthy appetite for Emmental, also known as Swiss cheese, is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning in recent months. Experts believe Kim may have been deliberately gaining weight in order to look more like his late grandfather Kim Il-sung, who is venerated in North Korea as the nation's founder and still holds the title Eternal President of the Republic, despite having died 20 years ago. His absence fuelled speculation about his health and even rumours of a coup in the nuclear-armed state .

Not un-well: TV monitors in South Korea show a news report about the health of the North Korean leader. The captions mockingly refer to the 'Honorable Kim Jong-un' The Ambassador’s comment that Kim was healthy would still hold true even if the leader was in hospital, as stomach banding would be classified as cosmetic, rather than treatment for an illness. The North Korean regime has made no mention of Kim being in Beijing and the claim by the source - a former government official of a European country who retains close ties with Western intelligence agencies - could not be independently verified. But Pyongyang officials have admitted that Kim has been suffering ‘discomfort’ - while emphasising that he is still very much in control of the country. Kim Jong-un's unhealthy obsession with Emmental has led to him importing vast quantities of the cheese for his own consumption - despite millions of North Koreans struggling to find enough to eat. The mystery over Kim Jong-un’s whereabouts had deepened as a surprise new claim emerged suggesting he was receiving drastic weight loss treatment in China . Kim has been treated in recent weeks for sprains or fractures, to his ankles - a problem that developed after he injured a leg while joining troops in a military exercise in August . Weight gain: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un got a taste for the cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities despite Western sanctions . Adored: Earlier this year it was revealed that Kim Jong-un tried to send a team of food experts to the French city of Besancon for a crash course in dairy production so he would no longer have to import his cheese . Malnutrition is widespread and famines often break out in the country, which is still reliant on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s. But despite the suffering of his 25 million citizens, Kim continues to gorge on Swiss cheese in such vast quantities that his waistline is expanding at a dangerously rapid rate. Earlier this year it was revealed that Kim tried to send a team of food experts to the French city of Besancon for a crash course in dairy production. Tired of his country's bland attempts to produce a top quality local cheese the despot ordered the three specialists to spend several months at the National Dairy Industry College. Although the college 'politely but firmly' rejected the request, Kim remains determined to improve standards at the country's main cheese factory. He is understood to be furious that the Pyongyang Dairy has continually failed to produce an Emmental-style cheese of a high enough quality to satisfy his demands.","Kim was pictured touring a scientists' retirement home near Seoul .

"Two orphaned baby wombats have picked up an unlikely skill after a tragic start in life, learning to play soccer in the back yard of their temporary home. Dudley and Moria-Joy were rescued by Judy Bailey around 12 months ago on the NSW South Coast after their mothers were killed by cars. 'They were both found on the side of the road in their mums' pouches after their mums were run over by cars,' Judy’s niece Kirsten Bailey told Daily Mail Australia. Soccer is now ‘a regular hobbie’ for the marsupials. ‘It’s how they get exercise,’ Kirsten explained. When they were first rescued, Dudley weighed just 720g but now they are both a healthy 8kg.

"The police case against two Burmese bar workers arrested for the murder of two British backpackers is in danger of collapse, after prosecutors warned the investigation was full of holes. Burmese migrants Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, were arrested last week for allegedly bludgeoning Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, to death on the island of Koh Tai last month. But the regional prosecution office in the Thai city of Surit Thani, which is responsible for Koh Tai, said the 300-page police report lacked complete evidence. Scroll down for video . Burmese suspects Zaw Lin (left) and Win Zaw Htun (right), both 21, claim they were made their confession under torture and were forced to perform re-enactment . Police have now been given until next Thursday to substantiate the report with more evidence, the Bangkok Post reported last night. It comes after Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha defended the 'botched' police investigation amid claims that two suspects were tortured into confessing. Mr Tawatchai Siengiaew, who is in charge of the case, denied that the evidence had been thrown out, but admitted the report was incomplete. He added that the legal process would not proceed against the arrested men until the prosecution office was satisfied it was watertight. The men are legally able to be held until next Wednesday, but the prosecutor said their detention would be extended by 12 days, regardless of what additional information is submitted by police. He said: ‘The police report still has some holes in it and we have asked for it to be substantiated with more evidence. 'Prosecutors will promptly consider the report once it is complete and make the decision on the indictment.' The bodies of the two tourists were found on Sairee beach on the southern island of Koh Tao, famous for its coral reefs and diving, on September 15. Last week, the two suspects were arrested and paraded by police at a news conference. They also re-enacted the brutal assault. Police said the arrested men had confessed to the crime - despite the fact that the two had yet to appear in court to face any charge and speak for themselves. Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said police would not dare catch the wrong person . The bodies of Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were found on Sairee beach on the southern island of Koh Tao . But their lawyer claimed their confessions and re-enactment were made under duress. They have now reportedly retracted their confessions, amid allegations of torture used against them. Yesterday, the country's Prime Minister urged critics to allow investigators to 'do their work'. 'I would like the media to stop speculation and let investigators do their work,' Prayuth told reporters after landing back in Bangkok following a two-day visit to Myanmar. 'We must build foreign confidence and make Britain and other foreign nations understand. They might be a little surprised why the criminals were caught so quickly. I myself was excited. 'I want all Thais to stop and think that authorities have procedures in place. Nobody would dare catch the wrong person because this is a case of big international interest.' Police said the arrested men had confessed to the crime - despite the fact that the two had yet to appear in court to face any charge and speak for themselves . Around 10 protesters gathered in front of City Hall in Myanmar's capital Yangon on Friday during Prayuth's visit to the city calling for a fair trial. Rights activist Nay Myo Zin said: 'I would like to urge our government to put pressure (on Thailand) and get help from the international community so that the real story can be found out.' The suspects' lawyer, Aung Myo Thant, has called the case a 'set-up'. He was not available for comment. The inquiry has been dogged from the outset by contradictory statements by officials. Police were widely accused of bungling the investigation, including chasing the wrong leads and failing to seal off the crime scene quickly enough. Pressure grew for them to solve the crime quickly. Officers also came under intense criticism amid claims that they had allowed the crime scene to be compromised by preventing people from walking all over it. They have also been accused of mishandling DNA testing and of torturing friends of the arrested men. Because of what many are saying is police inefficiency - criticisms that appear to be supported now by prosecutors saying that the case has holes in it - fears are growing that the real killers might still be at large on the popular holiday island. Koh Tao is now enjoying a surge in tourism, with most of its hotels full, following the widespread belief that the island was safe following the arrest of the Burmese men. Myanmar President Thein Sein urged the Thai Prime Minister to offer the suspects as much protection as possible. 'The entire people, the media and the civic society in this country are watching this issue very attentively,' Thein Sein said, according to an official in the president's office. 'I would like to ask for justice and fairness in handling this case. It is also concerned with our bilateral relations. Of course they should be liable to punishment if they are really guilty, but the trial should be based on fairness and justice.' Responding to Thein Sein, Prayuth said: 'They are not the culprits yet. We will handle this case with special attention, very fairly, so that we can win the trust of Myanmar people and the international community.' Director-general of the Central Institute of Forensic Science, Khunying Porntip Rojanasunan, questioned methodology used in the case. 'The weak point (in the investigation) is that police do not understand that the case requires a forensic pathologist,' she was quoted as saying by the Bangkok Post English-language paper. Police have strongly denied allegations of abuse during the investigation and have stressed the importance of DNA evidence in the case. DNA found on Witheridge matched samples taken from the two men, police said.","Prosecution office for Koh Tai island said 300-page report lacked evidence .

"North Korean Leader Kim Jong-Un has made his first public appearance in five weeks, ending a prolonged absence that fuelled speculation about his health and control over the country. The country's official news agency said Kim ‘gave field guidance’ yesterday at the newly-built Wisong Scientists Residential District, adding that he had also visited the newly built Natural Energy Institute of the State Academy of Sciences earlier in the day. The mystery over Kim’s whereabouts for the past five weeks has deepened as a surprise new claim emerged suggesting he was receiving drastic weight loss treatment in China. A source told the Daily Mail that the 31-year-old had spent the past few weeks in a Beijing hospital having his stomach tied, or ‘banded’, to help him fight his weight gain.

Kim had last been seen in the state media five weeks ago at a concert on September 3, and he missed several high-profile events that he normally attends. An official documentary released late last month then made a single reference to Kim's ‘discomfort’ and showed video footage from August of him badly overweight and limping. Now a reputable source, who has connections with intelligence agencies in the West, said Kim’s no-show at the recent 69th anniversary celebrations of the ruling Korean Workers’ Party was due to his recovery in a Chinese hospital having earlier undergone a gastric band operation .

Kim has been treated in recent weeks for sprains or fractures, to his ankles - a problem that developed after he injured a leg while joining troops in a military exercise in August . At the tour of the residential district, Kim praised the North's scientists as ‘patriots who are devoting all their lives to building a rich and powerful nation, convinced that though there is no frontier in science, they have a socialist motherland and are under the care of the mother party.’ No fan of the limelight in his later years: Kim's late father, Kim Jong-Il (above), would disappear at times .

"If you are partial to a sneaky spot of e-tail therapy during office hours, you might be relieved to hear you are not alone. A new survey has revealed that the average British worker spends the equivalent of nine days a year shopping on their work computer. New handbag or more paperwork? Many find the allure of a quick online shop is just too tempting to resist. Over the course of the year, workers rack up almost £1,400 in bills during their working hours - around the amount the average Brit earns after tax each month. Control your shopping excitement: 36 per cent say they have been caught shopping at work by their boss and 12 per cent have been given an formal warning about their habit . The study of 2,000 workers, commissioned by cashback and reward site Quidco.com, found employees not only buy new clothes but even booking the occasional holiday during working hours. Others admit to splashing their cash on birthday presents, household appliances and regularly paying their bills while sitting at their desk. It also emerged almost half of workers are planning to spend the equivalent of two working days between now and December 25th doing their Christmas shopping while in the office. Two thirds of the workers polled regularly shop or browse online during their working hours, with 16 per cent admitting to doing it 'all the time'. the research found that  workers will spend around 35 minutes a day shopping online in the run up to Christmas . In fact, the average worker spends 18 minutes of each working day - an hour and a half a week - spending their wages instead of earning them. Over the course of a working year, that amounts to the equivalent of nine eight-hour long days. And it doesn't come cheap, with workers splashing out on goods worth an average of £28.88 each week from their office desk - more than £100 a month or £1,386 over a year. For 46 per cent of employees, there are times they spend so much during work time, they effectively cancel out their earnings. The study also revealed that seven in ten immediately log on to have a browse or shop online whenever they are a little quiet at work. Over the course of the year, workers rack up almost £1,400 in bills during their office hours . And 44 per cent start browsing as soon as they switch their computer on in the mornings, with half of workers opening up their favourite shopping site as soon as their boss's back is turned. Thirty-eight per cent even admitted to having days where they have spent most - or even all - of their time shopping instead of working. Boredom is the main reason for hitting the online shops during work time, with another 25 per cent claiming it's the only chance they get to do it. But 15 per cent admit they simply don't want to have to do their work. It doesn't always work out for some though, with 36 per cent saying they have been caught shopping at work by their boss. While most got away with a little comment, more than a third of those were pulled into a meeting to discuss their misuse of company time, while 12 per cent were given a formal warning. 1.

Researchers also found that of the 85 per cent of workers who are planning to do at least some of their Christmas shopping online this year, 53 per cent admit they will do so while at work - around 35 minutes a day. And with the average worker planning to start their Christmas shopping on November 15th, that means a total of almost 15 hours - around two working days - will be spent looking for gifts in the run-up to December 25th. A spokesperson for Quidco.com said: 'When you spend the majority of your working day sat at the computer, the temptation to have a quick browse is always there. 'When you are going through a quiet period at work, or perhaps have a task which you are putting off completing, the thought of having a little look at your favourite shopping website can be much more appealing. 'But while many bosses may be happy to let their employees shop online during their lunch hour, they may be a little concerned to see how much of the time they pay their workers for is being used for tasks which aren't strictly work-related. 'And with the Christmas shopping period about to start, managers can expect their workers to be spending even more time browsing or buying while at work than usual.' : .","Office workers spend average £1,400 during  working hours every year .

"If you want to join the latest celebrity selfie trend, not only can you go make-up free, you can have messy hair too because nobody will be looking at your face. This season, the celebrity selfie is all about the nails. In the last few weeks everyone from Beyonce, Lily Allen, Mel B, Jessie J, Kim Kardashian and Nicole Scherzinger has posted a 'nailfie'. Some star talons are spectacularly bejeweled but the big trend among the nailfie posters is the nude look. Scroll down for video .

Mel B posted her eye-catching manicure ahead of Saturday night's X Factor and managed to straddle both styles by jazzing up her nude manicure with a bit of bling.

"This image of Keith Richards looks so real, it's hard to believe it's not the man himself starring out from that well-weathered face. But in fact, underneath those bushy eyebrows and wrinkles is the pretty face of Italian portrait painter and makeup artist Lucia Pittalis. This incredible transformation and others like it were created by 43-year-old Lucia using makeup alone - no prosthetics, no camera tricks, just intricate makeup application. Lucia Pitallis (left AND right): The makeup artist as herself and in the guise of Keith Richards . Behind these faces of Breaking Bad's Walter White lies Italian makeup artist Lucia Pittalis, . The first time Lucia decided to mix her talents as a portrait painter and makeup artist was on Halloween when she transformed herself into Lemmy from Motorhead. 'My friends went mad for it in my pictures and outside on Halloween night. It was just a bit of fun with friends,' the Italian tells the MailOnline. Since then, Lucia has  transformed herself into stars including Iggy Pop, Marlon Brando and Keith Richards - each one as realistic as the next. The making of Rambo: Lucia transforms her face into that of Sylvester Stallone, cheekbones and all . Now you see her, now you don't: Lucia starts by drawing on wrinkles as she transforms herself into Iggy Pop . Sunken eyes, bruises and stubble: Lucia manages to perfectly capture Sylvester Stallone as Rocky . Why has she chosen these particular famous faces? 'Because I love them,' she says. 'And I follow their movies and their music.' Now an avid Instagramer, Lucia studied art for two years before training to become a makeup artist, so this facial art is the magnificent mash-up of those two talents. Each creation takes around three hours to complete - although some more tricky characters, like Sylvester Stallone, have taken up to five. Lucia's incredible metamorphosis from pretty bruntte to scary mafia boss, Marlon Brando's Don Corleone . 'I watch and study the character's photos and videos and try to catch their expression as much as I can while watching myself in the mirror. Then I start with make up,' explains the artist. Her magic ingredient? An Italian product called IndioColor sticks. The 43-year-old says when she's been out on the street wearing her makeup disguises the reaction of passers by has been 'extremely funny'. 'Sometimes people are in total amazement,' she adds.

"Two Burmese men have now confessed to murdering British backpackers Hannah Witheride and David Miller on the island of Koh Tao, according to police. Officers arrested three men who were pictured riding a moped away from the scene of the killings on September 14. Two have admitted their guilt, but the third still denies any involvement. It is not known which of the men in the CCTV image have confessed. After the first admission of guilt, a credible source within the police ranks on 'murder island'  told MailOnline that he had been called by a senior officer who said: 'We have a confession. We have a suspect in custody. We are very confident we have our man.' Scroll down for video . The Burmese bar worker who allegedly confessed to the murders of British backpackers Hannah Witheridge and David Miller has been caught on CCTV riding a moped on Koh Tao on the night of the killing. It is not known which of the three he is . Investigation: One of the suspects is led in handcuffs by police . The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on Koh Tao on September 15 . Major General Kiattipong Khawsamang, who is leading the investigation, has since confirmed that another of the migrant workers has also confessed. Are three suspects are being held in the city of Surat Thani, the closest mainland metropolis to the central Gulf Coast islands. Officers previously said they will take the suspects back to Koh Tao for a reenactment of the crime, before those who have pleaded guilty are returned to jail awaiting court. News of the first confession came through a short statement from Deputy Police Commissioner General Jakthip Chaijinda who said the arrested man was called Win, a bar worker on Koh Tao, who was arrested in Surat Sani. The announcement came before the man's DNA could be confirmed as a match with DNA found on the body of 23-year-old Miss Witherage from Great Yarmouth. But the police source told the Mail last night: 'We are expecting the DNA results by late today or on Friday at the latest. Everyone is very confident.' According to the Nation newspaper, quoting sources, Win told police that he saw 'the foreigners having sex so he made the attack with a plan to rape the woman.' However, there appears to be a discrepancy in that statement as there is no evidence that Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller were walking on the beach together and stopped near the guest house where they were both staying for a sexual encounter in the early hours of the morning. The last known picture of the pair, together with a group at the sports bar called Choppers - they also went to the AC bar where a group of amateur footballers were celebrating the end of a tournament . And police have said previously that no trace of Mr Miller's DNA had been found on Miss Witheridge. But they have said that DNA from two Asian men had been recovered from her. Last week, in the wake of heavy criticism over the investigation of the murders, police sought to allay fears that the killers had long escaped and said they were 'confident' that a significant breakthrough was on the horizon. Police have taken more than 200 DNA samples from men living and working in the area of the crime scene - most of them being migrant workers from Burma. But there have been no matches so far with the victims. Police have offered a reward of 700,000 baht - roughly £13,300 - for information which leads to the arrests of the culprits. Yesterday Thai police were accused of beating up a taxi driver who refused to give false evidence about a football team suspected of being involved in the killings. Pornprasit Sukdam claims he was offered the full 700,000 baht reward if he agreed to be a fake witness to events leading up to the deaths, but says officers attacked him when he said no. He said he complained to the district chief Kobchai Saowalak and asked for protection over fears of another attack after the officers said they intended to question him again on Tuesday. Dressed in a pink top and white skirt, Hannah Witheridge looked happy and relaxed as she strolled past fruit stands and in and out of bars on the night before her murder . Investigating officers have said they believe sexual jealousy was the motive behind the murder of Miss Witheridge, who hails from Great Yarmouth, in the early hours of September 15. A condom has recently been recovered from the crime scene which has the young woman's DNA on its outer skin. Two different semen samples collected from Ms Witheridge's body form the remainder of the DNA evidence, Thai police told the Bangkok Post. 'The discovery of the condom is an important piece of evidence,' said provincial police commander General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang said earlier this week. 'Solving this crime is going to come down to DNA matches and we are working hard on this.' Police believe  Mr Miller, who lived in Jersey, was killed when he went to his recently-met friend's aid after finding in trouble near a group of boulders on the beach. Around 150 additional police officers have posted to Koh Tao to assist the murder investigation. The probe was launched after cleaners found the bodies of Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller on a beach on 15 September. Both victims suffered severe head injuries at the hands of their killers, and a bloodied garden hoe was found nearby.","Police claim two men have admitted killing backpackers on Koh Tao island .

"A man who helped rescue  surfer Sean Pollard after a shark tore off his hand and part of his other arm says the bravest thing he has ever seen is the injured 23-year-old swimming to safety. Mr Pollard is in a critical condition in a Perth hospital after having one arm severed below the elbow and the other hand torn off, as well as suffering leg injuries. A couple of witnesses came forward on Friday and recalled how they saw the Bunbury local stumble through the shallows towards his horrified girlfriend before collapsing on the beach. His girlfriend Claire Oakford has also described the terrifying moment her partner came out of the surf as she lay on the sand at Kelpids Beach, an isolated area at Wylie Bay near the West Australian town of Esperance, about 11am Thursday. Scroll down for video . Shark victim Sean Pollard, 23, pictured with his girlfriend Claire Oakford, who was reportedly on the beach when the attack happened . Mr Pollard lost parts of both arms in the attack near Esperance, Western Australia . Witness Ross Tamlin was surfing about 400m away from Mr Pollard and said they were the only ones that far out. 'I just heard this almighty scream and I just felt very uneasy by it, and knowing of the shark sightings of recent times out there, I quickly got out of the water,' he told reporters in Esperance on Friday. Mr Tamlin said he and another man drove to the spot and saw Mr Pollard lying on his back in the water. Dean Gaebler, who helped rescue Mr Pollard, described the moment he saw the injured surfer. 'He (Mr Pollard) stood up and fell back on his back. When I got out to him he was just lying on his back, eyes shut,' Mr Gaebler told Perth Now. Two men dragged Mr Pollard ashore and Mr Tamlin made the emergency phone call. A man known as Robbie said he had been planning to give his nephew a surfing lesson when Mr Pollard collapsed about 20 metres out and saw him being dragged ashore. 'He's obviously swum about 100 metres with those injuries ... it was probably the bravest thing I've ever seen,' he told Fairfax radio. Robbie said an off-duty paramedic at the beach saved Mr Pollard's life. The paramedic, Kylie Rothnie, attached a tourniquet to his limbs and wrapped them in towels, stemming the flow of blood until an ambulance arrived. 'Two guys raced out and grabbed him,' Robbie said. 'There was a paramedic by them. I think her husband was there surfing. She probably saved his life. 'You couldn't give her enough props.' Ms Rothnie told Perth Now that Mr Pollard was a brave man. 'He was conscious the whole time,' she said. 'He was so brave through the whole thing.' Mr Tamlin, who often visits the beach, said it was a 'remarkable effort' for Mr Pollard to swim that far to safety by himself. 'It was the most horrific thing you have ever seen in your life,' he told Perth Now. 'For that (attack) to happen at our local break's pretty upsetting and pretty daunting.' Robbie drove Mr Pollard to meet the ambulance and said the injured man remained conscious while his partner talked to him, despite losing a lot of blood. Mr Pollard, a dedicated surfer, pictured dropping in to big wave in Indonesia . Ms Oakford  told a friend - Kurd Cadman - before flying out to Perth on Thursday about the terrifying ordeal she witnessed. Mr Cadman  said she had been lying on the beach enjoying the couple's Esperance holiday when she quickly realised something was horribly wrong as he emerged from the surf. She rushed to his side while several others, including an off-duty paramedic, attended to his wounds. An Esperance police officer spoke to Ms Oakford from her partner's hospital bed on Friday morning, where he said the pair  were grateful to everyone who helped. Senior Sergeant Richard Moore said the couple have a positive outlook on the future. He added that Mr Pollard was awake and his partner's family was flying to WA from Tasmania. 'He is in a stable condition in the trauma ward at Royal Perth Hospital,' Senior Sergeant Richard Moore told The West Australian. 'He has a very positive attitude and he and his partner Claire have thanked the community and the emergency services for their assistance yesterday.' The Esperance community has also started fundraising to help with Mr Pollard's recovery with collection tins at the Shire's administration and leisure centres. The Lions Club will arrange for the money to be given to Mr Pollard after October 17. Officials caught two great white sharks in the hours after the attack and were preparing to cut them open to try to determine if one - or both - of them was responsible for the attack. Mr Pollard was flown to Perth by the Royal Flying Doctor Service within hours of the attack on Thursday . Mr Pollard's football club, the South Bunbury Football Club, paid tribute to him in a Facebook post and pledged their support for his family. The club wrote on its Facebook on Thursday afternoon: 'Today a young man was attacked by a shark in Esperance. Unfortunately the young man is one of our own in Sean Pollard.' 'Our thoughts are with Polly and his family from everyone at South Bunbury Football Club. We are with you all the way mate,' the post continued. The club is playing in its grand final this weekend and Mr Kelly said there was 'no doubt' the club would rally around Mr Pollard. Bunbury deputy mayor Brendan Kelly - himself a surfer - said '99.9 per cent' of patrolled or popular beaches along the south east coastline were safe, however isolated surf spots are a haven for sharks. 'There's a term over here called ""sharky"",' he said. 'If the water looks dark, the sky is grey and overcast, and there is generally good surf, then that's when there is going to be sharks about.' He said surfers know the risks and people should take the same precautions in WA surf as people visiting 'billabongs in Northern Territory would with crocodiles'. 'Most of the surfers I know acknowledge that.' Incident: The attack occurred in scenic Wylie Bay, on Western Australia's south coast . Wylie Bay is located around 8km east of Esperance, on WA's south coast . Attack: WA Police said the man came under attack by a shark near Esperance . The earliest recorded Australian shark attack was on an indigenous female (fatal) on the NSW north coast in 1791. * NSW - 203 attacks, 48 fatal, last fatality Byron Bay 2014 . * QLD - 208 attacks, 67 fatal, last fatality Palm Island 2011 . * WA - 88 attacks*, 19 fatal, last fatality Dawesville Cut 2014 . * SA - 44 attacks, 17 fatal, last fatality Coffin Bay 2011 . * VIC - 33 attacks, 4 fatal, last fatality Mornington Peninsula 1987 . * TAS - 11 attacks, 2 fatal, last fatality Tenth Island 1993 . * NT - 11 attacks, 2 fatal, last fatality Bathurst Island 1938 . TOTAL - 599 cases, 159 fatal . *This list includes the attack on October 2 near Esperance in Western Australia . Source: AAP, Taronga Conservation Society websit . WA Premier Colin Barnett said it was necessary to kill the two white pointers because they posed an imminent threat to public safety. 'The threat is there and sadly (Thursday) just demonstrated how likely a shark attack can happen,' Mr Barnett said. 'Perth beaches are probably as safe as we can reasonably make them (but) the south west and the southern coastline is a different matter.' The state's Fisheries Department responded to the attack by catching and killing two white pointers on drumlines - one measuring up to 4.5 metres and the other three metres. It was the first time white pointers - a protected species - had been killed by WA officials. Fisheries shark response unit manager Lisa Clack defended the move amid reports Mr Pollard might have been mauled by two bronze whalers, saying it was 'more likely' a white pointer was responsible. 'Advice from our shark scientists indicated that basically given the nature of the injuries and the location it occurred, it's not likely that the species was a bronze whaler,' she told Fairfax radio. Ms Clack said the two captured sharks would be transported to Perth and dissected and examined, although sharks often disgorge stomach contents so their role might never be confirmed. Drumlines have not been redeployed but beaches from Wylie Bay to Cape Le Grand remain closed. It is believed the girlfriend of Sean Pollard is by his side at hospital . A spokeswoman for the WA Department of Fisheries said a white shark has been caught near Wylie Bay, at Kelpids Beach, about six kilometres from Esperance .

"Made with champagne and 23-carat gold, the world's most expensive loaf costs a lot of dough. At a whopping £75 the royal bloomer has been made by Robert Didier at his Orchard Pigs bakery in Wrexham, North Wales. Robert uses only the finest ingredients in his luxurious recipe replacing some of the water used in traditional sourdough breads with champagne. Robert Didier made the show-stopping loaf at his Orchard Pigs bakery in Wrexham, North Wales . The previous record is believed to have been £30 so Robert's loaf - which uses 23-carat gold in the dough and as decoration - smashes that figure. Robert said: 'We wanted to create something unique and luxurious and the royal bloomer certainly does that.' He adds: 'We use only the finest ingredients - so that's Welsh spring water and sea salt and we replace some of the water with champagne. 'The champagne gives the bread a delicious taste but you don't get much flavour from the gold flakes. 'They give the inside of the loaf a real sparkle and look fantastic on the top.' Robert, who trained with legendary chef Raymond Blanc, got the idea after his previous attempt fell agonisingly short. Not your average loaf: The royal bloomer is made with champagne and 23-carat gold . At three-foot-long, the royal bloomer is three times the length and three times more expensive than his previous attempt. The chef said: 'We thought we'd broken the record a few months ago with our initial attempt. 'But at £25, we were a few quid short. 'We only make these loaves once a month and they are reserved for special occasions. 'It's gained a lot of interest and we're even shipped one over to New York for an event over there - its having to go special delivery.' The royal bloomer was unveiled at the Hamper Llangollen food festival in the Dee Valley, North Wales, over the weekend.","Made by Robert Didier at his Orchard Pigs bakery in Wrexham, North Wales .

"Understatement is not a concept that famed fashion designer Valentino Garavani is familiar with, which is what makes these newly released images inside the designer's private spaces such a fantastical feast for the eyes. Crystal chandeliers, lavish tableware, glitzy objets d'art and plenty of porcelain fuse together to create the most opulent of settings. The images form part of a new book, At the Emperor's Table, a stunning visual and written account of Valentino's world and entertaining style. The images give a glimpse inside the iconic designer's French chateau, Swiss ski chalet, luxury yacht as well as his London apartment. A table setting at the designer's Chateau de Wideville outside Paris: A painted tôle and porcelain eighteen-branch chandelier, by Meissen, hangs above the table. Each setting has its own silver-gilt salt throne . As fashion editor and former American Vogue editor-at-large  André Leon Talley writes in the book's introduction, 'Valentino Garavani designs his luncheons and dinners, in all of his homes, the way he has created crescendos and allegros vivace throughout his forty-plus-year career as one of the greatest haute couture designers and high-fashion leaders in the world.' Beauty and entertaining have long been passions of Valentino. 'I am in love with beauty,' he admits in the book's opening. 'I have always loved beautiful objects.' Though Talley, previously fashion editor of US Vogue and now its editor-at-large, writes that despite the supremely sumptuous settings, Valentino's excellence as a host is defined by the warmth he creates for his guests. The crown jewel of Valentino's residential repertoire is the Chateau de Wideville, a historic chateau outside of Paris . Afternoon tea set in the garden in  Chateau de Wideville, the designer's favourite residence . Porcelain dinner plates on a beautifully styled table (left) and up-close (right) 'When you enter his world, you enter the world of luxury; you enter a rare and opulent, yet warm space,' says Talley. Talking of his own experience as Valentino's guest he writes, that the atmosphere evokes 'the joy of sharing, and the joy of delivering a magnificent dining experience in a setting of wonder and originality; sharing with family, friends and guests; sharing good conversation that is quite often animated; and sharing beautiful flowers, especially from Valentino's own gardens.' Photographed by renowned Italian photographer Oberto Gili, the book, published by Assouline, is organized by residence, and invites the reader to enjoy various table settings and recipes specific to each home.

'I love sharing the things in my life with my friends,' Valentino says. Among all of these luxurious homes, the crown jewel of Valentino's residential repertoire is the Chateau de Wideville, a historic chateau outside of Paris that is admittedly Valentino's favorite. There, meals inspired by Italian home cooking, such as risotto Milanese, are presented amongst his collection of rare Meissen swans. The new book by that showcases Valentino's entertaining style . 'I love antique china sets, like Meissen, Russian, or from P.K. Selesia, a German company from the 1930s' he states. Though regardless of residence or number of guests, you won't catch Valentino using the cheap stuff. 'I am very often alone and enjoying my houses,' Valentino says. 'Entertaining thirty or one is the same; the food has to be on a beautiful plate.' Valentino  founded his eponymous fashion house in Rome in the late 1950s and has since established an illustrious career designing for the world's most glamorous women, from royalty to Hollywood icons, including Jackie O, Elizabeth Taylor and modern-day muses like Gwyneth Paltrow and Anne Hathaway. From his start designing dresses, Valentino and long-time business partner Giancarlo Giammetti built the Valentino brand into an international empire, now one of the most iconic fashion brands in the world. Though Valentino retired from fashion in 2008, his influence on fashion is still very much present.

"Short people are up to 50 per cent more likely to die from dementia than the tallest, it is claimed. And men are most at risk, according to a study. Being short does not cause dementia, say the experts, but it may be a marker for poor nutrition in childhood or other early life factors that affect growth. Scroll down for video . Men who are shorter than 5ft 6ins are 50 per cent more likely to die of dementia than those taller than 5ft 10ins, a new study has found. File picture . Such factors are already linked to a higher risk of heart disease among shorter people. ‘We found shorter adult height was associated with an increased risk of subsequent dementia death and that this association was stronger in men,’ said Dr Tom Russ, who led the study. Researchers from the Alzheimer Scotland Dementia Research Centre at Edinburgh University analysed data from 18 studies involving almost 182,000 people between 1994 and 2008. The height of participants was measured and other information, including social status and health history, collected. Of 17,553 deaths during an average follow-up period of ten years, 1,093 were from dementia. The study found the risk of dying from dementia was 50 per cent higher among the shortest men compared with the tallest. For every 2.87in decrease in height from the average 5ft 6ins for men, a person was 26 per cent more likely to die from the condition . Among women, the risk of dying from dementia was 35 per cent higher among the shortest. There was a 13 per cent increase in risk for each 2.5in reduction in height . There was a 24 per cent increase in risk for every three inches of reduced height among those in the studies. Among women, the risk of dying from dementia was 35 per cent higher among the shortest. There was a 13 per cent increase in risk for each 2.5in reduction in height. Dr Russ, of the University of Edinburgh’s College of Medicine & Veterinary Medicine, said it was the biggest study of its type. Senior author, Dr David Batty, of the Department of Epidemiology & Public Health at University College London, added: ‘Short height in itself of course does not “cause” dementia. Rather, height captures a number of early life factors, including early-life illness, adversity, poor nutrition, and psychosocial stress, and so allows us to examine the effect of these on dementia more closely.’ Tim Frayling, professor of human genetics, University of Exeter Medical School, said: ‘The authors are not claiming that height directly alters risk of dementia. They are claiming something more subtle and less controversial – that height is a marker of early life factors which predict death from dementia.’","Being vertically challenged increases risk of dementia in men and women .
Scientists at Edinburgh University found results more pronounced for men .
Findings show lack of inches does not cause dementia .
But it could be an indicator of poor nutrition, stress or other hardships .
For every 2.87in decrease in height from the average 5ft 6ins for men, a person was 26 per cent more likely to die from the condition .
For women a 2.68in drop from the average height of 5ft 3ins was linked to a 10 per cent increase in dementia mortality risk ."
"A couple who knew each other only as penpals in their early teens were reunited after 14 years via OkCupid, and last weekend, they were married. Piper Goodeve, now 35, and Gabriel Vaughan, 36, started exchanging letters at the suggestion of mutual friends in 1994, when Piper was 14 and living in New Hampshire and Gabriel was 15 and living in Massachusetts. They were both in relationships at the time, only met in person once, but bonded over their shared acting ambitions. After four years of writing to and fro, the letters stopped. Unbeknownst to them, however, they spent the next 14 years living in parallel; both studied acting in London and then ended up living a mere three blocks from one another in Brooklyn, New York. Scroll down for video . Digital love: Gabriel Vaughan (left) and Piper Goodeve (right) knew each other only as penpals in their early teens, and were reunited after 14 years of silence via OkCupid. Last weekend, they were married (pictured) As a teen, Piper and Gabriel shared a passion for Shakespeare and a dream to one day be actors, so their friends put them in touch - as was customary before the age of the internet - via pen and paper. 'It was like receiving a letter from a kindred spirit who...just knew what she wanted to do,' Gabriel told The Huffington Post. 'So we could talk the same language right out of the gate and that was really rare.' The pair enjoyed one brief meeting when Piper went to see Gabriel in a play, The Tempest, at a Massachusetts theater, but four years and some-50 letters later, the pair fell out of touch and went their separate ways. Or so they thought. In fact, both studied acting in London only a year apart, then moved to Brooklyn, New York, where they lived a few blocks apart, worked as actors and audiobook narrators, and even shared the same voiceover agent. The passage of time: Piper, now 35, and Gabriel, 36, started exchanging letters at the suggestion of mutual friends in 1994, when Piper was 14  Gabriel was 15. Pictured, the couple now . Precious: They were both in relationships at the time, only met in person once, but bonded over their shared acting ambitions. Pictured, Piper's letters, which Gabriel kept for 14 years . 'We took the same subway every day,' Piper says. 'I would get onto the front of the subway and he would get onto the back. So we never met.' In 2011, Piper and Gabriel both happened to join OkCupid, Piper reluctantly, and at the urging of her friends. 'This isn't my story,' she recalls thinking to herself. 'This isn't how I'm going to meet the guy I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. I just don't think it's how it's supposed to happen to me.' When Gabriel came across Piper's profile and saw they had a 94per cent match, he was intrigued, but didn't recognize her or her cryptic screen name. Disbelief: Piper and Gabriel were reunited on OkCupid in 2011, when they hit a 94per cent match. Pictured, Piper the night they first re-met, reading her old letters . Joined: The night the couple were reunited in their shared Brooklyn nieghborhood, in June 2011 . Actors: The newlyweds have since discovered they'd shared 'many' mutual friends for years without ever crossing paths. Pictured in 2013, at the Tennessee Shakespeare Co. where they performed in Hamlet together . 'I wrote to her just like, ""Hey, do you want to go on a date?""' he relays. 'And a second later I get a message back and it's like, ""Gabe! It’s Piper! It's your penpal!"" Gabriel's screen name was his real name, and Piper's only way of knowing who he was, since they barely knew each other by face. Both were utterly 'shocked' and 'dumbfounded,' but met a few days later for a casual neighborhood date. That very night, they headed back to Gabriel's apartment, where he quickly rummaged around in the back of his closet and retrieved a purple binder, stamped with 'Piper G,' containing every single one of her letters.

"Today is winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, and to celebrate  thousands of pagans packed the ancient site of Stonehenge. Around 1,500 people gathered at the ancient monument in Wiltshire to watch the sunrise this morning. Winter solstice is an astronomical phenomena which marks the shortest day and longest night of the year. This is caused by the tilt of the Earth’s axis, when the North Pole is tilted furthest from the Sun. Today is the shortest day of the year and to celebrate the Winter Solstice thousands of revellers packed the ancient site of Stonehenge . Tess Reddaway, 17, is one of those celebrating winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, at the ancient site of Stonehenge in Wiltshire . Senior druid King Arthur Pendragon reigned over the event and told the international crowd the event celebrates hope. Officially, Sunday was the shortest day, but the crowds gathered to celebrate this morning's sunrise as the moment the North Pole is tilted furthest from the Sun. The crowd's spirits remained undampened despite the fact heavy cloud blocked out most of the view. Senior druid King Arthur Pendragon told the BBC: 'What we're really here for is to celebrate the fact that the cycle of the world turns, and from now on the days get longer and it's the return of the sun. Revellers are wrapped up warmly as they prepare to celebrate the sunrise during the winter solstice at Stonehenge on Salisbury plain . The crowd were celebrating the sunrise closest to the Winter Solstice, which is the shortest day of the year at the ancient monument . 'It's a time of change and hope is renewed - the same message really from a pagan perspective as from a Christian perspective. 'That's what this season is all about - a message of hope.' Arthur Pendragon, real name John Timothy Rothwell, believes he is the reincarnation of the 5th century King Arthur. Last week English Heritage - which manages the stones near Salisbury in Wiltshire - reported a record number of tourists in the past year. A reveller dressed in rather unusual garb celebrates the sunrise along with around 1,500 others from all over the world . There were some bold fashion choices at the annual event - this man appears to be sporting an animal skin complete with antlers . Two weeks ago the Government announced in its Autumn Statement that it will be investing in a new 2.9km tunnel to remove the A303 from the Stonehenge landscape. English Heritage and National Trust as guardians of Stonehenge and its World Heritage Site, see this announcement as a 'truly momentous decision' in the modern history of one of the most famous places in the world. English Heritage recently announced 1.3 million people had visited the site since the opening of the £27 million visitor centre in December last year - a nine per cent increase on the previous 12 months. Senior druid King Arthur Pendragon (pictured) reigned over the event and told the international crowd the event celebrates hope . Druid, pagans and revellers all attended the event - this man shows off his ceremonial sword, robes and impressive beard . Many different cultures hold holidays, festivals, gatherings rituals on the day of the winter solstice  to celebrate the shortest day of the year . Last week English Heritage, which manages Stonehenge,  reported a record number of tourists in the past year since they opened a new centre . Many cultures hold holidays, festivals, gatherings rituals and other celebrations during winter solstice. According to the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids, the name for winter solstice in Druidry is Alban Arthan, which means 'The Light of Arthur'. On their website they say of the winter solstice: 'At this point the Sun is at its southernmost point almost disappearing beyond the horizon, and the days are at their shortest. 'This was a time of dread for the ancient peoples as they saw the days getting shorter and shorter. 'A great ritual was needed to revert the course of the sun. This was probably calculated by the great circles of stone and burial grounds which are aligned to this festival. 'Sure enough, the next day the Sun began to move higher into the sky, showing that it had been reborn.' Stonehenge is one of the most famous historic sites in the world. It is made up of the remains of a prehistoric ring of standing stones in the middle of a dense complex of Neolithic and Bronze age monuments, including burial mounds. Archaeologists believe it was built sometime between 3,000 BC and 2,000 BC. Stonehenge was a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986 and is legally protected as a scheduled ancient monument. It is managed by English Heritage and the surrounding last is owned by the National Trust.","The winter solstice is an astronomical phenomenon that marks the longest night and the shortest day of the year .

Scene: On September 25, a four-year-old from New Jersey who attended preschool at Yardville Elementary School died. The CDC confirmed Friday night the toddler tested positive to Enterovirus following the death . Tragic: Emily Otrando, a 10-year-old from Cumberland, Rhode Island, died September 22 at Hasbro Children's Hospital. She was infected with EV-D68, but died from a bacterial infection that hit her in tandem with the virus . The CDC said Friday night the New Jersey toddler, who attended Yardville Elementary School in Hamilton, died at home on Thursday September 25. 'Our thoughts remain with the family at this very difficult time,' said Health Commissioner Mary E. O’Dowd, according to NJ.com. 'While the child has tested positive for EV-D68, the cause of death has not yet been determined and it is unclear if EV-D68 played a direct role or was a contributing factor in his death.' The child has not been identified. The virus was also found in three other patients who died in September, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC declined to release any other details about those deaths. The Rhode Island child's death was the result of a bacterial infection, Staphylococcus aureus, that hit the girl in tandem with the virus, Rhode Island officials said in a statement. They called it 'a very rare combination', and stressed that most people who catch the virus experience little more than a runny nose and low-grade fever. The child was in good health before she developed severe breathing problems and her parents called 911, said Dr. Michael Fine, director of the Rhode Island Department of Health. Warning: Children's Hospital Colorado pediatric neurologist Teri Schreiner, MD, speaks during a press conference at the hospital September 30 to update the media on the condition of 10 patients with EV-D68 . Recovering: Melissa Lewis, of Denver, helps her son, Jayden Broadway, 9, as he coughs in his bed at the Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora, Colo. He was treated for the enterovirus 68 and released . She was taken by ambulance to a Providence hospital, where she died. 'Very quickly after they got to the hospital, things became dire,' Fine said at a news conference. This enterovirus germ is not new. It was first identified in 1962 and has caused clusters of illness before. Because it's not routinely tested for, it may have spread widely in previous years without being identified in people who just seemed to have a cold. This year, the virus has gotten more attention because it has been linked to hundreds of severe illnesses. Beginning last month, hospitals in Kansas City, Missouri, and Chicago have received a flood of children with trouble breathing. Some needed oxygen or more extreme care such as a breathing machine. Many, but not all, had asthma before the infection. Germ: Enterovirus EV-D68 is uncommon but not new and causes prominent respiratory symptoms, like a cold but worse. There's no vaccine for EV-D68 . Sick: 13-year-old Will Cornejo is recovering at Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children at Presbyterian/St. Luke's Medical Center in Denver on September 5 from human enterovirus 68 that has come to Colorado . Health officials say they have not detected a recent mutation or other change in the virus that would cause it to become more dangerous. The government says enterovirus 68 has sickenedover 500 people in 42 states and the District of Columbia. Almost all have been children. Health officials are also investigating whether the virus played a role in a cluster of 10 Denver-area children who have suffered muscle weakness and paralysis.","Four-year-old from New Jersey was infected with EV D68 at the time of the toddler's death last week, CDC confirmed Friday .

"On the booze: A dishevelled Gazza openly carries a bottle of gin in the street before his collapse . Looking dazed and occasionally breaking into tears, a frail Paul Gascoigne is led to an ambulance after being found wandering the streets clutching a four-pack of lager and a bottle of gin. The former World Cup hero’s latest downward spiral ended in a hospital near his home in the expensive Sandbanks area of Poole, Dorset, where he woke up yesterday after once more falling spectacularly off the wagon. In the most shocking chapter yet of his long and often very public battle with alcoholism, onlookers had dialled 999 after finding him slumped tearfully against a wall with his head in his hands at around 2.30pm on Thursday. Shortly before the ambulance had whisked him away, at 3.05pm, the former England star was seen calling a friend to plead: ‘I’m in trouble, please can you come and help me?’ Gascoigne, who looks far, far older than his 47 years, was believed last night to be in Poole Hospital. He had been observed drinking in public on several occasions in preceding days, and at lunchtime on Tuesday was videoed by a passer-by in what appeared to be an inebriated state, in central Bournemouth. ‘You could smell the booze on him. He was hanging on me to stay up. He was absolutely battered,’ said an onlooker. When he was taken into care 48 hours later, he appeared to still be wearing the same T-shirt. On his feet were a pair of blue slippers, which he’d worn to walk to an off-licence, where he’d purchased the alcohol and a packet of cigarettes. Gascoigne, who only months ago flexed his biceps while posing for pictures after a visit to the gym, looked weak and malnourished. His hair was unwashed, his skin blotchy, and he seemed barely able to open his eyes. Markedly pale, a gold cross hanging from his neck and tattoos showing on his right arm, he seemed a mere shadow of the man he was even a year or two ago. Comparisons with his athletic physique in his prime are even more shocking. The once muscular legs are painfully thin (there is a small wound on his left shin). The arms that once helped to force him past defenders are now wasted. Compounding his misery, he is feared to be facing homelessness after being told that he must leave his £3 million rented penthouse apartment in the coming weeks. ‘His lease will run out on September 13, and the landlord will not be renewing the contract as he wants the flat back,’ says Christopher Eales, the director of the management firm which runs the exclusive property overlooking Poole Harbour. Neighbours are said to have made many complaints about noise from the flat, where Gascoigne lives alone. The former Spurs and Lazio star’s sister Lindsay said on Facebook yesterday: ‘This illness is so tragic, and there is no cure, and [it] has shown its ugly head again. So in among my heartbreak . . . please leave us alone to grieve and pull together as a family as always to help save a great man.’ But, of course, we’ve been here plenty of times before. Gascoigne was first packed off to rehab . by Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson in 1998, having been found . unconscious after drinking 32 shots of whisky. His life since has been . an ongoing struggle with drink, drugs and mental health issues. Helping hand: The confused star is gently guided to a waiting ambulance by a policeman . For the past four years, Gascoigne has been living in Poole, where he is an occasional patient at nearby Bournemouth’s rehabilitation centre, The Providence Project. But in between stays there, his condition has appeared to spiral out of control. Months ago, he had to leave another rented apartment in Sandbanks after a series of disturbances. Friends have frequently attempted to rally round. Last year, his former team-mate Gary Lineker clubbed together with DJ Chris Evans and ex-England cricketer Ronnie Irani to pay for him to stay at an Arizona clinic. Troubled: Paul Gascoigne's tormet is etched into his face making him look older than 47 years . ‘I can honestly say we’ve supported him over the years,’ said Lineker at the Edinburgh TV festival yesterday. ‘Lots of people have — Tottenham have, his friends have. And I just wish him well.’ But, he added, responsibility for any future recovery ‘has ultimately got to come from Paul’. A close friend says: ‘Paul’s not just an alcoholic. He’s got OCD, ADHD, and Tourette’s Syndrome. He’s bulimic, anorexic, he’s an obsessive exerciser. As long as he had football, the structure of a club and the public adulation, his conditions were manageable. But since his career finished there’s been a hole he really can’t fill.’ Hunter Davies, who co-wrote Gascoigne’s 2004 autobiography, agrees. ‘Football saved Paul from himself. He was ill long before it came along, and for those 20 years, it helped him to manage those illnesses. Drink certainly didn’t ruin his career like it did for George Best. He was still playing in the Premier League in his 30s. He won 57 caps. But when the football ended, things spiralled. ‘He doesn’t even like alcohol. He hates the taste of it,’ adds Davies. ‘I’ve been with him when he’s poured it into flower pots, because he finds it so revolting. But then he will get depressed, and just want to get obliterated.’ Since leaving the game, Gascoigne has made a living on the back of his enduring fame. A friend says: ‘He has always done his best to provide for Sheryl and the children.’ Sheryl, whom he divorced in 1999, is the mother of his son Regan and step-children Bianca and Mason. Bianca yesterday tweeted to well-wishers: ‘Thank you for your kind words.’ In recent months, however, there have been signs that Gascoigne has fallen increasingly upon hard times. Superstar: Former Spurs and Lazio star Gazza, playing for England in 1990 . Neighbours yesterday claimed he has even resorted to charging fans to take ‘selfie’ photographs with him on their mobile phones. ‘I’ve seen Gazza ask for a fiver for a selfie from some tourists,’ said one. Today, more than a decade after quitting football, most of the diminishing circle of people he feels able to trust come from within the game. One is Harry Redknapp, the QPR manager who lives a corner kick from Gascoigne’s flat. He offered yesterday to give him a coaching role. ‘He could do some coaching with the kids, I would love it if he would. ‘I love Gazza, he has got a heart of gold,’ he added. ‘Everyone has tried to help him, but the only person who can help him now is himself.’ Additional reporting by Ryan Kisiel and Larisa Brown .","Gazza's latest downward spiral ended in hospital near his home in Dorset .

"Citroen C4 Cactus Flair 1.6 Blue HDi 100 . Price as driven: £20,325 . GOOD . Citroen's perky new motor will be too late for buyers to have the cachet of being seen with a '64' plate on Monday, but when it does becomes available in October, I reckon the C4 Cactus will bloom. This French back-to-basics family car combines simplicity and efficiency with practicality, low ownership costs and quirky looks. Door grips and fabric trim are styled in the manner of traditional suitcases. The Citroen Cactus Flair 1.6 Blue HDi accelerates to 62mph in 10.7 seconds and has a top speed of 114mph . A nimble ride on its 17-in alloy wheels, it has a tight turning circle and electric power steering which makes parking easy. Not the fastest kid off the blocks, but its willing 1.6 litre HDi four-cylinder in-line turbodiesel engine is enough for the family shop or a run up the M1. Accelerates from rest to 62mph in 10.7 seconds and has a top speed of 114mph. Citroen claims an average 83.1 mpg, rising to more than 88mpg when cruising. The distinctive 'Airbumps' — a series of blister panels — are designed to absorb minor side impacts such as a ding from a shopping trolley. The world's first passenger airbag in the roof means more storage in the dashboard. Prices from £12,990 for the 1.2 litre PureTech 75 manual up to £18,190 for the 1.6 litre e-HDi 92 ETG6. Upmarket, hi-tech, clutter-free dashboard, with digital controls grouped around a single large 7-in touch screen. BAD . For a back-to-basics car, £20k might seem steep. But this did include a lot of extra options. The £17,990 base price of the Flair 1.6 Blue HDi 100 was bumped up by a trim pack at £695, sunroof (£395), city park pack (£325), emergency and assistance system (£250) and other refinements. Something of a blind spot looking left and to the back from the driver's seat — the direction from which 'under-cutting' cyclists will be coming. Also the passenger seat slightly obscures the view out towards the rear left-hand side window. Some of the plastics feel light and cheap — the handbrake in particular.","Door grips and fabric trim are styled in the manner of traditional suitcases .

"He stepped out of a chauffeur-driven Range Rover, trotted up a flight of steps, slapped a circle of newly-installed Ukip MEPs firmly on the back, and asked the night’s big question: ‘Right then, where’s the bar?’ Nigel Farage breezed into Southampton’s historic Guildhall to meet the supporters who have devoted recent months to engineering a stunning election victory that has re-drawn Britain’s political map. First, though, he had to navigate his way through a sea of newspaper and TV crews who had descended from across Europe, blocking the entrance to the hall where votes had just been tallied. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage, at the South East count in Southampton, hailed his party's victory as the most extraordinary result in British politics for 100 years . ‘How happy are you?’ asked a sharp-elbowed German TV presenter, thrusting a microphone into his mouth. ‘I’ll be very happy,’ Farage replied, ‘once this part of the night is all over, and I can get to our private party.’ But first: business. Three nights after he declared a ‘political earthquake’ and announced that ‘the Ukip fox is in Westminster’s hen house’, Farage was once more eager to sing the praises of what he likes to call his ‘people’s army’. ‘We formed our people’s army to take on the establishment, and it looks like we’ve won a great  victory,’ he said. ‘But we’re getting used to this. And you know what? I quite like it!’ There was indeed a practised air to the way Farage celebrated his success. He had begun the evening at what an aide described as a ‘modest but serviceable’ local hotel, dining on steak sandwich topped with a healthy dollop of mustard ‘English, not French’. The Ukip leader’s German wife, Kirsten, was then dispatched to the count early, clutching a bag bursting with miniature bottles of pink champagne to hand to supporters. By the time Farage arrived, in a grey pinstripe suit, the warmth of the mood could be gauged from regular whoops of delight coming from the bar, where a TV was tuned to the BBC’s results programme. Before he could clamp his lips around the first pint of bitter, it was time to consider the effect of his victory – breaking more than a century of Liberal, Labour and Conservative electoral domination – on the political map. Ukip leader Nigel Farage enjoyed a pint of beer in Benfleet, Essex, before the election results started to roll in . Already, there are whispers in Conservative circles of a pact with Ukip at the 2015 election. And even George Osborne was on television yesterday morning discussing his newfound ‘respect’ for the party. It’s certainly a world away from his compadre David Cameron’s now infamous 2006 aside, during a radio interview, where he declared: ‘Ukip is sort of a bunch of … fruitcakes and loonies and closet racists, mostly.’ ‘After nine years of abuse, I was quite surprised,’ Farage said. ‘I nearly choked on my breakfast. But yes, he was trying to be nice I think and decided that throwing abuse at us doesn’t work. It only makes us more popular.’ As to whether a pact is on the cards, he insisted – and this is undoubtedly how results will today be spun – that Labour now has as much to fear from Ukip’s rise as the Tories. ‘Look at the results. The really big hits we’re getting are in the north of England from the Labour Party. ‘You know, actually the Conservative vote looks to me like it’s holding up quite steadily in many areas. Or more than perhaps it might have. So it’s not quite as bad a night for David Cameron as people have predicted. Counting votes cast in the UK began on Sunday, with officials in Southampton pictured arranging long ballot papers into piles . ‘So I wouldn’t have thought there’s any prospect of a deal with the Conservative Party. Firstly, I don’t think they’d want to offer it, and secondly, electorally, I don’t think it would make much sense for us either. ‘I think it would be extremely unlikely, is my take. The analysis is that we’ve hurt Labour. In 2009, when we came second at the last European  election, they said it was a high water mark, and that we’d never do it in a domestic election. ‘Then last year in English county elections we did. So then people tried to say it was all just a protest vote and that we would go away. Now there’s another protest vote and another high water mark. ‘Once we get this out of the way, the people’s army is off to Newark, where we have a by-election in a month.’ And who would now bet against yet another high water mark there?","UKIP tops the polls in large parts of the country, pushing Labour into 2nd .

"Starring role: Cocaine smuggler Gholda James, a model from the Dominican Republic, played the part of Sister Mary Roberts in Sister Act, the musical . A murderer, a drug smuggler and a child molester were allowed to star in a West End-style show inside a high-security women’s prison. Twenty inmates featured in the £180,000 production of Sister Act, the Musical at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey last month, the Mail can reveal. The show was put on as part of a ‘rehabilitation’ project designed to turn inmates away from crime. But prison bosses ordered a publicity ban over the event because of fears of public outrage. Last night victims’ groups condemned the production as ‘insensitive’. Rose Dixon, from Support after Murder and Manslaughter, said: ‘Most victims’ families will be horrified by this. 'Yes, rehabilitation is part of the programme in prison but there must be more appropriate ways. ‘They are in there enjoying themselves when the bereaved families are totally devastated. I think it’s very insensitive.’ Prison officials said the event was allowed to go ahead because it was not paid for with public funds. But questions were also raised about why foreign prisoners – who would be earmarked for deportation when they complete their sentences – were allowed to join in. The show was put on at HMP Bronzefield in Ashford, which holds the country’s most dangerous women offenders. The prison is run by private firm Sodexo Justice Services, . Inmates include serial killer Joanna Dennehy and, until recently, Rose West. An arts charity, Pimlico Opera, put on the show – based on the 1992 film starring Whoopi Goldberg – over seven nights at the end of February and start of March. Among the ‘stars’ was drug smuggler Gholda James, a model from the Dominican Republic who was jailed last year for trying to bring £90,000 of cocaine into the country. She is serving five years. Also on the cast was killer Sarah Anderson, who is serving a life sentence for stabbing another woman to death after a row in a South London pub in 2009. Nigerian air stewardess Temitayo Daramola, who was locked up after trying to smuggle £600,000 of cocaine on a flight to London from Lagos last summer, also featured in the production. The name of the convicted child abuser is not known. Roll call: Some of the jail's cast . They were supported by a cast of professional actors and opera singers and accompanied by a 13-piece orchestra. Hollywood classic: Whoopi Goldberg in the 1992 film . Prisoners performed on a West End-style stage created by top designer Halla Groves-Raines and were trained by professional choreographers for two weeks. Tickets were sold at £40 a head to members of the public, with around 300 available for each performance. But all mobile phones were confiscated from audience members as part of the ban on publicity by the Prison Service. Ian Blakeman, director of commissioning for the National Offender Management Service, said: ‘We already provide targeted offending behaviour programmes for prisoners but we also know that working with organisations like the Pimlico Opera can have a positive impact on rehabilitation and help offenders lead law-abiding lives on release.’","Twenty inmates starred in the West End-style show at HMP Bronzefield .

"'We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.' These were the famous words spoken by President John F Kennedy at Rice University on 12 September 1962 challenging America to land on the moon - which they did, nearly seven years later. And now that moment, along with many other historical and current audio clips from Nasa's space exploration and science endeavours, can be heard on a SoundCloud account from the agency. Washington-based Nasa has released dozens of clips on SoundCloud (screenshot shown). They range from moments in space exploration to scientific noises. It includes Armstrong's first words from the lunar surface and JFK's 'we choose to go to the moon speech' The collection of Nasa sounds ranges from pivotal moments in space exploration to fascinating sounds elsewhere in the universe. The short clips include Armstrong's immortal 'one small step for man,' but also some other lesser-heard sounds. When on Nasa’s Soundcloud page, it might not be immediately clear how to download a track. There are single tracks at the bottom that have a download arrow, which can clicked to download them. To download one of the tracks in the album lists, however, you need to click on the list’s name to navigate to its specific page. Here, you can then download each individual tracks from that clicked album by scrolling over them, which makes the download arrow appear. This includes the beep of the Soviet satellite Sputnik 1, the first man-made object ever to orbit Earth. And there's also the sound of a Space Shuttle launching and even noises from a distant star made from scientific data - as sound does not travel in space. While many of the sounds were available before, this account provides an easy way to access a varied number of them. They can be shared with others on social networks, or even downloaded to perhaps be used as a ringtone. 'You can hear the memorable words ""Houston, we've had a problem,"" every time you make an error on your computer,' Nasa jokes on their page. Above you can listen to some audio clips from the Apollo missions including the crew of Apollo 8 wishing Earth a Merry Christmas as they circled the moon in December 1968 and of course Neil Armstrong's words spoken from the lunar surface on 20 July 1969 . Here Buzz Aldrin stands beside an American flag at Tranquility Base on the surface of the moon during the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969 . The impressive noise of a J-2X engine being fired - to be used on Nasa's upcoming Space Launch System rocket - is one of the rocket noises on offer. Elsewhere you can hear data recorded by the Voyager spacecraft and later converted into sound - such as lightning on Jupiter or interstellar plasma sounds. Several Space Shuttle noises are available, including the sound of the landing gear dropping and a roaring liftoff. There are also several sounds from the Mercury series of space flights - Nasa's inaugural human spaceflight programme - and of course JFK's famous speech. Another clip is from the moment just after Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the surface of the moon on 20 July 1969. 'Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed,' says Armstrong, 18 seconds after landing. 'Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot,' replies the Capsule Communicator (Capcom) Charlie Duke. The audio clips will be a nostalgic reminder for some, and an educational experience for others.

"Victims of Cyril Smith are threatening to sue the Liberal Democrats for covering up his decades of sickening sexual abuse. As MPs and child abuse charities call for a full inquiry into Smith’s paedophile activities over more than 40 years, six victims said that they would issue writs for damages if it could be shown the LibDems had known about Smith’s abuse but failed to try to stop him. Former Children’s Minister Tim Loughton called for Smith to be posthumously stripped of his knighthood following devastating revelations about his depravity in a book by Rochdale Labour MP Simon Danczuk, being serialised by the Daily Mail. Scroll down for video . Cyril Smith with children from Rochdale who he had invited down to the Houses of Parliament . And Greater Manchester Police announced they are carrying out a new investigation into abuse at a residential school in Rochdale where Smith carried out regular attacks on boys. Further explosive revelations from the book in today’s Mail include: . Lawyers for Smith’s victims are looking to pursue Rochdale Council as well as the Liberal Democrats. Fiend: Cyril Smith's crimes were covered up by his high-ranking friends . Portrait of a child abuser: Like his friend Jimmy Savile, Cyril Smith used his charitable works as a cover for his fiendish activities. Biographer Simon Danczuk believes that the Liberal Party is still in denial about the monster who was in their midst . Richard Scorer, a solicitor at Slater and Gordon representing six men who claim they were molested by the MP as boys, is investigating how much senior Liberals knew. He said: ‘We are examining who knew what about the MP, and that includes the Liberal Democrat Party and Rochdale Council, and we are actively considering all possibilities in relation to those potential defendants.’ Mr Danczuk, who interviewed many of Smith’s victims for his book, said it was ‘only right and proper’ that they should seek compensation from ‘those who neglected to listen to them’. The Labour MP added: ‘I think consideration should be given to some sort of inquiry in terms of what Smith was up to. There is still a lot of denial around – not least in the Liberal Party. ‘Witnesses could be called to bring evidence, while others could face questions in terms of what they knew and what action they did – or did not – take about this prolific abuser.’ Tim Loughton, a Conservative former children’s minister, called for a wide-ranging inquiry into historic child abuse, looking at Smith’s activities alongside those of Jimmy Savile and paedophiles in the NHS, children’s homes, churches and schools. Tim Loughton, MP (left), a former children's minister wants to see a wide-ranging investigation into the activities of Cyril Smith, similar to that carried out on his friend and fellow paedophile Jimmy Savile (right) He said the Lib Dems seemed to have ‘turned a blind eye’ to the allegations, and called for Smith to be stripped of his knighthood. ‘Very clearly this chap did some nasty things and we need to get to the bottom of how exactly this went on and how it was that the Liberals made him a knight. At present it is not possible to strip . public figures of an honour after death because they cease to hold the . gong when they die. The Liberal Democrats need to put their hand up and say what happened then,’ he said. Smith was knighted on the recommendation of former Liberal leader David Steel in 1998, when rumours about the Rochdale politician's sexual activities were already rife in Westminster. Party allies: Cyril Smith was recommended for a knighthood by David Steel, former Liberal Party leader . David Steel became Liberal leader in 1976 after Jeremy Thorpe was forced to resign after he was accused of conspiracy to murder his former gay lover. Lord Steel, at 38, was one of the youngest party leaders in British political history and in March 1977 he formed the LibLab pact to keep James Callaghan's minority Labour administration in power. Andrew Bridgen, the Tory MP for North West Leicestershire, added: ‘A public inquiry would get to the truth. It’s transparency and the truth which conquers all. ‘I’m not convinced that organisations that have allowed this to happen on their watch have changed.’ Man of the people... if only the people knew: Sir Cyril Smith was a popular figure nationally, one of the most recognisable political figures in Britain in the 1970s, often appearing on light entertainment shows like Blankety Blank and Heroes of Comedy discussing his friend Bernard Manning . Martin Digan, a whistleblower who exposed abuse by Smith and others at Knowl View residential school in Rochdale, said the local council had also carried out a massive cover-up. ‘They were culpable. They failed to take action and instead hid the evidence in a safe at the council,’ he said. Peter Saunders, the chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said there needed to be a wide-ranging Royal Commission looking into cover-ups of historic child abuse. He said: ‘There absolutely should be an inquiry [into Smith’s abuse]. The reason I don’t think there will be one is because there are too many others who have been involved with the outrages and are still alive and kicking, and would not want to be associated.’ Liberal front bench: Cyril Smith (right) shares a joke with Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe. Thorpe was forced to resign as leader in 1976 after he was charged with conspiracy to murder his former gay lover. He was acquitted on June 22, 1979 . Peter Watt, the NSPCC’s director of national services, added: ‘No matter what the situation, any complaints about child abuse should be investigated and people in positions of  power should not be immune from this.’ One of Smith’s victims called for the Liberal Democrats to carry out a full inquiry. Kevin Griffiths, 65, said: ‘Nick Clegg needs to tackle this because a failure to act 40 years ago led to the abuse of dozens and dozens of boys by one of their leading MPs.’ A Lib-Dem spokesman said yesterday: ‘Cyril Smith’s acts were vile and repugnant and we have nothing but sympathy for those whose lives he ruined. ‘His actions were not known to or condoned by anyone in the Liberal Party or the Liberal Democrats. It would be inappropriate to comment further on any potential legal action.’ And John Pugh, the Lib Dem MP for Southport, told the Observer: ‘I am as shocked as the next person by these revelations. I can confirm that they were not widely known until recently.’ But there is growing evidence that senior figures in the  party did hear rumours about the crimes. As far back as April 1979, a press officer working for then Liberal leader David Steel, now Lord Steel of Aikwood, gave a statement about Smith’s alleged abuse to a local newspaper, the Rochdale Alternative Press. After learning that the title intended to print details of a police investigation into complaints against Smith, Lord Steel’s spokesman said at the time: ‘It’s not a very friendly gesture, publishing that. All he seems to have done is spanked a few bare bottoms.’ One former Liberal MP, Michael Meadowcroft, who was in Parliament from 1983 to 1987, has said that ‘whispers’ that Smith ‘liked boys’ did the rounds of Westminster over the ensuing years. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen (left with wife Jackie) is calling for a public enquiry into Smith; former Liberal MP Michael Meadowcroft (right) says that whispers that Cyril Smith liked little boys did the rounds at Westminster for years . Lord Steel, who put Smith forward for his knighthood, has yet to comment on the Daily Mail’s recent revelations and it remains unclear what steps he took to confirm that the obese politician was telling the truth. Special Branch officers would watch as Smith cruised known pick-up spots looking for young rent boys during Liberal Party conferences in Blackpool, it was claimed yesterday. Police were also allegedly aware that he secretly took vulnerable schoolboys on holiday with him and his mother to Lytham St Annes in Lancashire so he could abuse them. Sir Cyril Smith’s family said yesterday that they were ‘saddened and concerned’ by the claims about him. In a statement to the BBC, Smith’s 82-year-old brother Norman and other relatives said they were upset that the allegations were being made when he is no longer alive to defend himself.

"A teenager is so petrified of being sick that she refuses to be further than 100 yards from a toilet. Anna Roberts, 19, from Southwick, West Sussex, suffers from the phobia so severely that she must be near a toilet at all times. The phobia, known as emetophobia, has left Miss Roberts living in constant fear of vomiting and unable to lead a normal life. Anna Roberts has such a severe phobia of vomiting that she refuses to be more than 100 years from a toilet . She rarely leaves the house, has no job, and finds it difficult to socialise with friends due to her crippling phobia. She said: ‘I’m so terrified of being sick that if I ever go out I can’t cope unless I know I’m near a toilet at all times. ‘I always feel nauseous - the feeling just overwhelms me. ‘I don’t like the thought of other people’s sick but my worst nightmare would be to throw up in public. ‘I feel safest in my own toilet at home - but if a family member is sick in the bathroom I will avoid using that toilet for over a month.’ Despite only being sick once every few years, Miss Robert’s life is completely controlled by the fear. The phobia - known as emetophobia - is so severe that Miss Roberts rarely leaves the house and is unable to work. She also struggles to socialise with her friends because of her anxieties . She said: ‘I’m so scared of being sick so I try to make sure everything is clean and germ free so I won’t get ill. ‘I clean cutlery and dishes all of the time, I will only eat food that is so overcooked it’s burnt and I don’t really like to try new food just in case I have a bad reaction. Emetophobia is the phobia of vomit. It is a common anxiety disorder that is most common in women. Up to three per cent of men and seven per cent of women are thought to have emetophobia. People with the phobia fear being sick, especially in public, so often practice avoidance behaviours. For example, some sufferers will not leave home when there is a tummy bug going around and will avoid friends or family who are ill. Others will observe a strict diet that is free from anything that might cause a stomach upset. Some avoid medications which list nausea as a potential side effect. Others avoid pregnancy and alcohol for fear they could make them vomit. Treatment options include counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy and medication. Source: Anxiety UK . ‘I really want to pass my driving test but I feel car sick and I can’t concentrate as I don’t know where the nearest toilet is. ‘My friendship circle is constantly shrinking as I rarely go out and I can never visit my boyfriend’s house as I worry that I might become poorly.’ Miss Robert’s phobia started at the age of 11 when she had a sickness bug just before Christmas. She was ill for more than two weeks and frantically worried she wouldn’t get better in time for the festivities. She said: ‘I was only young and Christmas - like all children - was my favourite time of year. ‘But after being ill I was so scared that it would come back and I would miss the big day. ‘I don’t enjoy Christmas anymore, it just reminds me of throwing up. ‘After that I went through a phase where I would even take my own food to eat when my family made me go to restaurants. ‘Being at school helped as my mind was constantly distracted and although there were still days where I felt sick I had no choice but to be there and get on with it. ‘But since I’ve left college my phobia has consumed me, being at home in my room all of the time has meant my fears of going outside are much worse.’ Miss Roberts has been to counselling but so far nothing has helped her to successfully conquer her fears. She said: ‘My dream is to be able to go on holiday and relax and not constantly fret over being sick. Miss Roberts is so afraid of germs that she cleans obsessively and insists that all of her food is overcooked . ‘I hope to become a make-up artist one day, but of course that would mean leaving the house and being around lots of different people. ‘It just controls me so much, it’s terrifying.’ David Samson, a clinical hypnotherapist who specialises in phobia treatment, said: ‘Emetophobia primarily affects females. I treat around seven females for every male. ‘Most commonly it starts around the . early teens with fussy eating, obsessive checking of sell-by dates on . food products, reluctance to eat away from home, fears of social . situations, inability to attend school regularly, frequent tummy . sensations and a general feeling of being unsafe when not at home. Miss Roberts has had counselling but it did not help her to overcome her phobia . ‘Recovery is gradual and the symptoms can take from several months to many years to fully disappear. ‘It is not a smooth path either - patients will have a few good days followed by a “blip” when they feel they have got worse. ‘This is an essential part of the recovery process as they learn what the “tummy feeling” is and realise that it isn’t always bad. ‘Believe it or not, this is one of the most common phobias and whilst there are no official stats, some rank it to be around the fifth top in the world.’","Anna Roberts, 19, has emetophobia - the fear of vomit and vomiting .

"A teenager was arrested today over the alleged kidnap and murder of young mother Kirsty Treloar. The 20-year-old alleged victim was abducted from her east London home shortly after 7am yesterday before being found dead in an abandoned car some 90 minutes later. Officers involved in a major manhunt arrested a 19-year-old suspect at about 1pm in the Hackney area, Scotland Yard said. Kidnapped: The body of Kirsty Treloar, 20, who just a month ago had given birth to a baby girl, was found in an abandoned car yesterday morning . Christmas tragedy: Kirsty Treloar put a picture of her one-month-old daughter in a Santa outfit on Facebook shortly before she was found dead . The suspect remains in custody at an east London police station, officers said. Her body was discovered with stab wounds at around 8.30am in a grey Fiat Stilo which was abandoned about a mile from her home in east London. She was pronounced dead at the scene in Ryder Mews.

Police officers on the scene yesterday after a girl, believed to be aged 15, was arrested over a murder in Luton . Three other people died after being attacked at New Year's Eve Parties. A teenage girl was being held on suspicion of stabbing a middle-aged man to death at a house party. The 42-year-old victim, known only as Michael, was co-hosting the event with girlfriend Mandy O'Neill in LUTON, BEDFORDSHIRE. He suffered a heart attack after being knifed at the party and died within an hour. Detectives today arrested a girl believed to be aged around 15 on suspicion of carrying out the attack. Police were initially unable to question many of the guests at the party because they were drunk. Neighbours . told how at 3am they heard 'loads of screaming' coming from the house . party and then squads of police and a paramedic crew arrived. One neighbour said a lot of teenagers and adults had attended the party. 'They were playing music throughout the night which wasn't too bad, nothing out of the ordinary,' she said. 'Then the music suddenly stopped and there was a lot of shouting and fighting. 'You could hear people fighting. Then there were these awful screams and people running from the house in a state. 'A group of girls were the first to come out and they bolted down an alleyway at the bottom of the road.' Police had sealed of a large section of the quiet cul-de-sac as forensic teams worked in the house and back garden. ** Separately, a 27-year-old man was attacked and died at a New Year's Eve Party in SHEFFIELD. Police were called to the party in the early hours of yesterday morning to find the victim Joshua Green had been stabbed.

"According to the history books, five mass extinctions have devastated the planet since it formed 4.6 billion years ago. But history may have to be rewritten after the discovery of fossils that point to a sixth mass extinction taking place 260 million years ago. The find suggests that in the Permian period, the world’s creature were almost wiped out twice: once during the ‘Great Dying’ and in an earlier event named the 'Middle Permian' mass extinction. History may have to be rewritten after the discovery of fossils which point to a sixth mass extinction that took place 260 million years ago.  The fossils were found in the Permian rocks of the Kapp Starostin Formation (pictured) at Spitsbergen which reveal the record of the high latitude Middle Permian extinction . The Great Dying was the worst extinction event of all time killing off 96 per cent of species. Today, all life on Earth is descended from the remaining four per cent of species that survived. Now researchers from the universities of Hull and Leeds say there is evidence of a major marine extinction in the Arctic just eight million years before the Great Dying. An extinction event around this time has been the subject of previous studies, but this is the first to document the event in high latitudes. 'One of the pre-requisites for a “mass extinction” is that it has to be a global event,' Professor David Bond from the University of Hull told MailOnline. Professor Bond and his colleague Paul Wignall from the University of Leeds found evidence of the extinction in fossils in Isfjorden, Spitsbergen (left). They studied them in layers of rock (right), identifying the species present and building up what they described as 'a range chart' The find suggests that in the Permian period, the world’s creature were almost wiped out twice. Pictured is a fossil skull of Dinogorgon Rubidgei, sitting on a gravel pile. The fossil is one of many Therapsida which did not survive the Permian extinction, one of the most disastrous extinctions known . 'Our study confirms it is a global event, and so we can now say for sure that the event is a true mass extinction.' Professor Bond and his colleague Paul Wignall from the University of Leeds found evidence of the extinction in fossils in Isfjorden, Spitsbergen. They studied them in layers of rock, identifying the species present and building up what they described as 'a range chart'. 'At a particular layer, many of the different species disappear,' explained Professor Bond. 'This can be spread over several layers - and indeed hundreds of thousands of years - or can be in a single layer.' Together, the fossils suggest 50 per cent of all marine species died during the event. ‘We can now say this is a real global mass extinction,’ Professor Bond said after reporting his findings over the weekend at the Geological Society of America meeting in Vancouver, Canada. Meteor impacts contributed to wiping out species during mass extinction events on Earth . Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago . This was the third largest extinction in Earth's history, and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years. Around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82-88 per cent of all species. Late Devonian mass extinction - 375-359 million years ago . Three quarters of all species on Earth died out in the Late Devonian mass extinction, though it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years. Around 22 per cent of all marine families, and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79-87 per cent of all species. Permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago . The Permian mass extinction has been nicknamed The Great Dying, since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out. All life on Earth today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived. Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction - 201 million years ago . There were two or three phases of extinction that made up the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event. 22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76-84 per cent of all species. Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago . The Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs. However, many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71-81 per cent of all species. The Middle Permian extinction may have weakened species, causing the Great Dying to have a much more fatal impact than it might otherwise have had, he added. A number of theories have been proposed for extinction events during the Permian including asteroid impact, volcanic eruptions, methane release or some combination of these. 'We see the loss of carbonates in the aftermath of the extinction across the whole Arctic region – this is consistent with ocean acidification as a kill mechanism in the high latitudes,' said Professor Bond. 'This could have been caused by excessive CO2 release from the Chinese volcanism which gets absorbed by sea water and drives pH down. 'The volcanism would also have caused cooling and warming (both but over different timescales), acid rain, ozone depletion, many other factors – currently we don’t know which of these were responsible.' The Permian mass extinction has been nicknamed The Great Dying, since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out. All life on Earth today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived. Pictured are sail-backed Dimetrodons, which were alive during Earth's Permian period of time . Professor Bond is now hoping for the earlier Permian event to be added to the 'big five' mass extinctions that have so far hit Earth. Some scientists claim Earth is already in the midst of another mass extinction event, caused by humans who have already killed off over 320 species. The planet's current biodiversity, the product of 3.5 billion years of evolutionary trial and error, is the highest in the history of life. In a study published in July, researchers at Stanford University said Earth has reached a tipping point and is in the early stages of a mass extinction event . Since 1500, more than 320 terrestrial vertebrates have become extinct. Populations of the remaining species show a 25 per cent average decline in abundance. The discovery was made in Spitsbergen, the largest and only permanently populated island of the Svalbard archipelago in northern Norway .","UK scientists studied fossils found in layers of rock in Spitsbergen .

Her parents Andrea, 36, and Simon, 38, feared something wasn't right when their daughter struggled to walk and was smaller than other toddlers. They have taken her to countless specialists and sent her X-rays to doctors around the world but none have been able to identify exactly what Georgia's condition is.

I see myself as the same as everyone else.' It is an upbeat assessment of what in many ways has been a difficult time, with countless appointments with specialists and hospital surgery . The wheelchair would help Georgia reach cupboards and shelves and be more independent, since at the moment she is unable to bear her own weight or even lift a kettle. The campaign site said: 'It also goes to floor level from the comfort of her seat. Georgia can't weight bear whatsoever so can't stand up or get in or out of her wheelchair without help, if she drops anything she relies on the people around her to pick it up - she finds this extremely frustrating!

Joann Dunmore. 66, has been handed an ASBO after disturbing neighbours with sounds of late-night drumming and flowerpots smashing. Peter Gillett, a former gangster, said Dunmore is too much even for him . Mr Gillett described Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe as an 'absolute saint' compared to the 66-year-old who he said has terrorised his peaceful town.

She will be sentenced later this year. The town is known for picturesque beaches and wildlife spots. On Thursday, the pensioner also pleaded guilty to a separate charge of racially aggravated harassment at Chichester Crown Court.

"Wind farms could cause people living nearby to go deaf, a new study claims. The barely audible low frequency hum emitted by turbines harms ‘the exquisite mechanics of our inner ears’, scientists say. A study of 21 healthy young men and women who were exposed to such sound, revealed that most experienced changes in cells in the cochlear - a spiral shaped cavity essential for hearing and balance. Scroll down for video . Wind farms (pictured) could cause people living nearby to go deaf, a new study claims. Scientists from the University of Munich said that the barely audible low frequency hum emitted by turbines harms ‘the exquisite mechanics of our inner ears’ Researchers measured the changes by analysing Spontaneous Otoacoustic Emissions (SOAEs), which are the faint sounds produced in the ear that can detect changes to its physiology. Dr Marcus Drexel, of the University of Munich, said man-made sources of low frequency noise have spread dramatically in recent years and are also generated by thermal power stations, ventilation and air conditioning systems. ‘The dogma of “what you can’t hear, won’t hurt you” is deeply rooted in society and governs the current health and safety regulations,’ he said. ‘However, while even loud low frequency sounds are not perceived as obtrusive, our findings show such sounds affect the exquisite mechanics of our inner ears in a significant manner. ‘Our study identifies a mechanism in our hearing system, which can contribute to explain conditions associated with low-frequency sound emissions.’ A study of 21 healthy young men and women who were exposed to 'the hum' - a noise mimicking that made by wind turbines - revealed that most experienced changes in cells in the cochlear (pictured) which is a spiral shaped cavity essential for hearing and balance . The hum is a persistent and invasive low-frequency humming or droning noise, which is only audible to some people. It is thought that around two per cent of people can hear it - but there has long been scepticism about whether it actually exists. The hum is made by thermal power stations, ventilation and air conditioning systems as well as some factory machinery, household appliances and even the sea. This new report suggests that not only do wind farms produce 'the hum' but that it also damages hearing . Scientists found that most of the healthy adults who they exposed to the sound - a low frequency wavelength of 30Hz - experienced changes in cells in the cochlear. In the study, the participants were exposed to a low frequency wavelength of 30Hz for 90 seconds, to mimic the noise generated a wind turbine. The noise was well below health and safety regulations, according to the paper, which was published in the journal Royal Society Open Science. Humans can have a hearing range of between 20 and 20,000Hz. Dr Drexel said: ‘Most interestingly, 17 of the 21 subjects revealed an overall of 56 new SOAEs, which had not been measurable before low frequency stimulation.’ For decades, experts thought that sound lower than 250Hz largely bypassed the inner ear even at intense levels, because thresholds are relatively high. But this could be incorrect. Dr Drexel said: ‘The current data show in humans, active cochlear mechanics, as assessed by SOAE measurements, are significantly affected by low frequency stimulation. ‘To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study focusing on the effect of low frequency sound on level and frequency of human SOAEs.’ Wind farms have also been linked with a greater risk of heart disease, panic attacks and migraines. The farms are said to cause ‘wind turbine syndrome’, the symptoms of which include tinnitus, vertigo and sleep deprivation. It is estimated that up to 30 per cent of the population suffer from some sort of noise sensitivity and at least 10,000 people now hear 'the hum' (illustrated with a stock image) It is thought that thousands of people are super sensitive to low frequency sounds which are produced by factory machinery and transport as well as household items such as fridges and boilers. In extreme cases, ‘the hum’ can result in headaches, depression and even, in one instance, suicide. It is estimated that up to 30 per cent of the population suffer from some sort of noise sensitivity and at least 10,000 people now hear ‘the hum’. The wind industry has been accused of ignoring the damaging impact of the intermittent noise from turbines for 25 years. A 1987 research paper for the US Department of Energy showed the ‘annoyance’ caused by them to nearby residents was ‘real not imaginary’.","Study of 21 healthy adults exposed to 'the hum' revealed that most experienced cell changes in the cochlear - part of the inner ear .

"Rape victims whose horrific ordeals were filmed by their attackers are 'terrified' the footage may be posted online, after a reported surge in such crimes. Rape Crisis, which supports victims of sexual assault, said in the last 12 months between 50 and 100 women reported that the attacker not only filmed the rape but said it would be posted online for others to see. The abhorrent claims add weight to the charity's campaign to urge the government to urgently close a loophole in the extreme pornography legislation which permits the possession of pornography depicting rape in England and Wales. Terrified: Rape victims whose horrific ordeals were filmed by their attackers may find the footage posted online, after a reported surge in such crimes . Recent research found that, of the top 50 accessible ‘rape porn’ sites found through a Google search, 78 per cent advertise content depicting simulated rape of under 18-year-olds, for example 'schoolgirl rape'. Of the top ten Google search results for ‘free porn’ half the websites host free rape pornography. Sites include terms like ‘brutal rape’, ‘real rape’ and ‘savage rape’ in their web addresses. Further research by the Sunday Times found that blogging websites were another source where rape pornography was being posted. Speaking to the Sunday paper, Rosa Knight, national helpline coordinator at Rape Crisis South London, said: ' Women often talk about their experiences being filmed but it is only recently that they're being told that the films will be disseminated.' She said victims are now 'terrified' they will be recognised online in the videos and friends and family will find out. In a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, signed by 100 supporters - including Deputy Children’s Commissioner Sue Berelowitz - the charity points out that two recently convicted rapists and murderers - Mark Bridger and Stuart Hazell - used violent and misogynistic pornography as part of their murders of young girls. Recent research found that, of the top 50 accessible 'rape porn' sites found through a Google search, 78 per cent advertise content depicting simulated rape of under 18-year-olds . It also draws attention to the fact that the possession of rape pornography is already criminalised in Scotland where law-makers took its harm into account when legislating. Research conducted by the charity's South London branch into freely available online ‘rape porn’ found descriptions including ‘young schoolgirls abducted and cruelly raped. Hear her screams’; ‘little schoolgirl raped by teacher’; ‘tiny girl sleep rape’; and ‘girl raped at gunpoint’. The charity wants legislature to change to prevent the legal possession of such pornography. David Cameron, however, has put the onus on Internet companies such as Google to regulate what content they make available. He has called on companies to do more to root out such 'disgusting images' and will meet with industry on June 17 to discuss a way forward to clean up the web. Rape Crisis campaigner Fiona Elvines, who has conducted research into what is currently available online legally in England and Wales, said allowing simulated rape online 'glorifies' sexual violence. She said the 2008 legislation on extreme pornography was brought in to address the way the internet had changed the distinctions between 'publishing, distributing and possessing some kinds of pornography'. She said the law was intended to protect the public from harm by criminalising the possession of pornography which depicts life-threatening injury, serious injury to anus/breasts/genitals, bestiality or necrophilia. 'It is a serious omission not to have included images depicting rape and other non-consensual acts as they did in Scotland,' Elvines said. 'This is not about making a distinction between real and simulated rape and child sexual abuse, with the latter being perfectly lawful to possess as long as it is ""fantasy"" and actors are over 18. 'Permitting the possession of depictions of sexual violence as entertainment glorifies, trivialises and normalises such abuse – at a time when government statistics estimate that 85,000 women and girls are raped each year.' The letter to the Prime Minister also cites a recent report of the Children’s Commissioner on young people’s, especially boys’, exposure to pornography and its links to harmful attitudes and behaviours. Porn searches: : Of the top ten Google search results for 'free porn' half the websites host free rape pornography. Sites include terms like 'brutal rape', 'real rape' and 'savage rape' in their web addresses . Rape Crisis urges David Cameron to consider reform in order that other Government work on tackling violence against women and girls is not undermined. Professor Clare McGlynn of Durham University, an expert in this area of law, told the charity: 'The extreme pornography legislation is in urgent need of reform. The current law excludes the vast majority of pornographic images of rape. 'This is not a simplistic argument about rape pornography causing rape. It is undeniable that the proliferation and tolerance of such images and the messages they convey contributes to a cultural climate where sexual violence is condoned. 'Closing this loophole would not be difficult. Together with Erika Rackley at Durham University we have drafted changes to the law, and we believe that there would be huge public support for a swift change in the law. We await the Prime Minister’s response.'","Up to 100 cases reported in the last 12 months .

"When Charlotte Comer went to her GP with a sore throat, she got more than she was expecting. As well as being prescribed antibiotics for tonsillitis, the mother of two received an unwelcome lecture on family size. Her doctor told her she would be ‘irresponsible’ if she had a third child, and went on to call for a limit on how many children couples can have, as happens in China. Charlotte Comer (right with her two sons) was told by Dr Justin Landen (left) that having more children was 'irresponsible' Miss Comer said she was left ‘gobsmacked’ by the comments of Dr Justin Landen at the Hill Barton Surgery in Exeter, Devon. The 21-year-old travel agent said she was leaving the surgery on Monday when Dr Landen questioned her about contraception and asked whether she wanted more children. When she replied that she and her partner Lee Hook were thinking of having another child after they get married, the GP launched into a ‘lecture’ advocating a two-child limit on families, she said. Miss Comer and Mr Hook, a 28-year-old courier, are parents to Harrison-Lee, two, and Freddie, 11 weeks. The couple do not claim employment or housing benefits and Miss Comer is currently on maternity leave. ‘I was walking out with Freddie in my arms and he [Dr Landen] asked me if I wanted any more kids,’ she said. ‘I told him we were thinking of having another, but not until after we got married. ‘I started explaining that we both came from big families so we’d like more children but he said he didn’t think coming from big families justified having more children. ‘He then started talking about how the country is overpopulated and anyone who has more than two children is irresponsible. He started going on about how this country should be like China where people are allowed only one child.’ China’s one-child law has been used to control its booming population since 1979. She added: ‘I was gobsmacked. I never cry, but as soon as I got out I just burst into tears. I was so angry.’ Charlotte Comer with her sons Harrison-Lee aged 2 and Freddie aged 11 weeks, at their home in Exeter . Miss Comer could not understand why the conversation was relevant to her visit but said Dr Landen told her it was his job to advise on such matters. ‘He started saying that in a few years’ time the Government wouldn’t be giving out benefits as much,’ she said. ‘I felt like I was being judged. 'I told him my partner works 70 hours a week as a courier and I am on maternity leave, and we weren’t on benefits.' ‘I don’t think he knew what to say to that, so he asked me why we would want more children if my partner works 70 hours a week and doesn’t have enough time with his children already. He used that as a reason for us not to have more children.’ She said Dr Landen, 43, contacted her after the appointment to apologise but she decided to lodge a  formal complaint. ‘All the way through he kept saying, “I’m a doctor, I have to give advice on things like this, it’s my job”. ‘I was shocked to be having this conversation. I went in for some antibiotics and came out with a lecture. It upset me, as I already feel judged, being young and having two children, but to get this from your doctor – there’s no way anyone should be spoken to like this.’ A statement issued through the NHS said Dr Landen issued ‘advice’ regarding contraception. A spokesman said: ‘There was no intention whatsoever to cause offence or distress and Dr Landen apologises if this has upset his patient. Dr Landen’s priority as a GP is always to meet the health needs of his patients and at no point was this advice ill intended.’ The Hill Barton Surgery in Exeter, Devon, where Dr Justin Landen made the comments .","Charlotte Comer was told Britain should be more like China .

"January is the most miserable month of the year. Christmas is over, we're recovering from a month of lavish eating, drinking and spending - and there is no end in sight to the cold, dark mornings. So Femail has teamed up with happiness experts Andy Cope and Andy Whittaker to provide a plan to keep the January blues away. Scroll down for video . British happiness experts Andy Cope and Andy Whittaker have a list of cheering daily activities for January . The two men, who have written the best-selling book The Art Of Being Brilliant, devised a month-long plan that includes one chore every day designed to bring happiness. The challenge is to do the exercises daily until they become happiness habits. Read on to learn how to beat the winter blues: . 1 January: Upgrade your knickers so every bit of underwear oozes confidence. Stop saving your special pants for a special occasion and wake up to the fact that life is the ultimate special occasion. 2 January: Do an act of kindness for someone else. This can be as simple as letting someone out in the traffic or buying flowers for the bus driver. 3 January: Catch somebody doing something well and tell them. For example, make a point of thanking someone who gives good customer service or thank your teenager for bringing the plates and cups down from their room. Your fanciest pants aren't just for special occasions. Breaking out your best underwear will boost confidence . 4 January: Practice the 10/5 principle, for instance, smile at everyone who comes within 10 feet of you and make eye contact and say ‘hi’ to everyone within five feet (except on the Tube. I tried it and nearly got arrested). 5 January: Say nice things about people behind their back. This is a double whammy because it gets back to them plus people think you’re a lovely person (which, of course, you are). 6 January: Write a list of ten things you really appreciate but take for granted. ‘Health’ and ‘relationships’ will almost certainly be on there. Stop taking them for granted! 7 January: Every morning, appreciate that you don’t have toothache and that your kidneys are working. Being able to get out of bed is the best thing ever. 8 January: Write a list of the top ten happiest moments of your life and you’ll realise that most of the things on the list are ‘experiences’ rather than ‘products’. Set your stall out to have more experiences. Write a list of the ten things you really appreciate but take for granted like 'health’ and ‘relationships’ 9 January: Think of someone who has really helped you, perhaps given you time or supported you. Write them a letter from the heart, that says how wonderful they are and what they mean to you. Read it to them (I dare you). 10 January: Instead of asking your partner/kids ‘how was your day?’ change the words and ask (with enthusiasm), ‘what was the highlight of your day?’ Then listen with genuine enthusiasm. 11 January: Walk tall and put a smile on your face (not an inane grin, you will scare people.) Your brain will immediately think you are happy and you’ll feel a whole lot better. 12 January: Change your aim. Stop setting your sights on ‘getting through the week’ or ‘surviving until my next holiday’. Raise your game. Set your aim to ‘enjoy the week’ or ‘to inspire people’. 13 January: Write down your top five personal strengths. Be aware of them and start seeing opportunities to play to them more often. 14 January: Reduce your moaning - as a Brit, it’s almost impossible to stop completely - and always remind yourself it's a First World problem. Reduce your moaning (as a Brit, it’s a national passtime) and  remind yourself it's a First World problem . 15 January: When setbacks occur, ask yourself, where is this issue on a scale of one to ten (where ten is death). If it is death, you are allowed to feel down. Anything else, get over it. 16 January: Most people have an internal voice that is very critical. Challenge it. When your inner voice is telling you you’re an idiot, firmly disagree. Find a positive inner voice. Note, this conflict is best done in silence in your head. And if you have lots of inner voices, you need to see your GP. 17 January: Spend less time on electronic friends and more time with real flesh and blood ones. 18 January: Say ‘yes’ to things, all day. 19 January: Praise your children for effort rather than ability. So, for example, if they get a good grade in maths don’t say, ‘Genius, you are the next Einstein.’ Do say, ‘Brilliant! That shows what you can achieve with hard work.’ Spend less time on electronic friends and more time with the real flesh and blood people in your life . 20 January: Practice the four-minute rule; that is, be your best self for the first four minutes of arriving at work, being in a meeting or getting home. Your brilliance is infectious. 21 January: Lose the word ‘try’. Instead of setting a resolution of ‘I’m going to try and lose some weight’ or ‘I’m going to try and get a bit fitter’, go with ‘I’m going to lose some weight’ or ‘I’m going to get fitter’. Yoda was spot on when he said ‘Do or do not, there is no ‘try’. 22 January: Appreciate that your happiness is bigger than you. It has a ripple effect and infects people three degrees removed from you. 23 January: Read a bedtime story to your kids like it is the most exciting book in the world. 24 January: Reframe situations. For example, a leaking gutter means you have a house; paying tax means you have some income and your teenage son spending hours on his X-Box means he’s not wandering the streets. (But don’t overdo reframing otherwise you become Pollyanna; ‘Whoopee, grandma’s died, what a fabulous opportunity for a funeral and some lovely sandwiches’ is almost certainly a reframe too far). Read a bedtime story to your children as if it is the most exciting book in the world . 25 January: Rather than a New Year’s resolution, set yourself a HUGG (Huge Unbelievably Great Goal). This is something that is massive and that inspires you, for instance, to write your novel, to run a marathon or to be the best mum in the world. 26 January: Be genuinely interested in other people -  ask loads of questions about them. In a bizarre twist of quantum psychology, people will find you insanely interesting. 27 January: Remember children spell ‘LOVE’, ‘T, I, M, E’ (* see point 23). 28 January: Make sure that you use more positive than negative language. The ratio needs to be about five positives for every negative, so catch people doing things well and tell them. 29 January: Notice the ‘beautiful ordinary’ - the small things that other people rush past. Appreciate that happiness is in the moment so notice sunrises, raindrops, smiles, flowers and smiling children. 30 January: When setbacks occur, rather than beating yourself up in your head, ask yourself, ‘what will I do differently next time?’ 31 January: Ask yourself, if there was a version of you sitting on a cloud, watching you go about your tasks today, what advice would the ‘cloud you’ give the ‘earthly you’? How would they say you should walk, talk, think and behave? Take that advice. · At the end of the day, spend five minutes writing down three things that have gone well, and why. · Commit to doing some exercise. Don’t kill yourself, 20 minutes a day is fine. It might feel like a chore at the time but it releases all sorts of lovely chemicals which will infuse you with a Ready Brek glow. · Listen (and I mean really listen) to people. Stop finishing their sentences. Tune in and show an interest . · Watch out for the 90/10 principle. This states that 10 per cent of your happiness depends on things that happen to you while a whopping 90 per cent depends on how you react to these events. Make a conscious choice to be positive. · If you have small children practice what The Happiness Project author Gretchen Rubin calls ‘gazing lovingly’. This means downing tools at the end of the evening and standing at your children’s bedroom door, watching them sleep. The modern world dictates that you only ever do this with your own kids and there is an age limit of ten. After that, the general rule is that you NEVER go in your kids’ bedrooms, just in case).","British happiness experts Andy Cope and Andy Whittaker devised the plan .

"The son of Pink Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour was jailed yesterday after showing the ‘ultimate disrespect’ to Britain’s war dead by swinging from the Cenotaph during the student riots. Charlie Gilmour, 21, reeled in shock as he was handed a 16-month sentence for his ‘outrageous and deeply offensive behaviour’ during a drug-fuelled rampage that also saw him attack Prince Charles’s car. The Cambridge University history student was ‘out of his mind’ on a cocktail of LSD, Valium and whisky when he laid siege to the royal convoy during the tuition fee protests in London on December 9 last year. Not happy, Gilmour: Charlie Gilmour, left, who was jailed yesterday for 16 months, arrives at court with his father, Pink Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour and his mother Polly Samson (rear, centre) He threw a bin at a car carrying . royal protection officers and leapt on the bonnet of the vehicle . escorting the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall to the Royal . Variety Performance. Gilmour, whose parents have a home in . London as well as a £2.68million seafront mansion in Hove, East Sussex, . was also part of a mob who ransacked TopShop’s flagship Oxford Street . store, causing £50,000 worth of damage. Yesterday the yob tried to excuse his . behaviour, saying that he had not known it was the Cenotaph. But Judge . Nicholas Price scoffed at the excuse, saying: ‘For you, a young man of . undoubted high intelligence, education and background, to profess you . didn’t know what the Cenotaph represented defies belief. Under attack: The Rolls-Royce of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall was attacked during the protests . Jailed: Charlie Gilmour outside Kingston Crown Court during a break in proceedings . ‘It’s through the deaths of those . many thousands who gave their lives that you have been given the . opportunity for the democratic right to protest, but you showed ultimate . disrespect to those who fell defending their country. ‘Such outrageous and deeply offensive behaviour gives a clear indication of how out of control you were that day.’ The judge told how Gilmour’s conduct . had prompted a deluge of ‘vituperative and in many cases obscene’ hate . mail sent to his blameless family. However, he accepted that  Gilmour . had shown contrition the day after his actions, and stressed that his . antics at the Cenotaph did not form part of the violent disorder charge. But sentencing him at Kingston Crown . Court, Surrey, he said: ‘I have to take into account that you have had . many advantages which are denied to most young men who come before this . court. ‘I have no doubt you felt strongly . about the legislation regarding student fees, but what you did went far, . far beyond proper protest.’ Gilmour was wide-eyed in shock as he . was led away by a prison officer, while his mother, writer Polly Samson, . sobbed.Later, she and her rock star husband, who is worth an estimated . £78million, hugged their son’s university friends, many of whom shook . with emotion. During the hearing, Gilmour’s lawyer . wheeled out no fewer than 13 character references, many from ‘very . distinguished’ members of society, including BBC boss Alan Yentob and . the chief executive of the homeless charity Crisis. David Spens, QC, defending, said . Gilmour, an ex-pupil at £9,000-a-term Lancing College in West Sussex, . was a ‘gentle’ student who had been subjected to ‘serious bullying’ in . the past. He said the second-year student – who . was adopted by Dave Gilmour – had been catapulted into a downward . spiral of drink and drugs by a disastrous meeting last year with his . biological father, the radical playwright and poet Heathcote Williams. Mr Spens said: ‘For a period of time . starting around August 2010 he was, by his own admission, on something . of a continual binge, taking a range of illicit and illegal drugs. In . his own words, he spent most of the week, effectively every week, . tranquillised out of his mind.

Here he is pictured with his father, mother Polly, and sister Alice (left) ‘This young man has had to cope with . the pain and considerable emotional upheaval of having a biological . father who rejected him for no good reason and has continued to reject . him throughout his life.’ Mr Spens said Gilmour had now sought help from a psychotherapist, had stopped using drugs and cut down his drinking. Gilmour admitted violent disorder at a hearing in May, but denied he was responsible for the bin attack. A spokesman for Girton College, .

"An ‘intelligent’ schoolboy bought a prosthetic mask and dressed in an old man’s suit as part of an elaborate disguise to carry out an armed robbery at a jewellers during which he threatened staff with an imitation handgun. The robbery is just one of a number of shocking crimes documented in a new Channel 5 television show which reveals some of the most carefully planned crimes carried out by Britain's teenagers. Also revealed in the show is a gang from Hull who terrorised families by bursting into their homes armed with table legs and scissors and stealing their Christmas presents. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage of a 'steaming' gang attacking a mobile phone store in London. They are one of a number of teenage criminals featured on a new Channel 5 TV documentary .

The 'steaming' gang, who were caught on CCTV after removing their hoods on their journeys home after the raid, pictured, were jailed for a total of 11 years after the crime wave, which lasted from July 2012 to January 2013 . And the Running Riot: Britain's Teen Crims documentary also looks into the craze of ‘steaming', which involves youths barging into shops en masse to steal valuable goods such as smart phones and tablets. Miles Alura – a schoolboy in the middle of studying for his GCSEs – created an ‘old man’ disguise as part of a plan to steal £75,000 worth of jewellery from a shop in Kent. The 16-year-old and his accomplice, aged 15, pulled out two imitation handguns and ordered staff to go into a back room before bagging up £75,000 worth of jewellery during the raid in 2012. During the show, friends of Alura tell how the intelligent teenager was one of the top of his class and destined for good things before plotting the shocking armed robbery. Alura was convicted of the offence and jailed for five years after discarding clothes containing his Oyster card and mobile phone while fleeing from the scene. DC Angela Costin, of Kent Police, said: ‘It was very sophisticated to the point where you watch the CCTV from Victoria train station, and at no point do you even see members of the public giving him a second glance.’ The TV documentary also looks into the craze of ‘steaming’, which involves masses of youths barging into shops en masse to steal valuable goods such as smart phones and tablets.

One member of a ‘steaming’ gang - which smashed into numerous phone stores across London - describes how members would meet at a tube station which had access to several destinations, before walking into the town centre and bursting into a shop. The gang would create chaos because of the number of youths involved, enabling them to swipe thousands of pounds worth of goods from the shelves and disperse without being caught. ‘It was fast money, easy money, it gave us good joy at times seeing a lot of money,’ said the young criminal, known as Mr Q. The gang, who were caught on CCTV after removing their hoods on their journeys home, were jailed for a total of 11 years after the crime wave, which lasted from July 2012 to January 2013. Also featured on the show is the shocking story of a gang of hooligans from Hull who terrorised families by bursting into their homes armed with table legs and scissors. Joseph Wilson, 19, was locked up for four years for his part in the spree and his accomplice Macaulay Smith, 15, was jailed for more than three years at Hull Crown Court in 2012. The group's ringleader Aiden Mercer received eight years. Their victim, Sally-Anne Hawker, said: ‘They stole thousands of pounds worth of my children's Christmas presents. Ricky, 18, pictured left, and Danny Oakley, 20, pictured right, have both racked up a string of convictions since they were handed ASBOs in 2006 . Ricky Oakley, now 18, has been in jail a total of six times since 2006, and remarkably describes the ASBO he was given at the age of 11 as a 'badge of honour' ‘It was the worst Christmas ever and I still don't like to stay in the house by myself. ‘We found a knife in my kid's bedroom which the police told me was there to use on me when I returned.’ The vicious thugs then took the haul to a pawnshop just minutes from Mercer's then girlfriend Gemma Fuller's house before buying drugs and getting stoned on the proceeds. Miss Fuller said: ‘I saw the bags and I could see they were dodgy but I thought just don't ask. ‘I wanted them out of my house so we took them to the pawnshop down the road and got stoned with the money.’ Brothers Ricky and Daniel Oakley, known as the Demon Children from Hell for receiving ASBOs aged 11 and 12, are also featured. Their crimes included racist abuse and swearing, carrying knives, throwing stones, starting fires and letting down tyres in Wolverhampton, West Midlands.

"Billed as Brazil's first player-powered football pitch, a field in a Rio de Janeiro slum has been opened that harnesses the kinetic energy of players' movements to provide night-time illumination. Football legend Pele was on hand for the event in the Morro da Mineira slum, which saw a local youth team put the system to the test. Under the project, sponsored by Royal Dutch Shell, about 200 energy-capturing tiles developed by British startup Pavegen were installed the width and breadth of the field and covered by a layer of AstroTurf. Scroll down for video . A field in Rio de Janeiro has been converted into a high-tech football pitch (pictured). About 200 energy-capturing tiles harness player movements to power lights . Working in conjunction with solar panels also installed around the field, the player-powered tiles feed electricity to a system of floodlights overhead. A safety gadget has been devised for athletes to prevent serious head injuries occurring during sports. The Jolt Sensor device monitors the movement of players, keeping track of any dangerous impacts. Any potential threat causes the clip - worn on the player's head - to vibrate and send a wireless message to referees, as well as parents and coaches on the sidelines. The gadget was created by CEO Ben Harvatine from St. Louis, Missouri after he suffered from concussion himself. It is hoped the Jolt Sensor will help reduce serious concussion by encouraging sportsmen to stop play at the time of injury. The company are aiming to start shipping the product in April 2015, with a Kickstarter campaign currently taking place to raise £36,000 ($60,000). While the head of Pavegen, engineer Laurence Kemball-Cook, did not reveal the exact science behind the tiles, his father and the company's chairman, Richard Kemball-Cook, said they use a system of cogs. When stepped on, the cogs spin like tops and act like generators, he said. Each tile now costs about £310 ($500), but the price is falling as the 35-employee company refines its manufacturing process, Mr Kemball-Cook said. Pavegen has installed similar tiles in train stations in Europe, shopping centres in Australia and Terminal 3 of London's Heathrow Airport, Laurence Kemball-Cook said, but the football field is a first. 'We've effectively turned this community into a real-life science experiment,' he said. 'I believe this technology can be one of the future ways we illuminate our cities.' Similar tiles have been employed in airports, shopping centres and more but this is the first time they have been used on a football field . The new pitch was launched by Brazilian football legend Pele. The technology could also apparently be used to power future cities . Pele got emotional over the project, tearing up as he said he hoped the new field would help spark local kids' interest not only in football but in science. 'My father named me Edson after Thomas Edison,' said the longtime star striker, whose birth name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento. He said he hopes the next generation of Brazilians will help bring the country as much success in science as it has had in football. 'I'm sure that soon the number one scientists in the world are going to be Brazilians,' Pele said.","A field in Rio de Janeiro has been converted into a high-tech football pitch .

"The future of Obamacare was uncertain today after a federal court in Washington, D.C. struck down tax subsidies for Americans who bought insurance through federally-funded exchanges. Within hours the same policy was held up by another court, setting up a Supreme Court showdown. The cases revolve around four words in the Affordable Care Act, which says the tax credits are available to people who enroll through an exchange 'established by the state.' The rulings affect consumers who purchased their . coverage through the federal insurance marketplace - or exchange- that . serves 36 states. If the first ruling is upheld by the nation's high court, more than half of the 8 million Americans who purchased taxpayer-subsidized insurance under the law could see premium increases. Americans who are covered through the federal exchange will see no immediate changes to their policies, however, as the courts sort out the issue. 'In the meantime, to be clear, people getting premium tax credits should know that nothing has . changed. Tax credits remain available,' Department of Justice . spokeswoman Emily Pierce said in a statement after the first ruling. Scroll down for video . Another setback: A federal appeals court delivered a serious setback to President Barack Obama's health care law this morning, potentially derailing subsidies for many low- and middle-income people who have bought policies . In flux: Obamacare enrollees in the 36 states that initially or eventually used the federal healthcare marketplace as opposed to their own could face a steep rate increase now that a federal court has struck down a critical piece of Affordable Care Act legislation . Alabama Alaska ArizonaFloridaGeorgiaIdahoIndianaKansasLouisianaMaineMississippiMissouriMontanaNebraskaNew JerseyNew MexicoNorth CarolinaNorth DakotaOhioOklahomaPennsylvaniaSouth CarolinaSouth DakotaTennesseeTexasUtahVirginiaWisconsinWyoming . A three-judge panel in Washington, D.C. ruled 2-1 that the law, as written, only allows insurance subsidies in states that have set up their own exchanges. The majority opinion concluded that the law, as written, 'unambiguously' restricts subsides to consumers in exchanges established by a state. That would invalidate an Internal Revenue Service regulation that tried to sort out confusing wording in the law by concluding that Congress intended for consumers in all 50 states to have subsidized coverage. The subsidies, in the form of tax . credits, are available to people with annual incomes of up to 400 . percent of the federal poverty level, or $94,200 for a family of four. Causing further uncertainty is a decision by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, that was handed down this afternoon. That court said in a unanimous ruling that tax subsidies are indeed available people who bought their insurance through the federal exchanges. The seemingly arcane . issue is crucial to the success of the health law because most states . have been unable or unwilling to set up their own exchanges. The small business owners who challenged the law through the Washington, D.C. court say a literal reading of its language invalidates the IRS subsidy to people in the federal exchanges. The opponents say that people who would otherwise qualify for the tax credits should be denied that benefit if they buy insurance on a federally facilitated exchange. 'It is implausible to believe that Congress gave the IRS discretion to authorize $150 billion per year in federal spending, particularly when Congress had directly spoken to this issue,' the D.C. Appeals court challengers said in a court filing. 'Major economic decisions like these - indeed, any decisions granting tax credits - must be made unambiguously by Congress itself.' The Obama administration and congressional and state legislative supporters of the Affordable Care Act say the challengers are failing to consider the words of the statute in its entirety. 'It is pretty obvious what the congressional intent was here,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, which was for every qualified American to receive a subsidy 'regardless of whether it was state officials or federal officials running the marketplace.' Pierce said the D.C. ruling is 'at odds with the goal of the law.' 'We believe that this decision is incorrect, inconsistent with . Congressional intent,' the Justice Department official said. The Obama administration and congressional and state legislative supporters of the Affordable Care Act say the challengers to the law are failing to consider the words of the statute in its entirety . An appeals court filing by congressional and state legislative supporters of the Affordable Care Act, similarly argues that 'Congress did not provide that the tax credits would only be available to citizens whose states set up their own exchanges.' Congressional lawmakers and state legislators who are against the law hope that by limiting the subsidies to state exchanges, they can destabilize important aspects of the law, such as the individual mandate requiring most people to buy insurance. Andre . Davis, a  Senior Circuit Court Judge serving on the Richmond court, explained the court's decision this way: . 'If I ask for pizza from Pizza Hut for lunch but clarify that I would . be fine with a pizza from Domino's, and I then specify that I want ham . and pepperoni on my pizza from Pizza Hut, my friend who returns from . Domino's with a ham and pepperoni pizza has still complied with a . literal construction of my lunch order.' Davis and his colleagues voted to uphold what the Obama administration says was the 'intent' of law - subsidies for all qualified Americans, regardless of whether they signed up for coverage through the state or federal exchanges. 'Today’s ruling highlights the ramifications of hastily passing legislation before fully knowing and understanding what it entails and how it will affect people,' House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rogers said in a statement after the D.C. decision was handed down. 'For months, people all across this country have seen firsthand the flawed and ineffective implementation of Obamacare – in their skyrocketing premiums, lost coverage, limited access, and regulatory inefficiencies. 'And today’s decision is only further evidence of the legislation’s failure,' the GOP leader said.' It’s time to listen to the American people, enact real health care reforms, and start over. This law does not work.' Andre . Davis, a  Senior Circuit Court Judge who wrote a concurring opinion on the Richmond court's decision, said he was not going to allow anti-Obamacare advocates to use the court to deny 'millions of Americans desperately-needed health insurance.' Davis admitted that the federal law was 'tortured' and it's construction was 'nonsensical' but it's 'manifest purpose, as revealed by the wholeness and coherence of its text and structure, could not be more clear.' In an attempt to explain the law in lay terms, Davis offered up an equally tortured pizza-based analogy. 'If I ask for pizza from Pizza Hut for lunch but clarify that I would . be fine with a pizza from Domino's, and I then specify that I want ham . and pepperoni on my pizza from Pizza Hut, my friend who returns from . Domino's with a ham and pepperoni pizza has still complied with a . literal construction of my lunch order,' he said. Judges on the D.C. case were Thomas Griffith, an appointee of President George W. Bush; A. Raymond Randolph, an appointee of Bush's father; and Harry Edwards, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter, who dissented. A lower court had ruled that the law's text, structure, purpose, and legislative history make 'clear that Congress intended to make premium tax credits available on both state-run and federally-facilitated Exchanges.' But the appeals court concluded the opposite - that the letter of the law 'unambiguously restricts' the law's subsidies to policies sold through exchanges established by the state. 'An Exchange established by the federal government cannot possibly be ""an Exchange established by the State,"" ' Randolph wrote in a concurring opinion. 'To hold otherwise would be to engage in distortion, not interpretation. 'Only further legislation could accomplish the expansion the government seeks.' In a statement celebrating the D.C. court's decision, Sam Kazman, general counsel for the . Competitive Enterprise Institute, one of the organization's responsible for . funding the lawsuit said, 'The court’s decision puts an end to the power grab that the IRS rule represented. 'And more importantly it reaffirms the fact that we are a nation of laws enacted by Congress rather than rules issued by agenda-driven agencies,' Kazman added. 'Despite all the political calls for the country to 'get with the program and support Obamacare,"" it’s the Framers of the Constitution who have the last word.'","The Washington, D.C court of appeals ruled that the law, as written, only allows insurance subsidies in states that have set up their own exchanges .

"A married TV weatherman has been fired after an inappropriate conversation he had on Facebook with another woman was published on the internet. Geoff Fox was told to leave Fox Connecticut when his bosses became aware of the dialogue, which was of an explicit and sexual nature. The transcripts of his chat with a photographer named Zoel Kennedy were published on a blog and went viral before somebody at the TV studio noticed. Shamed meteorologist Geoff Fox has lost his job after bosses found out about sexually explicit webchats he had been having . Fox had engaged in explicit Facebook exchanges with photographer Zoel Kennedy, right . The conversation appeared under the headline: ‘Married Fox News Weatherman Caught Sexting With a Photographer.’ Fox Connecticut, which has the motto: ‘Trusted, experienced, accurate’ said that Fox’s conduct was ‘inappropriate’ and that he had been asked to leave 18 months into the job. But in a post on his blog ‘My Permanent Record’, Fox wrote to his former bosses imploring them to take him back. He wrote that he was ‘on my knees begging you to reconsider your decision’ and that he would make up for it. He wrote: ‘I had no idea this private conversation would be made public, but what I did was still wrong even if it had remained private. ‘This is a very difficult time for my family. I betrayed a trust with my wife and daughter which won’t be mended quickly. I have made promises to them I intend to keep. ‘Losing my job is also very difficult. ‘You probably noticed I wrote about my work there with a smile on my face.

"Slated: The Apprentice contestant Alex Mills . He is the Apprentice contestant best known for his bizarre plucked eyebrows – dubbed ‘guybrows’. But gravestone salesman Alex Mills has been accused of a shady business past which left hundreds of angry customers in his wake. Meanwhile a former boss claims Mills ‘fleeced’ his company and stole his clients. On the BBC show, Mills has been proud to boast of being just 19 when he set up Prestige Slate. The web-based business sold stone signs  and gravestones. But hundreds of Mills’s customers said their online orders took months to arrive – or did not turn up at all. Trading Standards in the Vale of Glamorgan, where Prestige Slate was based, confirmed they had received 146 official complaints since it was formed in 2010. Mills was a director of the company until January this year. Cardiff-based Mills founded Prestige Slate after leaving  a job as an office manager at a stone and masonry business in the Welsh capital. And his former boss, who asked not to be named, said: ‘He stole all my information, all my artwork, the pictures from my website and even a lot of my customers.’ He said Mills had ‘basically fleeced’ his business. In a statement, Mills said:  ‘I dispute this serious allegation and will take this up with my former employer.’ Catherine Watts, a musician from Windsor, ordered  a sign from Prestige Slate in 2011 and said she had been ‘completely hoodwinked’. She said: ‘I paid online and waited for it to arrive. I am still waiting two years on. ‘I hate the idea that so many people were taken in by this man and that he’s now on TV making out that he is a successful businessman.’ Scroll down for video . TV star: Alex Mills in the boardroom with rival Natalie Panayi . It was a sentiment echoed by 53-year-old Spencer Lyon, who spent £350 on a specially designed sign for his new home which took six months to arrive. Swathes of other Prestige Slate  customers have taken to online forums to vent their frustration.Trading Standards moved against the firm under the Enterprise Act – which gives officials the power to require undertakings that ‘certain behaviours will not continue’. Then an online contributor identifying himself as ‘The real Alexander Mills’ posted a lengthy rebuttal, claiming the postings had been fabricated by his disgruntled former employer, a claim that he denies. Mills described Prestige Slate as  ‘a credible and brilliant business’  and added: ‘We were supplying over 10,000 bespoke orders a year to both the general public and prestigious  clients – which included the Royal Family, The London 2012 Olympic comity [sic] and more.’ Under fire: Alex Mills, pictured on the far right, boasted on The Apprentice that he was just 19 when he set up his gravestone company . Mills, 22, has often boasted to his fellow Apprentice contestants of his significant success as a businessman. But accounts lodged at Companies House reveal the net worth of Prestige Slate was only £555 in 2011 and that the company had a modest annual turnover of about £28,000. Mills stepped down as a Prestige director after transferring all his shares to a businesses partner, who now operates the company under a new guise, Premier Slate. Not all he seems?: Alex Mills was confident in the boardroom, on far right, but he seems to have swathes of angry customers . Mills is one of the final seven contestants in the ninth season of The Apprentice, battling to secure a £250,000 business investment from tycoon Lord Sugar. Last night a spokesman for Mills said: ‘Alex Mills takes such allegations and complaints very seriously and is concerned that these have been made against a reputable company. 'During his time at Prestige Slate the company took 18,419 orders – and the average amount of complaints received during his time as director and part owner was less than one per cent.’","Alex Mills boasted that he was 19 when he set up Prestige Slate .

"Former Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez believes his old club will be losing their 'red heartbeat' when Steven Gerrard leaves at the end of the season. The Napoli coach added his own tribute to Gerrard, saying the 'Miracle of Istanbul' - the 2005 Champions League final victory against AC Milan from 3-0 down - would not have been possible without the inspirational captain. Benitez posted a poignant message to Gerrard on his personal website after the announcement that the 34-year-old would be leaving his hometown club Liverpool at the end of the season. Rafa Benitez (right, pictured in 2005) says Liverpool will miss their 'heartbeat' when Steven Gerrard leaves . The pair celebrate winning the 2006 FA Cup against West Ham at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff . 'If I could think of one word to describe Steven Gerrard it would be passion,' said Benitez. 'He was my captain at Liverpool Football Club for six seasons and we worked closely together to develop a side that could win the Premier League and the Champions League. 'Without Steven we could not have achieved the incredible success that we enjoyed throughout those years. 'The ""Miracle of Istanbul"" was only possible because of him. Steven inspired the team that night, refusing to believe it was an impossible job at half time against AC Milan. He led the charge with a wonderful headed goal and showed the determination needed to win a penalty for our third goal. 'And when called upon to sacrifice his position on the pitch for the team he didn’t hesitate.

"Betting man: Reclusive long-term gambler Nick Newlife bequeathed his adventurous Federer bet to Oxfam before he died in 2009 . A tennis fan who predicted Roger Federer's record-equaling Wimbledon triumph almost a decade ago has helped win Oxfam £100,000. Nick Newlife placed an adventurous £1,520 wager in 2003 on the Swiss maestro to win Wimbledon seven times by 2019, at odds of 66-1. Mr Newlife, who died three years ago, bequeathed the betting slip to the charity in his will, with Oxfam bosses watching in delight as the bold gamble yesterday won them the six-figure sum. After Mr Newlife passed away in 2009 aged 69, Oxfam narrowly missed out on the prize money when Federer crashed out at SW19 last year. Andy Murray's misery at the All England Club has become Oxfam's joy, however, as the ticket will now see them handed a £101,840 donation. Mr Newlife, of Tackley, Oxon., died in 2009 with no family and friends and left his worldly belongings to the Oxfam charity - including the betting slip. He was a recluse and asked neighbours to place bets for him because he was convinced bookies had worked out his system. The bearded bachelor was a landlord who lived alone in a three bedroomed semi-detached house set in a picture postcard countryside village. Neighbour at the time Gavin Cowan, 56, said: 'Mr Newlife came to me and got me to help him install a computer - he said he wanted to place a series of long-term bets. 'He said that it was all going to charity. At the time he was tipping Lewis Hamilton to become a world champion before he had become a big star. 'Nick said he had made predictions about several people over the years and wanted me to lay some of his bets. Gamble: Federer scooped his seventh Wimbledon title yesterday, earning Oxfam £101, 840 from Mr Newlife's 2003 wager . Record-equaling: As well as scooping Oxfam £100,000, Federer's win saw him equal Pete Sampras on seven Wimbledon triumphs . William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe said: 'This is a unique situation in my 40-year experience of the bookmaking world. 'Mr Newlife's bet could land six-figure winnings from beyond the grave, and in sporting terms Roger Federer came back from the dead to keep the dream alive for Oxfam and all his fans.' Oxfam spokesman Stuart Fowkes said: 'Legacies amount to 10 per cent of our total income from individuals, so they're essential to us, and as this case proves they can come in all shapes and sizes.' Mr Newlife, a recluse who rarely washed or left his home, got friends to place his bets for him as he was 'convinced bookies had worked out his system' Gambling specialist: Mr Newlife spent a lot of time making long-term sporting bets at his Oxfordshire home before his death in 2009 .","Nick Newlife placed £1,520 wager on Federer in 2003 .

"A security expert claims to have uncovered a major flaw in the traffic system in in major cities around the world including London and New York. Cesar Cerrudo, an Argentinian security researcher with IoActive, says he can control traffic lights and even reroute traffic. He discovered is was possible to control the sensors embedded into the road and used by control systems to monitor traffic. Scroll down for video . The Argentinian security expert claims to have uncovered a major flaw in the traffic system in in major cities around the world including London and New York. Sensys has 250+ customers in 45 US states and 10 countriesImportant US cities have deployments: New York, Washington DC, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle, etc.50,000+ devices deployed worldwide (most of them in the US)Countries include US, United Kingdom, China, Canada, Australia, France, etc. For instance, some UK cities with deployments: London, Shropshire, Slough, Bournemouth, Aberdeen, Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council, Belfast, etc. Australia has a big deployment on one of the most important and modern freeways. He was able to take control of the sensors –Sensys Networks VDS240 wireless vehicle detection systems– which are installed in 40 U.S. cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Washington, DC, as well as in nine other countries. The system is comprised of magnetic sensors embedded in roadways that wirelessly collect data. MailOnline contacted Sensys, but it did not respond to requests. Cerrudo saiys he was inspired by the movie Die Hard, which sees hackers contolling a city's traffic. 'Probably many of you have watched scenes from 'Live Free or Die Hard' (Die Hard 4) where 'terrorist hackers' manipulate traffic signals by just hitting Enter or typing a few keys,' he wrote in a blog post revealing the hack. Cesar Cerrudo, an Argentinian security researcher with IoActive, showing thre system off in Washington, where it was used to influence traffic patterns. 'I wanted to do that! I started to look around, and while I couldn't exactly do the same thing (too Hollywood style!), I got pretty close. 'By exploiting the vulnerabilities I found, an attacker could cause traffic jams and problems at intersections, freeways, highways.' Cerrudo said that once he bought a sensor for himself, he found it was relatively easy to control. 'After getting the devices, it wasn't difficult to find vulnerabilities. 'The vulnerabilities I found allow anyone to take complete control of the devices and send fake data to traffic control systems.

'What I would like to mention is that the vendor was contacted a long time ago (September 2013) through ICS-CERT (the initial report to ICS-CERT was sent on July 31st, 2013). I was told by ICS-CERT that the vendor said that they didn't think the issues were critical nor even important. 'Another excuse the vendor provided is that because the devices don't control traffic lights, there is no need for security. 'This is crazy, because while the devices don't directly control traffic control systems, they have a direct influence on the actions and decisions of these systems.' He says he will now reveal details of the hack at a conference next month after the firm failed to address the problem. 'This should be another wake up call for governments to evaluate the security of devices/products before using them in critical infrastructure, and also a request to providers of government devices/products to take security and security vulnerability reports seriously,' he said. 'By exploiting the vulnerabilities I found, an attacker could cause traffic jams and problems at intersections, freeways, highways, etc. 'It’s also possible to cause electronic signs to display incorrect speed limits and instructions and to make ramp meters allow cars on the freeway faster or slower than needed.

"Harry Kane has been in superb form for Tottenham this season, scoring goals and winning the hearts of Spurs supporters with his all-action displays. The 21-year-old netted twice in his side's 5-3 victory against Chelsea on New Year's Day but, as Chris Deeley of 90min.com tells us, it's not just his goals which have endeared Kane to the White Hart Lane faithful. 5.50pm, Thursday January 1. Chelsea lead Spurs 1-0, the natural order of things is in place and Harry Kane is about to be shut out by another top-class defence. 7.30pm, same day. Spurs have beaten Chelsea 5-3, Kane has scored twice, bagged an assist and been fouled for a penalty. He's a Spurs legend. That might sound a little harsh on the 21-year-old, since he's been making fans around White Hart Lane sit up and take notice all season,  but it's only been in the last month or two that he's got his league chances. And boy, has he taken them. Tottenham striker Harry Kane (left) unleashes a powerful effort at goal to make it 1-1 against Chelsea . Kane celebrates after scoring the first of his two goals against Jose Mourinho's side on New Year's Day . I was having a conversation with another Spurs fan last season, when Kane was being started ahead of Adebayor and Soldado by Tim Sherwood, and we both came to the same conclusion - Kane would be one of the most popular players at the club, if only he was actually worth his place in the side. Kane-aldo, as he must now surely be known, is the perfect 'club man'. He's a local boy, growing up only a few miles from the ground and a story about him shirking training would be more shocking than 10,000 volts straight to the eyeballs. His heart and soul are in the team, but he always lacked an edge. It's fair to say that, as 2014 came to a close, he found his edge. England Under 21 striker Kane guides his shot past Thibaut Courtois for his second goal of the game . Nacer Chadli gives Kane a hug after the former Arsenal youngster had given Spurs a 4-1 lead against Chelsea . It's not just the sudden explosion of raw talent and terrifying bursts forward that have thrust him into the limelight - only one man covered more distance than Kane's 11.35km at White Hart Lane on Thursday. If Kane was like another excellent Spurs striker of recent years, Dimitar Berbatov, this would be a different situation. Berbatov was easy to like, sure. Easy to admire, too. But his lazy style and aloofness tended to keep him one step removed from the fans. Kane's constant running and tendency to wear his heart on his sleeve, though, changes things. Suddenly, he's one of us. When his form drops off - and it will, nobody can keep this scoring rate up forever - it won't be through lack of interest or effort. Kane, pictured tussling with Chelsea's Nemanja Matic, has impressed supporters with his effort and desire . It's the same reason that another man in the news this week has become a legend at his club. Sometimes Steven Gerrard plays badly, but it's never because he doesn't care. That's comforting for fans. That's the kind of dedication that inspires love from fans towards players. I don't love Harry Kane for his goals. The goals are just a by-product of the reason that I and so many other Spurs fans love him. We love him for his heart. And we love him because when he's out on the pitch, he's showing us how much he loves us back.

"Watching from his seat up in the Villa Park stands, Alan Pardew will know Crystal Palace need to perform better than this once he steps down to the dug-out. Keith Millen oversaw a second away point in succession as caretaker manager — not to be sniffed at in their predicament. But, quite simply, Pardew must make Palace a greater attacking force. Brad Guzan was not called into meaningful action once. Pardew congratulated the players and Millen in the dressing room afterwards for their organisation, but told them sparkle is needed to survive.

Pardew is expected to take his first Palace training session on Friday and Millen has been told his services are wanted by the incoming manager, who could be seen in the directors’ box as the match meandered along. No need for notebooks to record the details of this dire game. Aston Villa’s role cannot be discounted. They continued to pass the ball as instructed by Paul Lambert but moves broke down far too easily, far too frequently. Their goal tally stays stock still at 11 in 20 Premier League games, the lowest in England’s top four divisions. They have failed to score in 12 matches in all competitions this season. There were boos at half-time. Louder boos at the final whistle. In the first half, Alan Hutton was presented with an excellent chance to score his second of the season when Aly Cissokho’s cross fell kindly. But Julian Speroni spread himself large and blocked the shot brilliantly. Ron Vlaar was then forced from the field having injured his knee in a collision with Wilfried Zaha. He suffered a similar problem for Holland at the World Cup, Lambert said afterwards. Yannick Bolasie sprinted clear like a 100m runner, away from Jores Okore and across Ciaran Clark, but sent his shot smacking against the crossbar. Alas, that was to be as exciting as it got. The rest of the game an affair void of speed, creativity or flow. Palace had failed to score in four of their last five away games so another blank here was no shock.

"Liverpool legend Steve Nicol has led the chorus of disapproval in the United States after Frank Lampard delayed his move to New York City to remain with Manchester City. Nicol, who was the coach of fellow MLS side New England Revolution until 2011,  told ESPN: 'It is a disaster for that new franchise, a disaster for the MLS.' On Wednesday night, it was confirmed that Lampard would remain in Manchester until the end of the season after City and their sister club in New York thrashed out a deal - which was then approved by the Premier League board. He is eligible to face Sunderland on New Year's Day. Frank Lampard has extended his loan deal at Manchester City until the end of the season . Lampard signed for Manuel Pellegrini's side after agreeing to join New York City in July . Lampard is eligible to face Sunderland on New Year's Day after the extension was agreed by Premier League . Steve Nicol is the former head coach of MLS side New England Revolution . Lampard has spent the first half of the season on a short-term deal at City after signing a pre-contract agreement with sister outfit New York  that was due to commence on January 1. He remains a contracted Manchester City player and is not at this moment associated with the New York side. In the States, it appears to have been viewed as a blow to the credibility of the American enterprise as the needs of Manchester appear to have been placed above the growth of New York City. Lampard was unveiled as one of their signature marquee signings last summer but he may now not arrive until several months into the MLS campaign. It has provoked a furious reaction from a New York City independent supporters' group, The Third Rail, who have released the following statement: 'On behalf of the Third Rail, we would like to publicly denounce City Football Group’s and Frank Lampard’s decision to extend his loan to Manchester City until the end of the Premier League season. 'Many fans, including our members, decided to support the team, committed to season tickets, and bought merchandise under the impression that Frank Lampard would be playing for New York City Football Club, not Manchester City. 'Many of those fans are rightly outraged by this decision, and we support any course of action they take to voice their discontent over this decision. Lampard speaks at a news conference, where he was introduced as New York player in July . Lampard poses in New York training kit in front of the City after agreeing to move to the MLS franchise . 'Our support for our ownership group has been unwavering until now, but this we cannot support. We reject out of hand any suggestion that NYCFC is in any way secondary to Manchester City FC, regardless of the source, and are disappointed that City Football Group would give such an appearance.' His exact starting date in New York remains to be decided. On Wednesday evening, City sources were not ruling out the possibility that Lampard could yet return to New York for the beginning of the MLS season in March or later on in Manchester City's season. For that to happen, the two clubs would have to agree a loan deal from Manchester City or a permanent transfer. It appears to be a possibility that remains open for discussion, although it seems most likely that Lampard will remain in Manchester as long as Manuel Pellegrini believes he has a role to play at the club. A New York City statement said: 'His exact starting date with New York City FC will be confirmed as the EPL and MLS seasons unfold. All parties remain in continuing dialogue to create the best outcome for all. The Third Rail, who claim to be the first independent supporters group for New York City FC, reacted furiously to the news on Friday.

"Eliot Spitzer's ex-wife finally has something to smile about after the details of her multimillion-dollar divorce settlement from the disgraced 'Luv Guv' were revealed today. Silda Wall Spitzer gets a $7.5million payout and to keep her luxury Fifth Avenue apartment overlooking Central Park in Manhattan as part of the deal.

Other perks of the 56-year-old's deal include a new car 'no more than every five years', a housekeeper, accountant, unspecified 'entertainment and activities expenses', a $100,000-per-year charity donation and a part-time assistant. Mr Spitzer will also take care of his former wife's medical insurance and health care. Although the multimillionaire does not have to pay child support to Silda for their daughters - Elyssa, 24, Sarabeth, 21, and Jenna, 19 - he must take care of 100 per cent of their medical, dental and college expenses. The former couple agreed to shared use of their $5million upstate New York farm. However the divorce agreement states that the 'choice of visitors' cannot cause their daughters any emotional distress or embarrassment. The Spitzers divorce was finalized in February this year and it was agreed that Silda would receive the first $1million within 180 days. Another $1million will follow on the service of their divorce judgement and then at least $500,000 ever year unless the former politician decides to pay his ex a lump sum. The annual $240,000 maintenance payment will come to Silda after her former husband has paid the taxes. It will continue until she either remarries or dies.

"Swiss artist H.R. Giger at his house in Zurich, Switzerland. Giger, who designed the creature in Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror classic Alien, has died at age 74 from injuries suffered in a fall . The Oscar-winning artist who designed . the creature in Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror classic Alien has died at . age 74 from injuries suffered in a fall, his museum said today. Hans Giger died in a hospital yesterday, Sandra Mivelaz, administrator of the H.R. Giger museum in Gruyeres, western Switzerland, said. Giger's . works, often showing macabre scenes of humans and machines fused into . hellish hybrids, influenced a generation of movie directors and inspired . an enduring fashion for 'biomechanical' tattoos. 'My . paintings seem to make the strongest impression on people who are, . well, who are crazy,' Giger said in a 1979 interview with Starlog . magazine. 'If they like my work they are creative ... or they are . crazy.' Born Hans Ruedi . Giger on February 5, 1940, in the south-eastern Swiss town of Chur, he . trained as an industrial designer because his father insisted that he . learn a proper trade. His . mother Melli, to whom he showed a lifelong devotion, encouraged her . son's passion for art, despite his unconventional obsession with death . and sex that found little appreciation in 1960s rural Switzerland. The . host of one of his early exhibitions was reportedly forced to wipe the . spit of disgusted neighbors off the gallery windows every morning. A . collection of his early work, 'Ein Fressen fuer den Psychiater' - 'A . Feast for the Psychiatrist' - used mainly ink and oil, but Giger soon . discovered the airbrush and pioneered his own freehand technique. He . also created sculptures, preferably using metal, styorofoam and plastic. Giger's vision of a human . skull encased in a machine appeared on the cover of 'Brain Salad . Surgery,' a 1973 album by the rock band Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Along . with his design for Debbie Harry's solo album, 'Koo Koo' (1981), it . featured in a 1991 Rolling Stone magazine list of the top 100 album . covers of all time. Giger . went on to work as a set designer for Hollywood, contributing to . 'Species,' 'Poltergeist II,' 'Dune,' and most famously 'Alien,' for . which he received a 1979 Academy Award for special effects. Frequently . frustrated by the Hollywood production process, Giger eventually . disowned much of the work that was attributed to him on screen. Giger inspired the alien in Ridley Scott's Alien, and won an Oscar for it. Here the beast faces up to Sigourney Weaver . The alien was used in a series of spin-off films, including this, from Alien Vs Predator . Giger also designed the sets from the 1984 David Lynch film Dune, starring Kyle MacLachlan . The . image of a brooding, mysterious artist was nurtured by Giger working . only at night, keeping his curtains permanently drawn and dressing . mainly in black - a habit he acquired while working as a draftsman . because it made Indian ink stains stand out less on his clothes. While . his work was commercially successful, critics derided it as morbid . kitsch. His designs were exhibited more frequently in 'Alien' theme . bars, short-lived Giger museums and at tattoo conventions than in . established art galleries. Swiss artist H.R.

In 1998, Giger acquired the Chateau St. Germain in Gruyeres and established the H.R. Giger Museum. Giger was pleased that his idea of machines with human skin became a popular motif in body art. 'The . greatest compliment is when people get tattooed with my work, whether . it's done well or not,' he told Seconds magazine in 1994. 'To wear . something like that your whole life is the largest compliment someone . can pay to you as an artist.'
