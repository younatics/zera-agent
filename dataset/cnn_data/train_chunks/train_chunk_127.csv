"(CNN) -- Thirty years ago, on the basis of ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner,"" Ridley Scott looked as if he might become the most important sci-fi director of his time. No matter that Harrison Ford played Rick Deckard in ""Blade Runner,"" the way Scott made that picture it was as if ""Star Wars"" never happened. Of course ""Blade Runner"" flopped on its initial theatrical release, and ever since Scott has restricted his time-travelling to the other direction: period epics like ""Gladiator,"" ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and ""Robin Hood."" Until now that is, when the 74-year-old has decided to go back to the future, with a movie that's a prequel, sort of, to his first big hit ""Alien."" Ironically ""Prometheus"" starts in the far-distant past, and though the opening shots look like another world it turns out we're seeing a primordial Isle of Skye, a remote outcrop off the coast of Scotland. Flash forward several millennia, 77 years from today. Cave paintings discovered at this location convince an aging businessman to bankroll a wildly ambitious interstellar mission. It's said that ""Star Trek"" creator Gene Roddenberry only ever had one story idea, the one where Kirk and crew met their maker. It's giving nothing away to say that Roddenberry would have liked ""Prometheus."" So too Erich von Daniken, whose ""Chariots of the Gods"" is an obvious influence. As in ""Alien,"" a small crew wakes up from cryogenic sleep. The ship has been tended by a humanoid robot, David (Michael Fassbender), who's been boning up on ancient languages and rewatching ""Lawrence of Arabia"" during transit. If he models his forelock on Peter O'Toole, it seems like a good bet he's modulated his soft, impassive vocal pattern on HAL, the ship computer in ""2001."" You may not believe it, but next to nothing happens in the movie's first hour and more. And this is probably the most effective and impressive part of the ride. The slow, atmospheric ascent to the top of the roller coaster as scientist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and colleagues (they include Sean Harris, Kate Dickie, Idris Elba and Charlize Theron) explore the mysterious planet LV-223. Not many filmmakers have the nerve to make us wait these days, but Scott knows his audience is primed for exploding chests and toothy extraterrestrials, and he enjoys playing on our trepidation while showing off the stunning production design. Even so, before long the movie feels rushed. When things start to slide for Shaw and her partner (Logan Marshall-Green) it's like watching a drag racer spinning its wheels, kicking up dust to hit the checkered flag at 90 miles per hour. Screenwriters Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof have devised some ingeniously nasty set pieces, but after that deliberate build-up it's disappointing that it still feels like corners are being cut. There is nothing to match the shocking biological horror that erupted in ""Alien,"" but you couldn't accuse them of giving up without a fight. Scott has assembled an engagingly rough and ready, workmanlike cast, but doesn't give them anything interesting to say for themselves. Theron's brittle executive officer is just too close to caricature, and she's not the only one either. Although she's likeable enough I can't see Noomi Rapace's Shaw proving as durable as Sigourney Weaver's Ripley either. The movie's stand out is clearly Fassbender. So it's too bad David's actions don't make a lot of sense, at least not to this perplexed viewer, who couldn't be sure if the robot was following orders or following his own agenda. The more you think about this movie, the less it stands up. Scott's philosophical grandstanding is just that; there's less here than meets the eye. Mind you, it is spectacular. Dariusz Wolski's visuals are lustrous to behold, the CGI is amazing, and Scott proves adept at handling 3D. This is one sci-fi movie with a palpable sense of space. And I'll say this: even if the movie's logic ultimately spirals down into a vortex of hysteria, horror and hokum, I enjoyed the bulldozer intensity of the climax, which barely keeps a lid on the crackpot cult movie that's wrestling for the soul of this multimillion dollar blockbuster. It may not be quite the ""Alien"" resurrection we were all hoping for -- Wait! They already used that one! -- but it's at least as good as the second and third sequels.","In ""Prometheus"" Elizabeth Shaw and colleagues explore the mysterious planet LV-223 .

"Milwaukee (CNN) -- My 91-year-old mother finds a lot of things aggravating. Drugstores that run out of things that are on sale. Typos. And phone calls from Mitt Romney. Quite a few phone calls from Mitt Romney. Also from Rick Santorum. And other people advocating for each of them. She's had enough. Also the television ads. Do they have to run so many? This is one time my mother and the rest of Wisconsin appear to be in sync. The political atmosphere that has prevailed since February 2011, when Republican Gov. Scott Walker launched his proposals to strip public employee unions of almost all of their power, remains supercharged. But as one big event follows another, with more coming soon, there is also a widespread sense that it's all getting to be too much. How much can one state take? A sense of political fatigue appears to be growing just as events are coming to a peak. Actually, they're coming to quite a few peaks, which is part of the problem. There's the peak that comes Tuesday, with the Republican presidential primary. Romney and Santorum, the two front-runners, have been up and down, particularly in the eastern half of Wisconsin the last few days. It's been rare in the last few decades for a Wisconsin primary to be consequential, but the general assumption is that if Romney beats Santorum, Romney will pretty much seal the deal as the GOP nominee. So this is kind of a big deal. Then there's the peak that will come over the next few weeks: a recall election in which Walker, who took office only 15 months ago, will face a Democratic challenger, quite possibly the person he defeated in November 2010, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. The recall, only the third for a governor in American history, was ordered after more than 900,000 people signed petitions. A Democratic primary with -- as it appears at the moment -- four candidates will be held on May 8, with a final election June 5. At the same time in recall-happy Wisconsin, Walker's lieutenant governor, Rebecca Kleefisch, will also face a recall, making her the first lieutenant governor in American history in that situation, and four state Senate seats held by Republicans will be involved in recall elections, with control of that house of the Wisconsin Legislature in the balance. Then there are the fall elections, with the strong prospect that Wisconsin will be a key battleground between President Barack Obama and the Republican nominee. Then there's an open seat for the U.S. Senate. Democratic Sen. Herb Kohl is retiring, and a heated Republican primary for that nomination is shaping up for August. So that totals up to major election days in April, May, June, August and November. It also means the prospect -- already being demonstrated -- of amazing amounts of campaign spending, much of it by independent groups; of robocalls inundating people across the state, and a level of television advertising that some experts say may leave Wisconsin viewers in the unenviable position of being exposed to more political spots in one year than virtually anyone else in U.S. history. It adds up to more than $100 million worth of political advertising in one state over 11 months. If one were to rank these election dates in order of interest, the Walker recall would be at the top of the stack. Tuesday's presidential primary may be a big deal in the national perspective, but it has been a relatively low-passion event at ground level. According to polls, Romney trailed Santorum in February; he was ahead in the last few days. Wisconsin has a large number of conservative voters, but the religiously motivated aren't as numerous as they are in Southern states, where Santorum has done well. Plus, it appears many Wisconsin Republicans, starting with powerful Rep. Paul Ryan, want to get the nomination race over and unite behind Romney. As in other places, support of Romney doesn't appear to mean high enthusiasm. The Walker recall, on the other hand, carries huge implications for Wisconsin's political climate for at least the next few years. Walker remains a polarizing figure like few who have ever crossed the landscape of the state. In almost any conversation with people who are not directly working in campaigns, the exhaustion factor comes up quickly. When will it all end? How many more ads can we take? How bottomless are the checkbooks of donors, especially the small- to midlevel donors? These concerns are sort of like the old Yogi Berra line about the restaurant that nobody goes to anymore because it's too crowded. Wisconsinites are worn down precisely because so much is going on, so many people are in various forms of uproar, and the parade of amazing political events doesn't seem to stop. But in a state that historically has had very high voter turnout, one of the things that will be important to watch in coming months is how many people come to the polls. Will turnout begin to droop? If so, to whose advantage or disadvantage? At what point does fatigue become a major player on the battlefield of Wisconsin politics, and a 91-year-old woman who would prefer some political peace and quiet become a key opinion leader?

"Woburn, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Cars and commercial airplanes move the vast majority of us around, but as any frequent traveler knows, both of these modes of transportation have their limitations. Cars are restricted to highway speeds and the sometimes circuitous routes of our road infrastructure. Commercial airlines, with their high security, fixed schedules and hub-and-spoke system, offset their fast point-to-point speed with large amounts of waiting, and you still have to drive on each end of the flight. Personal aviation, where pilots operate small private aircraft, offers an alternative with the potential to get you where you need to be quickly, safely and on your own schedule, but it, too, comes with limitations. We founded Terrafugia in 2006 to develop a solution to many of the barriers to the more widespread use of personal aviation: Our work led to the development of a new kind of aircraft, which we call the ""Transition."" Watch Anna Dietrich's TED Talk . I co-founded Terrafugia as a graduate student in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT. A pilot myself, I was interested in taking advantage of the new Sport Pilot and Light Sport Aircraft Rule that the Federal Aviation Administration created in 2004 to lower the barriers to entry to personal aviation for both pilots and manufacturers. We used the resources that were available at MIT and with our local Experimental Aircraft Association chapter to start building a team and a business while doing early conceptual design on the Transition itself.  Since the beginning I've enjoyed applying engineering problem-solving skills to the challenge of company creation: In many ways, starting a company is just a big systems engineering design-within-constraints problem. I'm also looking forward to fulfilling a dream I've had since grade school by being able to fly something that I've both helped design and build when I take the Transition out for the first time. TED.com: Paul MacCready flies on solar wings . In describing the Transition, we use the phrase ""roadable aircraft"" instead of ""flying car"" to help set expectations for what it is and how it will be used. As a light-sport aircraft, the Transition must be operated in and out of designated airports by certificated pilots. (Because this aircraft is easy to fly, the appropriate pilot license can be earned in weeks, instead of months or years.) Unlike any other airplane on the market today, the Transition can fold its wings on command, shift power from the propeller to the rear wheels and drive as a fully street-legal vehicle on any road in the United States. Designed to meet the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, it is the first light airplane to incorporate automotive-style safety features such as dash-mounted airbags, a passenger safety cage and energy-absorbing crumple zones. For added safety in flight, there is a full vehicle parachute for use in case of emergency. While the Transition is not intended to replace the modern automobile, it does have the potential to improve travel significantly. At less than 7 feet tall, it will fit in most garages, saving rent on hangar space. It runs on unleaded gasoline instead of more expensive aviation fuel. TED.com: Bert Rutan on the future of space . The Transition can also use any of more than 5,000 public-use airports in the United States, letting the operator avoid the congestion of commercial hub airports while also flying over traffic jams on the roadways. After landing, being able to drive to your final destination solves the ""last mile problem."" Flying at 100 mph and traveling point-to-point in the air, on your own schedule, the Transition can save hours off the typical regional trip. And what about the weather, something that often halts small airplane travel? With a Transition, if the weather gets bad, fold the wings without leaving the cockpit and continue the trip safely on the road. If the weather clears later in the trip, drive to a nearby airport and get back in the air. In short, the Transition addresses the cost barriers, weather sensitivity, long door-to-door travel time and lack of ground mobility that has thus far kept personal aviation from playing a significant role in meeting our transportation needs. As of early 2012, Terrafugia is conducting an extensive set of tests on our two production prototype aircraft. These aircraft incorporate all of the improvements that we were able to make following the completion of flight and drive testing of our proof of concept aircraft in 2009. Covering both flight and road use, we're using a combination of powered testing, static load testing and sophisticated analysis and simulation to demonstrate compliance to the light-sport aircraft standards as well as the applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. If this testing program continues to go well, we could be delivering the first aircraft to private owners around the end of this year. While it is not the ""flying car"" of ""The Jetsons,"" the Transition is a state-of-the-art solution to improving personal mobility today. From the reactions we get to the aircraft whenever we have the opportunity to share it, it's clear that even with its practical approach, the Transition is rekindling a shared dream of more personal freedom. As with many disruptive products, it is difficult to predict where this technology will take us in the future, but I believe that the Transition is the next major step in improving how we navigate our world.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- If Sunday's by-election in Myanmar is deemed to be free and fair, it will cap off a startling about-turn by the former military men currently running the country. For the first time ever, credible alternatives to the ruling party appeared on the ballot, including pro-democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi, who was serving the final days of her house arrest during the general election in November 2010, which was widely derided as a sham. This by-election, analysts say, will be the first real test of the government's commitment to removing the fear and paranoia of citizens silenced by nearly five decades of military rule. The vote was called to fill seats vacated by the promotion of parliamentarians to the Cabinet and other posts last year. ""It's hugely important and it will provide a new semi-democratic political system with an opportunity to show that it has ambition to become more transparent, more inclusive and thus more democratic,"" said Nicholas Farrelly, a research fellow at the Australian National University. In the weeks leading to Sunday's vote, Suu Kyi has traveled up and down the country, rallying support for her once-banned National League for Democracy party (NLD). Opening up Myanmar . Just the sight of her brazenly pitching her policies to huge crowds of people has emboldened many to dare to believe that democracy might be possible. ""I'm so happy Suu Kyi is free and campaigning... she will bring a better future for this country,"" said Nu Wary Lwin, who went to see Suu Kyi in Myaungmya, in the country's south. But others are more wary about what the future holds. ""I have more freedom to say what I think now, but Aung San Suu Kyi has to remain free and do more so we all have a better life than this,"" said another prospective voter, Din Dun Zayawin. Analysts say Suu Kyi is all but guaranteed to win her seat in Kawhmu, south of Yangon, one of 45 up for grabs in the by-election. ""It would be a major shock if she did not win her own seat. But I think we have to prepare people for the expectations that the NLD will not win all seats in the by-election,"" said Jim Della-Giacoma, a project director at International Crisis Group. Della-Giacoma stresses that the NLD does have competition, not least from the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), which was formed less than two years ago to contest the 2010 election by former general, and now president, Thein Sein, and a number of other former military leaders. ""The USDP has shown it is able to recruit good candidates, local figures who are popular in their own right. They've got something to lose here so they're competing, like governments everywhere,"" he added. However, others say that it doesn't matter who wins what seats in this by-election. After attracting international condemnation for manipulating the voting process two years ago, Myanmar's leaders know the real test of this election is proving to the world they can conduct a legitimate vote. ""I don't think it matters how many seats the NLD wins. I think the only thing that really matters whether it's free or fair. I don't think the people of Burma care about how many seats the NLD wins either. What they want to know is whether the next set of elections, the national elections (expected in 2015), are also going to be free and fair,"" said Monique Skidmore, of the University of Canberra. The staggering pace of change in Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, has shocked and thrilled observers. In the past 12 months, the country has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners, secured a ceasefire with Karen rebels and has agreed to negotiate with other ethnic rebel groups. Freer press rules have encouraged the proliferation of journals and magazines. ""There's a whole slew of information out there for voters that just wasn't there in 2010,"" said Della-Giacoma. Unlike the 2010 general election, international observers have been invited to monitor the vote. The U.S., European Union and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are sending monitors, as are Japan, Canada and Australia. However, analysts say the sheer number and spread of polling booths across the country will make it impossible for international monitors to ensure an honest count. ""We just have to take Thein Sein at his word and have a look at the outcome,"" said Skidmore. ""There is no way the Burmese people would ever vote overwhelmingly for the military party and so we'll know on the basis of who is elected whether it was free and fair."" So far, Myanmar's efforts to thaw its frosty relations with the rest of the world have been warmly welcomed and rewarded. In recent months, a steady procession of foreign ministers has visited the country and, in February, the EU lifted a travel ban on Myanmar officials. There have been hints too that a free and fair vote on Sunday will lead to the relatively swift unraveling of sanctions that have long choked the country's economy. ""The rapid reappraisal of sanctions is likely to come almost immediately,"" said Farrelly. ""(However) there will be those who will consider the sanctions that are in place should only be rescinded when certain other benchmarks are met. There will be some, I'm sure, who will argue that it's terrific that Aung San Suu Kyi now can play an active role in Burma's politics, but that franchise needs to be extended to all ethnic minority groups as well."" As a member of parliament, Suu Kyi would also be expected to be free to travel outside Myanmar -- and more importantly to return -- something that wasn't possible during her long years of repression and confinement. Another potential shift is underway as well, said Skidmore. Thousands of Burmese living in exile around the world are watching and waiting for a clear sign that it is safe to return home. For many, that clear sign could come with Sunday's vote. ""The Burmese chat rooms are full of discussion about when is it safe to go back and what will we do when we go back,"" she added. ""Already we're starting to see exiled media organizations coming back into the country and so the time is getting closer and closer for a whole generation of Burmese people to return home. And that's going to be a very exciting aspect of Burma's next democratic phase as well."" CNN's Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.","Vote called to fill seats vacated by the promotion of parliamentarians to the Cabinet and other posts .

"(CNN) -- A locksmith hired to help in the process of evicting a California tenant was shot dead, along with the sheriff's deputy serving the eviction notice, police said Friday. In addition to the two men shot dead, a lone body has been found inside the charred ruins of the Modesto, California, apartment building, Modesto police Officer Chris Adams told CNN on Friday. He did not say definitively that this was the same person being sought out for the eviction notice, adding that it could take days or weeks to positively identify the body. But he did say that police are no longer looking for any suspects in the case. The incident actually began Thursday morning, when Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department Robert Paris, 53, tried to serve an eviction notice at an apartment when a gunman opened fire. Paris, a 16-year veteran of the department, was shot dead. So, too, was Glendon Engert, a 35-year-old locksmith hired by the apartment complex's management company to get access to the unit as part of the eviction process, said Adams. The suspect locked himself into the home after the shootings, starting a standoff that lasted more than 10 hours. After 10 p.m. local time Thursday, a fire erupted from the apartment and flames could be seen shooting from the roof. The fire ignited after authorities threw flash grenades and tear gas into the apartment to try to flush the shooter out, Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christianson told reporters. CNN's Greg Morrision contributed to this report.","NEW: A locksmith helping in the eviction process was shot dead, police say .

"(CNN) -- The parents of Robert Champion, the Florida A&M University drum major who died after a hazing incident in November in Orlando, have filed suit against the school's board of trustees, the company that owns the bus in which the abuse occurred and the bus driver. ""Now, our journey begins as to really how we can eradicate a culture that's not just a FAMU problem, not just a Florida problem; it's an American problem,"" lawyer Christopher Chestnut told reporters Wednesday. The complaint alleges that the bus driver, Wendy Millette, ""frequently participated"" in or allowed hazing rituals to occur on the buses she was operating, and that Fabulous Coach management knew of and allowed the hazing rituals, which occurred each year after the Florida Classic Football Game. FAMU president resigns . It alleges that Millette ""breached her duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety and protection of her passengers ... and acted in a careless and negligent manner. ..."" The 33-page document, which was filed Tuesday in circuit court in Orange County, Florida, does not specify damages being sought. Chestnut said he hoped to use the discovery process -- via depositions, subpoenas and interrogatories -- to learn precisely what led to the 26-year-old's death. ""We still feel that Robert Champion was murdered,"" he said, but ""the prosecutor is limited as to what he can charge."" FAMU police chief called for band suspension before death . The complaint offers a detailed description of what Chestnut and Champion's parents allege occurred on the night of November 19, 2011, after the band performed at the Florida Citrus Bowl. Champion accompanied the band's five other drum majors and Julian White, the band director, from the stadium to the Rosen Plaza Hotel where they were staying, in a limousine, arriving with the buses at the hotel no later than 8 p.m., the complaint says. The band members unloaded the equipment and went to their hotel rooms and common areas no later than 8:30 p.m., it says. ""At a designated time after 8:30 p.m. and prior to 9:46 p.m., a series of hazing rituals were begun by members and/or alumni of the FAMU Band on one of the Fabulous Coach buses, specifically Bus C,"" the complaint says. Bus C was the third bus in a convoy of vehicles operated by Fabulous Coach for members of the 375-member band. The bus driver, Millette, let more than 20 band members and/or alumni into the bus, where the hazing ritual began, the motion alleges. ""The 'Bus C' initiation consists of 'pledges' attempting to run from the front door of the bus to the back of the bus, down the center aisle, while initiated members of the Bus C posse position themselves in between seat rows, launching punches, slaps, kicks, hitting with objects, yelling, or assaults and batteries otherwise upon the 'pledge' as he or she runs down the aisle of the bus,"" it says. Champion beaten with drum mallets, witnesses say . ""Should the 'pledge' fall to the bus floor from the blows sustained to his or her body, the 'pledge' may be stomped and is then dragged back to the front of the bus, and must begin the ritual again. ""Failure to successfully complete the 'Bus C' initiation results in a FAMU Band student being subjected to alienation from social contact, embarrassing public ridicule and mockery, sleep deprivation, and prohibition from talking, eating, drinking, sleeping, smiling, looking around or laughing while a passenger on Bus C or during FAMU Band activities."" No-confidence vote for FAMU president . At about 9:30 p.m., Champion was subjected to a number of hazing rituals, including the ""Hot Seat,"" in which a pillowcase or other object limiting the flow of oxygen was placed over a victim's head. He is then asked questions by a hazer. ""If or when the victim answers a question correctly, the object is briefly lifted to allow a brief flow of oxygen to the victim, and then quickly pulled back down over the victim's head as another question is asked,"" the complaint says. ""Should the victim fail to correctly answer the question, the object is not removed and the victim is prevented from inhaling fresh air, before the next question is asked. During this time, the victim is punched, slapped, kicked, or hit otherwise by members of the 'Bus C' posse."" The complaint says that ""John Doe 1,"" who himself had completed the ""Hot Seat"" initiation, ""opined that the physical and verbal abuse by the initiated upon (Champion) was more brutal than normal."" Champion gave in, band members say . When John Doe 1 stood to help Champion, he ""was immediately struck back down into the seat and pinned down as the physical abuse continued. ..."" Champion was also subjected to the hazing ritual known as ""Bus C,"" it says. Somewhere between 9:30 p.m. and 9:46 p.m., he ""appeared at the doorway of the bus and began vomiting in the parking lot."" At that point, Millette ""advised Decedent that he would be alright as she forced him back onto the bus,"" it alleges. There, he was subjected to further physical abuse, it says. ""The physical harm suffered by Decedent after being forced back onto the bus cumulatively led to the fatal injuries. ..."" At 9:46 p.m., another band member called 911 and said Champion was no longer breathing. He was taken to Dr. P. Phillips Hospital, where he was declared dead less than an hour later. Cause of death: ""Blunt force trauma (sustained) during a hazing incident."" Band fraternity charter revoked over hazing . FAMU Dean of Students Henry Kirby recommended three days before the incident that the band be suspended because of hazing, but his recommendation ""was ignored,"" the complaint says. Fabulous Coach did not immediately respond to an e-mail; CNN was not able to reach Millette. Band director White has retired and FAMU President James H. Ammons announced Wednesday that he is returning to a tenured faculty position in October.","Suit is filed against FAMU, bus company, driver of bus where hazing happened .

Beyond the strange name and the four-figure daily rate, what's most eye-opening is how this in-demand bully prevention guru defies the squeaky clean image expected of educators. He's no Mr. Rogers leading sweet sing-alongs in a sweater vest and tie -- far from it. He's a tough-talking former tattoo artist covered in ink. Lacking formal academic credentials, The Scary Guy acknowledges his looks and his lesson plans are a bit unconventional. Scary, as he likes to be called, delivers a shock-and-awe approach. Speaking before a packed auditorium of schoolchildren in Austin, Minnesota, he barfs up apples, groans and rubs his ink-stained belly and intentionally pokes fun at the shortest middle-schooler, the bald PE teacher and the ""geek in the wheelchair."" He explains he's demonstrating classic bullying behavior to make kids aware of the problem. The entertaining antics are followed up with fist-pumping and a steely look as he delivers his takeaway: ""You travel around on this world, and you put out hate and anger, and you cop an attitude, you'll draw all this into your life wherever you go."" Scary calls his performances ""edu-tainment"" -- a way to grab the kids' attention with humor and throw in a positive lesson at the same time. Playing the bully, he says, is how he role plays his young adult years when he would find fault with just about everyone. When pressed for his strongest message about bullying, he says it's to ""show [kids] they have the power to make the choice to be who they want to be and not become what they see and hear around them."" Kids seem to hang on to his every word, and schools and communities are buying into his act. Over the past 13 years, Scary says he has visited schools in 19 states, and he gets requests by countries worldwide. He's even been booked by law enforcement and the U.S. military. Some school administrators we talked to, however, wonder whether visiting outsiders like Scary are more than just ""clanging bells,"" as one Minnesota principal put it, rather than the culture change desperately needed in America's schools. ""You can have these kinds of folks come in and they are, in a sense, a bit of a mercenary -- a one-time, one-shot deal,"" says Principal Kerry Juntunen of Hermantown, Minnesota. ""Does that really change kids' lives? And my answer is no."" Scary visited Juntunen's middle school last year. The cost was covered by a federal grant. Parts of Scary's performance were positive, Juntunen says, but other parts were inappropriate enough to convince Juntunen he would never invite Scary back. Juntunen recounts how Scary, in an attempt to show that hand-shaking and hugging is harmless, reached out to shake a student's hand and sarcastically said, ""Oh, that's the best sex I've had all day!"" to a room full of middle-schoolers. After the crude comment, Juntunen says, he immediately knew his phone would light up. ""Well, what got left with the kids?"" he says, ""The kids got, 'Oh, that's the best sex I've had all day,' not that it's OK to shake someone's hand or to hug them."" Scary says he was just role playing, and that most people find it funny. In his interview with CNN, Scary also didn't seem overly concerned about discrepancies in some of his business and professional claims. His invoice to schools and his website -- before we sat down for an interview -- claimed his charity, KidsVisionHeart, is a nonprofit. (He changed his website after our interview.) The truth is KidsVisionHeart lost tax-exempt status nearly two years ago. ""It probably fell out because I didn't report all of my taxes for the last seven years,"" admits Scary. CNN also learned his for-profit business, VisionHeart, was dissolved in the U.S. so his earnings from past gigs have been going to his bank account tax-free. He says he's trying to work out his taxes and is restructuring his business now, but his life on the road has made it difficult. And, he says, schools don't care whether he's for-profit or a charity. Middle school Principal Dewey Schara of Austin, Minnesota, the community that booked Scary for two weeks last fall, is still a true believer. ""I think his credentials are stellar. And we looked into them because this is risky,"" Schara says, when ""you bring someone in that looks like Scary Guy, that talks like Scary Guy."" Schara, who together with a parent-initiated bullying committee booked Scary to come to Austin-area schools, says a messenger with shock value is exactly what the community needed to wake up and take action against bullying. ""I just love his approach,"" says Schara. ""It's not perfect. Some would say not beautiful. Maybe shocking to look at, but it gets everyone's attention."" The fact that Scary never finished college and has no formal training doesn't bother Schara. ""In our world, the academic world, you have to have a degree, the law says you have to have a degree from an academic institution in order to do the job,"" Schara said, ""but that doesn't make you a good teacher."" Scary is also quick to defend his self-styled teaching methods and shared with CNN a curriculum he's developing to go along with it. ""My teaching is researched-based in my personal experience and how I read people. No, it's not out of a book,"" Scary says, ""but the truth is I don't know where anyone would go to teach what I've been doing."" And Scary says he has letters to prove he's making a difference in kids' lives. ""[The letters] just tell me what it's like to make a difference, to make a change -- to wake up to the idea that they don't have to live with stress and negative behavior around them,"" said Scary. Juntunen recognizes some communities benefit from a Scary visit because his controversial approach can start a much-needed conversation about bullying; however, he says, what really matters is the daily interactions adults have with kids from the bus drivers to the school counselors. As he points out, people like The Scary Guy come and go. ""It is an ongoing process and the adults in this building, the adults in this community, the connections we make with kids -- that's what creates the culture, the anti-bullying culture that you're trying to provide,"" says Juntunen. ""I think a lot of people are just asking for somebody else to do what we need to do ourselves.""","The Scary Guy has an unusual presentation to stop bullying in schools .

"Northern Lebanon, near the Syrian Border (CNN) -- A young mother with 6-month-old triplets, a laborer still fearful of reprisals, a preacher whose wife was shot dead at an illegal border crossing, wounded in hospitals, a man living in a converted classroom -- these are among the 5,000 or more Syrian refugees living in Lebanon. ""For many of them, it's like, if they get detained, they're dead,"" said Nadim Houry, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch, about the plight of Syrians who are still in their country. ""And I've heard from many people who say, 'I'd rather take my risk, you know, escape, maybe die on the road escaping as opposed to getting detained and being tortured.'"" Pressure mounts for international response . Most Syrians who succeed in making their way to Lebanon take up residence with relatives or find modest shelter in the working-class neighborhoods where rents are low. Im Walid, a Syrian refugee, told CNN that she knows her husband would join the Syrian revolution if they were to return, so she plans to remain here. Counting their triplets, they have six children. They're routinely sick and work is scarce, but somehow, the family has managed to scrape by, she said. The hardest part, she said, is being away from the rest of their family in Syria. Today, many Syrians -- the activists, the organizers, those who are being sought by the Syrian government and those who are wounded -- find their way to Lebanon by fleeing through illegal crossings. In some places, only a thin finger of water separates the two countries. But that passage can carry risks. Abdul-Rahman Al Akari knows them too well. The Sunni Muslim preacher, who was once jailed on charges of fomenting unrest in Syria, moved to Lebanon a few months ago with Rabia, his 24-year-old wife and mother of three. But she missed her family and returned to Syria to visit. When she tried to cross illegally back into Lebanon, a Syrian security agent -- aware that her husband was being sought by Syrian authorities -- fatally shot her, according to Abdul-Rahman. Some of the wounded in hospitals here say they might risk a return to Syria through similar illegal crossings in order to rejoin the revolution. Regular border points are out of the question for them, they say. Should the world intervene in Syria? Though life in Lebanon is not easy, many Syrians say they left their country for their children, and that the decision to go was a matter of life or death. Abu Mohammed says he took his family out of Syria eight months ago, fearing for the safety of his five children. Fear, he said, is rooted deeply in everyone living under the current regime in Damascus. ""I fled because the army and thugs entered our village and bullets were pouring like rain,"" he old CNN. ""It was either stay and die, or leave."" He still looks over his shoulder, even in Lebanon. Ahmed found shelter in a dim, converted classroom in Lebanon a few kilometers from the border. He and his seven children survive on handouts, for which he is grateful. When those handouts arrive, they bring brief moments of relief for Ahmed and, for his children, even joy -- when toys are involved. But the growing tide of Syrian refugees is not a happy one. For many, there is the pain of lost loved ones and the depression of not knowing when, if ever, they will go home.","Thousands of Syrian refugees are living across the border in Lebanon .

"(CNN) -- A judge on Tuesday refused to throw out a case filed by four cast members from the hit 1970s television show ""Happy Days,"" who are suing to recover money from merchandise they claimed they have never received. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Allen White denied a motion by CBS for a summary judgment, which would have ended the lawsuit. CBS owns the show. The key issue remaining in the case is whether the actors may be entitled to payments from the sale of ""Happy Days"" DVDs. White ruled that that ""defendants have not met their initial burden of showing that plaintiffs are not entitled to merchandising royalties for the use of their likeness on DVD sets sold to consumers."" ""The Court emphasizes that it is not making a determination on the merits of (CBS') claim, which might be proven at trial, but only that defendants have not met their initial burden"" for the purpose of ending the lawsuit, White wrote. The ruling means the case, unless it is settled, would go to trial on July 17. Four members of the cast, Marion Ross, Don Most, Anson Williams and Erin Moran, along with the widow of Tom Bosley, sued CBS in April 2011, claiming they have not been been paid what they're owed for the worldwide sale of ""Happy Days"" merchandise. The series was on the air from 1974 to 1984. Bosley died in 2010. Under their contracts, the actors were supposed to receive 5% of net proceeds, or 2.5% if their images were used in a group, the lawsuit states. ""It's a certain sense of vindication that they ruled in our favor,"" Most told CNN in a phone interview. ""We feel obviously very pleased and happy with that ruling. It's just confirmation of what we've been claiming all along."" Asked if the cast would actually go to trial if necessary, Most said, ""We didn't come this far to then all of a sudden stop. It was a big victory for us today, so we're prepared to go all the way."" In interviews with CNN last year, the actors claimed they were cut out of the merchandising bonanza from the show. Those products include comic books, T-shirts, scrapbooks, trading cards, games, lunch boxes, dolls, toy cars, magnets, greeting cards and DVDs where their images appear on the box covers. The actors claim they never received revenue statements related to merchandising, and that CBS intentionally never intended to pay them anyway. A fraud claim had previously been dismissed by the court. In asking the court to dismiss the case, CBS said it had paid the actors everything they were owed for merchandise and that sale of the DVDs are covered under the Screen Actors Guild agreement. It said that agreement allows CBS to ""reuse photography from 'Happy Days' to exploit the television series without making additional payments to the plaintiffs,"" CBS attorney Keri E. Campbell wrote in papers filed with the court. ""It is undisputed that plaintiffs have received all of the residual payments for DVDs to which they are entitled."" While the actors claimed they had not been paid for all merchandise related to the show, the proceeds from the DVDs is the only remaining major issue in the case. Revenue from ""Happy Days"" slot machines featuring images of the actors was not as high as originally believed, plaintiffs attorney Jon Pfeiffer said. It was the actors' discovery of those slot machines several years ago that led to the lawsuit. ""The undisputed evidence shows, however, that CBS reported all revenue it received in connection with merchandise bearing the plaintiffs' name or likeness in the merchandising royalty statements provided to them and that there is no revenue that has not been reported to plaintiffs,"" Campbell wrote. In court papers, Pfeiffer wrote that, in fact, all merchandising revenues have not been accurately accounted for and that, over the years, the actors did not receive financial statements related to the sale of ""Happy Days"" items. Since the case was filed, Pfeiffer said CBS has sent the actors checks totaling about $10,000 each for owed merchandising payments. The checks are being held by Pfeiffer's law firm pending the outcome of the case. Last year, in other papers filed with the court, CBS claimed the actors ""are attempting to generate a lucrative litigation windfall by riddling their complaint with unsupported and overreaching causes of action"" for fraud and breach of good faith. The company said this was ""all done in a transparent attempt to introduce the specter of punitive damages"" in the case. CBS said the case was ""a garden-variety breach of contract action, nothing more."" The actors accused CBS of ""despicable conduct,"" saying ""although defendants routinely rebrand their corporate images, they should not be permitted to rebrand the truth.""","A judge Tuesday denied a motion by CBS that would have ended the lawsuit .
Four 'Happy Days' cast members are suing for money from merchandise .
The lawsuit states the actors should have gotten between 2.5-5% of net proceeds .

"(CNN) -- When Depeche Mode chose Soulsavers, the English electronica production team of Rich Machin and Ian Glover, to open for them on their 2009 European tour, they didn't know it would be just the beginning of their musical collaboration. But, as mutual fans, with front man Dave Gahan enjoying Soulsavers' work with singer Mark Lanegan and Machin's love of the seminal albums ""Violator"" and ""Songs of Faith and Devotion,"" it was only a matter of time. Following in their tradition of joining forces with high-profile guest vocalists, Soulsavers turned their attention to Gahan for their latest album, ""The Light the Dead Can See."" CNN recently spoke to Gahan about what inspired the soaring new songs, what fans can expect from the new Depeche Mode LP being recorded now and how ""Ziggy Stardust"" changed his life. CNN: How did working on this album compare to recording a Depeche Mode or solo record for you? It seems like a big enough task to have one great idea, never mind be able to parcel them out to different projects like you do. Dave Gahan: It's interesting that you said that about the one good idea. With ""Presence of God,"" for instance, it's one phrase or one sentence and the way I sing that. The notes that I choose to sing will sometimes do it. If I get that one line, I'm like, yes! That leads me somewhere else. That's when things start getting really exciting. The stuff with Rich was a different process for me. I never sat down and said, OK, I'm writing songs now for this or for that. I wasn't choosing this subject or that subject. It seemed to work with the music and I didn't want to edit that. I didn't want to bend it into a different direction. It was really a pure process, and I think you hear that. ""I Can't Stay"" was one of the first things I worked on. When I sent it back to Rich, he was blown away by what I'd done over the guitar chords he'd given to me and it started the process between us. These songs really kind of wrote themselves. I can't describe it in any better way. I just had to get out of the way, really. CNN: Speaking of blessed, you explore spirituality on this album, especially on ""Presence of God,"" and have said that may make people uncomfortable. Sure, it's more direct than what Depeche Mode usually does, but was it really such a major departure? Gahan: Not at all. I think that's because Martin [Gore] and I shake from the same hip as well. In the past, especially in the ""Violator"" and ""Songs of Faith and Devotion"" period, I felt like Martin was writing songs about me or for me. He wasn't really; I was younger then. But we had those same doubts, and quite often seemed to experience the same weird, dark sense of humor. ""Presence of God"" is really that understanding that sometimes when you step out of your own shoes and just open your ears and listen to what's going on around you, you get answers to the questions you were asking. The title ""The Light the Dead See"" works so well because sometimes when you're still and not trying to steer things in a certain way is really when the magic can happen. It's when I'm trying to figure that out for myself that I get into all kinds of trouble. CNN: It's a delicate balance to explore these subjects in your lyrics and not alienate the audience by coming across as tortured or preachy. How did you manage to pull it off? Gahan: I'm glad you heard that. There was no torture at all. It really came easy, this stuff. For me, that doubt and that faith are so close. It's impossible to deny that happening around you when you really kind of let go of trying to control things. But it's not hokey in any way. I'm not trying to tell you what to do. It's purely my experience of feeling like I really belong, and then moments of really what the f--k am I doing? We all have that. I tried to keep that as open as possible without directing. I don't want to direct you. I want you to listen and conjure up your own thoughts. CNN: The album is beautiful -- both melancholy and uplifting at the same time. How did you go about hitting those emotional nerves? Gahan: I think some of that stuff comes from the way I used my voice. I go to a very visual place when I'm singing. It's very cinematic and I get this feeling of space. I love when music does that. I listened to David Bowie a lot when I was a teenager. The place that he seemed to be singing from is the place that I wanted to go to. I didn't know if that place really existed, but I believed it did. I tried to capture that same magic again on this record. It's a place you go to when you listen, where you just feel a sense of belonging. Or, not feeling a sense of belonging and that being OK. CNN: Is there any one Bowie line, image or album that was able to transport you more than others? Gahan: There's many records that have been pivotal for me. If I were to name one, it would be ""Ziggy Stardust."" It changed my life. The same thing happened when punk rock came along and I heard the Clash for the first time. I was 16 or 17 years old. It made me feel like I belonged to something. Music has always done that and continues to do that for me. Lately, a record that I bought that I'm really listening to a lot is the new Spiritualized album, ""Sweet Heart Sweet Light."" There's a sense of humor to me in the combination of his words and his musical styles. It just spoke to me and brought a smile to my face. Some may listen to that record and not get the same feeling, but it's really uplifting and a beautiful record. CNN: You are currently recording your 13th Depeche Mode album. Can you give us a hint about what we can expect? Gahan: Martin's been particularly prolific, and myself as well. I was doing the Soulsavers thing and writing demos for Depeche Mode with a friend. Martin got on a writing streak. He's got some really great songs. We usually start a record with six or seven songs; we currently have about 20. In the studio, we're trying to not over-fuss things. We're trying to not over-produce the sound. If something's working, we're just recording it. We're trying to get the element of performance into the record more. We've already been talking to Anton Corbijn about some ideas we have about where we want to take the record visually and he usually has a pretty great angle. The songs have a bluesy influence. Obviously, it's not a blues record, but there's definitely some of those influences there. And it has a kind of soulful feel as well. It's still early so it's difficult to tell at this stage. We've been making records for a long time together, but there's always an element of surprise when it comes to the way a Depeche Mode record is really going to sound -- even for ourselves.","Dave Gahan is the front man for Depeche Mode .

"(CNN) -- Sure, there are things at stake in Tuesday's recall election for governor of Wisconsin. You need to know only a smidgeon about the politics of Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the Democratic challenger Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett to be aware of that. You need to have paid only passing attention to the political battle that has engulfed Wisconsin for 16 months to know that. If there's anything that just about everyone in Wisconsin agrees on, it's that it makes a big difference who is governor and which party controls each house of the legislature. When staunch conservative Walker and Republicans swept to control of the Capitol in Madison, and particularly when Walker launched his drive in February 2011 to render public employee unions all but powerless, no doubt was left that it mattered when Walker beat the liberal-to-moderate Barrett by a 52.3% to 46.5% margin in November 2010. Walker's fate in Wisconsin comes down to ground game . The changes can be seen not only in the law on employee public unions, but in tax policies, school funding, the strength of the safety net for those in need, environmental regulations, the right to carry concealed weapons and other major issues. But some things are not going to change in the light of Tuesday's outcome, things that should be kept in mind when it comes to post-election analysis. I'd suggest five of them: . 1. The presidential race in Wisconsin. Many will read Tuesday's outcome as a good sign for the presidential candidate from the party of the winner. I'm dubious. For one thing, President Barack Obama has done fairly well in recent polls, up 8 percentage points over former Gov. Mitt Romney in a Marquette Law School Poll last week, while Barrett has trailed Walker in almost all recent polls, down 7 percentage points in the same poll. Clearly, some people look at the two races separately. Previously on CNN: My mom is sick of calls from Mitt Romney . Obama and the national Democratic Party have distanced themselves from the recall election. That was glaringly clear when Obama did not make an appearance in Wisconsin, even though he was in next-door Minnesota on Friday and then, Friday night and Saturday, in his hometown of Chicago. It's a short hop from Chicago to Kenosha, Racine or Milwaukee, all Democratic strongholds where turnout will be key on Tuesday. The most reasonable interpretation for national Democrats keeping their distance is that they see nothing to gain from being visible, especially given polls that suggest a Barrett defeat is likely. The thinking most likely is: If Obama is doing reasonably well in Wisconsin already, why get involved in this acrimonious and probably losing mess? Wisconsin Democratic leaders have been unhappy with the low level of national party support, but Republicans have been more forthcoming with both money and by sending in GOP stars such as Govs. Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal and Nikki Haley. However the recall turns out, leaders of both parties expect the presidential race to be close in Wisconsin. With 10 electoral votes, Wisconsin isn't a big deal, except that it is hard to chart an Obama victory without including Wisconsin. In 2000 and 2004, the state had razor's edge wins for Democrats. The 2008 outcome, an easy Obama win, was different. But in some ways, 2008 seems longer ago than 2004. 2. The deep well of political anger. Wisconsin is a strong example of how people are pretty fed up, even as they go in almost equal numbers in opposite political directions. The economy, social hot-button issues, cultural issues, economic and racial dynamics -- there are many sources of fuel for the feelings that divide Wisconsin. The demographics of the state make these close to 50-50 issues, but it's worth pondering how similar the intensity of emotions are on each side of the divide. That anger won't be relieved after Tuesday. 3. The intensity of campaigning.  Wisconsin is in the Era of Never Ending Campaigns. In addition to the regularly scheduled November elections for governor and legislative seats, the state has featured a super-close, high spending Supreme Court race in 2011 and waves of recall elections for state senators. Immediately after Tuesday's recall for governor comes a hot Republican primary in August for an open U.S. Senate seat, followed by the November election, which will include not only the presidential and U.S. Senate voting but elections for half the state Senate and all of the state Assembly. 4. The dominance of big money. The political wars here have been a remarkable boon to television station revenues. Tens of millions of dollars have been spent on the recall election, much of it coming from out-of-state donors. It's not just TV and radio. It's daily mailings to hundreds of thousands of homes, extensive phone banking and robo-calling, and expensive get-out-the-vote efforts, which may prove be the decisive factor. The invasion of big money won't end after the recall, given the upcoming elections. 5. The short supply of civility. With some exceptions -- the era of Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s comes to mind -- Wisconsin has been known for civil politics. But the polarization of the state has been evident in round after round of polling, just as it is clear to anyone who observes the tenor of campaigning. There is little reason to think the intense and adamant approach to politics will abate after Tuesday. The pendulum swings in Wisconsin politics, and it seems to being swinging faster and farther in recent years. Both the winners and losers Tuesday are almost sure to refuel for more fights ahead, not only at the polls. The next two-year state budget cycle begins in early 2013. It will be intense, whoever wins. Hostility is going to hang around, and there's a strong chance political disarray will continue to be its partner. The state song is ""On, Wisconsin."" Whatever happens Tuesday, the case is likely to get stronger for making it Tom Petty's ""I Won't Back Down."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alan J. Borsuk.","Alan Borsuk: Wisconsin residents to decide recall of conservative Gov. Scott Walker .
Borsuk: Walker, who weakened public worker unions, changed the politics of Wisconsin .
Borsuk: Whoever wins, money and bad tempers will dominate as election season intensifies .

"(CNN) -- A short video that has gone viral in Mexico asks a tough question of the country's presidential candidates: ""Are you striving only for the (presidential) chair, or will you change the future of our country?"" A young girl with brown eyes and long brown hair, wearing a simple white shirt, poses the question. Behind her is a small army of child actors who star in the video, which is cute for a moment, but deadly serious. In it, the children act out a day in the life of a Mexican resident, fraught with all the problems and challenges that a leader must face. A child dressed as a businessman gets robbed at gunpoint as soon as he leaves his home. The robbers hand their loot over to a corrupt police officer. Protesters clash with riot police. There's a smog alert. Drug traffickers have it out with police on the streets, and human smugglers unload their cargo. Seeing children act out these grown-up situations has elicited a number of responses. Some viewers have criticized it as political manipulation, others as a wake-up call. But the list of Mexico's woes weighs heavily: security, pollution and poverty, among others. The video has garnered nearly 2 million views in less than four days. ""In reality, the video is not reflecting anything that people have not experienced,"" said Rosenda Martinez, a spokeswoman for Our Mexico of the Future, the group behind the production. The video targets the major presidential candidates -- Enrique Pena Nieto, Josefina Vazquez Mota and Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador -- and aims to raise awareness about Our Mexico of the Future. The goal of the organization is to collect as many ""visions"" of Mexico's future as possible and to compile them in a book that will be presented to the candidates before the election. So far, more than 10 million Mexicans have written or recorded their dreams for a safer or cleaner or more tolerant Mexico. ""We've had the response we've hoped for, and even exceeded it,"" Martinez said. After the children in the video depict a kidnapping, posters of the missing and people wearing face masks because of smog, the young narrator continues: ""If this is the future that awaits me, I don't want it. Stop working for your party, and not for us. Stop superficially fixing the country."" Some of the candidates have watched the video. Vazquez Mota, of the ruling National Action Party, said the video's message can't go unnoticed, while Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate Pena Nieto expressed that now is the time for change, as the video suggests. Leftist candidate Lopez Obrador, of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, had not seen the video, but said he agreed with the theme of change. Our Mexico of the Future will release data based on the millions of messages it has received. Martinez said to expect that security and the environment are the two most popular themes mentioned by Mexicans. CNN's Krupskaia Alis contributed to this report from Mexico City.","A video featuring child actors has gone viral in Mexico .

"(CNN) -- Imagine sitting at your desk at work and overhearing a co-worker sharing the good news about his or her latest raise, bumping his or her salary to $50,000. You have worked at the company five years longer, in the same position and your salary is $5,000 lower. On top of that, your sales have always been higher than those of your co-worker. Given the questionable history of some of the company's practices, you suspect that discrimination may be at the root of the pay discrepancy. You get together with your closest friends at the company, all share their salaries and decide that a pattern of pay discrimination based on gender may indeed be evident. The next week, you are fired because your boss found out that you were discussing your pay with your co-workers. Think your employer can't lawfully do that? You're wrong. This prohibition of talking about pay keeps discrimination secret and is an effective way to keep women and minorities from discovering they are being paid less than white male colleagues who work the same jobs. That will change if the U.S. Senate passes the Paycheck Fairness Act, expected to come to a procedural cloture vote on Tuesday. The Paycheck Fairness Act would prohibit employers from retaliating against employees who discuss their pay with co-workers. It would also close loopholes in the existing Equal Pay Act that deny victims of sex discrimination the same legal remedies as victims of discrimination based on race or ethnicity. To illustrate, returning to the scenario above, you later learn that two of your former co-workers still at the company are going to sue the company for pay discrimination. Although the company engaged in pay discrimination based on gender and race, your female co-workers cannot sue to recover the more lucrative compensatory and punitive damages, like people who sue over discrimination based on race or ethnic basis can. The Paycheck Fairness Act would ensure that victims of sex discrimination have the same legal remedies available to them as victims of racial or ethnic discrimination. Think we don't need the Paycheck Fairness Act because sex discrimination is a thing of the past? Just tell that to the women at Walmart who have been fighting the retail giant for more than a decade, with evidence of widespread sex discrimination in pay and promotion. The Paycheck Fairness Act would help prevent employers from paying women less for no other reason than because they are women. The pay gap is especially detrimental to low-income families and families of color who are more likely to rely on women's earnings to make ends meet or as the sole source of income. Women make on average 77 cents for every dollar men make. The wage gap is even greater for women of color. Black women earn 69.5 cents and Hispanic women 60.5 cents for every dollar earned by their white male counterparts. The average 77-cent pay gap results in a difference of almost $11,000 per year.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona captain Carles Puyol says Tito Vilanova is ""the ideal man"" to replace Pep Guardiola as Barcelona coach. Assistant manager Vilanova was named as Guardiola's replacement after the 41-year-old announced Friday that he was stepping down as coach at the end of the season. ""Tito knows the team like nobody else, he knows its philosophy through and through,"" said Puyol. Drained Guardiola quits . ""He is the ideal man to continue the project. The departure of Guardiola is a big blow, but the fact that Tito has succeed him softens it somewhat."" The 34-year-old defender, who has captained the club since 2004, also extended his gratitude to his outgoing coach. ""I would like to thank Pep for everything he has given us, he leaves us a lot in terms of football, a manner of understanding, of respecting ones opponent. ""He laid down a before and an after in football. Now life goes on."" Ten-man Chelsea stun Barcelona . Guardiola will be in charge for Barcelona's away meeting with Rayo Vallecano on Sunday -- a match they must win if they are to keep alive their slim hopes of retaining the La Liga title. If Barcelona lose and Real Madrid beat Sevilla in Sunday's early kick-off, Jose Mourinho's side will be crowned champions. In Saturday's La Liga fixtures, Levante moved back into the top four on Saturday with a 3-1 over Granada. Second-half goals from Arouna Kone, Xavi Torres and Valdo helped see Levante move up a place ahead of Malaga, who entertain Valencia on Sunday. Sporting Gijon kept their slim hopes of a avoiding the drop alive with a convincing 3-0 win away to Espanyol. The result moves them up to 18th on 34 points ahead of Real Zaragoza who play Europa League finalists Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. But Racing Santander's relegation from La Liga was confirmed on Saturday as they went down to a 3-0 defeat at Real Sociedad. Mid-table Mallorca moved above Getafe with a 3-1 win. Meanwhile in Serie A, Napoli's quest for Champions League football next season suffered a blow as they were held to a 2-2 draw at Roma. The result only moves them level on 55 points with Lazio who can consolidate third place with a win at sixth-placed Udinese on Sunday. Any hopes Catania have of playing in the Europa League next season appear to be fading after they could only draw 1-1 draw with Palermo. The draw keeps Vincenzo Montella's men in eighth, five points adrift of sixth-place. Mid-table Chievo also drew, playing out a goalless draw with Cagliari. Serie A leaders Juventus are in action on Sunday away to second-from-bottom Novara while title rivals AC Milan travel to Siena.","Barcelona captain offers his support to Pep Guardiola's replacement saying he's the ""ideal man""

"(CNN) -- A former Bolivian dictator has been arrested on a charge that he exposed himself to a group of children and has been sent to a drug rehabilitation center, the state-run news agency reported. Former air force Gen. Juan Pereda Asbun, who ruled the South American nation for four months in 1978, was arrested Tuesday after a father and a group of young people detained him because he tried to get a girl to get into his car after exposing himself to other children, the government's ABI news service reported Wednesday. After his arrest, authorities said, officers found he was carrying two boxes of cigarettes loaded with cocaine, commonly known as ""pitillos."" ""After taking his statement, Pereda, who identified himself as an air force general, underwent a series of clinical exams, primarily urine, to determine the extent of drug consumption affecting him,"" said Col. Ruben Suarez, head of the Special Force to Combat Narcotrafficking. The result of the urine test was positive for drugs, Suarez said in a news conference broadcast Wednesday by CNN affiliate Unitel TV. Pereda, 79, was admitted to a rehab facility to treat a cocaine addiction, ABI said.  He also underwent a psychological examination, Suarez said. The cocaine found on the former dictator was for personal use and not for sale or distribution, Suarez said, adding that Pereda had not been linked to any narcotrafficking organization. In a TV interview at the police station, Pereda denied any wrongdoing with the girls. ""I say that it is false,"" Pereda said in the interview, broadcast on Unitel. The silver-haired Pereda said he had not talked with the girls or had any contact with them. ""I don't know them,"" he said before being led away. Pereda was arrested in Santa Cruz, the largest city in Bolivia, with a population of more than 1.6 million. Neighborhood residents told Unitel they had seen Pereda cruising the area before and that he had previously accosted the girls, who ranged in age from 12 to 14 years old. Pereda ruled from July to November 1978, taking power after overthrowing dictator Hugo Banzer and losing the presidency in another coup. He has not served in any public capacity since then. Bolivia was ruled by military dictatorships from 1964 to 1982, with the exception of two brief democratic governments in 1979 and 1980. The last dictator, Gen. Guido Vildoso, ordered the military back to their barracks in October 1982 and re-established civilian rule. Bolivia is now ruled by democratically elected President Evo Morales, a leftist indigenous politician who has held power since January 2006.","NEW: The former president denies in a TV interview having contact with the girls .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigerian aviation authorities suspended Dana Air's operating license Tuesday as torrential rain hampered recovery efforts after a deadly weekend plane crash. ""As soon as we have concluded the recertification of the airline, if they are capable, then their license will be reinstated,"" said Sam Adurogboye, a spokesman for the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority. Authorities have recovered the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, which are expected to help investigators determine what caused Sunday's crash that authorities say killed at least 153 people aboard the plane and at least 10 people on the ground. Rescuers have recovered 153 bodies, including those of a woman and the baby she was clutching. But a downpour and a building on the verge of collapse impeded recovery efforts Tuesday. Rescuers said they hoped to resume work Wednesday morning. Seven U.S. citizens were aboard the flight, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday. Officials were working to notify relatives of the dead. Two sisters from Texas, Connecticut family perish . Dana Air's Flight 0992 slammed into a two-story residential building in a densely populated neighborhood of Lagos, Nigeria's largest city. ""The plane pushed the wall of our building in, and it hit everything,"" said Kingsley Okeke, who was inside at the time. ""There was fire everywhere."" The pilot declared an emergency as the plane was on final approach to Murtala Muhammed International Airport, and witnesses said it appeared the plane was having engine trouble, said Oscar Wason, Dana Air's director of operations. Wason identified the pilot as Peter Waxtan, an American, and the first officer as Mike Mahendra, from India. Waxtan had joined Dana Air on March 26. He was a captain for Spirit Airlines based in South Florida from 1997 to 2009, the airline said. He also flew for Falcon Air Express, a charter airline in Miami, CNN affiliate WPEC reported. Sisters Jennifer and Josephine Onita of Missouri City, Texas, were among those killed in the crash. They were on their way back home after attending a wedding, said their sister, Christiana Onita-Olojo. Also among the dead were six Chinese citizens who were on the plane, the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria said Monday. According to witnesses, the passenger plane appeared to be approaching the vicinity of the airport in Lagos high, its nose tilted upward, when it crashed 11 miles (18 kilometers) north of the runway, hitting the ground tail first, Wason said. The flight, which had originated in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, crashed at 3:43 p.m. in the neighborhood of Iju Ishaga, according to the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority. iReport: Images from Lagos . The airplane was 22 years old and had been purchased from Alaska Airlines. It had undergone routine maintenance checkups after every 200 hours of flight, and it had been inspected three days before the crash, Wason said. Dana Air says its fleet comprises Boeing MD-83 aircraft. Boeing's website says that model can carry 155 to 172 passengers, cover up to 2,504 nautical miles and has a fuel capacity of 7,000 gallons. The airline, which is privately owned and based in Lagos, began operations in 2008.

"(CNN) -- The last of 11 people facing felony hazing charges tied to a Florida A&M University band member's death turned herself in on Sunday, four days after prosecutors announced the charges, the state said. Lasherry Codner, 20, was released on a $15,000 bail shortly after she was booked into Orange County jail Sunday. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement had said Friday that it had been in contact with her family in Georgia. She joins 10 others who have reported to jails throughout Florida after being charged with felony hazing in the death of 26-year-old Robert Champion. State law provides a prison term of up to six years for a conviction on this charge, Ninth Judicial Circuit State Attorney Lawson Lamar said last week. The FAMU Marching 100 drum major died after collapsing on a band bus after a November 2011 football game in Orlando, Florida. He died within an hour after being badly beaten, medical examiners reported. Two others are charged with misdemeanor hazing, which typically carries at most a year-long prison sentence. Among those facing felony hazing charges is Aaron Golson, who was also charged in December with hazing and felony battery, after another FAMU band member, Bria Hunter, said she had suffered a cracked femur, deep bone bruise and blood clots after being beaten repeatedly on the thighs. As to Champion's case, the victim's mother, Pam Champion, has said her family is disappointed the suspects didn't face more serious charges. She also accuses authorities of botching the investigation, saying they didn't properly process the bus for evidence and failed to immediately question students who were on board. Deputy Ginette Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Sheriff's Office, has defended the investigation. ""I know our deputies questioned everyone available,"" Rodriguez said. ""I can assure you our detectives conducted a thorough and complete investigation, as we do in every case."" Earlier this year, the Champion family filed a negligence lawsuit against the bus company and its driver, and lawyer Chris Chestnut has said the family plans to sue the university as well. Champion's death brought renewed public scrutiny to hazing, a practice that has gone on for years despite what the Tallahassee university said had been efforts to eradicate the problem. Some university band members have said Champion died after taking part in an annual rite of passage called ""Crossing Bus C,"" an initiation process in which pledges attempt to run down the center aisle from the front door of the bus to the back while being punched, kicked and otherwise assaulted by senior members. An estimated 30 people were on the vehicle at the time. An autopsy found ""extensive contusions of his chest, arms, shoulder and back,"" as well as ""evidence of crushing of areas of subcutaneous fat,"" medical examiners reported.","NEW: Lasherry Codner, 20, bonded out of Orange County jail after turning herself in .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have busted a luxury-vehicle theft ring that took orders from clients in Africa and then stole the cars from New York. ""This criminal enterprise used the streets of New York City as one giant showroom for stealing cars,"" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said. The operation specialized in the theft of Toyota and Lexus SUVs and other automobiles -- Toyota Venzas, Highlanders, Sequoias and Lexus RX 350s, GX 460s and GX 470s -- as well as other high-end makes, including Acuras, his office said. A local broker in Africa would relay the order to the theft crew boss, specifying what was to be stolen by model, year, color and accessory package. ""Members of the steal crew would then 'fill the order' by locating the specified car"" and stealing it, court documents said. The stolen vehicles were worth more than $1 million. Law enforcement arrested 14 people Wednesday in raids spanning several states, culminating a yearlong investigation. They were charged with felonies under a 58-count indictment. The sophisticated operation used ""forged document specialists,"" a locksmith and a portable computer to sync a key to the vehicle's unique code, allowing the vehicle to be stolen without damage, authorities said. The cars and SUVs were then loaded into shipping containers and transported to Africa with forged titles and vehicle identification numbers. Some of them went for up to $40,000 in cash, the attorney general's office said. Those that didn't go to Africa ended up on the black market in Chicago.","Some vehicles went for up to $40,000 in cash, New York attorney general says .

"MAE SOT, Thailand (CNN) -- Exchanging his sacred Bhuddist robes for a crucifix and his black-colored hair for bleached-blonde, 24-year-old Ashin Kovida found freedom in neighboring Thailand and escaped authorities within Myanmar's oppressive military regime intent on hunting down the pro-democracy leader. Ashin Kovida made a narrow escape from Myanmar's military regime. ""The soldiers started shooting and I had a narrow escape, I saw monks being beaten,"" he told CNN, describing his exit. His main offense? Acting as a key organizer of protest marches that slowly escalated until thousands took to the streets in a movement underscoring the people's desire for pro-democracy leadership. The uprising, dubbed the Saffron Revolution for the monks' saffron-colored robes, lasted for several weeks before being snuffed out by the iron hand of the ruling junta. The protests were initially sparked by a huge fuel price increase imposed by the military government. They quickly became much more. Video smuggled out of the secretive country has shown unarmed protesters being beaten by government security forces, and one man -- believed to be a Japanese journalist -- shot and killed at close range. U.N. envoy Paulo Sergio Pinheiro has said as many as 110 people were believed to have been killed during the demonstrations -- including 40 Buddhist monks -- and 200 others beaten. The regime has since admitted to detaining more than 2,900 people, but hundreds more remain in custody, some facing deplorable conditions. Myanmar's humanitarian crisis has sparked international outrage, concern, attention and brought new focus to Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate who has been under house arrest on and off for nearly 20 years in Yangon, the country's biggest city. Pitting his Buddhist faith against Myanmar's oppressive military regime, Kovida described what inspired him to take a stand. ""I was an ordinary monk, but then I heard about the death in Bokoku I was surprised no monks came onto the streets,"" he said, describing an incident in the town of Bokoku in which one monk was publicly beaten to death at a rally. ""So I wrote to other monasteries. We had a committee of fifteen who organized the protests."" The movement grew until the army cracked down, arresting hundreds and circulating posters showing Kovida marching at the front of the demonstration. He is wanted by Myanmar's military government, which accuses him of hatching a bomb plot he denies. The Buddhist faith has given Kovida a quiet determination that eventually the military regime in Myanmar will be overthrown, but he has also called on the United Nations to step into the political fray where most citizens and monks dare to go no more. ""Our blood is on the street, most of the monasteries are empty. I can't estimate how many people in prison. When will U.N. Security Council take action?"" asked Kovida. The U.N. has already sent Ibrahim Gambari, the special envoy for Myanmar, and he is expected to return to Myanmar this week. The enovy met earlier in October with the military junta leadership as well as with Suu Kyi, who has been the voice of democracy since 1989, when her National League for Democracy won the country's first free multiparty elections. The military junta refused to hand over power and has kept her under tight wraps ever since. In addition, U.N. envoy Pinheiro has been cleared to visit Myanmar for a fact-finding mission into reports of human rights violations during the September crackdown. ""I have been able to verify, through different independent and reliable sources, allegations of the use of excessive force by the security forces, including live ammunitions, rubber bullets, tear gas, bamboo and wood sticks, rubber batons and catapults (slingshots),"" he said. ""This largely explains the killings and the severe injuries reported."" He plans to arrive in Myanmar sometime before November 17, the date of the summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The humanitarian rights situation in Myanmar has also caught the attention of U.S. first lady Laura Bush who -- in a rare foray into foreign policy -- penned a commentary calling on the military junta to give up the ""terror campaigns"" against its people and allow democracy. ""Gen. Than Shwe and his deputies are a friendless regime,"" Bush said in her article, published in the Oct. 10 edition of the Wall Street Journal. ""They should step aside to make way for a unified Burma (Myanmar) governed by legitimate leaders."" CNN's Dan Rivers and Tess Eastment contributed to this report .","A key organizer of monk protest marches in Myanmar escapes to Thailand.

"(CNN) -- An explosion early Thursday rocked a neighborhood in the city of Yangon killing 20 people and injuring more than 95, Myanmar's state-run television MR TV reported. The blast occurred in Mingalar Taung Nyunt, a mainly residential area about a 15 minute-drive from central Yangon, the country's former capital. It struck a compound of warehouses that the government rents out to private businesses. ""I can't tell what is the exact cause of the incident but it is unlikely from man-made bombs,"" said a police official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The authorities are investigating the explosion, he said. A fire official said the series of explosions may have come from large quantities of sulfur, ammonia and sulfur trioxide, which becomes sulfurous acid when mixed with water, stored at the compound. Win Tun, who lives near the warehouses, said she heard a ""very big, loud noise of explosion,"" which prompted startled residents to try to flee. ""Some people ran in the wrong way. I didn't know where to run to,"" she said, adding that the initial blast was followed by a string of other explosions. The dead include four firefighters, MR TV reported. The strength of the explosion shattered the windows of nearby houses.","NEW: Official says sulfur, ammonia and sulfur trioxide may have caused the explosions .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have seized 9,072 kilograms (20,000 pounds) of counterfeit medicine and arrested 80 people suspected of illegal trafficking in six East African nations, Interpol said Thursday. More than 300 premises were checked or raided in the two-month operation across Uganda, Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zanzibar, according to a news release from the international police agency. The confiscated loot included anti-malaria drugs, vaccines and antibiotics. There was also a significant quantity of government medicines diverted to illegal resale markets. It was the third such seizure operation in as many years in East Africa, intended to curb the manufacture and distribution of counterfeit medical products. Representatives of the six nations are scheduled to meet in Zanzibar next week to discuss the seizure and the extent of the counterfeiting problem, Interpol said. The World Health Organization defines counterfeit drugs as ""medicine, which is deliberately and fraudulently mislabelled with respect to identity and/or source."" Counterfeiting can apply to both brand-name and generic products, and forged products may include those with the correct ingredients or with the wrong ingredients, without active ingredients, with insufficient active ingredients, or with fake packaging, WHO says. The United Nations agency created a global task force in 2006 to deal with the problem, which has been growing as international markets expand and become globalized and internet commerce has taken off. The fake products can prove detrimental to public health efforts in disease-ridden countries and in worst-case scenarios can cause death, according to the WHO task force.","The two-month operation was conducted in six nations .

"(CNN) -- Jorge Lorenzo extended his MotoGP series lead to 20 points after winning the Catalunya Grand Prix for the second time in his top-level motorcycling career. The Yamaha rider started Sunday's race from second on the grid, but outshone Honda's polesitter Casey Stoner as the reigning world champion lost more ground in the overall standings after finishing fourth. It was Lorenzo's third victory in five races this season, and second in a row after winning at Le Mans last month. He was runner-up in his two other MotoGP starts at Montmelo, and also won there with Aprilia in the 250cc class. He came home five seconds ahead of fellow Spaniard Dani Pedrosa, with Italy's Andrea Dovizioso third on a Monster Yamaha Tech 3. Stoner sets pace in Catalunya qualifying . ""I'm really happy with this victory as it was a very tough weekend. We performed a lot better than yesterday as in qualifying it was very hot,"" said the 2010 world champion, who had to make up ground after Pedrosa took the early lead. ""The grip on the track after the rain this morning was also not so great. I followed Dani and watched him, he slowed his pace and eventually made a mistake so I was able to pass him then give it full throttle."" Pedrosa was disappointed despite finishing on the podium at Montmelo for the eighth time, being 10 points behind teammate Stoner in third overall. ""A second place is always a second, but I really wanted to win today, I cannot feel happy,"" he said. ""I tried to attack but with 10 laps remaining I couldn't keep the pace. It was hard to control the bike on braking and in the exit of the corners, so I was defensive because I knew my corner speed was not so good. I made a mistake and I had a big wheelie, so Jorge got past me and I couldn't follow him."" Stoner, who plans to retire at the end of this season, was also disappointed -- having won the previous four races held at Spanish circuits. ""We gave it everything at the end but we just didn't have the pace, especially in the beginning with the hard tire,"" the Australian said. ""With the performance we had during the weekend we expected to be a little stronger throughout the race."" Dovizioso's British teammate Cal Crutchlow was fifth ahead of Spain's Alvaro Bautista and seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi of Ducati. Germany's Stefan Bradl was eighth on a Honda, with Ducati's Nicky Hayden ninth and fellow American Ben Spies 10th. Spies dropped from second early in the race, which was a big blow after qualifying in fourth on Saturday. ""I just made one mistake in the race and blew our chance,"" the 27-year-old said. ""We were going good in the beginning but I was getting impatient with Dani. ""He was holding me up but I couldn't make the pass on the straight so I had to go for it on the brakes and unfortunately got out onto the edge of the track. I got up and we got back into it and our pace was pretty good, unfortunately it was too late to get back to the front.""","Spanish motorcyclist Jorge Lorenzo wins on home soil to extend championship lead .

"Panama City, Panama (CNN) -- Panamanian officials are preparing for the return of former dictator Manuel Noriega, who is scheduled to be extradited from France this weekend, Panama's foreign minister told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Noriega, 77, will arrive in Panama Sunday on a flight with the Spanish airline Iberia, the foreign ministry said in a statement. Authorities are preparing to step up security to guarantee Noriega's safety in prison, Foreign Minister Roberto Henriquez said Wednesday. ""We have to be ready for all the possibilities in all aspects. Noriega inspires very big emotions, and Noriega's life could very well be at risk in Panama,"" Henriquez said. Calls for protests against the former military dictator have already begun, Henriquez said. ""Noriega has some friends who still follow him. But also a large majority of the Panamanian people resent his behavior. They are already mobilizing in Panama,"" he said. France ordered Noriega's extradition earlier this year, responding to a Panamanian government request for the former dictator's return to face charges that he had a political rival killed. Panamanian officials want him to face justice there in the case of the killing of Hugo Spadafora, a doctor and political opponent of Noriega. Noriega was convicted in absentia of being involved with the kidnapping and killing of Spadafora in 1985. Several steps remain before the extradition, Panama's foreign ministry said in a statement Wednesday. Panama's attorney general will arrive in Paris Thursday, and doctors will conduct a medical exam of Noriega Saturday, the statement said. Judicial officials in Panama will determine whether Noriega can stand trial, Henriquez said. Last year, a French court sentenced Noriega to seven years in prison for money laundering. He also was fined almost 2.3 million euros ($2.9 million), the amount of drug money he was accused of laundering through French banks. Noriega denied the charges. U.S. forces removed the ex-dictator from office during the 1989 invasion of Panama. Noriega had fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. U.S. troops set up large speakers around the compound, blaring music at all hours, a psychological ploy to rattle the general. He surrendered in January 1990, and was quickly escorted to the United States for civilian trial. The U.S. government has portrayed Noriega as the ultimate crooked cop -- a man who was paid millions by the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia to protect cocaine and money shipments. He was convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes in the United States. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cleared the way for Noriega to be sent to France in April 2010 after he spent 20 years in a U.S. federal prison. Noriega and his attorneys had argued the United States was violating the Geneva Convention by not sending him back to Panama, where he was seized by U.S. troops after the United States invaded that country in 1989 in Operation Nifty Package. U.S. federal courts ruled against him. Noriega's U.S. sentence, originally for 30 years, ended in September 2007 after time off for good behavior. However, he remained in prison while the French extradition issue was decided. While in U.S. custody, Noriega suffered from prostate cancer and had a stroke.","NEW: The foreign ministry says Noriega will arrive in Panama Sunday .

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- Family members of Meredith Kercher said Saturday they were satisfied with the verdict that found American Amanda Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, guilty of the fatal knifing of the British student. ""Ultimately we are pleased with the decision,"" said Lyle Kercher, Meredith Kercher's brother. ""But it was not a moment of celebration. We are here because our sister was brutally murdered."" The victim's sister, Stephanie Kercher, talked Friday about her family's grief. ""Our lives have been on hold, really. You can't really carry on as normal,"" she said. ""You have to take each day as it comes. It's not ever going to be the same without [Meredith]."" Knox and Sollecito were found guilty of murder Friday after a lengthy, sensational trial. Knox was given a 26-year sentence; Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years. Both will appeal, attorneys said. Knox and Sollecito were convicted on all charges except theft. The pair was accused of staging a theft to cover up the killing. Authorities said 300 euros (about $444) was discovered missing from Kercher's purse. The pair must pay 5 million euros ($7.4 million) to Kercher's family. In addition, Knox must pay 40,000 euros (nearly $60,000) to a man whom she falsely accused of the killing. One of Knox's sisters said Saturday that Amanda ""had a rough night."" Her mother, Edda Mellas, said, ""She had a lot of support. The inmates and the guards were all taking great care of her. They care a lot. ""Amanda, like the rest of us, is extremely disappointed -- upset about the decision,"" Mellas said. ""We're all in shock; we're all heartened by the support"" that she said residents of Perugia and other Italians had shown. ""People from all over the world have been sending us messages of support all through the night,"" Mellas said. ""We told her she's going to get out of there. It's [just] going to take a little longer."" Sollecito's lawyer, Luca Maori, criticized his client's punishment -- less than the life sentence the prosecution requested but far short of exonerating Sollecito -- as making no sense. ""For the grave crimes they claimed, you either sentence them to life. ... or you acquit. There is no middle way,"" Maori said. Public prosecutor Giuliano Mignini told CNN he feels he presented a strong case. He said about 20 magistrates worked alongside police during the investigation. However, he said that in the face of the planned appeals, clearly the conviction is not final. Learn how the murder case played out . People who disagree with the verdict should at least respect it, because so many professionals were involved in the investigation, Mignini said. ""I believe, evidently, that they think there was violence. They are the deputies who establish the foundation"" of charges, he said. ""And they did this."" The victim's mother said she believed the defendants were guilty of the slaying. ""You have to go with the evidence,"" Arline Kercher said. Take a look at the evidence against Knox . Knox's lead defense attorney, Luciano Ghirga, said that when he met with his client Saturday morning, she was angry and continued to proclaim her innocence. He told CNN the situation has been a trying experience, and Knox hardly slept Friday night after the verdict. She was consoled by the other prisoners, who managed to get her a cup of warm milk, Ghirga said. The jury reached its verdict after deliberating nearly 11 hours on the 11 counts. Jurors must submit an explanation of how they reached their decision to the judge within 90 days, and this ""jury motivation"" will be made public. Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of life in prison. Italy does not have the death penalty.

"(WIRED)  -- Gawker Media, the blog powerhouse built by Nick Denton, has been hacked. After bringing the company's websites to a standstill Sunday, one or more hackers operating under the name Gnosis released a 500 MB file apparently containing Gawker's source code, commenter and staff passwords, and internal conversations between the company's employees. The email addresses and passwords of hundreds of thousands of Gawker users have been compromised, the hackers said. It's the worst security breach in New York-based Gawker's eight-year history, and a wake-up call to all web publishers. ""We're deeply embarrassed by this breach,"" Gawker said in a blog post Sunday afternoon. The attack included Gawker's eponymous flagship property, as well as gadget site Gizmodo and the culture site Jezebel. The successful Gawker hack followed a week of escalating attacks in the wake of Wikileaks's continued release of U.S. State Dept. documents and counter-attacks by hackers associated with group known as Anonymous, which has staged a campaign called Operation Payback. Over the last year, Gawker has been covering, with its trademark disdain, the antics of the 4Chan message board, leading 4Chan users to attack the site with denial-of-service attacks in July. That's the same tactic being used against Visa.com, Paypal.com and Mastercard.com for those companies' decisions to cut-off the ability to donate to Wikileaks. But the latest attack is much more serious than a typical denial-of-service attack. Gawker's attackers managed to infiltrate the company's content management system (CMS), user database, and internal communications system. The hackers then published a raw file containing that information. Gnosis took pains to say, in the uploaded file, that they were not 4Chan, even as they gave a shout-out to it, along with Anonymous. 4chan can only be described as one of the most obnoxious (and sometimes hilarious) corners of the net, but it's not a place where the most sophisticated hackers generally congregate. Still, Gnosis's choice of targets and their foul language puts them firmly in the net's ""griefer"" culture. A 500MB file containing thousands of Gawker user IDs, passwords and email addresses was easily available Sunday night. Some of the email addresses and passwords in the file appear to correspond to several prominent current and former Gawker employees. The source code to Gawker's website was also released, according to the hackers, as were internal chat communications among Gawker employees. Gawker seems to have regained control of their servers, and are advising readers to change their passwords. However, the real threat is for those readers who use the same password at Gawker that they do for other online services, since the hackers and others are at work breaking the outdated encryption Gawker used to store the passwords. Quite a few have already been broken. WIRED: Vigilantes take offensive in WikiLeaks censorship battle . Anyone who has set up up an account to comment on Gawker is advised to change their passwords as soon as possible. Gnosis made clear its disdain for Gawker in the leaked file. ""F*** you gawker, hows this for 'script kids?'"" the hacker wrote. ""Your empire has been compromised, Your servers, Your database's, Online accounts and source code have all be ripped to shreds! You wanted attention, well guess what, You've got it now!"" The file, which also includes information about Gawker's upcoming re-design, was being shared by dozens of people via file-sharing protocol bittorrent Sunday night . The hacker wrapped up the data dump with the following message. ""You would think a site that likes to mock people, such as gawker, would have better security and actually have a clue what they are doing. But as we've proven, those who think they are beyond our reach aren't as safe as they would like to think!"" Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- Voters in military-run Myanmar head to the polls Sunday for the first time in two decades. The West has denounced the vote -- the military junta will maintain a plurality of seats in the parliament while the remainder are contested by candidates from dozens of parties, including one formed by the military-backed former prime minister. China's chess match with Myanmar . Additionally, Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, which won a landslide victory in 1990 but was not allowed to take power when the military nullified the vote, is boycotting the vote. It was disbanded by the junta earlier this year when its insistence on keeping Suu Kyi on its rolls barred it from registering for the election. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who has spent most of the last 20 years under house arrest or in prison, says she will not vote. Here's a preview of Sunday's vote. How many will vote? There are about 29 million eligible voters and more than 40,000 voting stations in the country. The population is about 58 million. What are they voting for? This is the first election since 1990, when the National League for Democracy won a landslide -- a victory that was never acknowledged by the army. After years of stalling, now Myanmar's military regime is holding an election, which many analysts say is nothing more than a sham to legitimize its rule. Voters will elect representatives to two houses of parliament (instead of one as before) and there will be 14 state/regional assemblies. The lower house, the People's Assembly, will have 440 seats and the upper house, the Nationalities Assembly, will have 224. There are about 900 seats in the 14 state or regional assemblies. However, with 25 percent of the seats in each of these assemblies is reserved for the military, the seats up for grabs are reduced to 330, 168 and 665 respectively. Each voter will be casting a vote for each of these three assemblies. What about Aung San Suu Kyi? The icon of the democracy movement remains under house arrest, her 15th year of detention. Her latest detainment was imposed after American John Yettaw swam the lake next to her house in May 2009 and spent two days in her compound, saying afterwards he was delivering a message from God. Can Suu Kyi run in the election? Conveniently for the junta, the election law specifies that a convict cannot be a member of a political party, and so Suu Kyi can not stand for election. The NLD refused to expel her in exchange for being able to register as a party in the election, hence they are now boycotting the process. However, some of their members have split and formed a new party, National Democratic Front (NDF), which will take part in the election. What will happen to NLD and its members? It is now an illegal party since members didn't register it as a party. They have been unclear about their next move, saying they will have to become a ""social movement."" Which party does the junta favor? The youth wing of the army, the Union Solidarity Defence Association (USDA), has transformed itself into the Union Solidarity Defence Party (USDP), a political party, which is expected to run uncontested in many areas. Cyclone exposed secrets but junta keeps power . Why did Thein Sein, the prime minister, and some other ministers have to resign? He has resigned to lead USDP. Its predecessor, the USDA, had at least 26 million members, and USDP has at least 16 million party members. What are the other main parties? The National Union Party (NUP) is the party of the former military strong man Ne Win. The NUP was beaten in the 1990 election by Suu Kyi's NLD, but the army ignored the result. Some analysts speculate that a high vote for the NUP could be interpreted as a protest vote against the current regime. The National Democratic Front is a splinter group of former NLD members who think it's better to participate in this election as a first step towards full democracy. A total of 37 parties are taking part in the election. What was the SPDC and what happens to it? The State Peace and Development Council was the official name of the junta. Officially, it will disappear as the new government is formed, but critics say the same officers will remain in power and, crucially, Senior Gen. Than Shwe is expected to remain commander in chief of the army. How much does it cost to participate? Each candidate has to pay a US$500 fee for running in the election -- and the fee has been criticized as an obstacle to many who would otherwise stand for election. So if it's a sham, does that mean nothing will change? Some analysts say that although the vote is rigged, the paradigm is changing. With regional assemblies, ethnic groups may gain power and effect change on the ground. A president, not a general, will be head of state, and another set of elections will be held in five years, when perhaps democracy may have a better chance.","The election Sunday is the first in Myanmar in 20 years .

"(CNN) -- At least 23 people died Friday when demonstrations across the country were met by a fierce government crackdown, activists told CNN. Seven fatalities occurred in the suburbs of Damascus and two in the city itself, six in Deir Ezzor and Boukamal, three in Daraa and one each in Lattakia and Hama, the activists said. In addition, security forces killed three soldiers when they tried to defect; another 13 were wounded, the activists said. Demonstrators chanting anti-government slogans marched in Damascus, Homs, Lattakia and other cities, and were frequently met by security forces who fired into the crowds and beat protesters, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The agency said some neighborhoods around Damascus, Hama, Homs and Idleb ""saw gatherings"" after Friday prayers but did not elaborate. Heavy gunfire was also heard near the Abraham Mosque in a Damascus suburb and in the area of a protest in another Damascus neighborhood. The group said it had also received reports of troops near mosques in several towns. A curfew had been imposed in Jabal al-Zawiya and people were not allowed to go to mosques. They had to pray in fields, instead, the group said. CNN could not independently verify the reports. Journalist Alexander Page, who said he was with protesters who were marching from Damascus' Midan neighborhood to Zahera, reported that he saw three people shot when security forces aimed into the crowd and fired. Four buses carrying ""regime thugs and riot police"" had arrived on the scene, and security forces were stopping cars and beating people, Page said. The wounded were picked up by security forces and taken away in buses, Page said. He said a man on a motorbike filmed the faces of protesters as he drove past them. They chased and beat him, Page said. In the Damascus suburb of Haja Al Aswad, heavy gunfire was heard as demonstrators departed Abraham Mosque. In another Damascus neighborhood, security forces dispersed hundreds of protesters who were chanting anti-government slogans. Meanwhile, state media said a terrorist attack was to blame for an explosion in an oil pipeline  in Tal Kalakh, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Damascus. The explosion happened around 4 a.m., according to the state-run news agency SANA and Syria TV. They described the explosion as a bombing and said it created a 15-meter (about 50-foot) crater. ""Some citizens heard an explosion near a pipeline for transporting crude oil to Banyias,"" Homs Gov. Ghassan Abdel al-Aal told SANA. Procedures were taken to stop the oil spill and prevent it from spreading into the water of Tal Hosh Dam, the governor said. Syria has been wracked by violent government crackdowns on protests across the country since mid-March, when teens were arrested for writing anti-government graffiti in the southern city of Daraa. As the clashes intensified, demonstrators changed their demands, from calls for freedom and an end to abuses by the security forces to calls for toppling the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Syrian opposition groups have held a number of meetings in Turkey in recent months. The last one, organized by the Syrian National Salvation Council, took place in mid-July in Istanbul. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says that since the unrest in the country began, 1,513 civilians have died. It put the toll among government forces at 367, not including Friday's fatalities. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","Nine fatalities reported in Damascus and its suburbs .

"Seoul (CNN) -- Everyone's made a joke they thought was funny only to see it fall flat, but Park Jung-geun's attempt at humor could see him jailed for up to seven years in South Korea. Park, a photographer by profession, re-tweeted some messages from North Korea's official twitter feed, such as reports on the late leader Kim Jong Il's travels across the country and negative tweets about South Korea. ""I found the messages ludicrous because they are so harsh and the language is so out-dated. I found them funny, so I re-tweeted them,"" Park told CNN. Park, 23, also took a photo of himself holding a whiskey bottle and edited in a North Korean flag as a background for a joke. His supporters then doctored a North Korean military poster, replacing a smiling soldier with a sad photo of Park and the image of the gun with another whiskey bottle. But Park was imprisoned in January of this year, accused of ""acts that benefit the enemy"" and spreading North Korean propaganda. He was released on bail in February and has another court appearance in mid-July. He's still hoping the charges against him will be dropped. ""To be honest, if you did this in North Korea, you would be severely punished,"" Park said. ""But this is South Korea and I thought there wouldn't be a problem as I did it for fun. It certainly wasn't for propaganda purposes."" Park is the latest person to fall foul of South Korea's controversial National Security Law (NSL). Used widely during the years of military dictatorship in the 1970s and '80s, the law was designed to protect the state against North Korean propaganda and to prosecute spies. But human rights groups say it was also used to persecute political dissidents and stifle freedom of speech. Amnesty International says the law is still being abused, especially against those critical of the government's policies on North Korea. ""The NSL has a chilling effect on freedom of expression in South Korea,"" said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty's Asia-Pacific director. ""It is used, not to address threats to national security, but instead to intimidate people and limit their rights to free speech. It should be reformed in line with human rights law and if the government cannot do this, it must be abolished,"" he said. The United Nations has also called on Seoul to change or repeal the law. President Lee Myung-bak's office declined to comment on the issue but the law has certainly been more widely used since the conservative president came to power in 2008. That year, just five people were prosecuted on charges of pro-North Korean online postings. Two years later that number had jumped to 82. Some within the South Korean media are also criticizing the Lee administration for interfering in press freedom. Journalists from four major networks went on strike earlier this year. Employees from two of those stations have since gone back to work after promises from employers their concerns would be heard, but close to one thousand journalists remain on strike. ""President Lee Myung-bak has appointed pro-government people as presidents of the media companies, what we call 'parachutes,'' said Kim Jong-wook, head of the YTN labor union which is still on strike. ""They are now trying to censor our voice and stop criticism of the government,"" he added. The government denies interference but picketing journalists say they are worried they are seeing increased censorship reminiscent of the dark days of dictatorship.","South Korean man arrested over re-tweets of ""funny"" North Korean tweets .

"Washington (CNN) -- Foreign aid, a topic often overlooked on the presidential campaign trail, seems to sport a giant bull's-eye among Republicans this election season. GOP presidential hopeful Rick Perry proposed setting foreign aid accounts to zero if elected. One of his opponents, Mitt Romney, suggested last month that China should bear more responsibility for direct humanitarian aid abroad, instead of collecting interest on loans to the United States. These candidates and others imply that cutting this one-line item is the key to balancing our federal budget and a near panacea for economic woes at home. Understandably, GOP candidates have focused inward in their stump speeches, promising to create jobs and stimulate our sluggish economy. Americans rightly are worried about their own livelihoods and bank accounts. In Tuesday's GOP debate being aired on CNN, I urge the presidential candidates not to dismiss the lifesaving work done overseas by nonprofit organizations such as those I represent. Not only is helping others part of this country's moral fabric, but it also makes fiscal sense for the United States and, thus, for voters' wallets. Just as Americans' systematically examine their own family's spending decisions, I suggest that GOP presidential candidates apply similar personal finance principles to evaluate why foreign aid is worth the investment. Don't be penny wise but pound foolish . Emergencies and disasters are inevitable -- from natural calamities to catastrophic illness. Financially savvy Americans know to protect their assets by spending small amounts on insurance and other precautionary measures. Foreign aid is this nation's insurance. First, the investment -- like an insurance premium -- is relatively small. Foreign aid comprises less than 1% of the federal budget. Secondly, experts agree that small cash outlays can prevent major expenses later. For example, droughts happen everywhere -- from Texas to East Africa. What is not inevitable, however, is famine. In places such as Texas, Ethiopia and Kenya, investments in agriculture techniques, good storage facilities and infrastructure have allowed people to plan for the unexpected. The Texas drought, which affected 70% of the state, did have a ripple effect on food and cotton prices worldwide. But no Texans starved to death. Similarly, in East Africa earlier this year, long-term farming and food infrastructure investments in Ethiopia and Kenya meant that this year's drought in these countries was far less catastrophic. In Somalia, by contrast, the famine has put the lives of millions at risk. Invest wisely and enjoy significant returns . History shows us that investing in today's aid recipients will help convert them to tomorrow's consumers of American exports. Eleven of the 15 largest importers of American goods and services are former recipients of U.S. foreign aid -- including South Korea, Taiwan and Brazil. In today's increasingly global economy, experts agree that the United States will not recover from the Great Recession on its own. The U.S. Department of Commerce estimates that for every $1 billion in goods the U.S. exports, 6,000 manufacturing jobs are supported here at home. And 95% of the world's consumers live outside the United States. Research released in October by the African Development Bank shows that Africa's income is expected to triple in the next 50 years, and that most African countries ""will attain upper middle income status"" by then. All these individuals are potential consumers of American goods. Always hunt for bargains . For necessary items and services, bargain hunting pays off. Foreign aid's real price tag is a bargain compared with what it's worth to taxpayers. Year after year, polling shows that Americans are willing to spend 10 times what the government now allocates to foreign aid. The majority think humanitarian aid and development programs eat up 25% of the federal budget, and then settle on 10% as an appropriate amount. And yet the real amount is less than 1% -- a bargain. Five former secretaries of state -- from Henry Kissinger to Condoleezza Rice -- last week expressed their support for funding the international affairs budget not only as ""strategic investments in our nation's security and prosperity,"" but also to ""demonstrate America's proud tradition of goodwill and global leadership."" Americans have always shown tremendous generosity even in tough economic times. More Americans donated to Haiti earthquake relief efforts than watched the Super Bowl last year. Giving USA reports that giving by individuals is on the rise -- up 2.7% in 2010 over the previous year. And the biggest percentage increase in donations went to charities involved in international affairs: a 15% increase. No presidential candidate wants to be out of touch with voters. I urge GOP candidates to frame their position on foreign aid based on what Americans want: To safeguard their wallets and show compassion for people suffering overseas. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Samuel A. Worthington.","GOP presidential hopefuls are targeting foreign aid, says Samuel A. Worthington .
Foreign assistance comprises less than 1% of the federal budget, he says .
Countries we aid now may be tomorrow's consumers of American exports, he says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Think of President Barack Obama's pivot from last week's anemic job growth numbers to Monday's populist call to lower taxes for the middle class as the political equivalent of shifting an awkward dinner party conversation to a rousing comment about the home team's last game. The president spoke from the East Room on Monday surrounded by a group of middle-class families standing in rapt attention as Obama spoke of ""rebuilding an economy where work pays off."" Later in the day, the president was to echo his call to extend the Bush-era cuts to those making less than $250,000 a year during interviews with local and regional television stations and at a pair of campaign events. ""Right now our top priority has to be giving middle-class families ... security they deserve,"" Obama said Monday to applause. It was a decidedly more upbeat tone than on Friday, when the president was hammered over a relatively stagnant job growth rate and an unemployment rate of 8.2%. ""Obama is saying consciously, 'I'm going to change the direction of what I'm talking about. Really, here is my strongest argument -- I want people to hear that,'"" said Robert Lehrman, who was a speechwriter for dozens of Democratic political figures including Vice President Al Gore and is author of ""The Political Speechwriter's Companion."" Obama has hit the message reset button before during this campaign cycle. Attention was diverted from a month of dismal economic news in June when he announced a temporary halt to deportation of certain young undocumented immigrants. The move knocked GOP strategists back on their heels and they scrambled to respond. But it's a tactic with mixed results. Republicans immediately pounced on the president's call on Congress to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for those making less than $250,000 a year, describing it as ""desperate."" Congressional Republicans pointed out that the president's call for the tax cuts extension is not new and accused the president of trying to steer the narrative away from last week's dismal jobs news. There was no mention of Monday's event on the president's week-ahead schedule update on Friday, and the Obama campaign spent the weekend pounding Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on his overseas accounts. Romney's campaign also questioned the president's timing, which was coupled with the release of an ad in key states attacking the presumptive GOP nominee's stance on abortion. ""It's no coincidence that a day after a disastrous jobs report, the Obama campaign drops viciously negative and false ads against Gov. Romney, desperate to change the subject,"" spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg told FoxNews.com. ""The economy has gone negative on President Obama, so he has decided to go negative on Mitt Romney."" Both Obama and Romney have had hits and misses when it comes to trying to change the subject, said Julian Zelizer, a CNN contributor and history and public affairs professor at Princeton University, who has written books on former presidents George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. ""I don't think Romney is very good at it. He's best when he focuses on one topic -- the economy. (On that issue) he's extremely disciplined and extremely focused,"" Zelizer said. ""Obama is OK, but he hasn't been successful at it. He has a lot of skills, but he doesn't have the ability of Clinton or Reagan to change the topic."" ""There are subtle ways to (change the subject),"" Zelizer said. ""The most famous in that style was Ronald Reagan -- Jimmy Carter would be talking and he would say, 'There you go again.'"" And sometimes, politicians just goof. Last month, Obama said the private sector was ""doing fine"" compared to the public sector, comments he later tried to walk back. ""When Obama did that private sector ad lib I'm sure right after he just about bit his tongue off,"" Lehrman said. ""Or Romney with saying, 'I like being able to fire people.'"" But Romney held his own during last month's interview with Bob Schieffer on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" which touched on immigration, Lehrman said. ""I think in that exchange he was pervasive and skillful. ... You have to think not just how could he steer the conversation but what bad things did he avoid,"" Lehrman said, adding that the thorny issue of immigration was full of potential pitfalls that could have come back to haunt Romney. ""Contrast Romney, who is skillful, with (Rep. Michele Bachmann),"" Lehrman said, critiquing the two politicians' communication styles. ""... She kept reflexively going home to the statement she wanted to make. It looked like she had no ability to think on her feet."" Obama was able to successfully change the broader political conversation when he pushed for health care reform at a time when tempers flared over a bailout of many of the nation's largest banks. The health care debate consumed public attention for more than a year, Zelizer pointed out. ""A president can do that, for example, because that's the bully pulpit. ... The most dramatic way is to start a new legislative initiative in the middle of the campaign. ... It can look like when Clinton was being impeached and all of a sudden he's bombing Iraq."" But most importantly, candidates can change the subject by offering something substantive, political experts say. To that end, Romney can recapture the conversation if he can shake criticism that he has no alternative plans to offer other than attacking Obama. ""Romney needs to say 'Here's a package or program to consider,'"" Zelizer said.","President Obama's call for a tax cut for middle class changed dialogue on economy .
Obama and Romney have had hits and misses when switching political messages .
Political experts say offering substance over style always best when switching messages ."
"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A mix up between a computer tablet and a teleprompter during Sunday's BET Awards created an awkward moment that reminded viewers of Chris Brown's domestic violence conviction on a night that otherwise was Brown's triumph. The 2011 BET Awards paid nostalgic and emotional tributes to several fallen stars and the living Patti LaBelle, but embattled hip hop singer Chris Brown dominated Sunday night's show. Brown, who admitted guilt two years ago to the brutal assault of ex-girlfriend Rihanna, won four trophies and performed twice during the telecast from Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium. Brown broke down in tears on the same stage during the BET Awards a year ago while performing a tribute to Michael Jackson. Ironically, Rihanna was mistakenly announced as the winner of the Coca-Cola Viewers Choice Award near the end of Sunday's telecast. BET later clarified that Brown was the ""viewers choice,"" not Rihanna. Tiffany Green, a fan from Flat Rock, Michigan, was chosen to read the winner's name from a Sprint Evo tablet. Green first called Brown's name, but then squinted at the teleprompter before confidently announcing that Rihanna had won. ""Well, that was awkward,"" singer Drake said as he accepted the award for Rihanna, who was not present. Stephen Hill, BET's programming president, took blame backstage for what he called ""a human error."" Brown's name was correctly on the tablet in Green's hand, but the show producers put the wrong name -- Rihanna's -- on the teleprompter, Hill said. Photos of Green's stunned expression quickly became an Internet sensation. She tweeted that she was weeping backstage. Rihanna was honored earlier with the best female R&B artist award. When the dust settled, Brown had won for best male R&B Artist, video of the year, best collaboration, and the viewer's choice award. Not only did BET let Brown perform a medley of his songs, but he later took the stage with rapper Big Sean. When Brown made a post-show appearance in the backstage media room, he refused to answer questions. Instead, he laid down on the stage with two trophies, posing with a big smile. ""I didn't get to thank God for this,"" Brown later tweeted. ""He has taught me a lesson in life. and I appreciate everything! Thank you!"" Brown was sentenced to five years probation and 180 days of community service after he entered a guilty plea in June 2009 to assaulting Rihanna while they were in a car the night before the 2009 Grammy Awards. The judge later praised Brown ""for taking responsibility"" by completing his probation requirements. The BET show delivered more than the current auto-tuned hip-hop hits, opening with the natural voices of Mary J. Blige and 1980s songstress Anita Baker singing a duet. ""After 30 years, this isn't supposed to happen,"" an overwhelmed Baker said backstage. The auditorium rumbled during a musical tribute to Patti LaBelle, who was given a lifetime achievement award. Gladys Knight, Cee Lo Green and Marsha Ambrosius serenaded LaBelle before gospel legend Shirley Caesar brought her to tears. Finally, LaBelle reminded the audience that she is still going strong after five decades in the music business by singing two of her classics -- ""Love, Need and Want You"" and ""Lady Marmalade."" Alicia Keys premiered a new song, ""Typewriter,"" before singing a medley of her hits, including ""Falling."" Five artist who died since last year's show were honored with a memorial segment, including Cali Swag District member M-Bone, who was killed in a drive-by shooting last month. The three surviving group members performed a tribute. E Street Band saxophonist Clarence Clemons, R&B singer-songwriter Teena Marie, poet-musician Gil Scott Heron and hip-hop legend Nate Dogg were remembered by performances and appearances by Doug E. Fresh, Queen Latifah, Ledisi, Scott Mayo, Snoop Dogg and Warren G. In a nod to younger fans, Justin Bieber delivered a scripted on-stage proposition to Nicki Minaj, the winner for best female hip hop artist. ""I'm all grown up now. I turn 18 next year so, what's up?"" Bieber said to Minaj. BET voters were stuck on which of Will and Jada Smith's two children deserved the Young Star award, so Jaden and Willow Smith were both honored. After comedian Steve Harvey accepted a BET humanitarian award, he told reporters backstage that he was giving up stand up comedy. ""I don't want to be telling jokes at 60,"" said Harvey, 54. He's focusing his career now on being a motivational speaker, he said.","Patti LaBelle lifetime achievement tribute rocks the auditorium .

"(CNN) -- The president of Florida A&M University announced his resignation Wednesday, more than seven months after a drum major for the university band died following a hazing incident. ""After considerable thought, introspection and conversations with my family, I have decided to resign from my position as president in order to initiate my retirement on October 11, 2012,"" James H. Ammons wrote in a letter to the chairman of the school's board of trustees, Solomon Badger III. Ammons said he is leaving the post he has held for five years, effective this fall, but would remain as a tenured professor. He made no direct reference to hazing in his letter. Recommendations for suspension preceded FAMU band death . Last month, the school's trustees supported by 8-4 a no-confidence vote over Ammons' performance. ""I hear you loudly and clearly,"" Ammons told the board at the time. ""I understand there are some measures that I have to take as president of this university to fix things, and I am going to fix them."" In a statement, Badger said Wednesday that he was saddened by Ammons' decision to resign, ""but it is his choice to do so. Given all that has transpired, it seems to be in the best interest of the university, and I applaud him for putting FAMU ahead of his personal goals."" The resignation comes after the November 19 death of Robert Champion, 26. In a statement, Champion's family said ""the rampant culture of hazing found at FAMU would not and could not be eradicated without some major housecleaning of those who turned a blind eye to the problem."" Champion died within an hour of being badly beaten during a hazing ritual on a band bus after a football game in Orlando, Florida. The ritual, called ""Crossing Bus C,"" is an initiation process in which pledges attempt to run down the center aisle while being assaulted by senior members, according to some university band members. FAMU president gets no confidence vote amid hazing scandal . An autopsy found ""extensive contusions of his chest, arms, shoulder and back,"" and ""evidence of crushing of areas of subcutaneous fat,"" the medical examiner reported, ruling the death a homicide. A police investigation resulted in charges against 14 people. Eleven face one count of third-degree felony hazing resulting in death. Each also is accused of two counts of first-degree misdemeanor hazing. Three people each face a single count of misdemeanor first-degree hazing. FAMU said it took steps to eradicate the problem of hazing after Champion's death, and the board of trustees approved an anti-hazing plan that includes an independent panel of experts to investigate hazing allegations. Since then, Julian White has retired as band director, the Florida A&M board of trustees issued a vote of no confidence against Ammons and the marching band has been suspended through the 2012-2013 school year. Champion's parents met Wednesday with prosecutors to receive an update about criminal charges being pressed against those involved in their son's death. The Champions have filed a lawsuit suit against the school's board of trustees, the company that owns the bus in which the abuse occurred and the bus driver. The 33-page document, which was filed Tuesday in circuit court in Orange County, Florida, does not specify damages being sought. It claims the bus driver participated in or allowed hazing rituals to occur on the buses she was operating. Witnesses paint violent blow-by-blow picture of FAMU hazing .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Seventeen-year-old women should be able to buy the ""morning-after pill"" without a prescription within a few weeks, a government spokesman said Thursday. Plan B, also called the morning-after pill, is intended to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex. The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that the contraceptive will be available over the counter to 17-year-olds, as it currently is for women 18 and older. Agency spokesman George Strait said Thursday the approval process for the change will not take long. ""It's likely to be weeks, rather than months or years before it's approved,"" he said. The FDA just needs to review the label changes from the drug's maker, Duramed, Strait said. Once that's done, the approval will be complete. On March 23, a federal court ordered that Plan B, an emergency contraception pill, be made available over the counter to those 17 and older, the agency said in a statement on its Web site. The agency will not appeal that order, the statement said. In the order, U.S. District Judge Edward Korman also asked the agency to consider whether the pill should be available to women of all ages without a prescription, saying that such a determination is best left to the expertise of the FDA rather than a federal district judge.  Watch more on the Plan B controversy » . And he rebuked the FDA for apparently departing from its own procedures with respect to making decisions on the pill's over-the-counter status, noting the ""unusual involvement of the White House in the Plan B decision-making process."" The plaintiffs in the case presented ""unrebutted evidence of the FDA's lack of good faith"" toward the application to switch Plan B from prescription to non-prescription use, the judge wrote. ""This lack of good faith is evidenced by, among other things, (1) repeated and unreasonable delays, pressure emanating from the White House, and the obvious connection between the confirmation process of two FDA commissioners and the timing of the FDA's decisions; and (2) significant departures from the FDA's normal procedures and policies ... as compared to the review of other switch applications in the past 10 years,"" Korman wrote. In August 2006, the FDA approved the sale of Plan B without a prescription to those 18 and older, but those 17 and under needed a prescription to obtain it. But, the agency said in Wednesday's statement, ""in accordance with the court's order, and consistent with the scientific findings since 2005 by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, FDA sent a letter to the manufacturer of Plan B that the company may, upon submission and approval of an appropriate application, market Plan B without a prescription to women 17 years of age and older."" ""No useful purpose would be served by continuing to deprive 17-year-olds access to Plan B without a prescription,"" Korman wrote in his order. ""Indeed, the record shows that FDA officials and staff both agreed that 17-year-olds can use Plan B safely without a prescription. The FDA's justification for this age restriction, that pharmacists would be unable to enforce the prescription requirement if the cutoff were age 17, rather than 18, lacks all credibility.""  Watch bloggers debate the merits of Plan B » . Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards said in a statement that the FDA's announcement is ""a strong statement to American women that their health comes before politics. And that's the way it should be. This decision is common-sense policy that will help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and protect the health and safety of all women."" The morning-after pill -- made by Duramed, a subsidiary of Barr Pharmaceuticals -- is intended to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex. It works by stopping ovulation and decreasing the chances that a fertilized egg will attach to the uterus. When used within 72 hours of unprotected sex, it can lower the risk of pregnancy by almost 90 percent, the maker says. Some critics charge that the drug's action amounts to an abortion, and opposed making it available over the counter. Others expressed health concerns. ""Plan B is a high dose of birth control pills. ... The FDA violated its standards when it made the high-dose Plan B available nonprescription to adults. But now the FDA is making the drug available to minors without parental consent,"" the Concerned Women for America, a Washington-based conservative Christian group, said Wednesday. ""Parents should be furious that the FDA is putting their minor daughters at risk,"" the group said.","Judge asks FDA to weigh availability to women of all ages .

"(CNN) -- The United States announced Wednesday that it is easing sanctions on Myanmar, also known as Burma, allowing American companies to conduct business in the Southeast Asian nation. An investment ban had been in place since 1997. ""President Thein Sein, Aung San Suu Kyi and the people of Burma continue to make significant progress along the path to democracy, and the government has continued to make important economic and political reforms,"" President Barack Obama said in a written statement. ""Easing sanctions is a strong signal of our support for reform, and will provide immediate incentives for reformers and significant benefits to the people of Burma."" Myanmar VP nominee 'disappoints' reformers . The country has undertaken recent reforms, including the release of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who is now a member of parliament and leader of a political opposition group. But, Obama cautioned, the nation's ""political and economic reforms remain unfinished."" ""The United States government remains deeply concerned about the lack of transparency in Burma's investment environment and the military's role in the economy,"" he said in the statement. For decades, Myanmar was ruled by a repressive military junta. But in recent years, the generals have relaxed their grip on power, permitting Thein Sein's administration to push through a series of changes, including peace talks with rebel groups and the release of hundreds of political prisoners. Last week, the government announced the planned release of 24 political detainees, the latest after hundreds of political prisoners were set free in the previous year as part of the reforms. Other Western governments have responded to the efforts by easing sanctions on the country.","The United States announces it is easing sanctions on Myanmar, also known as Burma .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. is ""receiving intensive medical treatment at a residential treatment facility for a mood disorder,"" according to a statement released by the congressman's office, which attributed the quote to an unidentified doctor. The Illinois Democrat and son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader, has not been on Capitol Hill since late May, and in early June his office announced he was taking a leave of absence because he was suffering from a ""medical condition."" Jackson's office on Wednesday noted that information on Jackson's status is protected by federal law, as is the information of all medical patients. At the same time, the congressman's office released what it said was a statement from Jackson's doctor. Jackson's office declined to give the doctor's name. The doctor also was quoted as saying Jackson ""is responding positively to treatment and is expected to make a full recovery."" Depression in the workplace: Don't ask, don't tell? According to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, ""mood disorder"" is a broad term covering a variety of neurobiological abnormalities that can include a major depressive episode, bipolar disorder and catatonia. ""Generally speaking, to be diagnosed with a mood disorder, your feelings must be intense, with the patient feeling either depressed, or having excessive energy for days at a time, where sleep is not needed and decision-making can be significantly hindered, or one can fluctuate between both extremes,"" said Nancy Molitor, a psychologist in private practice in Wilmette, Illinois, and assistant clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at Northwestern University School of Medicine in Chicago. Jackson's illness comes as the House Ethics Committee is examining allegations that in 2008 he or one of his associates offered to raise funds for then-Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich in exchange for the Senate seat vacated by President Barack Obama going to Jackson. Pelosi: Jackson should take all the time he needs . Jackson has maintained his innocence and pledged to continue to cooperate with authorities. ""I did nothing illegal, unethical or inappropriate in that pursuit, and I believe that is what the Ethics Committee will conclude at the end of this process,"" he said. In a separate incident, Jackson apologized to his constituents in September 2010, after the Chicago Sun-Times reported that a Chicago businessman told federal investigators that Jackson had asked him to pay for a restaurant hostess to fly between Washington and Chicago several times. He said he was ""deeply sorry"" that he had ""disappointed some supporters."" A life shaped by history . Earlier Wednesday, before Jackson's office released the statement about his health, Democrats in the House of Representatives aired differing views on whether the younger Jackson should reveal the details behind his leave of absence. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said Jackson should disclose information on his own timetable, but Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the House minority whip, said more information should be provided. ""He's obviously facing a health problem,"" Hoyer said Wednesday in response to a question from CNN. ""People get sick. And when people get sick, they miss work. Everybody in America understands that, but I think the family would be well-advised to give his constituents as much information as is appropriate."" It was a direct message from a House Democratic leader who had been reluctant, until now, to publicly press Jackson for more detail. Rep. Jackson's ailments 'more serious' than 'initially believed' The chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus told reporters Wednesday he has spoken several times with members of Jackson's ""blood family"" and is confident Jackson will return from his leave of absence. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Missouri, said there was no urgency for Jackson or his family to come forward with any details about the absence. Cleaver told reporters outside the House chamber that ""when the people in his district have become concerned, then Congressman Jackson will respond, but so far there is no evidence that there is upheaval in his congressional district."" Added Cleaver: ""He's fine. He's an old football player -- he'll be back."" Cleaver made it clear he is in regular contact with Jackson's family, not directly with Jackson himself. ""It's frustrating and upsetting to me"" that other Democrats on Capitol Hill have called on Jackson to provide more information, Cleaver said. Every member of Congress deserves privacy, he added, and he cited Congress' vote on a law that keeps medical information confidential. ""This is not about a congressman. This is about a human being who is sick. This is not a political matter; it's a health matter,"" he said. Cleaver said Jackson's situation was discussed at the weekly Congressional Black Caucus lunch on Wednesday and added that caucus members were alarmed that other Democrats were urging the family to provide more information. ""We all agreed today, 100%, that that should not be the way in which we deal with members of Congress who get ill,"" Cleaver said. Pressure began mounting on Jackson, a nine-term representative, on Tuesday after comments to reporters in Chicago by fellow Illinois Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin. ""As a public official ... there reaches a point when you have a responsibility to tell people what you're facing and how things are going. Sen. Kirk has done that, and I think Congressman Jackson will face that, too,"" Durbin said. Earlier this year, Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, suffered a stroke. He is still recovering and his office continues to give updates on his progress. More questions arose late last week, when Jackson communications director Frank Watkins said, ""Congressman Jackson's medical condition is more serious than we thought and initially believed."" ""We have been made aware that he has grappled with certain physical and emotional ailments privately for a long period of time,"" Watkins said. Initially, Jackson's office said the congressman was suffering from ""exhaustion."" House Ethics Committee finds 'probable cause' to suspect Jackson misconduct .

"Washington (CNN) -- House Republicans voted Wednesday to repeal President Barack Obama's signature health care reform law despite Democratic objections that the move was a waste of time. The vote amounted to political theater because the measure is sure to die in the Democratic-led Senate and the White House has made clear Obama would veto any repeal. Five Democrats joined the Republican majority in the 244-185 vote. Democratic leaders said a handful of their caucus members facing tough re-election battles in November might side with the Republicans on the volatile issue. Wednesday's vote was the latest of more than 30 House GOP efforts to undermine the 2010 Affordable Care Act, including previous Republican moves to repeal the measure or cut funding for various provisions. Prior to the final vote, the House rejected a Democratic motion that would have required any legislator supporting the repeal measure to give up government-provided health care. In debate on the issue this week, Democrats noted the Supreme Court ruled on June 28 to uphold the health care law's constitutionality, which they said should end talk of repeal and instead inspire bipartisan efforts to address the nation's weak economic recovery. ""With millions still out of work and families struggling to make ends meet, Republicans are responding how? By voting to take away critical health care protections for people,"" Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, told reporters. Voters: Can we move on please? Republicans, however, said the issue remains a priority for their constituents and defended the need to combat what they call a threat to patient-focused health care and the economy. ""It is not a game to be played,"" declared House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, before the voting started. Earlier, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, told CNN that health care reform ""happens to be the seminal issue of our time."" ""Those of us who want patient-centered health care have had two years to repeal it,"" Hensarling said. ""I think it's kind of unreasonable to think we're going to go away."" Opinion polls indicate public confusion on the issue amid the sharp political divide. A CNN/ORC International poll conducted June 28-July 1 showed 52% of respondents favor all or most provisions of the health care law, while at the same time, 51% want Congress to repeal the entire measure. On both issues, Democrats were strongly in favor of keeping the law intact while Republicans were equally supportive of repealing or dismantling it. Independents reflected the conflicting findings of the poll, with 56% favoring repeal while 51% support all or most of the law's provisions. At committee hearings and on the House floor Tuesday, the debate on the repeal measure devolved into repetitive opposing claims about the health care law. ""This law is historic, but for all the wrong reasons,"" argued Rep. Sam Graves, R-Missouri. ""It reaches too far into the personal decisions of Americans and it puts a heavy burden on our economy and small businesses. It's an example of big government at its absolute worst."" Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the Democratic National Committee chair, noted the multiple previous House votes to repeal all or part of the health reform law. ""It is time to stop the tantrums, grow up, and work together on Americans' number one priority -- creating jobs,"" she said. Another Democrat, Rep. Lynn Woolsey of California, accused Republicans of ""serving more baloney"" regarding the health care law, while GOP members complained it was Obama and Democrats who misled the public on the the measure's cost and impact. Some in Congress are urging state governments to opt out of the health care law's provisions setting up health insurance exchanges and expanding Medicaid coverage for the poor and disabled. So far, a handful of states have said they will hold off on both provisions. The exchanges will provide consumers and businesses with options for obtaining health coverage, as required under the law's individual mandate. Both the exchanges and the Medicaid expansion are intended to reduce the number of uninsured Americans. By opting out, state governments hope to avoid a possible increased financial burden as the health care law gets fully implemented beginning in 2014. Opponents of the law also want to obstruct progress on implementation as much as possible while they try to get it repealed or dismantled. ""It starts a process that we believe has to be repealed because we can't afford it,"" conservative Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, told CNN on Wednesday. He is leading the state opt-out effort. ""The bottom line is, our country is broke,"" DeMint said. ""This is going to cost trillions of dollars. It's going to diminish the quality and access to health care."" However, analysts and industry experts contend health care reform will happen out of necessity, whether through the Affordable Care Act or the momentum it already has created since being passed over two years ago. How are you affected by the health care ruling? Share your views in the iReport Debate . According to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers' Health Research Institute, 14 states and the District of Columbia have made ""significant progress"" toward implementing reforms, while another 19 states have made ""moderate progress,"" leaving 17 states -- or about a third -- that have yet to change their laws or take other steps toward implementation. The report, titled ""Implications of the U.S. Supreme Court Ruling on Healthcare,"" says all players in the health care industry -- state governments, hospitals, insurance companies, employers and drug companies -- need to participate in the emerging reform process or risk getting left behind. DeMint appeared to concede that reality Wednesday, saying the goal is to ""give the states more flexibility to help individuals own their own health insurance, policies that they can keep from job to job, and hopefully into retirement. And a lot of states have begun that process."" He also echoed an emerging GOP talking point that praises what Obama and Democrats sought to achieve through health care reform pushed through Congress with no Republican support. ""We appreciate some of the goals of the president,"" DeMint said. ""We need every American to have access to affordable health insurance. The best way to do that is at ... the state level that respects the relationship between the patient and the doctor."" Democrats also point to a state solution that worked -- the health care reforms implemented by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney when he was governor of Massachusetts. Throughout Tuesday's committee hearings and floor debate on health care reform, Democratic legislators repeatedly noted how Romney's Massachusetts plan served as a model for the federal plan Republicans seek to eliminate, including the individual mandate detested by conservatives. Romney now pledges to repeal the federal law, a necessary position for any Republican in today's hyper-partisan GOP political environment. He argues his Massachusetts law was right for the state but never intended as a federal solution, but he also calls for keeping some popular provisions of what is known as Obamacare, such as preventing insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. What the Supreme Court ruled on health care 'tax' The health care issue has been among the most divisive of Obama's presidency. Conservative anger over the measure helped launch the tea party movement, and conservative groups joined with industry groups to fund a giant public pressure campaign against the legislation. Some provisions already have brought popular benefits, such as the one on pre-existing conditions. The bulk of the health care law will take effect in 2014. In its ruling, the Supreme Court said the individual mandate -- the requirement that all people have insurance -- is constitutional under the government's taxing authority, and Republicans have jumped on that to characterize the provision as a tax increase on middle-class Americans. What the health care ruling means to you . Obama and Democrats respond that only people who can afford health insurance but choose not to get it would have to pay, amounting to about 1% of the population. The continued GOP attacks seek to bolster public opposition to the law and force Democrats to publicly defend it. Republicans have made clear that the goal is to inspire voters to rally against the law and Obama in the November presidential election. ""If you give us more elected representatives to fix this problem, we will fix this problem in 2013,"" House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said Tuesday in an interview with CNBC. The White House formally notified House leaders on Monday that Obama will veto any repeal bill that manages to reach his desk, saying repeal ""would cost millions of hard-working middle-class families the security of affordable health coverage and care they deserve."" ""The last thing the Congress should do is refight old political battles and take a massive step backward by repealing basic protections that provide security for the middle class,"" a White House statement said. But Republicans called for eliminating the law and starting over on the complex issue that affects every American. ""That's why we've voted over 30 times to repeal it, defund it, replace it. And we are resolved to have this law go away and we're gonna do everything we can to stop it,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- Cadel Evans secured Australia's first ever Tour de France victory after the 21st and final stage of the historic race culminated on the streets of Paris. Evans, who rides for the BMC team, finished amidst the peleton in the 95km stage, to maintain his 1min 34sec lead over Andy Schleck of Luxembourg. Britain's Mark Cavendish, of HTC-Highroad, sealed a hat-trick of victories on the Champs Elysees to take the green jersey, awarded for the Tour's best sprinter. Samuel Sanchez, of the Euskaltel team, claimed the polka dot jersey and Frenchman Pierre Rolland, of Europcar, scooped the white jersey after becoming the best placed rider 25 and under. Cadel Evans: From the outback to Tour de France fame . Evans has twice finished runner up in the world's premier cycling event, in 2007 and 2008, and was mobbed by his teammates as soon as he crossed the line in the French capital. It was Evans' commanding performance in Saturday's individual time trial that secured him both the yellow jersey and an unassailable lead, and the final flat stage of the race was little more than a procession. Evans, who became Australia's first ever world road race champion in 2009, told reporters: ""It's been 20 years since I watched my very first Tour de France on TV and I said I'd like to win it. A lot of people didn't believe it. ""But some very good people believed in me, from my very first coach right through to the ones who turned me to the road. ""It's been years of hard work and there were a lot of moments in this three weeks where our Tour was lost but to get here safely with all my skin, just that alone is a quest in itself. ""But to be here wearing the yellow jersey -- for my team, my country, a group of people around me... it leaves me a little lost for words."" An emotional Evans paid tribute to Aldo Sassi -- his mentor who died of a brain tumor a year ago. ""Aldo Sassi always believed in me, more than I did myself,"" he added. ""He said to me at one point, I hope that you can win a grand Tour and I hope for you it is the Tour de France for it's the most prestigious. If you do, you'll become the most complete rider of your generation."" Andy Schleck finished second for the third successive year, with his brother Frank coming third. Frenchman Thomas Voeckler was fourth with last year's champion, Alberto Contador, of Spain, finishing fifth. ""It's been a perfect Tour de France but there's only one who can win,"" Andy Schleck told the Tour's official web site. ""We knew that from the start and that's Cadel and he also deserves this victory. He's been fighting for it. I was fighting too but he was stronger and I'll be back."" A jubilant Cavendish, who has now won a total of 20 Tour de France stages, said: ""This is absolutely my best Tour de France yet. The green jersey is an objective I've had in mind for a long time. It's incredible to get it.""","Cadel Evans secures Australia's first ever Tour de France victory .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Essam Sharaf said Monday that clashes hours earlier between army forces and pro-Coptic Christian protesters had ""brought us back"" to the tense, violent period at the onset of the recent revolution. ""Instead of going forward, we found ourselves scrambling for security,"" Sharaf said on state television in an early morning speech, noting that the incident had produced ""martyrs, both civilian and from the military."" The bloodshed in Cairo occurred just over a week after the burning of a Coptic Christian church in southern Egypt. The burning prompted the Sunday protest demanding equality and protection of Coptic places of worship. Dr. Sheriff Doss, the head of Egypt's chief association of Coptics, said 17 civilians died and 40 were injured. An additional 12 army troops were killed and over 50 were injured, according to Lt. Col. Amr Imam, an army spokesman. Meanwhile, health ministry spokesman Adel Al Dawi said late Sunday that there were a total of 23 people dead and more than 180 injured. The protesters -- many of them Coptics or supportive of their cause -- said they had been marching peacefully toward the Egyptian state television building when the violence erupted. ""Suddenly, we were attacked by thugs carrying swords and clubs,"" one protester, Magdi Hanna, told CNN. According to Alla Mahmoud, an interior ministry spokesman, some protesters began ""firing live ammunition at the army."" ""This is the first time protesters fired at the army,"" added Imam, the military spokesman. ""There must be a hidden hand behind this. Egyptians don't do that."" Mohammed Abdel Jabaar, a spokesman for the Egyptian Rebels Coalition that claims to have been part of the movement that led to former President Hosni Mubarak's ouster, blamed ""interference from outside"" for spurring the violent chain of events. The January 25 youth revolution coalition, which has been involved in various anti-government protests including Sunday's demonstration, denied that any participants shot at the Egyptian forces. Samir Bolos, one of the demonstrators, added Sunday that ""some unknown people may have fired at the army, but not us."" Witnesses said the army forces fired on the protesters near the state television headquarters. Meanwhile, military trucks could be seen burning on the street. Hundreds of demonstrators also went to Tahrir Square, the hub of the revolutionary movement earlier this year, according to Bolos. He claimed military police stormed the square with sticks, while protesters fought back with rocks. A curfew has been imposed for between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. Monday around Tahrir Square and central Cairo, said Imam. Egypt's National Justice Committee also plans to hold an emergency meeting Monday involving representatives from the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the al-Azhar mosque and the Coptic church to discuss the developments, prime ministry spokesman Mohamed Hegazy said. Those talks will be held in the prime minister's building. Meanwhile, state TV reported Sunday night that Ahmed al-Tayyeb, a prominent Egyptian Muslim leader and grand imam of Al-Azhar, has been reaching out to Coptic church leaders in hopes of containing the crisis. The protests and clashes follow the September 30 burning of the Mar Girgis church in Edfu, a city in Aswan governorate in southern Egypt. That attack marked the latest of several examples in which Coptic Christians have been targeted in the North African nation. About 9% of Egypt's 80 million residents are Coptic Christians. They base their theology on the teachings of the Apostle Mark, who introduced Christianity to Egypt, according to St. Takla Church in Alexandria, the capital of Coptic Christianity. The religion split with other Christians in the 5th century over the definition of the divinity of Jesus Christ. In Egypt, they have been targeted of late, including the New Year's Day bombing of a Coptic church in Alexandria that left 23 people dead. There have also been sectarian clashes, including one in Cairo on May 7 in which at least 12 people were killed. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent bipartisan federal agency, earlier this year added Egypt to a list of countries named as the worst violators of religious freedom. Sunday's incident also marks the latest skirmish between protesters and government forces. An incident last Tuesday outside a military court in Nasr City resulted in the arrests of two protesters. Journalists covering the demonstration were assaulted, according to witnesses. The same day, military police fired shots into the air to disperse about 400 pro-Coptic demonstrators who had attempted to stage a sit-in in front of the state television building after marching through the streets of Cairo.","NEW: The Egyptian Rebels Coalition blames ""interference from outside"" for the violence .

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Tunisia has sworn in a new president, a milestone in the North African country that kicked off the dramatic year-long cry for freedom across the Arab world. He is Moncef Marzouki, a secularist elected on Monday by an Islamist-dominated parliament, the Constituent Assembly. He will fulfill a more ceremonial role as the affairs of state are handled by the prime minister. Marzouki is the founder of the center-left Congress for the Republic Party. He is well-known for his firebrand style and his opposition to the old regime. The secular party has formed a coalition with the Ettakatol and Islamist Ennahda Party. Ennahda came in first to become the largest party in Tunisia's first democratic election since the ouster of former dictator Zine el Abidine Ben Ali. The Congress for the Republic Party party came in second in the October elections, collecting 29 out of 217 assembly seats. Marzouki was the only candidate because the nine other candidates for president did not gather the required 15 signatures from Constituent Assembly members. The new president lived in exile for the last decade. He is a human rights activist, founded the National Committee for the Defense of Prisoners of Conscience and was the head of the Tunisian League of Human Rights. The elections were historic not only in Tunisia -- which, until now, hadn't had a national election since it became independent in 1956 and for 23 years was ruled by Ben Ali -- but also in the region and the world. Since Ben Ali was ousted in January -- a month after 26-year-old street vendor Muhammad Al Bouazizi set himself afire after a police officer seized his goods -- residents in several other Arab nations have similarly rallied for democratic reforms and against their leaders, a show of force called the Arab Spring.","The presidency is more of a ceremonial role .

"(CNN) -- It may not be legal, but it's definitely popular. For just 10 Guatemalan quetzals, or 15 Mexican pesos (the equivalent of just over a U.S. dollar), you can pay to ride a zip line across a river and into a new country. A news team from Mexico's Televisa network, a CNN affiliate, found four zip lines crossing over the Suchiate River, which serves as part of Mexico's southeastern border with Guatemala. They observed people crossing into Mexico in broad daylight, apparently not worried about immigration authorities posted not far from there. Guatemalans on both sides of the border are in charge of the zip line and collecting money from people willing to cross. A Guatemalan immigrant getting ready to cross the border using the zip line admitted he was doing so illegally. He said he had ""obtained my passport but didn't know I also need a visa to cross"" into Mexico. Mexico shares a largely unpopulated, almost 600-mile border with Guatemala marked by jungle and rugged mountains. The zip lines connect the Guatemalan community of El Carmen to the Mexican town of Talisman. Once in Mexico, migrants travel on freight trains or by bus to the U.S. border, although many never get there. Last week, Mexican authorities stopped a bus in the central Mexican state of Queretaro with 104 undocumented migrants on board. Last August, 72 migrants were killed by a Mexican drug cartel in a ranch in San Fernando, Tamaulipas, only 100 miles south of the U.S. border. Those who do get to the U.S. border have another river to cross, the Rio Grande (or Rio Bravo, as it's known in Mexico) or a 21-foot wall. Many are now going underground. On a recent trip to Arizona, U.S. border patrol agents gave a CNN crew access to a tunnel being illegally used for this purpose. The mile-long tunnel was built to prevent flooding in the border city of Nogales, Arizona, but it has been increasingly used in recent years to smuggle immigrants and drugs. U.S. Border Patrol Agent Ariel Medeles says crossing this way can be dangerous. ""There was a group down here and then they got caught in the flash flood and hours later they were looking for a body north of the openings,"" says Medeles. Some immigrants die trekking across the treacherous Arizona desert, but many thousands more make it to the land of their dreams, after a trip of hundreds -- even thousands -- of miles. For some, that journey begins at a zip line across the Suchiate.","Zip lines cross the Suchiate River on the Guatemala-Mexico border .
People entering Mexico illegally can ride across for a relatively modest sum .
A long and dangerous road still lies ahead for those heading for the U.S."
"(Wired) -- A California student got a visit from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation this week after he found a secret GPS tracking device on his car, and a friend posted photos of it online. The post prompted wide speculation about whether the device was real, whether the young Arab-American was being targeted in a terrorism investigation and what the authorities would do. It took just 48 hours to find out: The device was real, the student was being secretly tracked and the FBI wanted their expensive device back, the student told Wired.com in an interview Wednesday. The answer came when half-a-dozen FBI agents and police officers appeared at Yasir Afifi's apartment complex in Santa Clara, California, on Tuesday demanding he return the device. Afifi, a 20-year-old U.S.-born citizen, cooperated willingly and said he'd done nothing to merit attention from authorities. Comments the agents made during their visit suggested he'd been under FBI surveillance for three to six months. An FBI spokesman wouldn't acknowledge that the device belonged to the agency or that agents appeared at Afifi's house. ""I can't really tell you much about it, because it's still an ongoing investigation,"" said spokesman Pete Lee, who works in the agency's San Francisco headquarters. Afifi, the son of an Islamic-American community leader who died a year ago in Egypt, is one of only a few people known to have found a government-tracking device on their vehicle. His discovery comes in the wake of a recent ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals saying it's legal for law enforcement to secretly place a tracking device on a suspect's car without getting a warrant, even if the car is parked in a private driveway. Brian Alseth from the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington state contacted Afifi after seeing pictures of the tracking device posted online and told him the ACLU had been waiting for a case like this to challenge the ruling. ""This is the kind of thing we like to throw lawyers at,"" Afifi said Alseth told him. ""It seems very frightening that the FBI have placed a surveillance-tracking device on the car of a 20-year-old American citizen who has done nothing more than being half-Egyptian,"" Alseth told Wired.com . Afifi, a business marketing student at Mission College in Santa Clara, discovered the device last Sunday when he took his car to a local garage for an oil change. When a mechanic at Ali's Auto Care raised his Ford Lincoln LS on hydraulic lifts, Afifi saw a wire sticking out near the right rear wheel and exhaust. Garage owner Mazher Khan confirmed for Wired.com that he also saw it. A closer inspection showed it connected to a battery pack and transmitter, which were attached to the car with a magnet. Khan asked Afifi if he wanted the device removed and when Afifi said yes, Khan pulled it easily from the car's chassis. ""I wouldn't have noticed it if there wasn't a wire sticking out,"" Afifi said. Later that day, a friend of Afifi's named Khaled posted pictures of the device at Reddit asking if anyone knew what it was and if it mean the FBI ""is after us."" (Reddit is owned by CondeNast Digital, which also owns Wired.com). ""My plan was to just put the device on another car or in a lake,"" Khaled wrote, ""but when you come home to 2 stoned off their asses people who are hearing things in the device and convinced its a bomb you just gotta be sure."" A reader quickly identified it as an Orion Guardian ST820 tracking device made by an electronics company called Cobham, which sells the device only to law enforcement. No one was available at Cobham to answer Wired.com's questions, but a former FBI agent who looked at the pictures confirmed it was a tracking device. The former agent, who asked not to be named, said the device was an older model of tracking equipment that had long ago been replaced by devices that don't require batteries. Batteries die and need to be replaced if surveillance is ongoing so newer devices are placed in the engine compartment and hardwired to the car's battery so they don't run out of juice. He was surprised this one was so easily found. ""It has to be able to be removed but also stay in place and not be seen,"" he said. ""There's always the possibility that the car will end up at a body shop or auto mechanic, so it has to be hidden well. It's very rare when the guys find them."" He said he was certain that agents who installed it would have obtained a 30-day warrant for its use. Afifi considered selling the device on Craigslist before the FBI showed up. He was in his apartment Tuesday afternoon when a roommate told him ""two sneaky-looking people"" were near his car. Afifi, already heading out for an appointment, encountered a man and woman looking his vehicle outside. The man asked if Afifi knew his registration tag was expired. When Afifi asked if it bothered him, the man just smiled. Afifi got into his car and headed for the parking lot exit when two SUVs pulled up with flashing lights carrying four police officers in bullet-proof vests. The agent who initially spoke with Afifi identified himself then as Vincent and told Afifi, ""We're here to recover the device you found on your vehicle. It's federal property. It's an expensive piece, and we need it right now."" Afifi asked, ""Are you the guys that put it there?"" and the agent replied, ""Yeah, I put it there."" He told Afifi, ""We're going to make this much more difficult for you if you don't cooperate."" Afifi retrieved the device from his apartment and handed it over, at which point the agents asked a series of questions -- did he know anyone who traveled to Yemen or was affiliated with overseas training? One of the agents produced a printout of a blog post that Afifi's friend Khaled allegedly wrote a couple of months ago. It had ""something to do with a mall or a bomb,"" Afifi said. He hadn't seen it before and doesn't know the details of what it said. He found it hard to believe Khaled meant anything threatening by the post. ""He's a smart kid and is not affiliated with anything extreme and never says anything stupid like that,"" Afifi said. ""I've known that guy my whole life. "" The agents told Afifi they had other agents outside Khaled's house. ""If you want us to call them off and not talk to him we can do that,"" Afifi said they told him. ""That was weird. ... I didn't really believe anything they were saying."" When he later asked Khaled about the post, his friend recalled ""writing something stupid,"" but said he wasn't involved in any wrongdoing. Khaled declined to discuss the issue with Wired.com. The female agent, who handed Afifi a card, identified herself as Jennifer Kanaan and said she was Lebanese. She spoke some Arabic to Afifi and through the course of her comments indicated she knew what restaurants he and his girlfriend frequented. She also congratulated him on his new job. Afifi got laid off from his job a couple of days ago, but on the same day was hired as an international sales manager of laptops and computers for Cal Micro in San Jose. The agents also knew he was planning a short business trip to Dubai in a few weeks. Afifi said he often travels for business and has two teenage brothers in Egypt whom he supports financially. They live with an aunt. His U.S.-born mother, who divorced his father five years ago, lives in Arizona. Afifi's father, Aladdin Afifi, was a U.S. citizen and former president of the Muslim Community Association here, before his family moved to Egypt in 2003. Yasir Afifi returned to the U.S. alone in 2008, while his father and brothers stayed in Egypt, to further his education he said. He knows he's on a federal watchlist and is regularly taken aside at airports for secondary screening. Six months ago, a former roommate of his was visited by FBI agents who said they wanted to speak with Afifi. Afifi contacted one agent and was told the agency received an anonymous tip from someone saying he might be a threat to national security. Afifi told the agent he was willing to answer questions if his lawyer approved. But after Afifi's lawyer contacted the agency, he never heard from the feds again until he found their tracking device. ""I don't think they were surprised that I found it,"" he told Threat Level. ""I'm sure they knew when I found it. ... One of the first questions they asked me was if I was at a mechanics shop last Sunday. I said yes, that's where I found this stupid device under my car."" Afifi's attorney, who works for the civil liberties-focused Council on American Islamic Relations, said this kind of tracking is more egregious than the kind her office usually sees. ""The idea that it escalates to this level is unusual,"" said Zahra Billoo. ""We take about one new case each week relating to FBI or law enforcement visits [to clients]. Generally they come to the individual's house or workplace, and there are issues that arise from that."" However, she said that after learning about Afifi's experience, other lawyers in her organization told her they knew of two people in Ohio who also recently discovered tracking devices on their vehicles. Afifi's encounter with the FBI ended with the agents telling him not to worry. ""We have all the information we needed,"" they told him. ""You don't need to call your lawyer. Don't worry, you're boring. "" They shook his hand and left. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- America's defense budget is headed for a big reduction, as a result of the congressional super committee's failure to reach a debt reduction compromise. The automatic 10-year budget cut of more than half a trillion dollars now facing the military is reminiscent of a strategic decision Britain confronted nearly a century ago. When the empire had to address the profound debts it accrued during World War I, the answer was the Ten Year Rule. Formulated in 1919, this rule dominated Britain's defense planning throughout the 1920s. It worked on a simple, rolling assumption: ""That the British Empire will not be engaged in any great war during the next 10 years."" As long as the planning assumption held, the government could assume strategic risk by reducing the military's size, deferring its modernization programs and delaying improvements to base protection. Winston Churchill, chancellor of the exchequer during much of this time, was its most famous proponent. Observing on several occasions that there was no foreseeable danger of war with Japan, he cautioned Britain against building any ships or bases that might alarm the Japanese government. Indeed, Churchill's voice was decisive in Britain's decision to delay strengthening the Royal Navy's vital base in Singapore during the 1920s. Although the Ten Year Rule saved the British much money in the short term, the calculated risk turned into dashed hopes in the 1930s. In short succession, Japan conquered Manchuria in 1932, Hitler rose to power in 1933 and suddenly a world war loomed on the horizon. Britain finally repealed the rule in 1932 -- the same year Manchuria fell. As Britain's weakened position in Asia became evident, the government realized it was in no position militarily or financially to address the challenges it now confronted. Through its inaction, Britain signaled the beginning of the end of its leadership role in Asia and of its ability to meet its continental commitment to European allies. Thus, in 1939 Britain entered World War II with a woefully inadequate military. The inadequacies of this force were best symbolized by the fall of Singapore in 1942 and the surrender of 80,000 British-led troops to the Japanese invaders. The loss of Singapore was a profound psychological shock as well as a military blow to the British. Churchill, originally a strong proponent of the Ten Year Rule, had to deal with its consequences as wartime prime minister. Any sound grand strategy must account for economic, political and military factors. But the strategy can't substitute hope for fact. The British hoped they could focus on their economy in the 1920s with a rule based on the assumption that their security would not be threatened during the next decade. They thought they could undertake whatever military expansion program necessary if a threat were to manifest. In short, the government hoped world events would unfold benignly until the British economy rebounded. Instead, the economy worsened as part of a global depression. Military dictatorships emerged in response to turbulent times and soon threatened British security. By the mid-1930s, it was evident that by focusing solely on a hopeful strategy, the British had, much to their regret, failed to create a less optimistic Plan B. As America embarks on a tough strategic journey in the aftermath of Iraq, and contends with an ailing economy, it is wise to be mindful of the difference between hope and fact. The president and Congress might focus on strengthening the economy and assume for a time that a smaller military will suffice. Pursuing prudent military reductions in this environment makes sense; however, relying on a budget-driven process to make these reductions does not. The nation's leadership needs a Plan B so that a heroic assumption -- or hope -- about the unlikelihood of future wars does not inadvertently lead to strategic disaster. This is harder than it seems. Plan B would allow more flexibility to meet what could go wrong in the strategic environment rather than just making budget cuts. In tough economic times, hope makes planning easier and defense reductions more palatable. Indeed, the mistake is an easy one to make. After all, Winston Churchill, perhaps the greatest democratic leader of the 20th century, succumbed to the temptation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paula Thornhill.","Paula Thornhill: With super committee failure, automatic cuts could lead to harsh defense cuts .

"(CNN) -- McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton has predicted the 2011 British Grand Prix at Silverstone could be the most exciting in history. The 2008 world champion won his home race during a victorious campaign three years ago and Hamilton described the maximum-points haul as one of the highlights of his motorsport career. ""I'm really looking forward to Silverstone,"" Hamilton told Formula One's official web site. ""My victory at Silverstone in 2008 was one of the sweetest and most satisfying moments of my entire Formula One career -- and it's a memory that I always carry with me. Impressive Vettel powers to another win . ""It's one of the best circuits in the world, and I really think that the arrival of DRS and KERS Hybrid will make this one of the best and most exciting British Grand Prix ever."" KERS -- an innovation that stores energy created under braking for user as an additional boost when accelerating -- was reintroduced to the sport in 2011, while DRS (Drag Reduction System) allows the rear wing of Formula One cars to be adjusted in a way that gives a boost of speed in new for the current season. Hamilton is currently fourth in the drivers' standings after eight races, 89 points behind current leader and reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull. The 26-year-old's future has been the subject of much speculation, with reports suggesting he could leave McLaren for the 2011 constructors' champions Red Bull. But McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh moved to end talk of Hamilton switching allegiances, and said he expects the Stevenage-born racer to remain with the British-based marque. ""Lewis loves this team and he knows the car is capable of winning races,"" Whitmarsh told British newspaper The Independent. ""He's sat with me here in the last 10 days and explained his passion, enthusiasm and desire to remain part of this team. ""I've known him since he was 11. I don't think he would look me in the eye and say that if he didn't mean it."" Sunday's grand prix will also see McLaren's Jenson Button return to his homeland, where his best finish is fourth place in 2004 and 2010. The 2009 drivers' champion is 12 points ahead of his compatriot Hamilton and sits second in the standings, 77 points behind Germany's Vettel. The 31-year-old is looking forward to experiencing the new-look Silverstone, which has a newly-constructed pit lane and paddock complex and first corner. ""With a new start line, a new first corner and an all-new pit and paddock complex, the new facilities should be fantastic,"" the former Brawn GP driver said. ""I think they'll confirm Silverstone as one of the best circuits in the world.""

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- A Nigerian man who sang in a Vatican choir arranged gay liaisons for an Italian government official who served in the unpaid role of papal usher, according to transcripts of wiretaps collected by Italian authorities. The wiretaps were gathered as part of an investigation into how public-works contracts were awarded. The purported conversations were between Angelo Balducci, who oversaw the Italian government's awarding of construction contracts -- including work on the airport at Perugia -- and Thomas Chinedu Ehiem, a 39-year-old Nigerian singer. They were recorded between April 14, 2008, and January 20, 2010. In addition to working for the government, Balducci served as a ""gentleman of his holiness,"" also known as a papal usher or ""Vatican gentleman."" The main responsibility of the ceremonial position is to welcome heads of state to the Vatican and escort them to see the Pope. Balducci is one of three public officials who, along with a businessman, have been jailed on charges related to corruption in the public works department. The public officials are alleged to have awarded contracts to businessmen who offered them favors, money, sex, and/or house remodeling in exchange. The suspects, who deny the charges, are in ""cautionary custody"" though they have not been charged or indicted. The Italian news media have nicknamed the scandal ""grande opere,"" which translates as ""big works."" The transcripts of the wiretaps were made public on Wednesday and widely disseminated in the media. Balducci's lawyer, Franco Coppi, lambasted investigators' handling of his client. ""It is shameful that things unrelated to the investigation are published,"" Coppi told reporters Wednesday outside the Rome prison where Balducci was confined. ""We are thinking about taking legal action. During the interrogations, we did not discuss private matters."" Ehiem told the Italian weekly magazine Panorama in an interview published Friday that he provided Balducci with men from Italy and abroad, including rugby players, actors, models and seminarians. Ehiem also told Panorama that he arranged for Balducci to meet escorts at Ehiem's house when the government official was in Rome and in Paris, France; Naples, Italy; and other cities when he was traveling. ""For Balducci, a 26- or 27-year-old man was too young,"" Ehiem told the magazine. ""He preferred older men, above 40 years old."" According to the wiretap transcripts, in a conversation dated April 22, 2008, Ehiem says, ""I called you ... because there are ... if you are free ... three or four situations that can be good ... very, very good ..."" Balducci: ""...Hmmm!"" Ehiem: ""Two black, Cuban men ... really tall, tall, tall ... so ... if you are free ... we can try to organize right away ... that is, I saw both of them, Angelo ... believe me that ... they could be two excellent options."" In another conversation, dated August 21, 2008, Ehiem says: ""Look, if you want I can have them come one after the other ... it is possible ... if you have some free time ... I can arrange for the two of them."" Balducci: ""Which are the better ones?"" Ehiem: ""The better ones are the ones I just told you about ... one from Bologna and the other one from Rome."" Balducci: ""All right, then let's do it for 3:30."" Ehiem: ""OK."" Ehiem said an escort friend introduced him to the Italian businessman more than a decade ago. ""He asked me to do it with him, but I like women and just the thought grossed me out,"" Ehiem said. ""He asked me if I could procure him other men. He told me that he was married and that it had to be done in great secrecy. I told him that there was the Internet. But he asked me to take care of it because he couldn't do it from his home."" He added, ""Sometimes he would ask for two meetings a day."" Ehiem told Panorama he was trying to support his family in Nigeria, and that Balducci sometimes paid him 50 or 100 euros, but ""never more than 1,000 to 1,500 per year."" Neither Balducci nor his attorney has commented on Eheim's interview with Panorama. A Vatican source who asked not to be identified said Ehiem had been dismissed from his choir duties. Asked about Balducci, the source said, ""It is obvious that, while in prison, he cannot exercise his duties as a papal gentleman."" But, the source noted, Balducci has not been convicted of any charge. ""If he is convicted, then we will look into it,"" the source said. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this story from Rome.","Nigerian who sang in a Vatican choir purportedly arranged gay liaisons for a government official .

"(CNN) -- An American contractor said Thursday that the U.S. mission in Iraq will be undermined if the Iraqi government succeeds in revoking blanket legal immunity for American security contractors. An armored vehicle of a foreign private security company drives in central Baghdad in October 2007. Carter Andress reacted to a Wednesday government report that said the removal of legal immunity for American private security contractors could set off an ""exodus"" from war-ravaged Iraq and ""impose significant limitations"" on American reconstruction efforts. The scenario is outlined in the quarterly report issued to Congress by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. Andress, whose firm builds bases for the Iraqi army and police and supplies those places with water, food, fuel and maintenance services, said that about 40 percent of his staff is involved in security. ""We would undermine the U.S. mission here because they are so reliant on contractors,"" said Andress, co-founder of the American-Iraqi Solutions Group. ""For better or for worse, that's reality."" Even though 90 percent of his employees are Iraqis, he fears that new laws could force him to shut down. But the ""exodus"" comment in the report also prompted skepticism from a scholar who studies the subject. Peter Singer, a Brookings Institution scholar who is an authority on private security firms, said, ""I don't think we should worry about a market collapse, so to speak. There's simply too much money to be made."" The Iraqi government has criticized the blanket immunity because of the actions of security contractors, such as the September shootings in Baghdad of Iraqi citizens that involved Blackwater contractors. Seventeen people died in that incident. ""From a relief and reconstruction perspective, one of the most critical issues under discussion is contractor immunity,"" the inspector general's report says. ""Existing agreements provide U.S. contractors in Iraq with blanket immunity from prosecution under Iraqi law. But [the government of Iraq] is seeking to modify, if not eliminate, that immunity. Such action would acutely affect the status of private security contractors in Iraq."" The issue of immunity has been part of the ongoing talks trying to create a long-term security agreement between the United States and Iraq after the U.N. mandate defining the role of American troops ends at the end of the year. Iraqis simply want contractors to abide by their laws. Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said this month that negotiators have agreed to drop the legal immunity for contractors, but a formal announcement has not been made. The inspector general estimates that about 70 private security companies have operated in the country since 2003, with cumulative contract values totaling approximately $4.5 billion. The inspector general report says the United States has ""appropriated more than $50 billion in taxpayer dollars for Iraq's reconstruction."" Asked about the report, Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said, ""I am confident the Iraqi government and the U.S. government for whom we work will come to some sort of an agreement that will represent both of their interests."" If anything does change with the immunity law, ""we're standing by for direction from our U.S. government clients,"" she said. Stuart Bowen, the special inspector general, elaborated on the reference to security contractors in the report, saying he believes that changes in immunity are ""going to have a very real economic impact,"" particularly with the provincial reconstruction teams operating in the Iraqi provinces. Although there hasn't been a formal announcement about the status of immunity, he believes that the blanket immunity measure for contractors that was developed by the Coalition Provisional Authority will be significantly modified at the very least. He said security contractors are the main target, but he said non-security contractors also would be subject to Iraqi law if immunity is revoked. He raised the issue of insurance costs, saying the removal of immunity could jack up such costs for security and other contractors. Bowen says one result he can foresee is the growth of homegrown Iraqi security firms. ""Clearly, if you can't use American security contractors, then you will have to use other contractors,"" such as those from Jordan, the Gulf region or Iraq, he said. Singer said the issue of immunity has been discussed for some time, and contractors have had ""a lot of lead time to figure out what's going on here. This isn't something new."" ""You've got around 190,000 private military contractors out there, doing all sorts of roles, everything from armed security work to logistics and running base operations and things like that. They work for all sorts of hundreds of different companies. And again they're coming from around the world."" He points out that the marketplace for security in Iraq is a big one, with Americans a minority in an industry that includes Iraqis and other third-country nationalities. ""You may well see some companies decide they want to leave, but they're going to evaluate what's in their own interests and other companies are going to decide what's in their own interest. This is, I would argue, a good thing because it's trying to take Iraq and turn it into what is a more natural setting, where that government is in charge of the operations of what's happening on the ground from a legal standpoint."" Andress said the removal of immunity would have a big impact on his business. ""You've still got remnants of the insurgents out there. You've still got ... the thieves. So, you've still got to have convoy security,"" said Andress, whose firm has won a quarter of a billion dollars in Defense contracts. A security contractor, who asked not to be named because he could lose his job for talking to reporters, said he believes a removal of immunity would have a chilling effect for contractors. He said Iraqi contractors taking over security duties have improved but haven't reached the level of proficiency that Americans have. The contractor, who said he has worked in Iraq and other countries, believes that non-Iraqi contractors could be be treated brutally and unfairly. ""It's like putting a police officer in the middle of Folsom Prison, on murderers row with five guys he put away,"" the contractor said. ""They're not going to get a fair trial."" He said individuals wouldn't want to work as contractors there in such a situation -- or they would demand more money to do it. He believes that some firms would pull out because of liability issues or because they couldn't find proper security.","Report says loss of contractor immunity could spark ""exodus"" from Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Syrian commanders say their troops along the border with Iraq are making strides in nabbing militants intent on staging suicide attacks in Baghdad. Syrian soldiers in a pickup truck patrol the area of their country's border with Iraq. But, the commanders say, they could do a better job if they were able to obtain modern equipment denied to them because of sanctions and if they received cooperation from the U.S. military. The commanders also say U.S. aircraft occasionally violate Syria's airspace, a situation that points to the lack of coordination between the countries. ""We work within our abilities,"" said Gen. Khaklil Al-Khaled, a provincial military commander in northeastern Syria. ""The border constitutes a daily obsession to us, to prevent infiltration and confront the contraband groups and jihadist groups that infiltrate the border.""  Watch what life is like on the Syrian border » . Syrian commanders were interviewed by CNN along the border, where Syria and the United States have a complicated relationship. The Syrian government ""began limited cooperation with the United States in the global war against terrorism"" after the September 11, 2001, attacks, the U.S. State Department has said. The United States has long criticized Syria for being a staging ground for insurgents who infiltrate Iraq in the Euphrates River valley of Anbar province and conduct attacks in the towns along that waterway and in Baghdad. It has also criticized Syria for its ties to Iran, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, and the Palestinian movement Hamas. Syria says it is doing what it can to thwart insurgent activity and the United States in turn has softened its negative rhetoric toward President Bashar Al-Assad's regime. They say they've arrested many foreign fighters and have confiscated many weapons. The number of monthly insurgent strikes in Iraq has dropped dramatically recently as Iraqis who once backed insurgents in Anbar province have turned against them. Still, some insurgent activity continues in Anbar and along the Nineveh province section of the Iraqi-Syrian border. Al-Khaled said Syrian troop outposts are strung along the vast, sandy 385-mile Syria-Iraq border, with 12 soldiers per post. The troops have erected a sand wall and embark on daily foot and vehicle patrols. ""There have been many arrests of jihadi groups that infiltrate the Iraqi side, and they have been turned to the authorities. These jihadi groups belong to different nationalities, such as Egyptians, Saudis, Moroccans, Tunisians, and Libyans that fight in Iraq,"" Al-Khaled said. The Syrians chafe at criticism from Americans for not doing a better job. The Syrians say they are using antiquated equipment because sanctions by the United States prevent them from upgrading. They say they lack night surveillance equipment, automatic weapons and other items they believe would help them. Al-Khaled said Syria doesn't like the U.S. administration casting blame on Syria for lax border security when ""America itself cannot control its border with Mexico."" The Syrian military said it has no communication with U.S. commanders along the border -- something that troubles Syrian commanders. Al-Khaled said communication would help deal with problems such as U.S. planes entering Syrian airspace. ""Every now and then there are airspace violations -- sometimes not less than five to six times per month with their military jets and helicopters,"" Al-Khaled said. He said Syria lodges its complaints with an Iraqi liaison officer. Americans say the errors are tactical or human, he said, but he doubts those assertions because of the U.S. military's acumen and resources. ""This is an issue that concerns both sides,"" he said. ""There should not be any lenience from their part in violating the border of a free, sovereign state."" Mohammed Askari, spokesman for Iraq's Defense Ministry, declined to comment, saying these are Multi-National Forces issues. The U.S. military has not responded to a request for comment.","Syrian military says it has arrested many militants trying to get into Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Clashes between security forces and protesters left 15 people dead across Syria on Saturday, an activist group said Sunday. The deaths included eight in Homs and three in Daraa, said Rami Abdulrahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The report came days after Syrian security forces barged into a hospital and snatched 18 wounded patients, including five from an operating room, the Human Rights Watch reported, citing witness accounts. That event occurred Wednesday at al-Barr hospital in the western city of Homs during a major military operation. Human Rights Watch also reported that security forces had prevented medical personnel from reaching wounded people in several Homs neighborhoods. Days after the hospital raid, demonstrators took to the streets Friday, leaving 11 people dead across the country, said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition group that documents and organizes protests. Human Rights Watch said Syria's actions violate its obligation ""to respect and protect the right to life and the right to health and not to subject anyone to inhuman treatment."" ""Snatching wounded people from the operating room is inhumane and illegal, not to mention life-threatening,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""Cutting people off from essential medical care causes grave suffering and perhaps irreparable harm."" A doctor at al-Barr hospital said security forces beat people as they moved the wounded from the hospital. The actions stirred panic and prompted families to remove patients who they thought might be detained, the doctor told Human Rights Watch. ""They were looking for a specific person called Bilal. The administrator told them that there had been a Bilal who arrived at the hospital, but he had died from his wounds and his family had already taken the body,"" the doctor said. ""The security forces then asked the administration for lists of wounded who had arrived that day, and then I saw them go through the rooms of the hospitals taking anyone with a bullet wound, regardless of when they had arrived. In total, they took 18 wounded from the hospital. Five of them were taken from the operating room, including two who were still unconscious."" Human Rights Watch said it has documented a pattern of security forces preventing medical personnel from getting to wounded protesters. Another doctor told the organization he went to Bab Dreib, a neighborhood where physicians were needed, but it was a challenge to get wounded people to a hospital because regime snipers were firing on cars. ""The situation was very dramatic. Five of the wounded had bullets in their stomachs and required hospitalization, but I could not get them to any hospital,"" the doctor said. Red Crescent volunteers in Homs said security forces prevented them from getting to some of the wounded. CNN cannot independently confirm these reports. The Syrian government has repeatedly refused international journalists permission to report inside the country.","NEW: 15 people were killed on across Syria on Saturday, an activist group says .

"London (CNN) -- A man accused of killing his teenage daughter in England because of her ""Westernized"" lifestyle denied the murder in court Wednesday. Iftikhar Ahmed said it was ""devastating"" to be on trial for murdering his daughter Shafilea, CNN affiliate ITV reported. He was taking the stand for the first time in a case which has gripped Britain since the 17-year-old disappeared in September 2003. The court case took a startling turn Monday when Iftikhar's wife Farzana abruptly changed her long-standing story and said she had seen her husband attack their daughter on the night Shafilea died. Both parents are accused of the murder. One of Shafilea's sisters testified that she saw her parents push Shafilea onto a couch, stuff a bag into her mouth, and hold her down until she suffocated. Iftikhar and Farzana Ahmed have both pleaded not guilty at their trial in Chester, England. Newspapers, television and radio have all been reporting on the prosecution case that Shafilea's parents killed her because they felt her ""Western"" lifestyle brought shame on the family. The teenager's dismembered body was found on a riverbank months after she disappeared. She had been stripped of anything that would identify her, prosecutor Andrew Edis told the jury in May, according to ITV. Shafilea's sister Alesha testified last month that she saw her parents kill the girl. Islam doesn't justify 'honor murders,' experts insist . She said her parents were angry that Shafilea was wearing a short-sleeved, V-neck top, and no sweater, on the night she was killed. ""Just end it here,"" Farzana said to Iftikhar, according to their daughter. They pushed Shafilea down onto a sofa and suffocated her despite her struggles, Alesha testified. Prosecutor Edis called it ""an act of suffocation by both parents acting together."" Alesha Ahmed did not tell police she had seen the killing until 2010, after she was detained by police in connection with a robbery of the family's home, ITV reported. She has pleaded guilty to robbery. Prosecutors said she had not been offered any sort of deal in exchange for testifying against her parents. She has testified that both her parents physically abused Shafilea ""every day"" over the course of five years, and that her mother did it more ""because she was at home more."" On Monday, Farzana unexpectedly said she had seen her husband attack Shafilea. She said that she tried to intervene to protect the girl, but that her husband pushed her away and punched her, ITV reported. Indian police: Man chops off daughter's head, citing her 'indecent behavior' ""Extremely scared,"" she fled the room and stayed in a bedroom with other children until she heard a car leaving 20 minutes later. When her husband returned alone, she asked where their daughter was. ""If you care for your dear life and that of your children, don't ever ask me this question again,"" he told her, ITV reported. Farzana Ahmed testified Monday that only one of their children, Mevish, was present when she saw her husband attacking Shafilea. The jury was told that Shafilea had been taken to Pakistan for a hastily arranged marriage before her death, and drank bleach when her parents suggested she was staying there when the rest of the family returned to England, ITV reported. She was hospitalized for three months after the family came home because of the bleach incident, Alesha testified. Alesha testified in May that her parents were very strict with their daughters, ITV reported. Family convicted in Canada 'honor murders' ""Our family was very restricted. It was very different. The Pakistani culture is more restrictive in terms of what you can wear or do,"" she said. The trial began in May and is expected to last several more weeks, prosecutors say. Reliable figures of the number of honor murders around the world are hard to come by, but the United Nations Population Fund has estimated there could be 5,000 per year. So-called honor murders are a significant enough problem in Britain that the country's Crown Prosecution Service has an expert specializing in cases in which members of a family kill relatives because of behavior that they say shames the family. The CPS began keeping statistics on honor violence in April 2010 and prosecuted 234 cases in the following year, just over half of which were successful. There is a perception that the crime is particularly common among Muslims, but one vocal British campaigner says not all honor violence is perpetrated by Muslims. Disappearance, then discovery, leads to 'honor killing' outrage . Jasvinder Sanghera, who was the victim of a forced marriage, is not Muslim; she is Sikh. ""Significant cases are happening within South Asian communities, be it Pakistani, Indian, Sikh, Muslim, Kurdish, Iranian, Middle Eastern communities,"" she said. The killings take place in many parts of the world, experts say. Indian father accused of killing baby 'for being a girl' ""It's definitely a problem that happens in many different places: the Middle East, Pakistan, Bangladesh and among immigrant communities in North America,"" said Nadya Khalife, a researcher on women's rights in the Arab world for Human Rights Watch. Several Arab countries and territories, including Iraq, Kuwait, Syria, Yemen and the Palestinian territories, have laws providing lesser sentences for honor murders than for other murders, Human Rights Watch says. Egypt and Jordan also have laws that have been interpreted to allow reduced sentences for honor crimes, the group says.

"KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of Taliban fighters have taken over several villages in the same southern Afghanistan province where about 400 Taliban militants recently escaped from prison, local officials and police said. Kandahar is the second biggest city in Afghanistan and a former Taliban stronghold. About 400 to 500 Taliban militants were seen streaming into the Arghandab district of the Kandahar province late Sunday night on motor bikes and pickup trucks, said Haji Aka Jan, a tribal elder in the district. Abdul Wali Karzai, younger brother of Afghan President Hamid Karzai and head of the provincial council, also said a large number of militants entered the district, and Afghan and NATO forces were preparing to come into the area. Reports varied on how many villages were taken. Taliban fighters have taken at least 5 villages and could have taken as many as 13, locals said. The villages area is about 20 km (12 miles) north of Kandahar, a former stronghold for the Taliban, and close to the prison escape. The daring and well-executed jail-break occurred Friday and had coalition and Afghan forces searching for escapees. Mark Laity, spokesman for NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said that they were aware of the report of attacks on villages. He said that Afghan troops ""are sending reinforcements and ISAF forces are redeploying within the city to see if there is any potential threat."" The prison break and the Taliban push have locals fleeing, said Norine MacDonald, president of the Senlis Council, a think tank that is based in the Kandahar province. ""Hundreds of people are moving out to get away from the fighting,"" said MacDonald. ""Things are getting worse by the day, by the minute."" MacDonald said she has heard from locals that Taliban fighters had taken villages by positioning heavily armed fighters on the streets in the area and telling village leaders that the Taliban has taken control of the area. If the militants are not rooted out, they will try to create their own government in the area, MacDonald said. Pushing the Taliban out will be very difficult, MacDonald said. ""It is extremely difficult to chase these guys out of the villages when they are not wearing uniforms that say 'I am the Taliban,'"" MacDonald said. ""They can just put down their guns and blend in. NATO may have to decide to bomb and that could bring civilian casualties."" In Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the border region remains ""a real problem"" for allied troops battling a resurgent Taliban and its al Qaeda allies in Afghanistan, particularly along the rugged border with Pakistan. ""They are more of a problem in the south in Afghanistan than they are in the east,"" Gates said in a speech to the North American Forum. ""We will just have to watch carefully and see how these agreements with the tribes are going."" The incidence of attacks in Afghanistan set record numbers in 2007 and remains on pace to match those figures this year, according to statistics from the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan, obtained by CNN. As of June 6, the coalition had tallied 2,999 attacks. That compares to 7,143 during all of 2007 and up significantly from the 5,174 attacks during 2006. The total for 2005 was 2,542 and 2004 was 2,112. The 733 attacks by roadside bombs and other improvised explosive devices through early June are on track to exceed the 1,313 for all of last year. And the 72 recorded suicide bomb attacks in 2008 is a pace about equivalent to the 157 for 2007. Journalist Farhad Peikar and CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr and CNN's Paul Courson contributed to this story.","Afghan officials: Hundreds of Taliban fighters occupy villages outside Kandahar city .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel has rejected claims that his charge to the 2011 Formula One title was a procession, and says his Red Bull team's ability to learn from their mistakes has been vital in delivering a second successive world championship. The German has been dominant this season, retaining his crown at the Japanese Grand Prix in early October. Despite spinning out of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix with a puncture on Sunday -- his first race retirement in over a year -- Vettel still enjoys a 119-point lead over second-placed McLaren driver Jenson Button. Vettel has won 11 out of the 18 races so far this season and paid tribute to the coolness of his team in helping him get the job done on the track. Vettel equals Mansell's record in taking pole in Abu Dhabi . ""One thing is for sure -- such a year doesn't come your way too often,"" he told the sport's official website ahead of the final race in Brazil on November 27. ""It was a well-woven tale right from the beginning without a moment of buckling. ""The car never let us down -- and we never let ourselves down. Sure, there were some small issues here and there, but we never ran into a bad-case scenario -- nothing like that at all. ""The major improvement over last season is that we have never been irritated by situations. Even if the boat started to rock we never stumbled -- probably something that was not quite there last year."" Vettel's huge lead in the drivers' championship, coupled with Red Bull's second year at the top of the constructors' standings, have led some commentators to declare their twin triumph ""easy."" But the 24-year-old rejects the idea that the UK-based Austrian team's season has been straightforward. Latest F1 standings after Abu Dhabi Grand Prix . ""What became clear over the course of the season was that our car hasn't been as dominant as it was in 2010, but what really made a huge difference was we -- the people -- have grown into one strong force,"" he said. ""We have been much more stable and obviously have learned from our 2010 mistakes. It is funny to get comments after a successful race: you hear descriptions like 'easy,' 'walk in the park' and so on -- and it was definitely nothing of the sort at any race of the season. ""Every victory was hard fought and, contrary to what people might think, it was closer, much closer than it looked from the outside. ""Everything had to come together -- and that was what was so special, that we've managed to make it come together at so many races."" Vettel pointed to his victories in Monaco, Italy and Singapore as the highlights of his season and says he has become a better driver in 2011. But he said he won't be getting complacent ahead of the 2012 season, with a chasing pack keen to prevent Vettel completing a hat-trick of titles. ""There is definitely not one driver I would highlight because we are living in a Formula One era where you don't have one challenger but many -- with different strengths and weaknesses. ""That much I can say. McLaren were very strong this year with both drivers -- Jenson and Lewis (Hamilton). It probably wasn't the easiest year for Lewis, but that doesn't mean that this will also go for 2012. ""Fernando (Alonso) with Ferrari will definitely be there and I also have Mercedes on the list, with two great drivers. And never forget Mark (Webber).

"(CNN) -- A Human Rights Watch official is calling on the government of Bahrain to investigate a Monday morning teargas attack on the Bani Jamra home of prominent activist Nabeel Rajab. The attack took place at 3:30 a.m., according to Human Rights Watch. Rajab, who heads the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, was apparently not injured. However, the attack by unknown assailants caused ""great distress"" for his 78-year-old mother, who suffers from respiratory disease, Human Rights Watch said. ""This attack certainly appears to target Nabeel Rajab for his human rights advocacy,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""Bahraini authorities need to investigate this incident and hold those responsible to account."" There was no immediate response to the Human Right Watch statement by the Bahrain government. The country is ruled by the Al-Khalifa family, which has been in power since the 18th century. Many protesters are calling for the removal of the royal family, whom they blame for the country's high unemployment rate and for running a corrupt government that relies on torture and other harsh measures to clamp down on dissent. Rajab's vocal opposition to the government's violent crackdown on anti-regime protesters has made him a target. On March 20, about 25 people in about a dozen cars pulled up to Rajab's house and took him to the offices of the Interior Ministry's investigative department. There, according to Rajab, he was beaten, blindfolded, and interrogated about an armed suspect they believed he knew. The government confirmed the arrest but provided no other details. Nine days ago, officials publicly accused Rajab of fabricating photos posted on his Facebook site of the body of Ali Isa Ibrahim Saqer, who died in detention on April 9. The photos showed slash marks all over the victim's back and other signs of physical abuse. A Human Rights Watch researcher saw Saqer's body just prior to his burial and said the photos were accurate. Human Rights Watch said it knows of no other entity than Bahrain's security forces that have access to the kind of grenades used in the attack on Rajab's home. Rajab, according to Human Rights Watch, said that markings on the grenades show they were manufactured in Pennsylvania. Rajab, the organization stated, said everyone in the two houses that belong to the family was sleeping at the time. Rajab, according to Human Rights Watch, said the assailants tossed the grenades over a high wall surrounding his and his mother's houses. Rajab is one of hundreds of Bahrainis to be arrested by security forces in recent weeks. The arrests, according to human rights activists, have often been violent and have taken place at night. Others arrested include Mohammed al-Tajer, a prominent defense attorney for various opposition figures. Al-Tajer was seized during a Friday raid on his home by more than two dozen uniformed and plainclothes officers. There was no reason given for his arrest, Human Rights Watch said. Another prominent Bahraini who was recently arrested is human rights activist Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja. Masked gunmen, according to human rights activists, stormed the home of Al-Khawaja's daughter, Zainab, where he was staying. They beat him severely and took him away, she said. After the arrest, Zainab Al-Khawaja launched a hunger strike to protest the assault and detention of her father and her husband. She was taken to a hospital Sunday after her health had deteriorated so much that she could not talk or move, Rajab said. However, the woman was released after refusing an intravenous tube, a human rights activist told CNN.","The home of a Bahraini human rights activist is tear gassed .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq's Anbar province -- once dominated by Sunni insurgents but now a bastion of tribal opposition against the militants -- will soon be run by the Iraqi military. Iraqi soldiers will soon be responsible for running the once militant-riven province of Anbar. The U.S. military said it would transfer security responsibility for Anbar this week to the Iraqi military, a bellwether event that illustrates what Iraq and the United States describe as a profound stride in their efforts to foster stability. Anbar is the 10th of the 18 provinces where Iraqi forces have taken charge of security control since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 and the first largely Sunni Arab province to do so. The other provinces to take charge are in the Shiite south and the Kurdish north. ""We have seen a dramatic increase in security there,"" said Rear Adm. Patrick Driscoll, Multi-National Forces spokesman, speaking to reporters in Baghdad on Sunday. ""I think that the trend now in Anbar is to move from the violent kinetic to the rebuilding process,"" he said. Anbar province -- west of Baghdad -- is a vast territory where Iraq shares borders with Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. Much of the region is desert, and most of the people there live in in the towns and cities -- such as Falluja and Ramadi -- along the Euphrates River. Sunni Arabs, such as those in Anbar, became politically marginalized when the Shiites and Kurds took over the new Iraqi government from the toppled Hussein regime, which had been dominated by and was most amenable to Sunnis. Many Sunni Arabs in Anbar became active in the insurgency, and foreign fighters made their way into Anbar via Syria. As a result, the Euphrates River valley region was a hotbed of insurgent activity in the early years of the Iraq war. U.S. Marines launched several offensives against the militants, including a large-scale push in late 2004 in Falluja. Al Qaeda in Iraq and other militants eventually developed a strong foothold in many towns. Major changes occurred in Anbar over the last two years, however, with the emergence of the awakening, the grass-roots tribal movement that opposes al Qaeda in Iraq. That movement aided efforts by the U.S. military and Iraqi security forces to fight al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), and violence there has dropped dramatically in the last two years. While Sunni tribes in Iraq were natural allies for the insurgency when it started in 2003, many locals eventually became disenchanted with what it regarded as al Qaeda in Iraq's brutality, corruption and hard-line enforcement of sharia law. The tribal movement in Anbar has developed into a political force and has helped spawn another development: U.S.-backed Iraqi militias -- such as Sons of Iraq and Awakening Councils -- formed in the Sunni regions of Iraq over the last couple of years. The Pentagon's June report to Congress on developments in Iraq said that in Anbar, the ""average number of security incidents remained at five incidents per day over a 90-day period, accounting for less than 4 percent of the attacks in all of Iraq."" ""This represents a 10-fold reduction compared to the summer of 2006 and is half of the rate of the last few months of 2007."" AQI ""continues efforts to regain footholds"" in the valley, the report said. But the Sons of Iraq and U.S. and Iraqi troops ""continue to hinder AQI's ability to obtain resources or operate effectively in population centers, forcing AQI to operate and conduct attacks from remote locations in the province."" At present, the other provinces that have transitioned to Iraqi security control are Duhuk, Irbil and Sulaimaniya in the Kurdish region, and Karbala, Najaf, Muthanna, Thiqar, Basra, and Maysan in the Shiite south. The other province to change over to Iraqi security control this year is Qadisiya in the south.","Iraqi military set to run the once militant-riven Anbar province .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Libyan military has been pounded by coalition airstrikes neutralizing its air capabilities but it is still able to fight and maneuver on the ground, U.S. officials said. The Libyan Air Force has been grounded after five days of operations by the coalition forces. More than 160 Tomahawk missiles and several hundred strikes from fighter jets have virtually destroyed Moammar Gadhafi's air defense. The toll on the air system is ""to the point where we can operate with near impunity across Libya,"" said Vice Marshall Greg Bagwell of Britain's Royal Air Force. Despite the targeting of mobile launchers, Libyan forces still have numerous mobile launchers that could pose a risk to coalition planes. But it's the ground forces where Gadhafi has more maneuverability because of the coalition's limitations in fighting Libyan forces only from the air. Gadhafi's forces have retreated from the eastern city of Benghazi, but continue to fight in other cities including Misrata and Ajabiya using ""tanks, artillery, rocket launchers,"" according to Rear Adm. Gerard Hueber, chief of staff for the coalition Odyssey Dawn. The coalition is able to strike at forces moving toward cities, but once they are inside city limits, dropping bombs with enough precision to avoid civilian casualties is difficult. Before the war, Libya had about 500 mortars and 2,400 pieces of artillery. Gadhafi had close to 2,000 tanks and armored vehicles to move around, but much was poorly maintained. Libya's elite forces come from tribes loyal to Gadhafi, dedicated to protecting the regime. The 32nd Brigade, for instance, is commanded by one of Gadhafi's sons. Those forces total, at most, 10,000 men. They are better paid and better equipped, said Gawdat Bahgat, a military analyst at National Defense University, with tanks and conventional weapons. Those elite forces are on the offense. U.S. surveillance planes have seen some attacks by the elite units. ""Those forces are fully engaged in this conflict, that are attacking those civilian populations,"" Hueber said. The Gadhafi forces remain capable of carrying out attacks on the opposition, a U.S. official told CNN. They are relatively well organized and continue to fight effectively in certain parts of the country, said the unnamed official, who is not authorized to speak on the record. The rebels have gained some additional battle space due to coalition efforts, the official said. Rebels are in a better position than they were a few days ago, but the Gadhafi forces have the upper edge at this point in time, the official said. However, where possible, the coalition is hitting the forces on the ground, arguing it is within the mission of protecting civilians. ""Gadhafi's forces are feeling the strain of several weeks of fighting without any resupply,"" the official said. ""In Ajdabiya to Misurata, our targeted priorities are mechanized forces, those mobile integrated -- those mobile surface-to-air missile sites, interdicting their lines of communications which supply their beans and their bullets, their command-and-control, and any opportunities for sustainment of that activity,"" Hueber said Wednesday.","Gadhafi's elite ground forces are well-paid, well-equipped .
Those troops fight within cities, where coalition can't easily get them ."
"(CNN) -- Mark Webber claimed his first victory of 2011 as he relegated his Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel to second place in the season-ending race in Brazil. The Australian took the lead on the 30th lap as Vettel was under team orders to nurse a serious gearbox problem. Until then, Germany's Vettel had looked set to cap his triumphant season with his 12th race win. He had led off his record 15th pole position with Webber taking close order in second place. But after the first round of pit stops, the technical problem on the normally ever reliable Red Bull of the two-time champion came to light. McLaren's Jenson Button overtook Fernando Alonso of Ferrari for the final podium position late in the race to retain second spot in the championship behind Vettel. Abu Dhabi winner Lewis Hamilton went out with a faulty gearbox in the second McLaren as he bid unsuccessfully for back-to-back victories. But few could begrudge Webber his belated win, repeating his 2009 success at the same circuit and his seventh career triumph in F1. ""Seb did a great lap for pole, but today I had the rub of the green. It would have been nice to have a race with Seb all the way through but he had a problem,"" he told the post-race media conference. ""I enjoyed the last few laps. It's always nice when I could pit a bit later than people and cover people off. Nice way to finish,"" he added. ""It was a real shame for me as I had a good start,"" said Vettel.

"San Salvador, El Salvador (CNN) -- A third migrant survived a massacre that left 72 dead in a Mexican border state, and could play a key role in authorities' investigation of the crime, El Salvador's president said. ""He is already in the United States and fortunately avoided being killed,"" President Mauricio Funes told reporters Sunday as the remains of 11 Salvadorans who were killed in last month's massacre were returned to their families in a somber ceremony. A man from Ecuador, Luis Freddy Lala Pomavilla, was originally thought to be the only survivor. Lala was wounded in the attack and told authorities he played dead to fool his captors, . Last week, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa revealed that a man from Honduras had also survived the attack. At the time, Mexican authorities said they had not revealed news of the second survivor in order to protect the person's safety. Mexican investigators have not released information about a third survivor. They are still in the process of identifying some of the remains of the 72 migrants killed. Officials have said the migrants hailed from Ecuador, El Salvador, Brazil, Honduras and Guatemala. Family members in El Salvador wept Sunday as a Mexican air force plane returned the remains of their loved ones in flag-covered caskets. Funes did not release the name of the third survivor Sunday. ""His testimony could be the key to investigating the crime, but above all, identifying those who committed it,"" he said. Officials are investigating whether members of the Zetas drug cartel were responsible for the deaths. Funes said Saturday that authorities should not only imprison whoever executed the migrants, ""but also those who could have planned it."" In El Salvador, authorities have started an investigation to identify who were the Salvadorans' guides as they headed north through Mexico. In Ecuador, authorities detained a man they say was responsible for coordinating Lala's passage to Mexico. The growing reach of drug cartels has increased the risk for migrants crossing through Mexico to get to the United States, Mexico's National Commission for Human Rights said. An investigation by the commission showed that 9,758 migrants were abducted from September 2008 to February 2009, or about 1,600 per month. Journalist Merlin Delcid contributed to this report.","The third survivor, who is from El Salvador, is now in the United States .

"(CNN) -- South Korea beat Kuwait 2-0 Wednesday to seal their place in the final stage of Asia World Cup qualifying as Group B winners. Their victory also meant Lebanon qualified in second place, despite a 4-2 defeat against the United Arab Emirates. Kuwait went into the match in Seoul needing a win to leapfrog Lebanon, while a draw would have been enough for 2002 World Cup semifinalists Korea. Kuwait gave the home side some scares in the first half and goalkeeper Jung Sung-Ryong had to be at his best. But after the break it was the Koreans who dominated as Lee Dong-Gook broke the deadlock in the 65th minute. Lee Keun-Ho rounded off the scoring five minutes later to seal the victory. Lebanon had shocked South Korea 2-1 back in November to boost their hopes of going through, but were unable to repeat their heroics against the UAE. Goalkeeping and defensive errors undermined their performance, but with Kuwait losing they go into the draw in Kuala Lumpur on March 9. Aleksandr Shadrin scored the only goal as Uzbekistan beat Japan 1-0 to top Group C. Shadrin netted in the 54th minute as Japan slumped to their second defeat in the section to leave them six points adrift of Uzbekistan in the final standings. ""We should have scored in the first half when we had several chances. Uzbekistan took the offensive in the second half and we couldn't play our game,"" Japan coach Alberto Zaccheroni told AFP. Another disappointed coach was Dutchman Frank Rijkaard after his Saudi Arabia side failed to progress. The Saudis led Australia 2-1 at the break but leaked three goals in five second half minutes to lost 4-2. Alex Brosque with a double, Harry Kewell and Brett Emerton scored for the Socceroos who top Group D. But Oman's Hussain Al Hadri and Abdul Aziz Mubarak scored to give them a 2-0 home win over Thailand and claim the second qualification spot in the group. It will be the second straight World Cup the Saudis have failed to qualify after making four in a row from 1994 to 2006 and leaves former Barcelona coach Rijkaard with an uncertain future. In Group E, Bahrain routed Indonesia 10-0, but their efforts were in vain as Mohammed Kasola's scored a late equalizer for Qatar in a 2-2 draw in Iran to go through at the Bahrainis expense.","South Korea seal place in next round of Asia World Cup qualifying .

"Washington (CNN) -- The FBI and Justice Department are undertaking a broad review of thousands of criminal cases to see if any defendants were wrongly convicted based on faulty forensic analysis. An FBI official said Thursday the issue is whether in some cases FBI experts went too far in trial testimony and drew more conclusions than existing scientific techniques could support. ""The department and the FBI are in the process of identifying historical cases for review where a microscopic hair examination conducted by the FBI was among the evidence in a case that resulted in a conviction,"" said Justice Department spokeswoman Nanda Chitre on Wednesday. ""We remain committed to working closely with our law enforcement partners to go through thousands of cases, all of which are more than a decade old, and to assemble evidence for purposes of conducting a thorough and meaningful review of convictions."" Convictions and corrections: A look at the numbers behind wrongful imprisonment . The Washington Post first reported the review. This follows a report by the newspaper in April that Justice officials had known for years that questionable forensic work might have occurred in some trials in which defendants were convicted, but that no new look at the cases had taken place, and that defendants and their lawyers had not been informed of possible problems in the evidence. The review will include cases in which the FBI lab was involved. In addition to analyzing evidence in federal cases, the lab provides assistance to state and local law enforcement agencies. FBI forensic examiners have testified in trials throughout the country. The FBI has been able to provide more thorough analysis of small or degraded hair sample evidence since it began using mitochondrial DNA testing in 1996. On Tuesday, federal prosecutors in Washington said a man convicted of a 1981 rape and home invasion is innocent and his conviction should be vacated. Kirk Odom, 49, spent 22 years in prison and was released in 2003. His case was highlighted by the Washington Post in April as one involving faulty forensic analysis. The U.S. attorney's office for the District of Columbia said recent DNA testing in the case proved Odom was not the culprit. Instead, it said, the sample matched another man in the FBI's Combined DNA Index System who had previously been convicted of a sex crime. That person will not be charged in the 1981 rape because the statute of limitations has expired. The Justice Department did not estimate how long it will take to go through cases or how many total cases may be reviewed. Officials said they will work on the review with two independent groups, the Innocence Project and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.

"(CNN) -- Egypt's tumultuous political process took another dramatic turn Thursday when its Supreme Constitutional Court effectively dissolved parliament, ruling that the election of one-third of its members last year was unconstitutional. The court also ruled that former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq can remain a presidential candidate in this weekend's runoff election, despite his close association with the former regime. These back-to-back rulings have immediately strengthened the hand of the ""old guard"" at the expense of the Islamists, who held more than 70% of the seats in parliament before it was dissolved. While some Muslim Brotherhood leaders are referring to the court's decisions as a ""full-fledged coup,"" it is more accurate to see recent events as an energetic ""counter-revolution."" Egypt's presidential runoff to go ahead despite concerns . The remnants of the establishment, including the economically privileged military and the Mubarak-appointed judiciary, are flexing the powers they never gave up to make sure they remain in control. The now dissolved parliament was supposed to establish a 100-member Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution; instead, the military has announced that it will determine the composition of the committee. The constitution will determine such critical issues as how much power the president will wield, the role of Islam in society, and what oversight a civilian government will have over the military. In a sign of the military's intentions, it proposed in November that its budget be outside civilian scrutiny, sparking outrage and denunciations from opposition leaders who vowed to reign in military power. Now, the transition from military to civilian rule is back to square one. On Wednesday, the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces also issued a decree giving the military police and intelligence service the right to detain civilians and send them to military tribunals. Essentially, the decree replicates the dreaded State of Emergency law that was in effect for most of the past 30 years under Mubarak until it was overturned on May 31. The security forces are clearly girding for another round of massive street protests by Egypt's revolutionaries when they rally to resist the counter-revolution. Some Egyptians pin the blame for the current setback on the Muslim Brotherhood's political overreach. In the parliamentary elections last December, it ran candidates affiliated with its Freedom and Justice Party for seats reserved for independents, helping it win a larger share of seats. This was one of the explanations for the Supreme Constitutional Court's ruling invalidating those seats and dissolving parliament. Also, after insisting it would not run a presidential candidate, the Muslim Brotherhood did join the presidential race. Its candidate, Mohammed Morsi, led the field in the general election last month and will compete against Ahmed Shafiq in the runoff election, which starts tomorrow. However, while the Muslim Brotherhood's growing political influence certainly disquieted the establishment, the reality is that the powerful military, which has run Egypt for decades, was never going to simply hand over power to a civilian government and fade into the background. This showdown was inevitable. Analysts: 'Soft coup' court ruling could reignite Egyptian revolution . For now, the Muslim Brotherhood has not called for protests, and Egypt's cities on Friday were relatively calm. The Brotherhood and various leaders of the youth movement have vowed to fight the counter-revolution, and they have the power to bring millions of people back into the streets to do so. Undoubtedly, there are behind-the-scenes negotiations occurring as Brotherhood leaders meet with the SCAF to figure out what influence they can now expect. Egypt's stability now rests on whether they can come to some accommodation that will lead to a gradual transition acceptable to the major players. The military must recognize that its attempts to reverse the democratic transition will eventually fail. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Isobel Coleman.","Isobel Coleman: Old guard in Egypt has reasserted control with ruling dissolving parliament .

"London (CNN) -- While the fight for equality between women and men has long been an uphill struggle, the current economic situation -- the ""age of austerity"" -- poses a new kind of threat. In recent years, the steady, albeit slow, march towards equality has not only come to a standstill but threatens to change direction. Here in the UK, record cuts to public spending risk actually reversing progress. The Fawcett Society's analysis has found that women face a ""triple jeopardy"" of job losses, benefit cuts and the expectation that they will fill a looming ""care gap."" Women's unemployment is now at a 25-year high, and rising. In large part, this is down to dramatic cuts to the public sector workforce -- women make up two-thirds of this workforce overall. Women are also bearing the brunt of cuts to benefits. The ""emergency budget"" of 2010 contained some $13 billion (Â£8 billion) worth of cuts. More than 72% of this cash will come from women's pockets, because many of the cuts are to benefits that more women than men rely on. Finally, women lose out more than men as public services are rolled back -- both because they tend to rely on these services more, but also because they end up ""plugging the gap"" as support services such as low-cost childcare dry up. Read more: 10 most powerful women in tech . On 3 May, the UK heads to the polls to elect around a third of local council seats including the powerful position of Mayor of London, who plays a key role in running the city. The impact of these cuts on women is high on the political agenda. London's mayoral election has grabbed most of the limelight in the UK media: A steady stream of commentators have speculated on what different results will mean for different political parties, while the campaign itself has been dominated by the outsized personalities of the core contenders. But in the midst of the bluster, mudslinging and occasional genuine political debate, scant attention has been paid to the sizeable and substantial influence the Mayor's office wields. Whoever wins this election will be the most powerful directly elected politician in the United Kingdom (and, in fact, most of Europe), with overarching responsibility for a budget of some $23.6 billion (Â£14.6 billion). How this money is spent can make a real difference to the lives of London's four million women. Fawcett's research has found that, far from leading the way, the UK's capital city lags behind much of the country when it comes to gender equality. Women in London are more likely to live in poverty, experience a wider pay gap, and are less likely to work once they have children than women living elsewhere. In fact, London has the lowest level of maternal employment in the country: Just over half of the city's mothers with dependent children work, compared to almost two-thirds across the UK. More from Leading Women: Norway's female execs quota . Women are also thin on the ground when it comes to positions of power in public and political life. Only 29 of London's 73 Members of Parliament are female; just eight of the 25 Members of the London Assembly -- which holds the Mayor to account -- are women. Our research also suggests women in London are more likely to experience sexual assault than those living elsewhere in the UK. Far from getting better, the gap between women and men in London is set to widen. The toxic combination of rising women's unemployment, cuts to welfare and the ever-increasing cost of living in the capital means that life for London's women is going to get tougher. Some groups will be particularly hard hit. More lone parents call London home than anywhere else in the UK, and because of changes to the welfare system, they can expect to lose a month's worth of income on average by 2015. This is why Fawcett has called on mayoral candidates to commit to taking action on gender equality. We asked all candidates to pledge that, if elected, they will assess the impact of their policies -- including the GLA budget -- on women and men. Thus far, the Labour, Green and Lib Dem candidates have all committed to taking this vital first step, a surefire way of improving the way policy decisions are made -- and the lot of women in London. You can read more about the different candidates' policies and how they will affect women here. The political color of City Hall might mean a lot to the different political parties, but it makes a daily, real difference to the lives of millions of Londoners.","Expert: Whoever wins control of London's $23 bn budget could make a real difference to the city's four million women .

"(CNN) -- The European Union is ""shooting itself in the foot"" by keeping Turkey at bay, the country's Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek says. The nation, with an economy sprinting ahead of Europe's continental countries, would be an asset for the region, he said. But Turkey's path to EU membership remains fraught, in part due to problems pitching the idea to the country and Europe. The debt crisis which has ravaged the European continent has been unhelpful for Turkey, but the key issue is feedback from European circles ""that we're not loved and we're not wanted,"" Simsek told CNN. ""It diminishes the support for change in this country because change requires leadership, but also requires a good story."" The EU, Simsek added, ""is shooting itself in the foot by essentially trying to keep Turkey at bay. I think that's wrong but at the same time, my party just got 50% of the vote and our platform strongly supports EU membership -- so people still support change."" European recovery? Wait till 2013 (at least) There is a credible case for EU accession, but that has been dented by the question marks raised over Turkey's right to belong, Simsek said. He argues Turkey and Europe need each other. ""I think for regional stability, for energy supply security, for better standards of democracy... we need each other."" The country has its supporters. British Prime Minister David Cameron backs the country's accession, and points to Turkey's growing economy as a reason. But the EU wants Turkey to make further reforms, to the judicial system for example, before it can join. Turkey -- which straddles Europe and Asia -- is in a key position to improve relations in the region. But the Arab Spring, which drew in some of Turkey's biggest trading partners, has been destabilizing for the area. ""Our neighborhood is quite noisy ...and right now is not stable,"" Simsek said. Is the Arab Spring failing its people? But welcoming Turkey into the EU would, in the midst of such volatility, send a powerful message, he said. ""You can be with the west. You can be secular. You can be Muslim. You can be prosperous. And you can be stable.""","Turkey's finance minister says the country would be an asset to the EU .

"(CNN) -- Four human rights organizations are urging authorities in the United Arab Emirates to drop charges against five pro-democracy activists. Court proceedings against the five men wrapped up Monday and are scheduled to resume July 25. They face charges of public insult against the president of the UAE and other top officials, the groups said in a statement. All five defendants have pleaded not guilty. The four groups jointly calling for charges to be dropped are Amnesty International, the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), Front Line Defenders and Human Rights Watch. The groups accuse UAE authorities of misusing the defamation charges ""as a pretext"" to punish the activists for peacefully expressing their opinions, they said in a statement. ""We consider all five men prisoners of conscience and call on the UAE authorities to release them unconditionally,"" said Philip Luther, Middle East and North Africa deputy director at Amnesty International. Other charges against the men, who police detained in April, include undermining the public order and opposing the government system. They have been ""held in preventative custody,"" according to UAE's state news agency WAM. The best-known of the five activists on trial is Ahmed Mansour Ali Abdullah Al Abd Al Shehi, more commonly known as Ahmed Mansour. He is a ""leading human rights activist who had publicly called for political freedoms and an elected parliament,"" Human Rights Watch said. Mansour also is a member of Human Rights Watch's Middle East advisory committee. Mansour ""faces additional charges for inciting others to break the law, calling for an election boycott, and for demonstrations,"" the four groups said. On trial with him are economist Nasser Ahmed Khalfan bin Gaith, Fahad Salim Mohammed Salim Dalk, Hassan Ali Al Khamis -- all of the United Arab Emirates -- and Ahmed Abdul Khaleq, who ""does not carry identification papers,"" state news reported. All were arrested on the heels of a recent decision by the UAE's government to dissolve the elected board of directors of the Jurist Association, a prominent civil rights organization in that country, and replace it with state appointees, according to Human Rights Watch. The Jurist Association was one of four nongovernmental organizations that sent a petition in March 2011 to UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan and other authorities asking for direct elections. Ahmed Mansour signed the petition, which also demanded authorities turn over legislative powers to a representative body known as the Federal National Council, which exercises an advisory function. FNC elections are scheduled for September, according to state media. Authorities justified the sacking of the association's elected board, saying it had violated a law banning nongovernmental organizations from interfering ""in politics or in matters that impair state security and (the) ruling regime."" Human Rights Watch has accused UAE authorities of acting against its own free speech guarantees as well as those propagated by regional and international provisions. The UAE are ""reacting to domestic criticisms by banning websites, detaining peaceful activists and intensifying its chokehold on civil society,"" Human Rights Watch claims. The country has not faced street protests, but authorities are sensitive to the unrest sweeping the Arab world. Long-standing regimes in Tunisia and Egypt were toppled earlier this year, and Damascus has launched a violent crackdown against protesters in Syria. Libya is currently in the midst of a full-blown war involving supporters and opponents of strongman Moammar Gadhafi. Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia recently sent troops to nearby Bahrain to help quell an uprising there. While concerned with rising ethnic and sectarian strife in the region, authorities in the UAE also have to contend with potentially explosive immigration concerns. More than 8 million people live in the UAE, but Emiratis account for only 11.5% of that total. Migrant workers comprise the bulk of the population in the country.

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Talks among regional African leaders failed Monday to resolve a long-standing power-sharing dispute between embattled Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. South African former president Thabo Mbeki is shown at talks Monday in Harare. After the meeting a visibly angry Mugabe said talks faltered after Tsvangirai, head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), presented proposals which differed from recommendations by the 15-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC). ""The talks did not go very well. ... MDC have a proposal which is in conflict with the SADC and we opposed it and then the talks broke down,"" Mugabe said. ""We will continue with discussions here at home. We shall continue to exchange ideas and see where the differences are with the SADC proposal."" The meeting had drawn the leaders of Mozambique and South Africa, as well as former South African President Thabo Mbeki. In light of the continued stalemate, SADC executive secretary Tomaz Salamao told journalists that South African leader Kgalema Motlanthe, who is leading the SADC, had called for a summit on January 26. The meeting will be held in Botswana or South Africa. Tsvangirai blamed Mugabe for the failure of the talks. ""For us as the MDC this is probably the darkest day of our lives,"" Tsvangirai told reporters as he left the hotel where the 12-hour-long meeting took place. ""I am sure the whole nation is waiting anxiously for the resolution of this crisis. We are committed to this deal but subject to (ruling party) ZANU-PF conceding on these issues."" Mugabe told the state media that Monday's meeting would be the final one, and that he would form a government without the opposition if no agreement was reached. The MDC has not been able to settle with Mugabe since signing a power sharing deal in September. Tsvangirai accuses Mugabe of keeping the most powerful portfolios in the government for his party. The ministries under contention include home affairs, finance, foreign affairs, local government, information and defense. Both Tsvangirai and Mugabe, along with Arthur Mutambara of a small faction of the MDC, are expected to attend next week's summit, Salamao said. The power-sharing deal is expected to keep Zimbabwe's melting economy from a total collapse. Zimbabwe is experiencing its worst economic and humanitarian crisis, with the highest inflation in the world officially at 231 million percent as of July 2008. Analysts say the inflation is thriving because of an acute shortage of all essentials ranging from fuel, electricity, cash and food. The United Nations estimates that about 5 million people in Zimbabwe need urgent food aid. A cholera epidemic has claimed more than 2,200 lives since its outbreak in August. The ravaging cholera has been made worse by a four-months-long industrial action by doctors and nurses demanding higher pay.","NEW: Talks collapse between President Robert Mugabe, opposition  ""Darkest day of our lives,"" says MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai .

"(CNN) -- McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton believes he is back in the fight for the 2011 Formula One world championship after claiming a much-needed victory at Sunday's German Grand Prix. The 26-year-old headed home Ferrari's Fernando Alonso and Mark Webber of Red Bull to secure his second maximum-points haul this season and the 16th of his career. The Briton trails world champion and current standings leader Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull by 82 points, and is fourth in the drivers' championship, but Hamilton is confident he is back in contention for the title he claimed in 2008. ""The fight for the world championship will be very, very, very hard now,"" Hamilton, who started the race second on the grid behind the Australian Webber, told McLaren's official website. Hamilton reigns in Germany . ""We're back in the fight though, and I really hope we can carry this forward and keep the momentum going."" Hamilton spent large parts of the Nurburgring race battling at close quarters with both Webber and the Spaniard Alonso, and he felt the intense competition helped him to perform at his best. ""Driving lap after lap within tenths of each other was about trying to do everything as perfectly as possible -- yet, being aggressive yet controlled, I felt the moves I made were some of the most precise I've ever pulled off. Passing judgment: Hamilton must stay aggressive . ""Being able to drive with your head as well as your heart, and getting it just right, is massively satisfying."" Vettel, 24, endured his lowest finish of the season so far and only secured fourth after he overtook Alonso's teammate Felipe Massa in the pit lane heading into the final lap. It was the first time the German had finished outside of the top two this season, but Vettel still holds a 77-point lead over second-placed Webber. ""We've seen how fast things can change and it is still a long way to go to the final checkered flag,"" Vettel told the sport's official website. Latest F1 standings after German Grand Prix . ""What this weekend has taught me is how fast your race can get spoiled. I definitely hope that the next race will be business as usual. ""Of course I would have wanted to please my home crowd.

"(CNN) -- The runner-up in Mexico's presidential election announced Thursday that he was filing a legal challenge to invalidate the vote. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the Democratic Revolution Party has said that presumptive President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto and his party bought millions of votes in the election, an accusation that party officials have denied. Lopez Obrador has said a partial recount was not enough to erase his doubts about the vote. ""To proceed in another way would be to give up our fundamental rights,"" Lopez Obrador told reporters at a news conference. A tally of returns released by Mexico's Federal Election Institute last week confirmed that Pena Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, received 38.21% of the votes. Lopez Obrador garnered 31.59% of the votes, election officials said. The tally has been completed, but the results remain unofficial until the country's electoral tribunal ratifies them. The tribunal will have until September 6 to complete its investigation and ratify -- or reverse -- the election results. The new president will be sworn in on December 1. Lopez Obrador has criticized the election and refused to concede repeatedly over the past week, echoing comments he made in 2006 when election authorities said the leftist candidate narrowly lost the presidential vote to Felipe Calderon. After that election, the former Mexico City mayor claimed election fraud and never conceded. Back then, Lopez Obrador called himself ""the legitimate president of Mexico,"" and his supporters protested nationwide. In Mexico City, they staged sit-ins and blockades. Officials have called this year's election the most transparent in Mexico's history. It was the first election in which scanned copies of district-by-district election returns were posted on the Internet. But accusations have arisen of electoral manipulation by the PRI. Opponents of the PRI said they have video and photo evidence of the party buying votes through thousands of cards that could be redeemed for products at a chain of supermarkets. The PRI has called the claims a farce and accused political opponents of staging the videos and photographs purported to show vote-buying. CNN's Samira Said and Nick Parker contributed to this report.","Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is refusing to concede in the presidential election .

""Germany and France are the two big economies of Europe. To risk us diverging is to risk us destroying Europe. The crisis requires of us an extra commitment for unity and Europe will not redo the mistakes of the past,"" Sarkozy said after their meeting. The two leaders agreed on a new fiscal pact that they say will help prevent another debt crisis. The pact, which will be presented in detail at a meeting of European leaders later this week, will involve amending or rewriting the treaties that govern the European Union, the leaders said. The leaders of Italy and the Netherlands met earlier Monday, and Ireland's prime minister is due to announce new budget-cutting measures later the same day. Merkel Friday told lawmakers that a fiscal union was in the works, an effort to correct a basic flaw within the EU -- that it has a common currency and shared monetary policy, but no mechanism to ensure that all members are financially sound. ""We are beginning to create the fiscal union,"" Merkel said. But she stressed that the European debt crisis will not be resolved overnight, saying the process ""will take years."" On Thursday and Friday, government leaders from all 27 EU nations will meet in Brussels for what is expected to be the final meeting of the European Council in a year that has seen more than its fair share of such summits. Merkel and Sarkozy both said last week that a fiscal pact should be written into the EU treaty so that budget rules can be properly enforced through broader oversight and automatic penalties for nations that fail to comply. In a sign of what's at stake for the United States, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner will spend most of this week in Europe to meet with top officials, including Sarkozy and the newly appointed Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti. President Barack Obama has called the crisis a serious threat to the U.S. economy, noting that Europe is one of America's biggest trading partners. While Merkel and Sarkozy agree on the need to form a fiscal union, they appear to be at odds over what that would mean. Last Friday, Merkel again ruled out the creation of eurobonds, which could drive up borrowing costs for creditworthy nations such as Germany. The European Commission has proposed issuing so-called stability bonds as part of a plan to pool government debt across Europe. Merkel also stressed that the ECB should remain independent, underscoring the deep opposition in Germany to the central bank risking inflation by printing money to prop up troubled governments. Sarkozy also said the ECB should remain independent, but he sounded much less draconian than his German counterpart. ""Naturally, the European Central Bank has a role to play,"" said Sarkozy. He did not want to debate what that role would be, but Sarkozy did say the ECB would act to prevent a deeper economic downturn in Europe. Late Sunday, Italy, which has sparked worry over its weighty debt and rising borrowing costs, unveiled a budget proposal that included â‚¬30 billion ($40 billion) in new taxes and spending cuts over two years, including reductions to future pensions. About â‚¬20 billion ($27 billion) would come from cuts, including major changes to how Italian workers' pensions are calculated and a one-year increase in retirement ages, effective in January, Monti announced Sunday night. In announcing the cuts, Monti -- who also serves as finance minister -- said he would take no salary for either position. The proposal still needs parliamentary approval.

"(CNN) -- The leader of the political coalition expected to win the first election in Libya in 42 years said Thursday that it is vital for Islamists, liberals and secularists to ""sit around one table"" and form a new government. Mahmoud Jibril, head of the National Forces Alliance, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that consensus will help legitimize the government in a nation where the people seek a restoration of order. ""I think the biggest challenge right now is to convince our potential partners, especially the Islamist forces, that now it's time that we sit around one table and talk about one destiny that is in the interest of the Libyan people,"" he said from Tripoli. ""It has nothing to do with who prevails in those elections or those who do not prevail."" Libya is unique among nations that have held elections after Arab Spring uprisings. Voters in the North African nation chose a more liberal coalition to lead, while voters in Egypt and Tunisia both opted for Islamist parties. Jibril said the absence of a civic structure in Libya, which was dismantled by leader Moammar Gadhafi during his decades in power, means people of all political ideologies can be part of a new government and its 200-seat parliament. ""It's an opportunity that all parties, all political forces can have a new start where all of them can participate and take part in the reestablishment of the state,"" he said. Jibril, former prime minister of the National Transitional Council and one of the most influential politicians in Libya, would not say if he would seek a higher office in the new government. ""What matters to me is the effectiveness of my role,"" he said. ""If I can contribute to the national interests of my country, I will not hesitate. But if there is a role where I cannot do anything within that role, then I will not take part."" He suggested that being an aide to the president or prime minister might suit him. A consultant can have as much influence on those offices, he said. Some critics have said the U.S.-educated Jibril is too secular. ""I am a true Muslim, but I have nothing to do with ideology,"" he said. According to the Project on Middle East Democracy, the National Forces Alliance is a coalition of 58 political parties that campaigned as a ""more liberal, progressive option."" The party's platform focused heavily on economic issues, according to the Project on Middle East Democracy. Jibril said the message resonated with voters, who just want some stability and a chance to start a new life. The National Forces Alliance on Thursday led in 12 of 15 districts, according to results posted on the Libyan elections commission website. About 3,500 candidates ran for the new parliament, and turnout was about 60% of the country's 2.8 million registered voters, election commission Chairman Nuri Khalifa Al-Abbar said this week. It will take weeks or even months for the winners to form an effective coalition government, said Fadel Lamen, president of the American-Libyan Council. The parliamentary vote is a litmus test for Libya in the post-Gadhafi era. Balloting took place 17 months after political demonstrations against Gadhafi broke out in two Libyan cities. Those demonstrations spread, leading to a civil war, NATO airstrikes and Gadhafi's death by a bullet to the head in October. While Gadhafi's death ended much of the violence, unrest continues in parts of the country, particularly the south and the west, and the government has not been able to contain the militias that helped overthrow Gadhafi. Once seated, the national assembly will appoint a transitional government and craft a constitution.","Libya's political parties need to form a consensus, a leading politician says .

"CHINHOYI, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe was celebrating his 85th birthday with a lavish all-day party Saturday despite the fact that the country is gripped by an economic and health crisis. President Robert Mugabe and his wife, Grace, attend a cake-cutting ceremony for his birthday Saturday. Mugabe's ZANU-PF party said it raised at least $250,000 to hold the party in Mugabe's hometown of Chinhoyi, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) outside of the capital, Harare. Critics of the president say the country is desperate for that amount of money to be spent instead on its citizens, who are suffering from a cholera outbreak, food shortages, and spiraling hyperinflation. On Friday, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai visited a hospital's closed intensive care unit that he said needed $30,000 to resume operating. During the celebrations, Mugabe announced that his controversial land reform would not be reversed. The program is designed to have white-owned farms given to blacks, and there have been violent seizures of such farms since the program began in 2000.  Watch Mugabe's birthday bash » . He emphasized that the country's ""indigenization program"" -- which forces all major foreign companies operating in Zimbabwe to have at least 51 percent black ownership -- will be carried out. It began last year and hasn't been implemented yet. Mugabe's birthday falls on February 21 but his party loyalists postponed the celebrations as they were raising money for the event. ""I think it is going to be a great day for the legend and icon whose birthday we are celebrating today here,"" said Mugabe's nephew Patrick Zhuwawo, one of the fund-raisers for the birthday. ""The country might be having problems, but we need to have a day to honor the sacrifices the president has made for this country."" What do you think about the celebrations? Zhuwawo said about 100 beasts would be slaughtered for the birthday bash. iReport.com: What do you think about Mugabe's lavish party? Mugabe also invited schoolchildren from around the country to attend the party, being held at Chinhoyi University. The farming town of Chinhoyi is usually quiet, but Saturday's event has changed everything. Cars with Mugabe's supporters could be seen hooting and some ZANU-PF supporters sang Mugabe's praises. A banner in Chinhoyi read, ""Age ain't nothing but a number."" Mugabe invited Tsvangirai, his new partner in a power-sharing government, but a Tsvangirai spokesman said the opposition party leader turned it down. He said it is political party function, with most of the attendees being ZANU-PF elite. As the prime minister, Tsvangirai is not obligated to attend, the spokesman said. The spokesman would not acknowledge whether Tsvangirai had initially agreed to attend, but it was widely reported in Zimbabwean media that he had agreed to do so. ""Mr. Tsvangirai has other commitments, as far as I know,"" said Nelson Chamisa, a spokesman for Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change. Tsvangirai last year said Mugabe's birthday party was ""a gathering of the satisfied few."" But at that point, he and the president were preparing to face off in a hotly contested presidential election. As Saturday's celebrations began in a carnival atmosphere, just less than a kilometer (0.62 miles) away stood a deserted Chinhoyi government hospital -- a reflection of the country's dire health situation. A few nurses are attending to patients. ""There are no medicines. These patients have no option but to come here, but there is nothing we can do,"" said one nurse at the hospital. On Friday Tsvangirai visited Harare Hospital, one of the country's biggest, and said its intensive care unit will need $30,000 in order to start operating again after a funding shortage. Once a darling of Zimbabwe, Mugabe is blamed for driving the country into a meltdown. A cholera epidemic that broke out in August has since hit every corner of the country, killing 3,731 people and infecting nearly 80,000, according to the World Health Organization, which quoted Zimbabwe's Ministry of Health. The preventable disease has spread through Zimbabwe's 10 provinces through lack of access to clean water, faulty sewage systems, and uncollected refuse, according to Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), which released a report this month on the outbreak. The problems, MSF said, are ""clear symptoms of the breakdown in infrastructure resulting from Zimbabwe's political and economic meltdown."" On Sunday, Tsvangirai appealed to the international community to help Zimbabwe's crippled economy, saying it would take $5 billion to stabilize the country. The cholera outbreak has worsened Zimbabwe's economic crisis. Failed government policies and an acute food shortage because of years of poor agricultural production and widespread corruption have ravaged the currency of Zimbabwe, which has the world's highest inflation rate.

"(CNN) -- Accusations of lies and counter-lies dominated the intensifying November election campaign Thursday, with surrogates and spokespeople for President Barack Obama and certain Republican nominee Mitt Romney trying to cast the other as dishonest and secretive. While neither candidate engaged directly in the political back-and-forth, their teams and supporters launched new attack ads and criticized the opposing contender with increasingly sharp rhetoric. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Romney couldn't be confirmed as a dogcatcher because he refuses to make public more of his past income tax returns, while Romney adviser Ed Gillespie labeled as a lie some Obama ads that accused the former Massachusetts governor of outsourcing jobs when he headed Bain Capital. ""Another day, another Obama campaign falsehood,"" said the headline of a statement by the Romney campaign. Romney was scheduled to speak later Thursday at a fundraiser organized by former Vice President Dick Cheney, while Obama declined an invitation to address the NAACP national convention in Houston, sending Vice President Joe Biden instead. Obama's campaign blamed a scheduling conflict for his unavailability to speak to the nation's largest African-American advocacy group. The president's schedule for Thursday initially appeared wide open, but a senior administration official confirmed Thursday morning that Obama and the first lady were being interviewed by CBS later in the day. At the convention, a short videotape from the president urged delegates to ""keep standing with me."" On the campaign trail, the competing charges of lying involved claims by each camp that the other candidate has been more responsible for sending U.S. jobs overseas, as well as a longstanding and previously discredited accusation that Romney remained at the private equity firm for three years longer than he has said. Romney says he ceded control at Bain Capital in February 1999 in preparation to run the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. However, The Boston Globe reported Thursday that documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission stated that Romney owned 100% of the company until as late as 2002 . CNN confirmed that an SEC filing from 2001 also listed Romney as the ""sole shareholder, sole director, Chief Executive Officer and President of Bain Capital."" In addition, CNN obtained from a Democratic official a Bain Capital filing with the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office in 2001 that listed Romney as Bain president as well as a director. The document was Bain Capital's annual foreign corporation report for calendar year 2000, signed by Bain Treasurer Joshua Berenstein. Romney's campaign spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, said the Boston Globe article ""is not accurate"" and insisted the candidate left his management role at the company in 1999 ""as Bain Capital has said, as Gov. Romney has said, and as has been confirmed by independent fact checkers multiple times."" Steve Pagliuca, Bain managing partner, told CNN on Thursday that Romney had ""absolutely no involvement with the management or investment activities"" of the firm after his February 1999 exit, but continued to be the sole stockholder. ""Due to the sudden nature of Mr. Romney's departure, he remained the sole stockholder for a time while formal ownership was being documented and transferred to the group of partners who took over management of the firm in 1999,"" Pagliuca said. ""Accordingly, Mr. Romney was reported in various capacities on SEC filings during this period."" The timing of his end date at the firm remains an important focal point in the presidential race, as Romney argues he left the company before it was involved with the shuttering of certain businesses that led to job losses. Obama's re-election campaign quickly seized on the Boston Globe report, arguing it was possible proof that Romney ""hasn't been telling the truth"" about his exit from Bain. ""Either Mitt Romney, through his own words and his own signature was misrepresenting his position at Bain to the SEC, which is a felony, or he was misrepresenting his position at Bain to the American people to avoid responsibility for some of the consequences of his investments,"" said Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter. ""If that's the case, if he was lying to the American people, then that's a real character and trust issue that the American people need to take very seriously."" The Romney camp reacted quickly, with campaign manager Matt Rhoades calling Cutter's remark ""a reckless and unsubstantiated charge"" that was ""so over the top that it calls into question the integrity of their entire campaign."" ""President Obama ought to apologize for the out-of-control behavior of his staff, which demeans the office he holds,"" Rhoades continued. ""Campaigns are supposed to be hard fought, but statements like those made by Stephanie Cutter belittle the process and the candidate on whose behalf she works."" The nonpartisan group FactCheck.org said it previously looked into the matter of when Romney left Bain Capital and concluded there was insufficient evidence to show that Romney was still managing the company, even part-time, during his time with the Olympics. ""We would reassess our judgment should somebody come up with evidence that Romney took part in any specific management decision or had any active role (not just a title) at Bain after he left to head the Olympics,"" said Brooks Jackson, the director of FactCheck.org. Jackson added: ""But in our considered judgment, nothing in the Globe story directly contradicts Romney's statements, which he has certified as true under pain of federal prosecution, that he 'has not had any active role' with Bain or 'been involved in the operations' of Bain since then."" Obama's campaign also has been calling on Romney to release more than the two years' worth of tax documents he has already made public, suggesting the candidate may be hiding important details about his finances. In a statement Thursday, Cutter questioned whether Romney was concealing his tax documents ""because there is still more about this period and beyond that he doesn't want people to know."" The chief of the House Republicans' campaign arm said Thursday it was reasonable for people to ask for more information about Romney's personal financial records. ""His personal finances, the way he does things, his record, are fair game,"" Texas Republican Pete Sessions told CNN. So far, the former Massachusetts governor has released his 2010 tax records and an estimate for 2011, but he has filed an extension for his 2011 taxes. In an interview on Fox News on Wednesday, Romney said he'll release the most recent information ""as soon as they're prepared."" Romney has an estimated net worth of more than $250 million. Meanwhile, Romney's campaign released a new television ad Thursday accusing Obama of spreading ""dishonest attacks"" that Bain Capital specialized in advising companies on outsourcing while Romney was its head. The new Romney ad noted that FactCheck.org said there is ""no evidence"" that Romney was directly responsible for shipping jobs overseas while he headed the company. Obama's campaign has pressed the point in its own attack ads, and the president told an Iowa crowd Tuesday that ""Gov. Romney has experience owning companies that were called 'pioneers' in the business of outsourcing."" In an interview Thursday on NBC, Gillespie of the Romney campaign said the Obama ads ""have been shown to be demonstrably false and that's, you know, that's another way of saying a lie, obviously."" Gillespie's comment showed the growing role of surrogates for the candidates in launching campaign attacks. Reid, who said Wednesday that Romney would fail to win Senate approval as a Cabinet member because he won't reveal more than two years of his tax returns, went a step further Thursday. ""He not only couldn't be confirmed as a Cabinet secretary, he couldn't be confirmed as dogcatcher,"" Reid said. ""As a dogcatcher, you'd at least want to get a look at his tax returns."" Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, went after Obama during his weekly news conference, accusing the president of giving stimulus money to companies that did business overseas instead of in the United States during a recession. However, a fact check by The Washington Post showed there was little evidence that companies receiving federal money used it to pay workers overseas. Obama got some good news Thursday, with the number of people filing for initial unemployment claims falling to a four-year low. But the president remains vulnerable on his handling of the economy, identified as the biggest issue on the minds of voters, because of the 8.2% unemployment rate and weak growth. A top independent conservative group, Crossroads GPS, announced Thursday it was going up with its second straight television commercial slamming Obama over the high unemployment rate. The group, which was co-founded by conservative operative Karl Rove, says the commercial is part of an $8 million ad buy targeting battleground states. Crossroads GPS is the sister organization to American Crossroads, the independent super PAC that backs GOP causes and candidates. Crossroads GPS has spent tens of millions of dollars to run ads critical of the president and supportive of GOP lawmakers and candidates in crucial Senate contests. In his remarks to the NAACP, Biden focused on voting rights, arguing that Republicans were making it more difficult for people to vote. By implementing laws requiring voters to present official identification at the voting booth, Biden said, the GOP sees ""a different future, where voting is made harder, not easier."" Democrats have said that such laws are politically motivated and intended to suppress minority voting. Republicans have said the laws prevent fraud and protect the integrity of the system. The issue was a hot topic this week at the NAACP convention, where Attorney General Eric Holder spoke Tuesday and lambasted states that have considered or attempted to implement such laws, including Texas, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Appealing to the group's founding, Biden on Thursday urged the crowd to ""remember what (the NAACP) at its core was all about."" ""It was about the right to vote, because when you have the right to vote, you have the right to change things,"" he said. Biden's speech came one day after Romney was booed during his own remarks to the group when he vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature health care law. In comparison, Biden drew thunderous applause Thursday after trumpeting health care reform and emphasized that the law ensures coverage to ""8 million black Americans who never would have had insurance.""

"(CNN) -- Thousands of demonstrators in Syrian cities hit the streets after Friday prayers in another week of anti-government rallies, angry but largely peaceful outpourings of protest against the Bashar al-Assad regime. The gatherings come as a prominent humanitarian watchdog group issued a report detailing ""torture and ill-treatment"" of protesters over the past month, and U.N. human rights experts released a statement deploring the crackdown on peaceful demonstrations. Witnesses reported demonstrations in Daraa, Baniyas, Dair Elzour, Douma, Zabadani, the outskirts of Damascus and other cities against the regime, urged by protesters to enact political, economic and social changes. In most locales, the day seemed peaceful compared with previous Fridays, when bloody clashes left many dead and injured. Still, the Syrian Arab News Agency, the official government news service, said that a police sergeant ""was martyred"" after being ""assaulted by protesters in Homs."" The report, citing Homs police Commander Hamid Assad al-Murrai, said that Issam Mohammad Hassan died after being ""hit on the chest and head with sticks and rocks by protesters."" Razan Zaytouni, a human rights activist, said gunfire was heard in that western Syrian city as well as in Latakia. One witness in Daraa said people packed into the restive city's main square and chanted, ""The people demand the reform of the regime"" and ""United, United! The Syrian people are united."" The witness, who is a doctor, said the demonstration was peaceful and there were no signs of police or soldiers. Two witnesses described a brief clash between demonstrators and security personnel in Jobar, a village just outside Damascus. As forces tried to disperse the crowd with tear gas and warning shots, demonstrators and security forces threw rocks, a half-hour confrontation that left 10 demonstrators lightly injured, one of the witnesses said. The Syrian Arab News Agency reported brief and limited street gatherings in different cities and towns, largely without any conflict with security forces or reports of vandalism. As protesters marched, Human Rights Watch issued a report Friday entitled ""Syria: Rampant Torture of Protesters,"" a document detailing arbitrary detention, as well as mistreatment in prison. ""There can be no real reforms in Syria while security forces abuse people with impunity,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""President al-Assad needs to rein in his security services and hold them to account for arbitrary arrests and torture."" Human Rights Watch collected information about the mistreatment from interviews with 19 people who had been detained in Daraa, Damascus, Douma, al-Tal, Homs and Baniyas, and the families of detainees. The group also gathered information from Syrian activists about dozens of people detained in Daraa and Baniyas, and watched footage of some detainees released from Daraa, ""whose bodies appeared to have marks from torture."" Activists passed along videos of beatings and wounded people in Baniyas, disturbing imagery that punctuates the details in the Human Rights Watch report. Detainees arrested during the protests told Human Rights Watch that officers from the intelligence services, or the Mukhabarat, beat them during arrests and in detention. They saw beatings of dozens of detainees, including children, and ""heard screams of people being beaten."" Many in prisons experienced torture from electro-shock devices, cables and whips, witnesses said. Many stayed in overcrowded cells and were ""deprived of sleep, food and water."" Detainees were blindfolded and handcuffed, some said. Detainees had been made to ""sign confessions without being allowed to read them, as well as pledges not to participate in future protests,"" and ""none were allowed to have any contact with relatives or lawyers while in detention, and their families were not informed of their whereabouts,"" the report said. Security and intelligence officers also seized lawyers, activists and journalists who backed the protests, Human Rights Watch said. Most detainees had been freed in days without charges, and others were released on bail with charges pending. There was no immediate response to the report from the Syrian government. Al-Assad ordered the release of detainees in the unrest ""who have not committed criminal acts against the homeland and citizens,"" the Syrian Arab News Agency reported Thursday. This follows the president's meetings with officials in several provinces. ""The move comes in affirmation of President al-Assad's interest in solidifying cohesion among the Syrian people and in appreciation of their keenness on preserving Syria's security, safety and stability,"" the news agency said. Rami Nakhle, an activist, said many people who had been detained in Baniyas were released, but many of them had been tortured. Videos show men displaying bruises on their backs and faces. One video shows armed security forces in the main square kicking, flogging and stepping on tied up demonstrators. Activists say the security forces cursed the protesters, and one person could be heard saying ""tie the animal up."" U.N. human rights experts urged authorities Friday to stop the ""repression"" that has resulted in at least 200 deaths, and to launch a dialogue on reform. Juan Mendez, the special rapporteur on torture, called on Syria ""to respect the physical and mental integrity of protesters, ensure justice and accountability for victims, and bring those responsible for violations to justice,"" the United Nations said in a statement. ""Firing on peaceful crowds attending protests or funerals is by no means justified,"" stressed Christof Heyns, special rapporteur on arbitrary executions, one of 10 independent experts joining the call on the Syrian government to end the crackdown. ""Live ammunition is being used outside the prescribed limits and in clear violation of international law. Firearms may only be used in self-defense or in the defense of others."" He said the unrest could ""easily escalate into widespread violence,"" citing reports that people are now arming themselves to retaliate against security. The experts, who report to the U.N. Human Rights Council, said the crackdown is persisting even though the government has promised reform and is considering lifting its 48-year-old emergency rule. The statement said ""deep-seated corruption, injustice and discrimination, the lack of consultation, participation, and accountability"" are among the protesters' grievances. Also Friday, there were videos of chanting marchers Friday in Kiswah, outside Damascus, Latakia, Qamishli and Homs. In Jassem, near Daraa, demonstrators called for an end to corruption and the trial of government officials responsible for the deaths of demonstrators, a witness said. There were no security forces at the peaceful gathering, which lasted about two-and-a-half hours. Chants of ""Freedom! Freedom!""

"(CNN) -- Championship leader Fernando Alonso took pole position for the British Grand Prix after a rain delayed final qualifying session Saturday. The Silverstone track in central England was hit by a deluge during the second part of qualifying and the session was held up for nearly two hours. When the action resumed, Ferrari's Alonso showed his undoubted class with a one minute 51.746 seconds clocking, edging out Red Bull's Mark Webber for first place on the grid. Seven-time champion Michael Schumacher reveled in the conditions in his Mercedes and took third fastest ahead of reigning double champion Sebastian Vettel of Germany in his Red Bull. It will be Spaniard Alonso's first pole since the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix, but he took his home race in Valencia a fortnight ago to become the first man to achieve two wins in an unpredictable season. ""It was not easy. To complete a lap with no huge mistakes is not easy in these conditions,"" he told the official press conference. ""I'm happy to be on pole after nearly two years. In these conditions the qualifying is probably the least important of the year but obviously for visibility it is always better to be on pole."" His teammate Felipe Massa also backed him up with an improved performance to take a competitive fifth, his best in qualifying this season. Massa has faced questions about his future with the team after only gaining 11 points to date in 2012, but the Brazilian has told CNN that he is confident he will get a new deal with Ferrari. ""It's not the first time this thing happened to me at the end of the contract and we renew it,"" he said. ""Personally I didn't have the start to the season I wanted but I'm much stronger now, much better now, and I'm sure we can be competitive race-by-race now until the end of the year,"" he added. Former world champion Kimi Raikkonen was sixth for Lotus-Renault with young Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado in seventh for Williams-Renault. Home hope Lewis Hamilton was fastest in his McLaren after Q2, but struggled to find grip when it really mattered and was a frustrated eighth fastest. His teammate Jenson Button also endured another miserable afternoon and failed to make the cut for Q2, ending only 18th best.","Fernando Alonso takes pole for British Grand Prix at Silverstone .

"(CNN) -- Fallen For You sprang a surprise at Royal Ascot to win the Coronation Stakes in convincing fashion from Starscope and Irish History. It capped a fine day for jockey William Buick and trainer John Gosden, who triumphed in three of Friday's races. Elsewhere, the Queen finally scored a winner at Royal Ascot after two disappointing outings earlier this week. In the Coronation Stakes, the day's feature race for three-year-old fillies, the pre-race trio of favorites Homecoming Queen, Laugh Out Loud and Samitar set a strong early pace. Homecoming Queen, who won the 1,000 Guineas in similar front-running style, was aiming to help Joseph O'Brien to his second win at Royal Ascot after So You Think on Wednesday. But she was overhauled in the final furlong by a powerful burst of speed by the Gosden-trained 12-1 shot, ridden by Buick. Buick earlier won the Albany Stakes on Newfangled and later clinched the Wolferton Handicap on Gatewood. He moves top of the jockey's standings for this year's Royal Ascot meeting with four wins in total. The Queen's filly Estimate won the Queen's Vase (Group 3) for her first Royal Ascot winner since Free Agent in 2008.

"(CNN) -- Peter Sagan of Slovakia marked his debut in the Tour de France by winning the first stage of this year's race in Seraing Sunday. The 22-year-old Liquigas rider underlined his reputation as the rising star of the peloton by outsprinting Fabian Cancellara and Edvald Boasson Hagen of Norway after a tough uphill finish to the 198km stage from Liege. Swiss Cancellara kept the race leader's yellow jersey he claimed after winning the opening prologue Saturday. Pre-race favorite Bradley Wiggins of Team Sky finished in a whittled down bunch given the same time as the leading three, which also included defending champions Cadel Evans of Australia. The globalization of the Tour de France . A series of crashes and incidents involving errant spectators made for a difficult finish to the stage for the 198 riders. After the early breakaway was caught on the outskirts of Seraing, the pace went up as riders made their bid for stage glory. Sylvain Chavanel of France, who took third in the prologue in Liege behind Cancellara and Wiggins, made an initial attack, but it was RadioShack's Cancellara who split the field. Sagan reacted immediately to join him at the front before Team Sky's Boasson Hagen bridged the gap. Showing a coolness which belied his inexperience, Sagan timed his final burst perfectly to cross the line with his arms raised in triumph. He came into the Tour as the favorite to claim the green points jersey, having won five of the eight stages of this year's Tour of California and shown his versatility in other races. But it is his first appearance in cycling's most famous competition and his early victory will put him under the media spotlight. ""I'm very happy, especially after yesterday's incident at the prologue,"" said Sagan, referring to losing time when he nearly came off on a sharp turn. ""My legs were feeling better today. I want to thank my teammates, they did a lot of good work in the last kilometers.""

"(CNN) -- Boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. was booked Friday into the Clark County, Nevada, detention center to serve a 90-day sentence for a conviction last year on a domestic violence charge, police said. The high-profile athlete will be kept in isolation from the facility's 3,000 other inmates. ""He will receive one hour free time per day by himself,"" the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in a news release. The undefeated boxer was convicted after police said he punched the mother of his children at his home. Mayweather had been set to go to jail earlier this year, but a Nevada judge pushed back his reporting date so that the boxer could compete last month against WBA super-welterweight champion Miguel Cotto. Mayweather, whose nickname is ""Money,"" won a unanimous decision in the Las Vegas fight, which paid him $32 million. A Michigan native, Mayweather has won seven titles in various weight classes since turning pro in 1996.

"(CNN) -- New York Mets pitcher Johan Santana tossed the first no-hitter in the franchise's history Friday night in an 8-0 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. The Mets' hometown crowd at Citi Field erupted after Santana rallied from a 3-0 count to strike out Cardinals third baseman David Freese to end the game, and later when he was asked about making Mets' history. ""I'm very happy, and happy for you guys -- finally the first one,"" he told fans in an interview with SNY, which was covering the game. Though he struck out eight batters, Santana wasn't flawless, walking five in the course of tossing 134 pitches, only 77 for strikes, against the reigning World Series champions. And he got a few breaks -- including when the Cardinals' Carlos Beltran smacked a shot that appeared to hit the left-field chalk but was ruled foul, and when teammate Mike Baxter made a spectacular catch in left field in the seventh inning, slamming the wall so hard that he had to leave the game with an injured shoulder. Santana's feat was the third no-hitter of the 2012 Major League Baseball season, following the Chicago White Sox's Philip Humber, who pitched a perfect game in April, and the Los Angeles Angels' Jered Weaver last month. It is the first no-hitter by a National League pitcher since the Phillies' Roy Halladay did it in the 2010 playoffs. The Mets have had their fair share of standout pitchers. Hall of Famers Nolan Ryan and Tom Seaver, for instance, played with the club and went on to throw no-hitters -- seven for Ryan and one for Seaver -- with other teams. Friday night's game means that only the San Diego Padres have never had a pitcher get through nine innings without allowing a hit. Born in Venezuela, Santana won two Cy Young awards -- given to baseball's best pitcher -- in 2004 and 2006 while with the Minnesota Twins. He came to the Mets in 2008 and had three solid seasons, but he underwent shoulder surgery, missed all of 2011 and came into 2012 as a question mark. Santana said Friday's game was his first no-hitter on any level. ""I don't even think I threw a no-hitter in video games,"" he told reporters. ""This was the first time I had the opportunity.""","NEW: ""I don't even think I threw a no-hitter in video games,"" Johan Santana says .

"(CNN) -- Frankel first, the rest nowhere. Astonishing Frankel won the Queen Anne Stakes, the opening race of Royal Ascot, in spectacular style on Tuesday, smashing a classy field by 11 lengths to reassert his claims to be recognized as the world's best racehorse. The fans have come in their droves to Royal Ascot this week to see another wonder horse, Black Caviar, the Australian superstar who will make her appearance here on Saturday. But the performance of the week - arguably the performance of the year - has already been seen here. It might just be the race to end all races as the unbeaten Frankel recorded his 11th successive victory. The Sir Henry Cecil-trained four-year-old was sent off at odds of 1-10 on Tuesday, meaning a $10 bet would earn you just $1 profit. In hindsight, those odds seemed like a good deal. Long time rival Excelebration, whom Frankel beat by a comfortable five lengths at Newbury in May, had been given orders not to let Frankel open up ground. Despite the best efforts of Excelebration's jockey, Joseph O'Brien, those orders soon proved futile. Once Tom Queally, Frankel's jockey, opened the tap there was no way any other horse was going to get close to Frankel, the giant bay increasing his lead with every one of his all-devouring strides. Still in full flow as he passed the winning post, it is hard to recall a performance like his by any horse in recent memory. ""Breathtaking"", ""astonishing"", ""brilliant"" were just some of the milder adjectives murmured by appreciative fans, even the inexperienced racegoers among them sensing they were witnessing something extraordinary. Is Frankel the greatest racehorse of all time? Probably. Will we ever see his likes again? Don't bet on it.","Unbeaten Frankel wins Queen Anne Stakes in opening race of Royal Ascot meeting .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's been less than two months since President Barack Obama signed the bill that will eventually lead to repeal of the controversial ban on gay men and lesbians serving openly in the military. And the military is already taking steps to implement the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell."" The Pentagon released a memo Friday that finalizes how the department will begin adopting its policy to the new law, how it will train troops with regards to gays and lesbians serving openly and how it all will be communicated to Congress and the public. The plan focuses on three tiers of training: . -- Tier one for experts who may frequently deal with ""don't ask, don't tell"" repeal matters, like chaplains and military lawyers. -- Tier two for senior leaders who will need to oversee education and training of the troops in their command. -- Tier three for the rank-and-file, active-duty service members, reservists and civilians working for the Defense Department. On March 1 Clifford Stanley, the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, will provide a progress report on the preparation for repeal to the White House, the secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The memo says the ""don't ask, don't tell"" law will not be repealed until, among other milestones, the tier one and tier two training is complete and tier three training is underway. At that point, the secretary, chairman and the president will certify the department is ready for gay men and lesbians to serve openly. After the certification takes place, a 60-day countdown begins before repeal is officially implemented. That date has not been decided yet.","Defense Department preparing to implement repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell""

"(CNN) -- This is the time of the year when NBA executives may get a little religious, praying that the ping pong balls in Wednesday's NBA draft lottery fall in their favor. Nobody may be praying harder than Michael Jordan, whose Charlotte Bobcats is the losingest team in NBA history. The Bobcats ended the season with a record of 7-59 and finished with an all-time worst .106 winning percentage. For the lottery, the league assigns ping pong balls to the worst performing teams. The poorer a team performed in the season, the more balls it gets. The idea is to help the team get first dibs in the draft and pick up a promising player. The Bobcats' dismal distinction means it will have a 25% chance of getting the top pick in Wednesday's draft lottery -- and the greatest chance at picking Kentucky's all-world big man Anthony Davis. Davis, a 6-foot-10 power forward who led Kentucky to a NCAA national championship this year, is believed to be the top prospect for any team who wins the first pick in the NBA draft. Last year's big winner was the Cleveland Cavaliers, which won the first pick despite having the second best odds of getting it. The draft lottery, which determines the order of the first 14 teams drafting in the June 28 draft, will be held in New York Wednesday night and will be televised. Here are the odds of getting the first pick for the 14 teams in the draft lottery, according to the NBA: . 1. Charlotte, 25% . 2. Washington, 19.9% . 3. Cleveland, 13.8% . 4. New Orleans,13.7% . 5.

"(CNN) -- Southern hemisphere's top three rugby nations completed a clean sweep of victories against their northern counterparts for the second successive weekend on Saturday. World champions New Zealand held off a late charge from Ireland to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in their three-match series, winning 22-19 in the first international match played in Christchurch since the earthquake that devastated the city in February 2011. South Africa also took a 2-0 lead against England, triumphing 36-27 in Johannesburg, while Australia edged out Six Nations champions Wales for the second weekend in a row, winning 25-23 in Melbourne. The All Blacks needed a late drop-goal from star flyhalf Dan Carter, now back in the fold after injury ruled him out of the business end of the World Cup, as both teams scored a try each. The Irish have never beaten the Kiwis in 107 years. ""It was a game we probably shouldn't have won but we showed some great composure,"" said the Kiwis' new coach Steve Hansen, whose team won 42-10 in the opening match of the series in Auckland. The Wallabies also needed late inspiration as replacement Mike Harris kicked a match-winning penalty after the fulltime siren to deny Wales a first win in Australia since 1969. ""We're hugely disappointed, having outscored Australia two tries to one,"" caretaker Wales coach Rob Howley said. ""We gave them the opportunity through a lack of discipline in those last two minutes which they took."" The Springboks looked set for an impressive win against England, leading by 15 points at halftime. However, the tourists reduced the deficit to four points before 2007 World Cup-winning winger J.P. Pietersen scored the home team's fourth try to extend their winning run over England to nine matches. ""I think we gave them some easy tries at one stage,"" Springboks captain Jean de Villiers said. ""We played some great rugby in the first half, but credit must go to England for coming back and never giving up.""

"(CNN) -- David Beckham's Olympic dream is over after the soccer star revealed he has not been included in the British squad for the forthcoming Games in his home city of London. Coach Stuart Pearce has left the Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder out of his squad for the 16-team football competition, rejecting the chance to include the 37-year-old midfielder as one of his three players over the age of 23. ""Everyone knows how much playing for my country has always meant to me, so I would have been honored to have been part of this unique Team GB squad,"" Beckham said in a statement released via his representatives. ""Naturally I am very disappointed but there will be no bigger supporter of the team than me and like everyone, I will be hoping they can win the gold."" Should Beckham be in Britain's Olympic squad? Beckham was part of Sebastian Coe's team which convinced the International Olympic Committee to grant London the right to host the Games for a third time in 2005. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid player was on a provisional 35-man list for the British squad, but Beckham insists he is still looking forward to the Olympics, which start next month, despite the snub. ""As a Londoner I was really proud to have played a small part in bringing the Olympics to my home town as part of Seb's team,"" he said. ""I can't wait for the Games to begin and enjoy every moment along with the rest of Great Britain."" Reports in the British media have suggested Beckham's former United teammate Ryan Giggs has been selected as one of Pearce's three over-age players, along with Liverpool's Craig Bellamy and Micah Richards of Manchester City. The choice of 38-year-old Welsh midfielder Giggs, England international defender Richards and Wales forward Bellamy would provide Pearce with cover in all areas of his squad. Beckham has not played international football since coming on as a substitute during England's 3-0 win over Belarus in 2009. Football culture: Who are you? Warrior or tika taka technician? His omission provoked surprise on social-networking site Twitter as well as criticism for Pearce, with former Premier League midfielder Robbie Savage, who played with Beckham in United's youth team, labeling the GB coach as ""clueless."" Former England striker Gary Lineker added: ""There are arguments for and against DB selection. What i don't understand though, is why string him along by including him in a short list? ""On another note... Will be brilliant to see Ryan Giggs finally have the opportunity to play in a major tournament."" Team GB has been drawn in Group A of the tournament, alongside Senegal, two-time champions Uruguay and United Arab Emirates. Pearce's team will begin their campaign against Senegal at Giggs' home stadium Old Trafford on July 26 -- the day before the Olympics officially start.","David Beckham has been left out of the British Olympic soccer squad .

"(CNN) -- Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook were instrumental as Oklahoma City Thunder won the first game of the 2012 NBA Finals. Durant was the game's top scorer with 36 points, while Westbrook notched 27, as the Thunder beat Miami Heat 105-94 in the best-of-seven series. Three-time MVP LeBron James managed 30 points for the Heat, who lost out on last year's NBA crown to the Dallas Mavericks. James' battle with Durant is seen by most commentators as key to the direction of this year's series. But it didn't start well for Oklahoma. They had to overcome a 13-point deficit early on in the game, thanks mainly to a 13-point first-half haul from Shaun Battier. The Heat also nailed five 3-pointers in the opening quarter, a franchise record for the opening period of a playoff game. However Durant, making his first appearance in the NBA showpiece, led Thunder's fightback with an impressive performance that culminated in 17 points in the final quarter. ""I am just playing off my teammates and not trying to force anything,"" Durant told reporters after the game, in quotes carried by Agence France-Presse. ""Everybody came to play and we stuck together."" His coach, Scott Brooks, was equally effusive about the team's spirit and togetherness. ""We showed a lot of toughness in the second half,"" he said. ""Really battling and fighting for every possession. I give our guys a lot of credit. They did a great job of competing in the second half.""

"(CNN) -- Yohan Blake stunned Usain Bolt over 100m in the Jamaica Olympic trials to signal his intent ahead of the London Games where they will battle again for gold medal glory. The 2011 world champion was never headed as he set the best time of the year of 9.75 seconds at the National Stadium in Kingston Friday night. Bolt made an appalling start and had to charge through the field to claim second place, 0.11 seconds behind, with Asafa Powell in third place. Only the top three in the Jamaica trials are selected for the individual events at the Olympics, so there was not room for error by any of the star sprinters. Bolt was disqualified for a false start in the 100m in the world championships in Daegu last year, leaving the way clear for the 22-year-old Blake. It may have been playing on his mind as he got left off the blocks and could not make up the deficit on Blake, who shares the same coach in Glen Mills. Why do all the top sprinters come from Jamaica? ""He's a class runner without a doubt and I have said it over the years that he is one of the best. So for me it's just one of those things,"" Bolt told AFP. The pair were back in action Saturday, winning their qualifying heats in the 200m ahead of Sunday's final over the longer sprint. In the women's 100m there was more stunning action as defending Olympic champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce clocked a world leading 10.70 seconds to edge out Veronica Campbell-Brown (10.82) and Kerron Stewart (10.94). ""This is the first hurdle and I crossed it and I am just looking forward to the Olympics,"" Fraser-Pryce said. Jamaican sprinters are expected to dominate their events and the relays at the London Olympics which start in a month's time.

"London (CNN) -- The man in charge of security for the upcoming Olympic Games in London said Monday that preparations have been ""long and thorough,"" and expressed confidence that the event will prove to be a success. ""The national threat level at present is assessed to be substantial -- meaning that an attack is a strong possibility -- one notch lower than has been the case for much of the last 10 years,"" said Jonathan Evans, director general of the Security Service, known as MI5, in an address at Mansion House, the official residence of the mayor of London. ""We are far from complacent. A lot of hard work still lies ahead and there is no such thing as guaranteed security. But I think that we shall see a successful and memorable Games this summer in London."" Is this the world's greatest athlete? Evans said members of his service had been involved in advising on the design and security of the venues, in the accreditation of those working there and in intelligence collection and analysis. ""The preparations have gone well,"" he said. ""No doubt some terrorist networks have thought about whether they could pull off an attack,"" he acknowledged. ""But the games are not an easy target and the fact that we have disrupted multiple terrorist plots here and abroad in recent years demonstrates that the UK as a whole is not an easy target for terrorism."" The Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank, has identified 43 potential plots or serious incidents in Britain since the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, he said. Saudi Arabia allows women to compete . Evans credited an investment in counterterrorism with having succeeded since then in ""identifying, disrupting and suppressing terrorism before it succeeds. You could say that we are near to reaching a form of stalemate -- they haven't stopped trying but we have got better at stopping them."" He added that he was seeing a change in international threats, with incidents involving Pakistan and/or Afghanistan falling from about three-quarters of all such threats to fewer than half. ""We appear to be moving from a period of a deep and focused threat to one where the threat is less monolithic but wider. Al-Qaeda affiliates in Yemen, Somalia and the Sahel (region of Africa) have become more dangerous as al Qaeda in Pakistan has declined and we see increasing levels of cooperation between al Qaeda groups in various parts of the world."" In addition, ""a small number of British would-be jihadis"" have been traveling to Arab countries to find training and opportunities for militant activity, he said. ""Some will return to the UK and pose a threat here. This is a new and worrying development and could get worse as events unfold. So we will have to manage the short-term risks if there is to be a longer-term reward from the Arab Spring."" Photo finish in 100-meter trial . The Security Service, or MI5 is the British domestic spying agency -- sister of MI6 foreign intelligence service, where fictional spy James Bond worked. Both services emerged from World War II, but neither were acknowledged to officially exist by the British government until 1992. Evans also gave a blunt warning about the dangers from Iran, saying ""a return to state-sponsored terrorism by Iran or its associates, such as Hezbollah, cannot be ruled out as pressure on the Iranian leadership increases."" CNN's Dan Rivers contributed to this report.","Preparations have been ""long and thorough,"" says Jonathan Evans .

"(CNN) -- The Queen's hopes of marking her Diamond Jubilee with a win at Royal Ascot were dashed when her horse, Carlton House, was beaten by two-and-a-quarter lengths by So You Think in the showpiece Prince of Wales Stakes on Wednesday. The victory marked redemption for the Aiden O'Brien-trained six-year-old. Runner-up in this race last year to the ill-fated Rewilding, the New Zealand-bred horse has traveled the globe in search of an elusive 10th Group 1 victory. The dual Cox Plate winner could be considered to be the horse with the biggest carbon footprint in racing, having tried his luck in Australia, France, the U.S. and Dubai. He is now expected to take a well-deserved retirement to stud having passed the Â£5 million ($7.87m) prize money barrier. The Queen, dressed in pink for the second day of Royal Ascot, had watched Carlton House parade before the race and exchanged a few words with Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai, who gifted Carlton House to the Queen as a yearling. One of the best-known owners and breeders of racehorses in the country, the Queen has not had a Group 1 winner in Britain since Dunfermline captured the St Ledger Stakes in her Silver Jubilee year, 1977.","So You Think wins Prince of Wales Stakes at Royal Ascot .

""I wanted to see blood and guts and L.A. take them down,""said Ann Marie Love, standing outside the arena. For most of the game, the Devils and the Kings remained in a tight scoreless battle. New Jersey goaltender Martin Brodeur and Los Angeles goalie Jonathan Quick seemingly put up walls in front of their nets in a defensive struggle. Among the celebrities in attendance were longtime Kings fans Matthew Perry and Alyssa Milano, along with Will Ferrell, who made a raucous video cheering the Kings that went viral throughout now-hockey-crazy Los Angeles. Kings fans, most dressed in their home team's black, roared throughout the contest and chanted ""MVP"" each time Quick stopped a serious scoring chance by the Devils. From the start, the Los Angeles Kings seemed doomed to be underdogs. They are a hockey team in a land without snow or even ice. They couldn't even find a puck for their first practice in 1967. Not even the Great One, Wayne Gretzky, could bring the team a Stanley Cup. And to marginalize them further, the Kings had to compete for fans against other local teams, some legendary: the Lakers, the Dodgers, the Angels and the Clippers. But the Kings are positioned to win their first Stanley Cup in the franchise's 44-year history. The Kings have been having a Cinderella run, entering the playoffs as the lowest seed in their conference. But they have been nearly unbeatable, with a 15-3 playoff record. In his 39th season as the announcer for Kings games, Hockey Hall of Famer Bob Miller said the anticipation was unbearable. ""It is emotional for me, and I'm wondering what it's gonna be like when it actually happens and I see (team captain) Dustin Brown lift that Stanley Cup, because there were years that a lot of us in the organization felt, 'will we ever see this?' "" Miller said. At their first practice in 1967, after the league awarded a franchise to Los Angeles, the team's pucks were ""stored under boxes and equipment, and they had no puck,"" Miller said. A Hollywood producer borrowed a puck that had been a gift from the Montreal Canadiens and gave it to the team, Miller said. ""They've come a long way since the days of one puck, that's for sure,"" Miller said. The Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, home of the Kings, is seeing a run on team apparel. It's an unlikely scenario because the arena usually sports the colors and merchandise of the Lakers and Clippers, the NBA teams that both call it home. ""I'm so fired up right now that I got up this morning, put shoes on and came down here to get this jersey. I had a T-shirt. I said, 'I need a jersey to keep me for real, be there for them. Let's be there when they end it!' "" fan Vincent ""Butch"" Frankel said. ""That's gonna be Wednesday night! Kings goin' to go all the way!"" Inside the stadium, fans were anxious. ""I've been a Kings fan for 40 years and had a season's seat for 25 years,"" said Cheryl Baggs, holding a plastic cup of white wine. ""I've waited a long time for this, so it's chardonnay now, and I hope it's champagne later."" Grabbing a beer at a concession stand, Daniel Medina said he was glad to see the Kings as the successful ones this time of year now that the Lakers and Clippers have been eliminated from the playoffs. ""It's just great to see the focus on the Kings now instead of those other teams,"" Medina said. Two other fans drove in from Las Vegas, five hours away. ""They underachieved all season, and so I think that now they are actually living up to their potential and showing everybody that they really were the team to beat,"" said Emily Kolbus, who was joined by her friend, Kaleigh. Kings have found a way to be better . Actor and rapper LL Cool J, more of a basketball fanatic, has even caught the fever. ""Normally during this time of year, I'm watching the NBA playoffs, but a friend of mine invited me to the hockey game, and I decided to take him up on his offer, and I gotta tell you, it did not disappoint,"" he said. ""You know, the hockey games live, the hockey match live, is some serious business. It's serious. It's great.""","Kings are having a Cinderella run in the playoffs .

"(CNN) -- Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson, who announced over the weekend she would retire because of recurring knee problems, said Monday the decision was one of the hardest of her life and that she thinks its impact hasn't truly hit her. ""Having that period of my life over with is surreal. I don't think it's settled in yet. It just came to a point where my body couldn't take anymore and kept telling me I had to face the science,"" she told CNN's Erin Burnett. ""It was definitely one of the hardest decisions I've ever made,"" she said. Johnson, 20, won one gold and three silver medals during the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. She also won a season of ""Dancing with the Stars,"" waltzing her way into the hearts of millions of American fans. Even though she won't be able to compete at the Olympics this year, Johnson told Burnett she still plans to go to London to cheer on her teammates. ""If I can't be on the podium competing, I'll be in the stands cheering my head off for them,"" she said. Asked by Burnett what she plans to do next, Johnson said she will take a year off and then hopefully start college. ""I've had that on my list ever since I was little and my parents are going to make sure that happens,"" said Johnson. ""As for career, I have no idea. I don't even know what I'm going to be doing tomorrow right now because my plans have changed a little bit, but I'm excited to see what opportunities are going to arise.""","Shawn Johnson won four Olympic medals and a season of ""Dancing with the Stars""

"(CNN) -- There was time, a generation ago, when it was hardly insanity -- or, to use the operative word here, Linsanity -- for the NBA team in New York to play an unselfish style of basketball. It was simply called ""playing the game the right way,"" and the Knicks did it better than anyone. Fifteen years before Jeremy Lin was born, they built their franchise on the principles their new star has brought to the team over the 12 days since the Harvard graduate broke into the starting lineup and captivated the nation. Make the extra pass. Don't worry about individual statistics. The championship Knicks of 1970 and 1973 had plenty of talent -- there were a combined six Hall of Famers on their rosters and one, head coach Red Holzman, on the bench -- but they put aside their egos for the betterment of the team. They won as a group, not as individuals, and in the process became the pride of a struggling city in the early '70s. The stars of those teams -- Walt Frazier, Willis Reed, Bill Bradley, Dave DeBusschere, Jerry Lucas and Earl Monroe -- could appreciate the way the Knicks have transformed with Lin as point guard. ""What I would say to young fans is, 'Close your eyes and imagine five Jeremy Lins on a team -- that's what those teams were like,"" said Harvey Araton, author of the recent book ""When the Garden was Eden"" on those great teams. ""Lin is a 21st century carryover of what the old Knicks brought to the city."" Now fans have to wonder: Will the return to the team first style under Lin stick for the long term, especially with superstar Carmelo Anthony expected to return to the lineup this weekend? And can it help end a championship drought for the Knicks that dates back to that 1973 title? So much about Lin's incredible story has focused on what he could do. He could knock down the stereotype that Asian-Americans can't excel at team sports, opening opportunities for countless others. He could become a marketing force generating tens of millions a year -- and, with his picture on the cover of Sports Illustrated, is already on his way to becoming an international star. The NBA even added him to its All-Star weekend because of the enormous interest. He could dramatically increase the bottom line for the big-market Knicks, with the team's parent company already having seen its valuation increase $71 million since he jumped into the starting lineup and ignited a seven-game winning streak. But head coach Mike D'Antoni is more focused on how his presence has dramatically changed the chemistry of a middling basketball team, turning the Knicks from a tough-to-watch unit into something more fitting their home address just off Broadway. SI: Inside the Knicks playbook . The Knicks are still just 15-15, a long way from the elite teams in the NBA. But they have been playing a pretty brand of basketball since Lin took the reins as point guard. ""He's changed everything,"" D'Antoni said an hour before the new-look Knicks beat the Sacramento Kings, 100-85. ""Everybody knows what they're supposed to do and how they should act. Nobody looks at stats and nobody cares about that. It's a great feeling as a coach to have a group like that."" It is what every basketball coach wants: A team that is stronger than its five individual parts. But for years, with few exceptions, the Knicks have put predictable, star-driven teams on the floor, living and dying on the abilities of a couple of great players rather than an entire unit. With Lin, that's changed. In the win over the Kings, the Knicks were a balanced and unselfish team -- the top eight players scored between nine and 15 points -- with Lin leading the way with a career-high 13 assists to go along with his 10 points. Lin became a national story when he torched the Los Angeles Lakers for 38 points, but he said he'd rather be a true point guard in the mold of a Steve Nash or a Jason Kidd, one who passes first and scores when the opportunity is there. It's what the Knicks hope to get from him. ""As a point guard, my field-goal attempts have been really high,"" Lin said after hitting just four of six. ""I don't think that's necessarily good. I think it's my job to distribute and get people in a rhythm."" So how does Anthony fit in? Lin has won over the desperate fan base of this franchise so quickly and dramatically that the return of a superstar to the lineup has been met with worry, not excitement. Anthony arrived from Denver in a blockbuster trade just a year ago as the player who was supposed to deliver a title to a franchise that hasn't even won a playoff series since 2000. The small forward is a five-time All-Star who led the Nuggets to the playoffs every year from 2004-2010, averaging 24.8 points a game over his nine-year career. But he also has the reputation as a player who needs -- and demands -- the ball in his hands, one who routinely takes more than 20 shots a game. Can he fit in with Lin? He was insulted at the question. ""That's like a slap in the face,"" Anthony said when asked by ESPN if he was a selfish player. ""None of my teammates I've ever played with would say that I was a selfish player. Nobody."" Anthony has a point. He won a national championship at Syracuse elevating his teammates and, while playing alongside LeBron James and Dwyane Wade at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, took a complementary role for the benefit of the team's gold-medal pursuit. He is also smart enough to have watched the Linsanity unfold in Manhattan and to know that any player who stalls this movement will not be treated kindly by the fans at Madison Square Garden. Anthony insists he'll adjust, and that the Knicks will be a better team when he's back. Lin, for one, is not worried. ""He's a lethal scorer,"" Lin said, ""and he runs the pick-and-roll so well. We will probably be on opposite sides on the offense and when we swing-swing the ball and set up plays off the pick-and-roll ..."" He let the sentence trail off, but fans understand the potential. There's no telling how far the Knicks can go if Anthony and his teammates are willing to put aside their egos for the betterment of the team. This team will captivate the city with selfless basketball. And, as any old school Knicks fan can tell you, it won't be the first time it's happened.","Steve Politi says Lin represents ""team first"" style the Knicks exhibited a generation ago .

"(CNN) -- The remains of what was Christchurch Cathedral, whose shattered spire became a symbol of the New Zealand city's quake devastation, is to be dismantled after Anglican church officials said the earthquake had damaged the structure of the iconic church beyond repair. Bishop Victoria Matthews said the existing church walls would be brought down to about 3 meters and the base of the church kept for use as a prayer garden. Officials had thought part of the building could be saved but said on Friday that recent aftershocks had made the existing structure unsound. ""What we need to do is bring the walls down to a safe level which is probably about 2-3 meters,"" Bishop Matthews said. ""There will be no bulldozers, no wrecking ball. This will be done with deep respect and love."" The cathedral -- one of the city's best-known historic buildings -- was severely damaged in the earthquake on February 22, 2011, its neo-gothic spire crashing to the ground. The quake destroyed many buildings in Christchurch's central business district and killed 185 people. When the deadly quake hit New Zealand . News of its demolition was greeted with dismay in Christchurch where heritage campaigners say the decision was taken without public consultation. Christchurch City Councillor Aaron Keown vowed to protest to stop the demolition and said there was widespread support for his position. ""I would be in there chaining myself to the building to stop that and I know lots of other volunteers would come in to do that,"" he told the Christchurch Press. Bishop Matthews said the cost of saving the cathedral was ""staggering"" and that NZ$50 million (US$42 million) would be needed to rebuild existing parts of the building or NZ$100 million for a complete reconstruction. She said bringing the walls down to a safe level would allow officials to retrieve artworks and other church relics still inside the structure. The cathedral is within Christchurch's ""red zone,"" the worst-hit area of the city where many of the buildings still remain too unstable to enter. The Anglican Church has said that it is committed to building a new cathedral, but no plans have been drawn up about where it will be placed, how much it will cost or what it will look like. The 131-year-old cathedral had previously been damaged in earthquakes in 1881, 1888, 1901 and in 2010, according to its website.","Church officials say quake-damaged cathedral will be demolished .

"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- As the window opened for North Korea's latest rocket launch opened Thursday morning, the nation's neighbors were watching developments at the remote base nervously. Japanese Patriot missile defense systems scanned the clear skies in Tokyo and an air base in Okinawa, underlining the regional tensions. ''We would like to call (on North Korea) for restraint until the very end,"" Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said outside his office as he arrived Thursday, according to news agency Kyodo. He added, ""We are fully prepared to deal with any contingency,"" the news agency reported. Japan has threatened to shoot down the North Korean rocket if it is seen threatening its territory. South Korea has described the move as a ""grave provocation"" and says it will respond with ""appropriate countermeasures."" The announcement last month of the satellite launch -- which countries like the United States and South Korea see as a cover for a ballistic missile test -- ratcheted up tensions in the region and prompted Washington to suspend a recent deal to supply food aid to the North. ""This launch will give credence to the view that North Korean leaders see improved relations with the outside world as a threat to the existence of their system,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a speech Tuesday. ""And recent history strongly suggests that additional provocations may follow."" The Phillipines and South Korea have ordered commercial planes and fishermen to stay clear of the rockets proposed path over the next few days. North Korea has said that it plans to launch its rocket sometime between Thursday and Monday, between the hours of 7 a.m. and noon (6 p.m.-11 p.m. Wednesday-Sunday in the U.S. Eastern Time zone). North Korea says it has started fueling a long-range rocket in final-stage preparation, a senior national space official said Wednesday. Fueling will be completed at the ""appropriate time,"" said Paek Chang Ho, head of the North Korean General Satellite Control and Command Center. He declined to be more specific. North Korea says the rocket will put a satellite in orbit. A recent report from South Korean intelligence officials claimed that North Korea is planning a new nuclear test in the area where it staged previous atomic blasts. The report noted that the two previous rocket launches that Pyongyang said were intended to put satellites into orbit were followed a few weeks or months later by nuclear tests. International leaders have urged North Korea to cancel the launch, but Pyongyang has refused to back down, insisting that the operation is for peaceful purposes. The last time Pyongyang carried out what it described as a satellite launch, in April 2009, the U.N. Security Council condemned the action and demanded that it not be repeated. The announcement of the fueling was made on the same day as a conference of the North Korean ruling Workers' Party that began to cement the position of the secretive state's new leader. Korean television showed a somber Kim Jong-Un standing beneath two towering statues of his father and grandfather while receiving applause from party functionaries and the military. The meeting of party delegates and the controversial launch come as the nation prepares to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea who ruled the Communist state for more than four decades. His birthday on April 15, known as the ""Day of the Sun,"" is a key public holiday in the North Korean calendar. At the conference, the late former leader Kim Jong Il was given an everlasting title. He is now eternal general secretary of the Workers' Party of North Korea. Current leader Kim Jong Un was named the first secretary of the Workers' Party of North Korea. The title appears to be a newly created position that sets the table for a virtual coronation of Kim Jong Un, says North Korea watcher Jonathan Pollack of the Washington-based Brookings Institution. ""Creating this new position is sort of like retiring a jersey number for a famous baseball player,"" said Pollack. ""It shows a deference to his father and to the old guard, while still cementing his control on power."" North Korea announced several other titles for Kim Jong Un, including making him a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission. Kim Jong Un is already described as the supreme leader of the party, state and army. But it is still unclear how directly the young Kim, thought to be in his late 20s, is involved in policy decisions. ""This move fully parallels what happened with his father,"" said Pollack. ""Kim Jong Il is now venerated at the same level as his father, buried in the same tomb and they are making statues of them riding together on horseback."" ""But Kim Jong Un never got the on-the-job training his father did, so he may have this title to allow some mentoring or sharing power and decisions with his elders."" CNN's Brian Walker contributed to this report.","NEW: Officials say launch will occur in morning hours between Thursday and Monday .

"(CNN) -- Toro Rosso have announced an all-new driver pairing for the 2012 Formula One season with Daniel Ricciardo and Jean-Eric Vergne replacing Sebastien Buemi and Jaime Alguersuari. Both new signings are part of the junior driver program at Toro Rosso's owner and fellow constructor Red Bull, and both featured in practice sessions for their new team during 2011. Australian Ricciardo also drove for Hispania Racing (HRT) in the second half of last season. The 22-year-old said he was delighted to secure his future in the sport. ""To be honest, I am still jumping up and down with excitement at the news,"" he told Toro Rosso's official website. ""I can't wait to get to work once testing begins. Pit-lane pioneers: Women in Formula One . ""This is a really big deal for me and something I have wanted ever since I was driving for Toro Rosso on Friday mornings at the races in the first part of last season."" Like Ricciardo, Vergne, from France, is a former winner of the British Formula 3 Championship. The 20-year-old said he was determined to repay the faith his team had shown in him. ""Christmas has come early for me this year! Having driven for them a few times this year and also testing for Red Bull Racing in Abu Dhabi, I definitely feel ready to make the move, even if I know there is a big difference between testing and actually racing. ""I enjoyed working with the guys at Toro Rosso this year and I can't wait to be part of the team for real. Sitting on the grid in Melbourne next March cannot come soon enough."" Team principal Franz Tost defended the decision to replace Buemi and Alguersuari, saying his new duo had long been primed for their debut seasons with the team. Champion Vettel honored to be part of F1 history . ""I must also thank Sebastien Buemi and Jaime Alguersuari for all their hard work over the past three seasons. They have delivered some excellent performances which have helped the team move forward and develop. ""However, one has to remember that when Scuderia Toro Rosso was established in 2005, it was done so with the intention of providing a first step into Formula 1 for the youngsters in the Red Bull Junior Driver programme. ""It is therefore part of the team's culture to change its driver line-up from time to time in order to achieve this goal."" Elsewhere, Team Lotus officially changed their name to Caterham F1 on Wednesday, with team principal Tony Fernandes eyeing improvements in the 2012 Formula One season. The UK-based outfit's name change officially ends the dispute over the use of the Lotus name in F1, with Renault set to race as Lotus next year. The marque have finished 10th out of 12 teams in each of the two seasons they have competed in since entering the sport in 2010, but are yet to score a world championship point. ""The race team must improve and be a true showcase for our group of businesses,"" Fernandes said in a team press release. ""Yes, being in F1 implies that you are already ahead of the pack. However, ultimately we want to be leading that pack. It's not going to happen overnight, but if we set realistic targets, then it's something we will achieve."" Elsewhere, Hispania Racing (HRT) announced the departure of team principal Colin Kolles after two seasons with the team.

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia is re-establishing its diplomatic presence in Egypt after tensions briefly spurred the kingdom to pull its envoys and shutter its missions, Egyptian and Saudi state news agencies said Friday. Ambassador Ahmad Kattan is returning to his post in Cairo, and Saudi Arabia's embassy and consulate will reopen by Sunday, the agencies said. Saudi Arabia called back Kattan and closed its embassy and consulates last Sunday after raucous protests in Cairo over the imprisonment of Ahmed Mohammed el-Gezawi, an Egyptian human rights lawyer. Throngs of Egyptians had gathered in front of the Saudi Embassy last week, calling for the release of el-Gezawi. The decision to pull out Saudi diplomats came after protesters' ""attempts to storm and threaten the security and safety of its (embassy) employees,"" the Saudi Press Agency said. Saudi officials say el-Gezawi is accused of trying to smuggle thousands of pills into the country. The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights say el-Gezawi had been traveling during Umrah, a minor pilgrimage to Mecca, when he was detained. ""What has happened in the recent days of repercussions in the relationship between the two countries is painful to every honorable Saudi and Egyptian citizen, and our decision to recall the ambassador and the closure of the embassy were only to protect its employees from other situations that could have developed with dire consequences,"" the Saudi Press Agency said, quoting King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz. ""We will not allow this incidental crisis to prolong."" The protests and the Saudi reaction appear to have again ratcheted up long-standing tensions between the two Middle Eastern nations. The strains can be traced back to 1979, when the kingdom broke off diplomatic relations after Egypt inked a peace deal with Israel based on the Camp David Accords. The ties were restored in November 1987. Egypt, the most populous Arab country, has often engaged in ""a subtle competition"" with its Saudi counterparts ""over this question of regional leadership,"" Cook said. Egypt erupted in protest last year during 18 days of demonstrations in Cairo's Tahrir Square after similar uprisings in neighboring Tunisia, ultimately ousting Egypt's longtime president Hosni Mubarak after nearly three decades in power.

"New York (CNN) -- New Jersey drivers, long the butt of bad driver jokes, will soon give up some of their roadways to professional racers, as state officials have reached an agreement to bring Formula One racing to the Garden State. The 10-year deal will begin in June 2013, a source familiar with the venture told CNN. Two sources said that Formula One, considered the world's premiere racing circuit, will be taking to the streets of Weehawken and West New York, New Jersey. The route of the race featuring open cockpit, high-tech cars traveling more than 200 mph would begin in Weehawken at the beginning of JFK Boulevard East and go north, with spectacular views of the Manhattan skyline as a backdrop, before turning right down 60th street in West New York to River Road where drivers would head south, back toward Weehawken. A press conference to announce the details of the deal will be held Tuesday in Weehawken. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Weehawken Mayor Richard Turner and West New York Mayor Felix Roque are expected to attend. The race course should be ideal for Formula One as it combines the sport's characteristic right turns and elevation changes and, unlike the auto racing most Americans are used to, generally features less passing and fewer crashes. Austin, Texas, meanwhile, will host the annual United States Grand Prix for the sport beginning November 2012 and continuing through 2021 -- making it the first U.S. city in 30 years to have a multi-year deal with Formula One. The last U.S. city to have such a deal was Watkins Glen, New York. Since then, Formula One has been hosted by Long Beach, Las Vegas, Detroit, Dallas and Phoenix all on temporary street circuits. Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for Christie, said the governor expects Formula One's arrival to bring ""a significant economic and tourism boom for our state.""","Formula One will begin in New Jersey in 2013, sources say .

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's electoral commission is not able to conduct the country's elections this year unless it gets a cash injection from the government, a state-owned weekly newspaper reported Sunday. The commission was only given $8.5 million by the country's treasury, Zimbabwe Electoral Commission Chairman Simpson Mutambanengwe said, according to the Sunday Mail. ""We're barely surviving. There is no money."" Earlier this month, representatives of President Robert Mugabe's Zanu PF party and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change party agreed that it would not be possible to have elections this year. But last week, Mugabe's party called for general elections this year to end the country's two-year-old coalition government. Mugabe has repeatedly called for elections to take place this year. Tsvangirai has said elections must be held only after democratic reforms -- including having a new constitution in Zimbabwe -- are completed. Under the power-sharing agreement that Tsvangirai and Mugabe signed in 2008, Zimbabwe is supposed to have a new constitution before general elections are held. Drafting a new constitution has been marred by lack of funds, interparty violence and disagreements between Mugabe's and Tsvangirai's parties. As a result, a referendum on the new constitution that was supposed to have been held last November was set for September of this year. But with the election commission indicating that it has no money to run polls, the date might be pushed further. Mugabe, a guerrilla leader who was hailed as a hero of Zimbabwe's freedom struggle when he came to power three decades ago, has established himself over the years as one of Africa's most ruthless dictators. However, his power has weakened as evidenced in the 2008 election. Tsvangirai won that vote, but Mugabe refused to cede power. He agreed to form a unity government with Tsvangirai and Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Mutambara after African regional leaders refused to recognize the legitimacy of a runoff.","""We're barely surviving,"" the electoral commission chairman says .

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal judge has again temporarily blocked enforcement of key parts of a tough immigration law in Alabama. The ruling Wednesday is a partial victory for both sides. The Justice Department had brought suit against state officials to block the law, but Alabama was given the power to enforce some controversial sections. Other opponents of the measure -- including state church leaders and the American Civil Liberties Union -- had asked U.S. Judge Sharon Lovelace Blackburn to stop the law, which had been scheduled to go into effect last month. ""There is a substantial likelihood that the United States will succeed on the merits of its claim that (parts of the law) are pre-empted by federal law,"" Blackburn wrote. ""The court further finds that the United States will suffer irreparable harm if these sections of HB 56 are not enjoined"" from taking effect. The ruling means certain parts of the law cannot be enforced until a hearing on the larger issues raised in the appeal are resolved, a process that may take several months at least, and may ultimately have to be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court. At issue is whether HB 56 intrudes on the federal government's power over all immigration matters. State officials argue the law would help Alabama and not violate civil rights. The court upheld a section of the Alabama law requiring that police ""attempt to determine the immigration status of a person who they suspect is an unauthorized alien of this country,"" according to an Alabama House of Representatives fact sheet. That provision is similar to other laws aiming to crack down on illegal immigration passed by other state legislatures over the past year. But Blackburn blocked the following provisions from being enforced: . --One saying undocumented aliens in the state are not allowed to ""knowingly apply for work, solicit work in a public or private place, or perform work as an employee or independent."" --One banning the ""concealing, harboring, transporting, etc., of unlawfully present aliens."" --One prohibiting employers from ""taking of a state tax deduction for wages paid to an unauthorized alien."" But the Alabama law also includes more expansive measures, including requiring the state to check immigration status of students in public schools, that the judge allowed to go into effect for the time being. During court hearings earlier this summer in Birmingham, Alabama, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center argued the public school portion of the law is unconstitutional. Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange told the judge at the hearing the law would not prevent undocumented immigrants from having access to public school education. Strange also argued that the law is not an anti-immigrant measure, and that the state welcomes visitors. The judge in late August had issued a preliminary injunction against enforcement, saying she needed more time to decide the complex legal questions raised. In August, leaders from the Episcopal, Methodist and Catholic churches of Alabama separately sued Alabama's governor, its attorney general and a district attorney over HB 56. On Wednesday, bishops from two of those churches welcomed the decision to block the provision preventing the harboring or transporting of undocumented aliens, releasing a joint statement saying it ""protects our churches' ministries from prosecution under this over-reaching law, and substantially protects our religious liberties."" ""We will continue to provide food, shelter, transportation, housing, and the church's sacraments to all of God's people, regardless of race, class, or citizenship status,"" said the statement from Bishop Henry N. Parsley Jr. of the Episcopal Church's Alabama Diocese and Bishop William H. Willimon of the United Methodist's North Alabama Conference. But Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley, who signed the law in June, said after Wednesday's ruling that ""Judge Blackburn upheld the majority of our law and temporarily -- and I say temporarily -- enjoined in four sections. In those parts that were upheld we have the strongest immigration law in this country."" He said law would not have been needed ""if the federal government would have done its job and enforced the laws dealing with this problem. However, they have failed to do that."" And he added, ""This law was never designed to hurt fellow human beings."" Republican Alabama state Rep. John Merrill told CNN in June that the legislation would be ""good for Alabama"" because it would reduce illegal immigration to the state and ""provide equal opportunities for all people who want to come to Alabama legally."" ACLU attorney Andre Segura noted the complexity of Alabama's law compared with other state measures. The Mexican government had also appealed, arguing the law would promote racial profiling, targeting Hispanics especially. Alabama's law is considered the strictest in the nation. Key portions of Arizona's immigration reform law have also been blocked while a federal appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court consider various challenges. The Alabama case is U.S. v.

"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (CNN) -- Officials are forcing the 25-year-old model who won the Dominican Republic's top beauty pageant to hand over her crown, saying she violated contest rules when she hid her marriage. Pageant organizers claim Carlina Duran had been married since 2009 but told Miss Dominican Republic contest organizers she was single. Contestants in the pageant cannot be married or divorced, organizers said. The runner-up in last week's Miss Dominican Republic contest, Dulcita Lieggi, will represent the Caribbean nation in the Miss Universe pageant, organizers said. Dominicans were divided over the pageant's decision. ""If there is an established rule, and it comes out that she is married, she is violating the rule,"" said Rafael Concepcion. On Duran's official Facebook page, fans lamented the move. Dari Baez said taking away Duran's crown was unfair. ""She already won it,"" Baez said. Beauty queens from dozens of countries are scheduled to compete in the Miss Universe pageant in Las Vegas in June.

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI visited the main Jewish synagogue in Rome on Sunday, a trip that unfolded amid heightened tension between Catholics and Jews. Benedict was the first pope in 24 years to visit the Tempio Maggiore, or Great Temple. He called on Catholics and Jews to keep an open dialogue and work together to tackle problems, such as poverty and disease. ""As Moses taught ... and as Jesus affirms in the Gospel, all of the commandments are summed up in the love of God and loving-kindness towards one's neighbor,"" the pope said, according to a Vatican transcript. ""This rule urges Jews and Christians to exercise, in our time, a special generosity towards the poor, towards women and children, strangers, the sick, the weak and the needy."" Christians and Jews ""share to a great extent a common spiritual patrimony,"" but ""often remain unknown to each other,"" he said. ""It is our duty, in response to God's call, to strive to keep open the space for dialogue, for reciprocal respect, for growth in friendship, for a common witness in the face of challenges of our time, which invite us to cooperate for the good of humanity ..."" The visit to Rome's synagogue is part of what should be an annual Catholic Day of Dialogue With Judaism, but it didn't happen last year. The Vatican had reinstated an ancient prayer calling for the conversion of the Jews, decades after it was shelved as part of 1960s-era reforms. Italy's Jewish community pulled out of the 2009 Day of Dialogue in protest. The Vatican smoothed feathers by re-wording the prayer. But then it revoked the ex-communication of a renegade bishop, Richard Williamson, who turned out to be a Holocaust denier. Benedict apologized and visited Israel. Then he moved Holocaust-era Pope Pius XII a step closer to sainthood. That rankled the Jewish community in Rome, where Nazis rounded up Jews on Pope Pius XII's watch, said Lisa Palmieri-Billig, the American Jewish Committee's liaison to the Holy See. The Vatican says Pius XII worked behind the scenes to save Jews from the Holocaust, but it has refused to open archives from his tenure to show proof. It also says a papal statement outlining the late pontiff's heroic virtues was not meant to offend Jews. Jewish groups have called on the Vatican to open its archives on Pius XII. The Holy See says scholars eventually will be able to examine the paperwork, but not for several more years because of how long it is taking to catalogue and organize. Riccardo Pacifici, president of the Rome Jewish Community, reiterated calls during Sunday's service for the Vatican to open the archives. ""The silence of Pius XII still hurts today as an opportunity missed,"" he said. The pope might not have been able to stop the Nazi deportation trains, Pacifici said, but he could have conveyed solidarity and comfort simply by speaking out. He acknowledged the church's role in helping save some lives and noted that Catholic nuns saved his father during World War II. During his address, Benedict recalled his 2006 visit to the Auschwitz concentration camp. ""The rulers of the Third Reich wanted to crush the entire Jewish people,"" the pontiff said. He said many Catholics helped Jewish fugitives whom the Nazis were ""hunting down"" for deportation to concentration camps. He also said the Vatican provided help -- ""often in a hidden and discreet way."" Yet the pope acknowledged that others remained indifferent. He said the Catholic Church has deplored the failings of its adherents, begged forgiveness for actions that ""contributed to the scourge of anti-Semitism and anti-Judaism,"" and looked forward to warmer relations between Catholics and Jews. ""May these wounds be healed forever,"" he said. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report .","NEW: Pope Benedict XVI visits the main Jewish synagogue in Rome, Italy, on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- If director Ron Howard hopes religious controversy will help sell tickets to ""Angels & Demons"" the way it boosted his ""Da Vinci Code,"" the Catholic Church is not playing along with his script. Tom Hanks reprises his role as professor Robert Langdon in ""Angels & Demons."" Howard, who premiered the follow-up in Rome, Italy, this week, said there was ""residual antagonism from 'The Da Vinci Code,' "" but Vatican officials ignored the movie by not responding to suggestions that the church was offended. The first movie based on Dan Brown's mega-selling novels earned $750 million worldwide in 2006. ""The Da Vinci Code"" was intensely criticized by Catholics, especially those from the Opus Dei organization, a small but influential group within the Catholic Church whose members felt that they were vilified in the story. An Opus Dei priest who teaches history and literature at Holy Cross University in Rome said that ""Angels & Demons"" has ""simply not been an issue"" among those in the Vatican and that any controversy is a product of the movie's marketing machine.  Watch Howard make his statements » . ""To be honest, I don't think that anyone at the Vatican is paying much attention to the premier of the 'Angels & Demons,' "" Father John Wauck said. ""I was just talking with some people yesterday, I know friends of mine working in the Vatican, and they were surprised to learn that the movie was premiering in Rome. They had no idea."" ""I think the church's attitude has been, from the beginning, 'hands off,' "" Wauck said. ""Especially, I think, after what happened with 'The Da Vinci Code.' "" The new movie is not as offensive, Wauck said. ""In 'The Da Vinci Code,' there were serious issues, such as who Jesus Christ was or the nature of church in the course of history, but none of them is taken in 'Angels & Demons.' It's simply, you know, a thriller,"" he said. The movie may even help Rome by promoting tourism there, which is ""not a bad thing,"" Wauck said. But Howard suggested to CNN's Neil Curry that controversy has carried over to the sequel. ""I think there's some residual antagonism from 'The Da Vinci Code,' "" Howard said. Stirring people up with controversy is ""something that appeals to me,"" he said. ""Part of the entertainment value is that people are going to go in there and have something to talk about or think about afterward,"" he said. Howard said he tried to reach out to the Catholic Church. ""We've even invited certain groups, members of the church, for example, to see early rough cuts, because I wanted to share it with them and know what they thought, and I felt they'd find it not as offensive as they'd imagine,"" he said. ""Everyone's declined to do that."" Howard himself downplayed reports that Rome and Vatican officials hampered production by refusing permission to film in certain locations. ""Probably a little more has been made of that,"" he said. ""While I don't want to reveal how we took people on the 'Angels & Demons' tour and on the adventure, someday I might, maybe on the DVD or something, do a little better breakdown of how we got the shots we needed,"" he said. Producers did resort to some ""low-budget street photography where you just pull up in a car, getting out of a van, clearing a little space and shooting a shot,"" Howard said. This controversy, Wauck said, was also cooked up by the film's marketing department. ""As a general rule, no commercial films are filmed in churches in Rome, and no exception was made for 'Angels & Demons,' "" Wauck said. The film, which like ""The Da Vinci Code"" stars Tom Hanks as symbolism professor Robert Langdon, takes the audience inside the Conclave, where cardinals meet secretly to choose a new pope. ""One thing that was important to me and to all of us was to be as authentic as we possibly could be about what Conclave was like, that period when they're trying to elect the pope,"" Howard said. ""It's a complete mystery. Outsiders are not allowed in. They stop rolling even their own Vatican archival footage when they lock the cardinals into the Sistine Chapel."" Set designers used old paintings and photos to recreate the scene, he said. ""I wanted to represent for the audience that with as much detail as I did going to the moon with 'Apollo 13,' "" he said, referring to his 1995 movie about the aborted space mission. ""Angels & Demons"" is the second of Brown's Langdon novels Howard has turned into a film. ""There are so many reasons to do it, and when I really looked at 'Angels & Demons' and realized that it was going to feel different,"" he said. ""It was going to sound different. It was going to be paced in a completely different way because this is a real bona fide thriller. This is Langdon in jeopardy. There's a ticking bomb. You know, it's a murder mystery."" Howard said he will wait to decide whether he will make a movie based on Brown's third Langdon novel. ""While I haven't read Dan's next installment of the Robert Langdon adventures, I'm dying to,"" he said. ""I'll also look to see how audiences respond to 'Angels & Demons.' They're going to tell us a lot."" ""Angels & Demons"" opens in U.S. theaters May 15.

"Greensboro, North Carolina (CNN) -- John Edwards knew that a wealthy benefactor was giving money to help cover up his affair with Rielle Hunter, a former speechwriter testified Tuesday during the corruption trial of the former presidential candidate. Prosecutors say the North Carolina Democrat used donor funds to hide Hunter and their daughter, Quinn, in an effort to keep his candidacy viable. Edwards broke federal law, they allege, by accepting about $725,000 from heiress Rachel ""Bunny"" Mellon for that purpose and more than $200,000 from Fred Baron, a now-deceased Texas lawyer who was his finance chairman. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Wendy Button, the former speechwriter, said she worked with Edwards during the summer of 2009, helping him craft a statement admitting paternity for Hunter's child. Attorney: Donor knew money wasn't for Edwards' campaign . ""While I never asked Fred Baron to spend a dime, I stood by and watched him support Quinn,"" he said in an early draft, Button testified. Edwards changed that line to then read: ""Some people without my knowledge supported Quinn,"" she said. And when he released the final statement in January 2010, any mention of financing for the cover-up was taken out altogether. Edwards told his former speechwriter he did not find out the other donor, Mellon, was sending checks until much later, Button testified. Edwards faces six felony courts, including conspiracy and making false statements. The defense team for the former U.S. senator has argued that Andrew Young, an Edwards aide, had largely used the money for his own personal gain while also paying for Hunter's medical expenses during her pregnancy to hide the affair from Edwards' wife. Donations for that purpose, the Edwards team has argued, cannot be considered in violation of campaign finance laws. Young admitted during questioning that he used some donations for his own personal benefit -- particularly to fund construction of a home that included a pool and a theater. Last week: Daughter tearfully leaves courtroom during testimony . Earlier Tuesday, an Edwards donor testified that he told the Barack Obama campaign to believe rumors of Edwards' affair as early as June 2008. Prosecution witness Tim Toben, a developer and green energy entrepreneur, said during cross examination that during a dinner with Edwards, the candidate was optimistic about his chances of his being selected as Obama's running mate. The message from Edwards was that if he were to be offered the position, he would take it, Toben testified. The witness said he found the idea ""astonishing,"" given the then-rampant rumors of Edwards' affair and child with Hunter. After the dinner, Toben called the North Carolina director of the Obama campaign, he testified. He told it the reports about Edwards' affair were true and encouraged the campaign to vet the information thoroughly as it decided on its pick. Toben also testified about an alleged sex tape involving Edwards and Hunter, which will not be shown to the jury, and whether Young had ever suggested he wanted to sell it. Young thought about selling the video, but changed his mind, Toben said. Once a grand jury started an investigation into the events surrounding the affair, Toben sent an e-mail to Young, asking: ""Wonder what that tape is worth today?"" If convicted, Edwards could face up to 30 years behind bars.","NEW: Edwards knew benefactor was giving money to hide affair, speechwriter testifies .

"(CNN) -- The spiraling conflict between the Sudans has exacerbated issues for tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees who are desperate for water and facing the threat of fatal diseases, an international aid organization says. As South Sudan and Sudan continue to battle over border and oil issues, 37,000 refugees in South Sudan's Jamam camp are running out of time, Oxfam said. ""There is simply not enough ground water available to sustain the growing number of people who need it,"" said Pauline Ballaman, head of Oxfam's operations at the camp. ""Women have to queue for hours in the burning sun just to collect a fraction of the water they need, and the situation is getting more desperate by the day. The only solution is for people to be moved urgently."" Oxfam says this large number of refugees fled to the camp since December and more are on their way. South Sudan split from Sudan last year as part of a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of war in Africa's largest nation. The war left 2 million people dead and ended with the peace agreement that included an independence referendum for the south. Despite the split in July, unresolved issues remain between the two, including status of their citizens, division of national debt, disputed border areas and sharing of oil wealth. Simmering tensions peaked this month when South Sudan seized the oil-producing region of Heglig from Sudan, raising the stakes by targeting a resource that fuels the economies of both nations. Heglig oil facilities account for about half of Sudan's production of 115,000 barrels a day. Sudan claims ownership for the region, and lodged complaints with the United Nations and the African Union to pressure South Sudan to withdraw troops from its territory. A day after South Sudan withdrew from the disputed region, it accused Sudan of launching ground and aerial attacks on its territory.","37,000 people need to be moved urgently, Oxfam says .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The widow and mother-in-law of a man killed by a CIA contractor last year were found dead Monday in Lahore, Pakistan, police said. Zohra, the widow of Faizan Haider, and her mother were shot in a family dispute at their home, said police Inspector Javed Siddiqui. The bodies were sent to a hospital for an autopsy, and authorities were seeking a suspect, he said. Haider was one of two men killed in Lahore in January 2011 by Raymond Davis, an American CIA contractor. The deaths sparked a diplomatic tussle that strained relations between the United States and Pakistan. Davis said he shot the two in self-defense when they attempted to rob him at gunpoint as he drove through a busy Lahore neighborhood, but authorities at the time called the case ""clear-cut murder."" He was charged with murder and illegal possession of a firearm, but was released after more than $2 million in compensation was paid to the victims' families, according to Pakistani officials. The killings caused outrage in Pakistan, a key U.S. ally in the war against al Qaeda and Taliban militants in neighboring Afghanistan. And it heightened tension between the two nations, with Congress warning Pakistani leaders that billions of dollars in U.S. aid could be jeopardized without Davis' release. Davis appeared in a Lahore court after the payment was made and was acquitted of the charges in accordance with an Islamic practice known as diyat, or compensation. Diyat, enshrined in Pakistan's penal code, allows victims to pardon a murderer with or without being paid ""blood money."" Haider's widow submitted an affidavit to court stating she had pardoned Davis after the payment. The heirs of Fahim Shamshad, Davis' other victim, also received payment, Rana Sanaullah, the provincial law minister of Punjab province, said at the time.","The widow and mother-in-law of Faizan Haider are found dead .

"New York (CNN) -- The space shuttle Enterprise, mounted atop a 747 jumbo jet, swooped across the New York City skyline on Friday before touching down at the city's John F. Kennedy International Airport, bringing an end to its final flight. It took off from Virginia's Dulles International Airport with a flight plan that included fly-bys of the Statue of Liberty and other Gotham landmarks. It is ultimately bound for its new home at the city's Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum. ""This is going to be the largest NASA artifact north of Baltimore in the entire Northeast region,"" said Susan Marenoff-Zausner, the Intrepid's president. ""For kids to be able to come and see this when they'd have to travel miles and miles to go somewhere else, it's right in their back yard."" The space agency said it will put the shuttle on a barge in a few weeks and float it up the Hudson River to its final home. ""It's the end of one era, but I think it's the beginning of another era,"" said space historian Andrew Chaikin. ""The shuttle was amazing but it's not sustainable. And above all, we need a space program that can do great things in a sustainable way."" Share your shuttle photos, videos with CNN iReport . The shuttle, which has been on display at a Smithsonian Institute museum near Washington, is the latest to shift locations as NASA sends its fleet into retirement. Discovery -- the most traveled of the shuttles -- is replacing Enterprise in the Smithsonian facility. Completed in 1976, Enterprise was designed as a prototype test vehicle. Test pilots demonstrated that it could fly and land in the atmosphere like airplanes, but the Enterprise never flew in space. ""It's a very gratifying feeling for someone who's devoted their career to test flying like myself and all the other astronauts,"" said former Air Force Maj. Gen. Joe Engle, who commanded one of two flight crews that manned the Enterprise during test flights in 1977. ""To get a flight in a space shuttle is just the culmination of your entire professional career."" The shuttle was originally to be named the Constitution, but a write-in campaign by fans of the television series ""Star Trek"" persuaded officials to rename it in honor of the show's main starship. NASA sent the shuttle on a tour of Europe and Canada in 1983, and it also appeared in the 1984 World's Fair in New Orleans. The craft made a brief return to service as a ground test vehicle in 1984 before retiring to the Smithsonian's collection in 1985. NASA is preparing to fly space shuttle Endeavour to Los Angeles sometime in the second half of the year. Atlantis is being readied for display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida.

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- Anders Behring Breivik, who admits killing 77 people in Norway last summer, gave chilling details at his trial Friday of the gun rampage in which he systematically shot dead scores of young people. Without apparent emotion, he recounted firing more bullets into teenagers who were injured and so couldn't escape, killing those who tried to ""play dead"" and driving others into the sea to drown. Some survivors and relatives of victims in the courtroom wept as they listened to his detailed account of the attack on a youth camp on Utoya Island in which 69 people died. Breivik is on trial on charges of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror in the July 22 attacks. He admits carrying out the Utoya attack and a bombing in Oslo that killed eight people. He boasts of being an ultranationalist who killed his victims to fight multiculturalism in Norway. Breivik told the court he had made use of lessons learned from al Qaeda in planning his attacks, and was inspired by the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center bombings. He said one other person knew of his planned attacks, but did not say who that was. Breivik recounted how he had arrived on Utoya Island by ferry, posing as a police officer and telling security officers on the island he was there to talk to them about the bomb attack. He told the court he had said to himself, just before he started shooting, ""I just don't want to do this."" But then, he said, he thought, ""It is now or never."" He considered for a minute, as ""100 voices in his head said don't do it."" Then he picked up his gun and started shooting. His first victim was the lone policeman on the island, Breivik said, whom he shot in the back of the head. The second was the manager on the island. Describing a scene of chaos at a cafe on the island, Breivik told how he shot young people who were paralyzed and could not run away in the head. He also tried to drive young people into the chilly waters around the island so he did not have to shoot them all, he said. He was shouting, ""You shall all die today, Marxists,"" to scare people into the water, he said. He then fired at boats that ventured out to try to save some of those in the water, to frighten them away, he said. Breivik repeatedly tried to call a police chief to give himself up, but no senior officer spoke to him or called him back, he told the court. Concluding that the police did not want him to surrender, he decided to carry on shooting until he was shot himself, he said. Near the end of his rampage, he spared the lives of a girl and boy that he thought were obviously younger than 16, Breivik said, telling how the boy had burst into tears. Asked why he had aimed at the head in so many cases, he said it was ""natural"" when ""the goal is to kill."" The first two killings were the hardest, he said. ""I knew it was wrong. Taking life is the most extreme action you can do."" Breivik insists the deaths were justified by his mission but told the court he was in a ""fight or flight"" mode that meant the normal ""ethical checks"" in his brain seemed to have switched off. A grim silence, broken only by sobs, filled the courtroom as those present heard his account, some of it in militaristic language. Breivik earlier said he picked up the idea of wearing a police uniform for the gun massacre on Utoya Island from reading al Qaeda's online ""magazine"" for followers. He followed al Qaeda closely from 2006 to 2011 and studied the terror network's ""media effect, what they have done wrong, what they have done right ... what it takes,"" Breivik said. He told the court he had gained tips from watching documentaries on the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Breivik also described how he had taught himself to switch off his emotions as prosecutors quizzed him on whether he felt empathy for others. ""You ask if I have empathy and emotion. ... You could say I was pretty normal until 2006 when I started training ... desensitizing myself through meditation,"" Breivik said. ""It's about atrocity, barbaric acts. I cannot even fathom what it must sound like to others. I have tried to distance myself from it,"" he said, speaking of his own actions. Prosecutors sought to uncover the roots of Breivik's ideas in earlier questioning Friday. Breivik told the court the issue at stake was freedom of speech, and how nationalists ""have been excluded since the Second World War."" He was driven to violence after trying unsuccessfully to get his views on multiculturalism heard, he said. ""I had tried all peaceful means. I have personally found that this was futile. I tried to engage myself politically ... write essays and get through to the editors. ... Then there was only one possibility, that was violence,"" Breivik said. Asked if he considered his terror attacks to be cowardly, Breivik said it would probably have been ""most honorable"" to challenge Norway's military to a duel. ""But when you are up against a massive strength, one is forced to do asymmetric warfare, and the only thing you have then is the element of surprise,"" he said. His attorney, Geir Lippestad, had warned that Friday's testimony, with its focus on the Utoya killings, was likely to be ""the toughest day."" Breivik told the court Thursday that he decided to carry out the gun attack on a Labour Party youth camp on Utoya after his initial plan to target a journalists' conference did not work out. He also hoped to kill former Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and decapitate her with a knife or bayonet, he said. He planned to film the murder on his iPhone and upload the video to the Internet, he said. Breivik used the video game ""Modern Warfare 2"" as training for his shooting, he testified. Players of the game, one of the ""Call of Duty"" series, work together as soldiers to shoot opponents. He also went through a period of playing the online fantasy game ""World of Warcraft"" up to 16 hours a day, he testified. The trial is expected to last up to 10 weeks. Breivik's testimony, which is not being broadcast due to a court ruling, follows his declaration Monday that he carried out the massacre but was not guilty because the killings had been ""necessary."" Breivik said in court Wednesday that he should either get the death penalty or be acquitted, ridiculing the idea that he would be sent to prison or a mental hospital for his actions. Norway does not have the death penalty. He boasted Tuesday that he had carried out ""the most sophisticated and spectacular political attack in Europe since World War II"" when he went on his gun-and-bomb rampage. Lippestad said it was important to his client that people see him as sane. Experts have given different opinions about Breivik's sanity, which will be a factor in determining what punishment he receives if convicted. Sentencing options could include imprisonment or confining him to a mental facility. Most of the victims' relatives did not want Breivik's remarks televised, and presiding Judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen rejected Breivik's claim that airing it was a human right. Court papers indicated the five judges hearing the case did not want the trial to become a platform for Breivik to air his political views, or for them to distract from the legal issues involved. Breivik has said his rampage was meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and to prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians. In a 1,500-page manifesto attributed to him, Breivik railed against Muslim immigration and European liberalism -- including the ruling Labour Party, which he said was allowing the ""Islamification of Europe.""

"(CNN) -- After battling government forces, a Maoist guerrilla group in Peru has released 36 hostages it captured earlier this week, state media reported Saturday. Peru's Defense Ministry said that 1,500 government troops had encircled members of the Shining Path in southern Peru, the state-run news agency Andina reported. This action prompted the release of the hostages, who were identified as oil and gas workers. Masked attackers had kidnapped dozens of workers in the town of Kepashiato early Monday morning, Andina reported earlier. It is not clear if all of the hostages have been released and are now safe. A police captain was killed and two people were injured during a search operation Thursday, when suspected rebels opened fire on a military helicopter, Peru's government ombudsman said in a statement. The Maoist guerrillas had demanded $10 million in ransom for the hostages, in addition to explosives and weapons. But government officials said they would not not negotiate with terrorists, calling the effort to locate and secure the release of the kidnapped workers a top priority. Some of the hostages were employees of the international construction company Skanska, according to Andina. A company spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment. The kidnapping comes after authorities' recent announcements that they had significantly dismantled and defeated the rebel group. At its peak, the Shining Path spread terror in the country through a bombing campaign that targeted buildings and key infrastructure, such as electricity towers. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Peruvian government fought a campaign that greatly reduced the capacity of the group. After Peruvian authorities captured a longtime leader of the group in February, President Ollanta Humala said the group was ""no longer a threat to the country.""","A Maoist guerrilla group in Peru releases 36 hostages it captured this week, state media reports .

""My brother was a loving brother, caring citizen,"" his sister, Annette Seau, said as she asked journalists to respect the family's privacy. ""I know you guys will overblow this."" Seau was charged with domestic violence against his 25-year-old live-in girlfriend in October 2010 after police were called to his home. Hours after that arrest, he drove his car off a cliff and landed on the beach in Carlsbad, California. Police later concluded it was an accident caused by lack of sleep.

"(CNN) -- Kenyan-born Briton Chris Froome won a pivotal seventh stage of the Tour de France Saturday as his teammate Bradley Wiggins took over in the race leader's yellow jersey. Froome, a noted climber, showed his ability on a steep finish at La Planche des Belles Filles after 199km from Tomblaine. Despite setting a relentless pace in the final two kilometers, Froome still had the reserves to sprint past defending Tour de France champion Cadel Evans and finish two seconds clear on the line. Australia's Evans came in second with Team Sky leader Wiggins on his wheel, the race favorite replacing Fabian Cancellara in first place in the overall standings. BMC star Evans is 10 seconds back in second with Vincenzo Nibali of Italy (Liquigas) a further six seconds adrift. Nibali came in fourth on the stage with Rein Taaramae of Estonia a fine fifth for Cofidis. The globalization of the Tour de France . But on the final climb a number of other leading contenders lost more time as Team Sky, with Michael Rogers, Richie Porte and then Froome, set a ferocious pace at the front. Froome, who finished second in last year's Tour of Spain, has moved up to ninth in the standings after his magnificent ride and will be left to regret the time he lost to a puncture on an earlier stage. He will be a key support rider for Wiggins, who is bidding to become the first British rider to win cycling's most famous race. ""We're in the driving seat,"" Wiggins told Eurosport. ""We will look to consolidate over the next couple of days, but just to be in the yellow, that is something to be savored. It was a childhood dream of mine."" But he warned that Evans will remain a threat with the race still to enter the high mountains of the Alps and Pyrenees. ""You can never underestimate him, he is an incredible champion. He fought every step and he's never going to give up."" Sunday sees a 157.5km stage from Belfort to Porrentruy in Switzerland, featuring seven categorized climbs, but Wiggins and Evans will probably look to Monday's 41.5km time-trial to Besancon lock horns again in the battle for overall honors.

"Washington (CNN) -- Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's survival in a recall election sparked by steps to weaken public unions could embolden fellow Republicans in other states to seek similar measures. ""He's one of the Republican governors who has been out on the point on this issue about whether there are excesses in public employee unions in terms of their pension plans or health care plans and so forth,"" noted CNN senior political analyst David Gergen, calling the topic a ""very, very hot issue"" across the country. At least 19 states have passed or considered legislation involving collective bargaining rights in the past two years, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The Wisconsin recall effort was spurred by a Walker-backed Republican measure, signed into law in March 2011, to limit the collective bargaining rights of state worker unions. During a bitter fight over the law last year, Democratic legislators left the capital to prevent a quorum, and tens of thousands of protesters converged on the State Capitol building in what became an occupation. After the law was signed, Democrats and their labor allies immediately began a recall effort that eventually led to Tuesday's vote. The AFL-CIO in Wisconsin, which worked in favor of the recall, defended the effort to oust Walker. ""We wanted a different outcome, but Wisconsin forced the governor to answer for his efforts to divide the state and punish hardworking people,"" the group said in a statement. ""Their resolve has inspired a nation to follow their lead and stand up for the values of hard work, unity, and decency that we believe in. We hope Scott Walker heard Wisconsin: Nobody wants divisive policies."" Democrats complained that Walker benefited from a huge spending advantage due to tens of millions of dollars for his cause brought in from outside the state. Voters were inundated with campaign ads and door-to-door canvassing in the fierce battle, which was cited for increasing political intolerance in Wisconsin. To Tim Phillips of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group that pumped more than $10 million into the state backing Walker's policies, the recall campaign sent a message that the Republican Party machine and its backers will help colleagues willing to take on the tough battles. ""I think every governor, every state legislator around the country is looking at Wisconsin, and they're going, 'OK, if I got the courage to stand up and do what I think is right to get my state moving again ... will someone have my back?' "" Phillips said before Tuesday's vote. ""And hopefully the answer is going to be, you bet."" Walker's message -- that state workers unions had too much power and were preventing necessary budget cuts -- resonated with voters, Gergen said. After spending a few days in Wisconsin during the campaign, ""I can tell you a lot of people, small business people in particular, were talking about that these unions are costing too much money,"" he added. ""And it was not about the ads. It was not about the ground game. It was people just deciding they couldn't afford it."" The victory by Walker is ""a substantial defeat for labor, for public employees unions, and a substantial victory for those who have been trying to curb them"" Gergen concluded. President Barack Obama easily won Wisconsin in 2008, but the Republican victory Tuesday now puts the state in play in the November general election, analysts agreed. Republican strategist Ari Fleischer noted Obama mostly stayed out of race that was so important to the labor movement. Obama publicly backed Walker's opponent, Democratic Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee, but neglected to stop in Wisconsin to campaign with him even though he was next door in Illinois last week. ""I have a hard time seeing big labor returning to Wisconsin this fall to put in a lot of effort for President Obama since he didn't show up there for them this year,"" said Fleischer, a CNN contributor. Gergen concurred, saying: ""If the president had gone in and been loyal to labor, I think labor would be more loyal to him. Whether he can count on them under these circumstances, I'm not sure."" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told reporters Wednesday there were ""mixed feelings"" about Obama's involvement. Asked if campaigning by the president would have made a difference, Trumka said he didn't know. ""This is just the opening shot of a battle that is going to go on until November,"" he said of the Tuesday vote. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, who chairs the Republican Governors Association, told CNN that Wisconsin voters were tired of continuous recall efforts by Democrats since the 2010 election that brought Walker to the governor's office. ""I think it was overreach by the labor unions,"" McDonnell said. ""This is the third recall. They tried a judge, legislators, and now governor, and I think people realize this is too much."" Democratic state Sen. Jon Erpenbach agreed, noting on CNN that ""people are sick of recalls in Wisconsin."" ""The exit polling shows that people in Wisconsin support public employees strongly, they support the right of collective bargaining,"" Erpenbach said. ""By sending Gov. Walker back to the governor's residence, obviously I think what people are saying is not so much about the policies, just that they've had it with recalls and they feel very strongly that removing Gov. Walker from office right now for what he's done isn't the right way to go."" Gergen warned Republicans, including certain presidential candidate Mitt Romney, to avoid overplaying the Wisconsin result by launching a broad attack on public unions. ""I think he can certainly give voice to a lot of the restlessness and resentments and that sort of thing that are stirring against some of the excesses in labor unions,"" Gergen said of Romney, ""but what I hope he does not do is declare war on public employee unions. I think that would be a terrible mistake. There are some things that need to be fixed, but we don't need a war."" Analysis: Wisconsin now tougher for Obama, but still uphill climb for Romney .

"(CNN) -- Germany's Andre Greipel powered to his first stage victory of this year's Tour de France Wednesday after his arch-rival Mark Cavendish was caught up in a crash near the finish in Rouen. Greipel took full advantage after being given a perfect lead out by his Lotto teammate Greg Henderson. The imposing Greipel came off the New Zealander's wheel to easily hold off Italian sprinter Alessandro Pettachi (Lampre) and Dutchman Tom Veelers of the Argos Shimano team. RadioShack's Fabian Cancellera kept the race leader's yellow jersey at the end of the 214 km stage from Abbeville. A mass pile-up less than three kilometers left Team Sky's Cavendish with cuts and bruises and ended the hopes of a number of other sprint contenders. Cavendish, who edged out Greipel to win the second stage Monday, rode slowly to the finish after the crash, having earlier beaten all his rivals for the green points jersey at an intermediate sprint at 140km.

""It's a really emotional victory for me, we worked hard for this and I think we deserved this,"" he told Eurosport. ""I didn't see the crash... it's not nice to see those pictures, but it's a part of racing and there was still a lot of quality guys there, so it's no problem for me.

Slovakia's Peter Sagan, winner of two stages on this year's Tour, finished fourth to keep the green jersey heading into the fifth stage over 196.5km from Rouen to Saint Quentin. Cancellara, who has maintained a seven second lead over race favorite, Team Sky's Bradley Wiggins, since the opening prologue stage Saturday, was relieved to have avoided the pile-up.

"(EW.com) -- You don't need to look very hard to find Neil Patrick Harris these days. The actor-slash-singer-slash-magician has hosted the Emmys, performed at the Oscars, and even headlined the World Magic Awards, which apparently are an actual thing. But despite his menagerie of ceremonial credits, the consummate entertainer admits that it's the Tony Awards -- which Harris is hosting for the third time on Sunday, June 10, on CBS -- that hold the dearest spot in his heart. ""I think the celebratory tone of it makes it my favorite show to host,"" says Harris, who previously celebrated Broadway's biggest night with successful hosting gigs in 2009 and 2011. ""In the Emmys and in observing the Oscars, it's a bunch of individuals that hardly know each other that all work in their own business bubbles, and I think the opposite is true on Broadway. Most everyone is a) thrilled to be there, b) even more thrilled to be nominated but c) and I think most importantly, they all know and are supportive of each other, so you end up with this great evening where it's not a lot of sour grapes."" With last year's ""Book of Mormon""-dominated telecast dabbling in irreverence, this year's ceremony should be noticeably more family-oriented, thanks in no small part to the heavy presence of a solid handful of mainstream plays representing one of the medium's best seasons in recent memory. Despite powerful performances, plays typically tend to get short shrift at the musical-focused Tonys â€” a foregone conclusion of the ceremony that Harris hopes to change this year. ""I'm really trying this year to figure out a way to get performances by plays somehow in the show,"" Harris tells EW. ""Every year you focus mostly on the musicals, because that's what's easier to put on the stage, like a three-and-a-half-minute number from 'Anything Goes.' But with so many amazing James Earl Joneses and Stockard Channings, we've got some amazing, monologue-talented people that I want to showcase the plays in a legitimate way."" Does that mean we'll be treated to a brief glimpse of Darth Vader and Rizzo in a monologue mash-up? (Most likely not, as that's an awful idea on my part.) But what we can expect on June 10 is a high-energy telecast that commemorates the best of the year on Broadway and cements Harris as a master master of ceremonies. ""The more content I end up doing, then the less time everyone gets to spend watching performances, and really, in addition to doling out awards, that's the reason you watch,"" says Harris, who last year sang a duet with Hugh Jackman, a group performance with the New York Philharmonic cast of ""Company"" and a full opening and closing number. ""Not to say I won't be around. I'm hoping for the watercooler-y moments when you have to pause and go back and rewatch. There will be a couple surprises!"" As we count down the days until we can see what NPH has up his sleeve at the Tony Awards, we'll just have to make do with his opening number from last year. See full story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Youngster Thibaut Pinot claimed the eighth stage of the Tour de France as Bradley Wiggins retained his overall lead for Team Sky. Pinot, from France, is the Tour's youngest rider at 22 and held on after hitting the front with 2km to go, despite the overall leaders desperately trying to hunt him down. Though Cadel Evans finished second to FDJ-Bigmat's Pinot, he wasn't able to shave off any of Bradley Wiggin's lead as the Briton preserved his ten second advantage. The stage was punctuated with another nasty crash as Spain's Olympic road race champion Samuel Sanchez came off his bike, suffering head and shoulder injuries that might prevent him from competing at London. ""It's a dream come true,"" Pinot told reporters, of his maiden stage win on what is his debut Tour. ""I just did the longest 10km of my life, I'll never forget it. I was quite scared when I heard the peloton had closed the gap to 50 seconds. ""But a lot of this is down to Jeremy (Roy). He did a lot of the preparation work for me, I can't thank him enough."" After Saturday's strong performance from Team Sky, which saw Wiggins take the yellow jersey and teammate Chris Froome win the stage, Wiggins survived a late attack on his lead. Evans, riding for the BMC team, and Italian Vincenzo Nibali, of Liquigas, cranked up the pressure in the final stages but Wiggins did enough to record the same time and keep his nose in front. And with Monday presenting the first of two individual time trials in a 41.5km stage from Arc-et-Senans to Besancon, Wiggins has the chance to put more distance between himself and the chasing pack. But the 32-year-old said: ""There is so much fuss made about them, but there's been another eight stages before then. You don't win the Tour on time trials alone. ""It's the race of truth, so you've got to have the legs ultimately. Anything's possible tomorrow. I try not to think too negatively, and just concentrate on my own race.""","Young Frenchman Thibaut Pinot claims the eighth stage of the Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- Police in Paris are searching for a self-proclaimed porn star suspected of killing and cutting up a university student in Canada, authorities in Montreal said Sunday. Police Cmdr. Ian LaFreniere said sightings of the suspect, 29-year-old Luka Rocco Magnotta, are being investigated in Paris, but that he could be anywhere. Montreal authorities on Saturday detailed the charges pending against Magnotta, accusing him of first-degree murder in the grisly killing and dismembering of the student and threatening, among others, Canada's prime minister. The search for him began after a severed hand and foot were mailed to the Ottawa headquarters of Canada's Liberal and Conservative parties, while a torso was discovered stuffed in a suitcase and tossed in the trash heap of a Montreal apartment building. What specific accusations he would face if he's captured became clearer Saturday, when police in Montreal released information from his arrest warrant. Besides murder, the charges include producing, distributing or possessing ""any obscene written matter, picture, model ... or other thing,"" mailing ""anything that is obscene, indecent, immoral or scurrilous,"" and ""improperly or indecently (offering) any indignity to a dead human body or human remains."" The accusations relate to the violent death of a Concordia University student from China. Lafreniere identified the victim Friday as 33-year-old Jun Lin. The Chinese consulate in Montreal said Lin was from the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Police believe Lin was killed and his body dismembered either on May 24 or 25 in a Montreal apartment. A 10-minute video showing what transpired was then posted online. ""We believe he filmed himself,"" Lafreniere said earlier this week of the suspect. ""It's gross ... This is a very deranged person. He is looking for attention and he got it, but not in a positive way."" According to a more detailed copy of the arrest warrant posted on the website of CNN affiliate CBC, the fifth charge of ""uttering threats"" accuses Magnotta of ""causing (Prime Minister) Stephen Harper and members of parliament to reasonably fear for their safety."" Harper is the leader of the Conservative party, one of the offices that had body parts mailed to it. Magnotta, who was born as Eric Clinton Newman and also uses the alias Vladimir Romanov, fled by plane from Montreal to Europe, Lafreniere has said. That prompted Interpol, the global police agency, to alert authorities in 190 countries. On Friday, police had indications that the suspect may have been aboard a flight traveling from Paris to Montreal. Yet there was no sign of him after a search of the plane, Lafreniere said. Having earlier indicated that Magnotta is good at disguising himself, the police commander said Saturday that the suspect could now be anywhere in Europe, though authorities haven't ruled out the possibility he may be back in Canada. Police described Magnotta as being 5 feet, 8 inches tall and about 135 pounds, with black hair and blue eyes. His name may not have been known before this week, but his digital footprints were large. He was notorious among online animal rights activists, who pegged him as a serial kitten killer who used cat carcasses in sexual acts. Suspect in body parts probe described as 'creepy' and a kitten-killer . A Facebook group started in December 2010 dubbed him the ""Vacuum Kitten Killer,"" after a video was posted on YouTube showing kittens being killed by suffocation and drowning. ""Members of this group have spent over a year searching for this individual, who we believe is also responsible for several videos where animals were killed,"" the group said Thursday. ""Information gathered by group members was passed on to the authorities in Canada, and we were informed that they were actively working on locating the person seen in the videos hurting animals."" Lafreniere has said police are aware of the animal abuse allegations. On what appears to be his own website, Magnotta defended himself as a victim of cyberstalking. ""Once and for all, I will set the record straight,"" he wrote. ""Many hoax websites are created using my image and name, posing as me to seem more believable in respect to the type of audience these website (sic) have, I feel I don't need to list them specifically but people need not be told, not to believe what they read and to take it as fact."" The website has writing in Arabic and Russian, and shows images of Magnotta half-naked and with lips in a distinct runway pout. Lafreniere from the Montreal police expressed confidence that Magnotta will be caught sooner or later -- predicting his desire for attention may be his downfall. ""This man uses the Web to glorify himself, and (authorities) hope this habit will lead to his capture,"" the police commander said Saturday. CNN's Paula Newton contributed to this report.","French authorities investigate a reported sighting of Luka Rocco Magnotta .

"Buenos Aires (CNN) -- Doctors have withdrawn medications and begun palliative care for a premature baby who survived hours in a morgue refrigerator in Argentina, state media reported. The baby's survival grabbed global headlines last month and prompted her parents to give her a new name: Luz Milagros, the Spanish words for light and miracles. But medical tests have determined that only 10% of 2-month-old Luz Milagros Veron's brain is functioning, her mother told reporters. ""Doctors say that she will not be a complete child. They decided to stop medicating her so that she doesn't suffer anymore,"" mother Analia Bouguet said, according to Argentina's state-run Telam news agency. Pronounced dead after her premature birth on April 3, the baby withstood more than 10 hours in a coffin inside a morgue refrigerator before being found alive. This week, Bouguet said that her family was keeping its faith that the baby would survive and that her brain would heal. ""She came out of death, she came out of a drawer and she is in another fight from which she is going to come out again,"" she said, according to Telam. Doctors decided not to perform surgery and to withdraw medications, but would keep the baby hydrated and on a ventilator, Telam reported. The baby was flown to Buenos Aires for neurological testing earlier this week. Before she was transported, doctors said she had suffered health complications after having seizures. Every, doctor, nurse and morgue worker who dealt with the baby at the hospital in northern Argentina where she was born has been suspended while authorities investigate, officials have said. In April, the hospital's director said proper protocol had been followed. The baby had no vital signs when she was born, hospital director Dr. Jose Luis Meirino said. The gynecologist on hand didn't find any signs of life, so he passed the baby to a neonatal doctor who also didn't find vital signs, Meirino said. The doctors observed the baby for a while, and only then pronounced her dead. Two morgue workers then put her body inside a little wooden coffin and placed it in the morgue. ""Up to that point, there were still no vital signs,"" the hospital director said. That night, Bouguet insisted on seeing her daughter's body. ""They put the coffin on top of a stretcher and we looked for a little crowbar to open it because it was nailed shut,"" father Fabian Veron told a local television station in April. ""It was nailed shut. I put the crowbar in there and started prying. I took a breath and took the lid off."" Bouguet approached the baby's body, touched her hand, and heard a cry, Veron said. Standing in front of a Buenos Aires hospital Wednesday, Bouguet asked for prayers for her daughter. ""She demonstrated that she is strong and for some reason God has kept her alive until now,"" she said, according to Telam. ""Everything that happened cannot be in vain.""","Medical tests show that only 10% of the baby's brain is functioning .

"Cairo (CNN) -- An Egyptian military court has sentenced an activist blogger critical of the army to three years in prison, and it did so without his lawyers present, a development that drew stiff condemnation by human rights groups. Maikel Nabil, who was sentenced Monday morning, had been arrested on March 28 and charged with defaming the army and spreading false information, according to his lawyer, Adel Ramadan. A general in charge of the ""Morale Affairs Directorate"" of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said on television that ""Nabil had used 'inappropriate language' and defamed the military, and that his calls for an end to military conscription would have a negative effect on the youth of Egypt,"" according to Human Rights Watch. Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said the sentence ""may be the worst strike against free expression in Egypt since the (Hosni) Mubarak government jailed the first blogger for four years in 2007."" His group, which issued a statement on the sentence, said Nabil's trial ""has serious implications for freedom of expression on the internet more generally and in particular the ability to expose military abuses."" ""The sentence is not only severe, but it was imposed by a military tribunal after an unfair trial,"" Stork said. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday that the U.S. government is ""deeply concerned"" about Nabil's sentence. ""This is not the kind of progress we're looking for,"" he said. Former State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Nabil's imprisonment ""calls into question whether a democratic transition is under way in Egypt."" Nabil's case is the latest in a series of incidents in which the post-Mubarak military regime has cracked down on protesters and other opponents. Hundreds of protesters calling for Mubarak's prosecution were forced to flee Cairo's Tahrir Square Saturday when scores of soldiers backed by armored personnel carriers launched a raid against them. Earlier in the week, several military officers took to the Internet, recording video statements accusing the chairman of the country's ruling council, Field Marshal Mohammed Tantawi, of protecting Mubarak from prosecution and of leading a counterrevolutionary movement. Nabil ran afoul of the army by blogging about claims of violence against protesters during the uprising earlier this year, including use of the Egyptian museum for torture, as well as virginity tests on females and the army supplying police with weapons, Ramadan told CNN. Nabil also claimed on his blog that he had been arrested, sexually assaulted and beaten by army intelligence forces, Ramadan said. Ramadan said neither Nabil nor his lawyers were present for the hearing in which his client was sentenced. Human Rights Watch, the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information and Ramadan said the military told defense attorneys that there would be no court session on the day he was sentenced. ""He was supposed to show up at court (on) Tuesday but we were tricked,"" Ramadan said. Human Rights Watch said the judge had announced last Wednesday that he would rule Sunday after defense lawyers finished their pleadings. Nabil's lawyers were told that no session would be held and the judge would rule on Tuesday. Ramadan told Human Rights Watch that when lawyers went to the court complex Monday ""they saw on the court roll that the court had already sentenced Nabil the day before."" The absence of lawyers violates the military code of justice, Ramadan and the groups said. The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information said Nabil's freedom was ""shackled and stolen."" ""This behavior raises suspicions and doubts on the fairness of the trial, not only for being a military trial for a civilian over his opinions, but in the context of the proceedings of similar trials against other civilians, considering the fact that the army refused to admit committing torture against Egyptian youth or apologize for this behavior,"" the group said in a statement. The human rights organizations that signed the statement said, ""We will not keep silent about torture or unfair trials, even if we wrote about these crimes on the walls in the streets."" ""An atmosphere of fear and obscurity is the last thing needed for a revolution to thrive, instead of openness, transparency and justice, for which Egyptians have struggled for so long and will not give in,"" the Arabic network statement said. President Hosni Mubarak resigned two months ago, a departure prompted by a grass-roots and popular uprising, and the military eventually took the reins of power. Human Rights Watch and the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information said the Egyptian news media has not been bold on covering reports of torture by the military over the past two months. ""Two news conferences by human rights lawyers in which torture victims testified -- a subject that independent newspapers and satellite TV stations usually cover -- received almost no coverage. Only a limited number of opinion writers in some newspapers and certain TV hosts have been willing to raise the issue of torture by the military,"" Human Rights Watch said. It criticized Gen. Ismail Etman, the Morale Affairs chief, for telling newspapers ""not to publish any articles/news/press releases/complaints/advertising/pictures concerning the armed forces or the leadership of the armed forces"" without consulting his directorate and military intelligence. ""State institutions, including the military, should never consider themselves above criticism,"" Stork said. ""It is only through a public airing of abuses and full accountability measures that Egypt can hope to transition away from past human rights violations.""","Blogger's lawyer says ""we were tricked""

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities have seen no change in the number of illegal immigration checks sought by local Arizona police and allowed under a state law partly upheld by a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, officials said Wednesday. In the first week after the high court upheld a portion of the controversial law, eight calls were made by Arizona law agencies inquiring into the immigration status of persons suspected of being in the United States illegally, said spokeswoman Amber Cargile of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Phoenix. Those eight phone calls ""resulted in the arrest of 38 aliens on immigration violations"" between June 25 and July 2, Cargile said. Texas uses license plate photos for enforcement . Comparison figures to the recent past or a year ago weren't immediately available, ""but our staff reports they continue to receive what they describe as a normal volume of calls from state and local law enforcement agencies,"" Cargile said in an e-mail response to a CNN inquiry. On June 25, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down key parts of the Arizona law that sought to deter illegal immigration, but let stand the controversial provision allowing police to check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws if ""reasonable suspicion"" exists that the person is in the United States illegally. Critics said that law opens the door to racial profiling. California Senate passes 'anti-Arizona' bill . The Phoenix Police Department and at least two sheriffs in Arizona told CNN that the law won't result in great change for their departments. But Tucson Police Chief Roberto Villasenor expressed concern in an interview after the ruling about whether his 950-officer agency has been dealt an ""impossible mandate."" The state law, SB 1070, allows citizens to sue his department or others if they fail to enforce federal immigration laws, the chief said. ""Just for my agency, it will be a huge workload, just making the calls and waiting for a response on what to do,"" the police chief of Arizona's second-largest city said.

"London (CNN) -- Queen Elizabeth II visited her husband, Prince Philip, on Wednesday in the London hospital where he is receiving treatment for a bladder infection. The Duke of Edinburgh, who will turn 91 on Sunday, was taken to King Edward VII hospital Monday after falling ill during the queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations over the weekend, including Sunday's rain-swept river pageant. He missed a pop concert held at Buckingham Palace on Monday and was absent from the queen's side for Tuesday's events, seen as the ceremonial climax of the jubilee festivities. They included a service of thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral, a carriage procession and a flypast at the palace. The queen did not speak to the media on her way into the hospital. Prince Andrew later joined his mother inside. The queen, who spent about 50 minutes at the hospital, had earlier attended a lunch with commonwealth leaders. A statement on the official British Monarchy website Wednesday said the Duke of Edinburgh's condition had ""improved considerably"" since he was admitted to the hospital. ""The treatment of his infection continues with antibiotics. He is likely to remain in hospital over the next few days. He is in good spirits,"" the statement said. Prince Edward, who visited Prince Philip's hospital room Tuesday, said his father was recovering but needed rest. He also said the Duke of Edinburgh had watched the day's proceedings on television. He is expected to remain under observation for several days. Prince Philip was ""disappointed"" not to take part in Tuesday's events, the queen's press secretary said in a statement Monday. CNN's Max Foster and Alexander Felton contributed to this report.","NEW: Queen Elizabeth II spent about 50 minutes visiting with her husband at a hospital .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A member of the Japanese doomsday cult responsible for the 1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway has been arrested after 17 years on the run, Tokyo police say. Naoko Kikuchi, 40, a follower of the Aum Supreme Truth Cult, was apprehended in the town of Sagamihara, a quiet residential area approximately 40 km west of the Japanese capital after a local resident tipped off police. During a rush-hour attack on the morning of March, 20 1995, cult members released sarin gas that led to the death of 13 people and sickened more than 5,500 commuters. Kikuchi has admitted to helping make the gas, which attacks the central nervous system, but was not aware how it would be used, Tokyo Metropolitan Police said. She was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. Before her arrest, she was living in a small, shabby house made out of rusted metal panels, local TV footage showed. Another resident, a 41-year-old man, was arrested for allegedly hiding the suspect. Police were tipped off early Sunday morning and made their arrest when Kikuchi returned home in the evening. They had recently doubled the reward available for information related to the suspects' whereabouts to 10 million yen ($125,000). Kikuchi was one of two remaining cult members wanted for their involvement in one of the most shocking acts of terrorism in Japan's history. Katsuya Takahashi. 54, is the only Aum follower involved in the attack still at large. Doomsday cult member surrenders to police in Japan . Another cult member Makoto Hirata, wanted for the murder of a notary official, unexpectedly turned himself in on New Year's Eve, stunning many in Japan. More than 200 members of the cult were convicted in the wake of the gas attack and 13, including Shoko Asahara, the cult's blind guru, were sentenced to death. However, no one has been executed. The cult now claims to be a benign religious group but at the height of its activities in the 1990s, it preached the world was coming to an end and that it must arm itself to prepare for various calamities. It had stockpiled weapons and the gas attack was part of what the group thought was an apocalyptic showdown with the government.

"(CNN) -- Syrian security forces were commanded to shoot unarmed protesters, according to military and security agency defectors interviewed by a human rights watchdog. Human Rights Watch said Saturday that they ""described receiving, and following, orders to shoot on protesters to disperse them."" Efforts to reach the Syrian government for comment were not immediately successful. The group said they interviewed eight soldiers and four members of the security agencies in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan who defected over the last four months of anti-government protests. ""The testimony of these defectors provides further evidence that the killing of protesters was no accident but a result of a deliberate policy by senior figures in Syria to use deadly force to disperse protesters,"" Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, quoted in the report. ""Syrian soldiers and officials should know that they too have not just a right but a duty to refuse such unlawful orders, and that those who deliberately kill or injure peaceful protesters will be subject to prosecution."" The claims coincide with ongoing assertions by Syrian activists that security personnel have assaulted unarmed protesters. The Syrian regime claims armed groups are responsible for the violence at the demonstrations, which erupted nationwide in mid-March. There was a flurry of deaths on Friday during nationwide protests. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, said 1,410 civilian and 348 members of army and security forces have been killed over the last four months. The people interviewed ""participated in the government crackdown in Daraa, Izraa, Baniyas, Homs, Jisr al-Shugur, Aleppo, and Damascus"" and witnessed ""the shooting and injury of dozens of protesters, and the arbitrary arrest and detention of hundreds."" All of those interviewed defectors said ""their superiors had told them that they were fighting infiltrators (mundaseen), Salafists, and terrorists. The defectors said they were surprised to encounter unarmed protesters instead, but still were ordered to fire on them in a number of instances,"" a Human Rights Watch report said. ""The defectors also reported that those who refused orders to shoot on protesters ran the risk of being shot themselves. One of the defectors reported seeing a military officer shoot and kill two soldiers in Daraa for refusing orders."" The United States and other countries have denounced Syria's tough crackdown on peaceful protests, and a visit to the restive city of Hama by the U.S. ambassador to Syria this week has drawn sharp criticism from the Bashar al-Assad regime. Government officials said Ambassador Robert Ford incited protest in Hama, a claim called ""absolute rubbish"" by State Department's spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. Syrian officials also claimed he didn't get proper permission to travel, an assertion also disputed by the United States. Hama has been the scene of large anti-government demonstrations and a crackdown this week by government forces. Syria's minister of Islamic Endowments was the latest to denounce Ford's presence in Hama, saying it was ""without prior permission considering that it was primarily intended to incite bloodshed and ruin the contacts designed to stop bloodshed and eliminate sedition,"" according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency. Citing remarks of Abdul-Sattar al-Sayyed, SANA said the ""U.S. ambassador wants Jerusalem to be an eternal capital of Israel, adding that the U.S. has always been against Arabism, Islam and values.""

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- While the election of a new French President will be making headlines around the world on Sunday night, it may well be that the Greek parliamentary election results -- marginal as they may be, obscure and hardly decipherable -- will turn out to be more important for the future of the EU and the euro. French voting might alter the core European policy mix. Voters in Athens will be sending out an SOS. What the exact results will be is very hard to tell. Experienced Greek pollsters fear their data might this time prove unreliable: People tend to fume anger instead of discussing politics when called for a poll. Their findings keep predicting, though, that the two ""establishment parties"" -- conservative New Democracy and socialist PASOK -- who have previously notched up 78% to 86% of the vote between them, might well lose almost one in two of their 2009 voters. Faithful voters who have never betrayed their allegiance to one of the two main political families, descendants of the Royalists and Republicans of the 19th century divide, are for the first time considering going against tradition. The left wing vote is expected to double, and extreme right wing votes may triple. Lackluster politicians who, overnight, turned from obscure backbenchers to leaders of new, radical, parties are dreaming of double-digit scores. And a gang of black-clad Nazi admirers who polled just 0.2% in 2009 is threatening to pass the 3% threshold and make a violent entry in parliament. There is a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu to all that. All elections in crisis hit countries, during the current Great Recession, from Iceland to Hungary and from Ireland to Portugal, have fallen under the same pattern: Government washed away, governing party defeated, extreme, nationalistic parties on the rise. Greece wouldn't be an exception. But it is not just a repeat. This time is different. Greece is the first country to head for elections with its economy not just in recession but in a full-on depression. Greece will have lost 20% of its pre-crisis GDP by the end of 2012. The economy has lost in 24 months a number of jobs equal to those created over the last decade, with unemployment over 21%. Labor costs are expected to fall by over 20% and the tax burden on labor income has become the highest among OECD countries. Was this the expected outcome of the austerity program attached to the bailout and applied by the euro-partners and the IMF two years ago? Not really. The recession was initially predicted by the IMF to be -7.5%. The rise in unemployment was under-predicted by half. Greece was supposed to have regained its credibility and return to the bond markets by early 2012 with its economy back on growth. A failure of predictions, mass impoverishment and destitution, a recession that leads to failure to meet fiscal targets, growing social unrest: Greece, the poster child of austerity as cure-cum-punishment, is becoming the clear proof of the recipe's shortcomings. How does that translate into politics? In all the previous cases of elections in these times of recession, the parties that were unlucky enough to be in power when the crisis struck were punished, and alternative governments that did carry on with fiscal adjustment replaced incumbent governments. It happened in all cases under IMF or joint IMF-EU programs from Reykjavik to Lisbon to Dublin. In the Greek case, for the very first time, we might see a disapproval of both governing and opposition parties. PASOK, the party in power when the country suffered its debilitating heart attack, will take a beating. But the alternative party, the conservatives, discredited by its pre-crisis record in power and doubly discredited by its participation in a coalition government implementing austerity measures, might be beaten too. The two of them, together might, and probably will have enough seats in parliament to form a coalition government, but their combined score will send a warning throughout Europe. Austerity and no growth, recession and unemployment, dictates from Brussels and Frankfurt and Berlin and no consensus building at home, carry a real risk of de-legitimizing not just the euro project but European democracies as such. It should be read as a democratic SOS. Not as a sign that the country does not acknowledge the fact that it is facing (alone, with Portugal) a true debt crisis and has a genuine need for fiscal adjustment, but as a sign that if Europe does not change its austerity dogma and invent new, more European, ways of decision making, even a small country like Greece, where 80% of the electorate still believes in the European project and the euro, recession will win over politics. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pavlos Tsimas.","Greek voters go to polls Sunday in first election since euro crisis .

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court sided with the government Monday, allowing the military to maintain its ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy during an appeal of a lower court ruling that the law barring openly gay and lesbian soldiers is unconstitutional. The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals means that the policy remains in place while the government appeals a federal judge's ruling against it. One of the three judges on the panel dissented against parts of Monday's decision. In response to the panel's ruling, the Log Cabin Republicans, a GOP gay rights group that filed the lawsuit against the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, can now appeal it to the full 9th Circuit appellate court and or make an emergency application directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. Dan Woods, an attorney with White & Case who represents the Log Cabin Republicans, said the appeal would continue and he raised the possibility of seeking emergency relief from the nation's highest court. ""We will continue to fight on for the constitutional rights of these Americans and look forward to a favorable decision on the merits of the appeal,"" Woods said in a statement. ""Meanwhile, we will discuss the court's order with our client to determine whether we will ask for a review of the order by the U.S. Supreme Court."" In Monday's ruling, the judges said they had to weigh the harm of continuing the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy against the potential harm in forcing the military to drop the policy before it is ready. ""We conclude that the government's colorable allegations that the lack of an orderly transition in policy will produce immediate harm and precipitous injury are convincing,"" the ruling said. ""Colorable"" means the court believes the allegations have a reasonable chance of being found valid. ""We also conclude that the public interest in ensuring orderly change of this magnitude in the military -- if that is what is to happen -- strongly militates in favor of a stay,"" the ruling said. Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan told CNN in an e-mail message that the appellate panel's decision was ""appropriate."" In their ruling, the judges also noted that legislation pending before Congress to repeal the policy would render the case before them moot. The House has passed a repeal provision, and the Senate is expected to consider it as part of a broader defense authorization bill when it returns for a lame-duck session in mid-November. President Barack Obama wants to repeal the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy and reached an agreement with Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen,the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on a process that includes a military review of how to make a successful transition to openly gay and lesbian soldiers serving alongside straight colleagues. Obama, Gates and Mullen would then have to certify the repeal. The case puts Obama's administration in an unusual position of supporting a repeal but filing court motions to prevent it from happening faster than planned. The legislation before Congress includes the process for repeal agreed to with Gates and Mullen. In response to the court case, Gates recently raised the level at which gay and lesbian troops can be discharged under ""don't ask, don't tell"" by ordering that it only be done by the secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force. In a memo written to the heads of all the military services, Gates said his action was taken in direct response to the legal uncertainty surrounding ""don't ask, don't tell"" law and policy. ""Effective immediately and until further notice, no military member shall be separated ... without the personal approval of the secretary of the military department concerned, in coordination with the under secretary of Defense for personnel and readiness and the general counsel of the Defense Department. These functions may not be delegated,"" Gates wrote. CNN's Adam Levine, Tom Cohen and Jennifer Rizzo contributed to this story.","NEW: Pentagon spokesman calls ruling appropriate .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A person allowed to enter a juvenile detention center for girls in Afghanistan would find one strikingly sad story after another, according to Human Rights Watch. Nearly all of the girls imprisoned in Afghanistan are behind bars for ""moral crimes,"" as are about half of adult women, a new report from the international watchdog group says. The arrests are often based on two actions considered criminal behavior. One is running away from home without the permission of their father or husband; the other is called Zina, having sex with anyone other than a husband. ""Very often you see women have been charged with both things -- with running away and with Zina. And when you dig a bit deeper and you talk to the women about what actually happened, what you find out is that ... a large majority of these cases are cases where women have actually run away from abuse,"" Heather Barr of Human Rights Watch Afghanistan told CNN. ""They've run away because they were about to be forced into a marriage against their will or they've run away because they've actually been married and they are experiencing abuse in the home from their husband or their in-laws."" U.S soldier died saving Afghan girl . In 2011, CNN highlighted a case in point. A woman named Gulnaz was jailed and sentenced to 12 years in prison after reporting she was raped by her cousin's husband. Her daughter was the product of the rape. Gulnaz's plight attracted international attention and she was freed when President Hamid Karzai intervened. But some women's rights activists say she will never be accepted into the community because of the way women are thought of in parts of Afghanistan. ""Women are passing away the best years of their lives inside prison, their children as well,"" Shurkria Barakzai, a member of Afghanistan's National Assembly, told CNN. ""To be honest, they do not have a future going back into the community. Their husbands will not accept them back and neither will their families or members of the community."" Barakzai said she is disappointed in the Afghan judicial system when it comes to its treatment of women. ""Our laws are quite equal for men and women, but men have the means to pay bribe money, run away from home, (or) ask others for help to get out of a situation,"" she said. Barakzai is well aware that even being a female in a position of power cannot save a person from danger. Threats and intimidation have occurred against women in politics, mostly because they are women. ""I blame the judicial system, the judges, and the system as a whole before anything else,"" she said. ""The system is simply not supporting women, and until they do, these so-called 'crimes' against women will continue and we will only slip back into what we were 10 years ago.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Tuesday is tax day, and the only thing more frustrating than paying taxes is Washington's refusal to fix the tax code. Aside from entitlements, no policy debate highlights the dysfunctions of American politics more than taxes. Instead of viewing the tax code as a way to raise revenue and enable government to perform its essential functions, politicians on both sides of the aisle use the tax code -- and the debate about taxes -- as tools to keep themselves in power and to reward their friends and interest groups who put them there. First, liberals like to argue that taxing the rich will solve our debt and deficit issues. They ignore one major problem. There simply are not enough rich people to tax to make a difference. For instance, President Obama has seized on the so-called Buffett Rule that calls for higher taxes for ""wealthy"" Americans. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation looked at this proposal, however, and found it lacking. They wrote, ""Taking half of the yearly income from every person making between 1 and 10 million dollars would only decrease the nation's debt by 1%. Even taking every last penny from every individual making more than $10 million per year would only reduce the nation's deficit by 12% and the debt by 2%. There's simply not enough wealth in the community of the rich to erase this country's problems by waving some magic tax wand. Fortunately, the Senate voted down the Buffett Rule Monday night. Yet the Senate once again wasted America's time to make a political point. So why do liberals work so hard to create the perception that ""taxing the rich"" will solve our problems even though the top 10% of taxpayers already pay 70% of all federal income taxes and many low-income Americans pay no federal taxes at all? Because it's all about the politicians. Liberals believe that inflaming class envy will persuade the American people to elect Democrats over Republicans, who allegedly want to protect tax cuts for the rich. It would be hard to find a more tired and intellectually dishonest argument in American politics today than the idea that we can balance the budget by soaking the rich. Republicans, on the other hand, have desecrated the limited-government legacies of Reagan, Goldwater, and our founders by embarking on spending orgies with borrowed money -- a form of deferred taxation and financial repression -- while hiding beyond false pledges of tax purity that have made tax reduction and simplification much more difficult to achieve. For instance, some Republican tax lobbyists, such as Americans for Tax Reform's Grover Norquist, say eliminating any credit or deduction -- what economists call ""tax expenditures"" or ""spending the code"" -- is a tax increase. For instance, when I tried to eliminate a tax earmark for Hollywood movie producers in President Obama's stimulus bill, Norquist alleged that I was trying to raise taxes. In other words, Norquist would demand that Republicans and conservatives walk away from a deal that was $9,000,000,000,000 (that's $9 trillion) in budget cuts and $.01 (one cent) in new revenue. That's pure stupidity and, fortunately, no one serving in Congress agrees with him. I know all the major negotiators on the Republican side and, regardless of what their public statements suggest, not a single one would automatically walk away from a deficit reduction deal that included revenue. The ideal tax rate is the rate at which government collects enough revenue to perform its essential functions and not a dime more. Another critically important principle when considering the ideal tax rate is something called ""Hauser's Law,"" named after investment economist Kurt Hauser, which shows that over the last six decades tax revenue as a percent of GDP has been about 19%, regardless of fluctuations in tax rates. In other words, government has an extremely difficult time collecting more than 19% or 19.5% of revenue even if it increases tax rates considerably. Congress has not tackled fundamental tax reform in more than 25 years. In 1986, President Reagan signed a comprehensive tax reform plan that closed loopholes, lowered rates, simplified the code, and sustained what was then the longest economic expansion in peacetime since World War II. Reagan called the tax reform act ""the best anti-poverty bill, the best pro-family measure and the best job-creation program ever to come out of the Congress of the United States."" Using Reagan's approach would be a win-win for taxpayers. President Obama's own deficit reduction commission, on which I served -- the Simpson-Bowles commission -- followed this template of lowering tax rates and broadening the base by getting rid of spending in the code. The commission recommended lowering individual rates to 8, 14, 23% and corporate rates to 26%. I would push rates even lower, but the commission report, which was supported by conservatives and liberals, showed that it is possible to lower rates, stimulate growth, generate additional revenue and reduce the deficit. Congress has done bold tax reform in the past. It can and must do so again if we are going to survive in the 21st century. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tom Coburn.","Tom Coburn: The most dysfunctional part of federal policy is the tax code .

"(CNN) -- Earlier this month, an AeroMexico plane made an important flight from Mexico City to Madrid. The flight wasn't notable for who was inside the cabin, but for what was inside the fuel tank: it was the world's first transatlantic commercial flight using biofuel. The engines on that flight were powered by a fuel mixture that was 30% biofuel from the jatropha plant, and the trip followed a pair of Mexican domestic commercial flights by Interjet that used the same formula. Mexico is known for its oil production, but it could be its less obvious flats of arid and marginal land that will be the future of Mexico's energy resources. The country has quietly positioned itself to become a potential leader in biofuel production as scientists develop a second generation of fuels derived from sources that don't compete for arable land or with food. Jatropha-based biofuels are being increasingly used in Mexico, and agave -- the plant from which tequila is made -- is being studied as a new source for ethanol. But some observers warn that Mexico's cumbersome land laws make it too hard to purchase the land needed for cultivation at competitive prices. Some biofuels, such as ethanol derived from corn and sugar, can indirectly raise the prices of staple foods in many places, along with raising ethical issues, said Gilberto Lopez Meyer, director of Airports and Auxiliary Services (ASA), the Mexican government agency that oversaw the biofuel flights. So in 2007, Mexico, along with 14 other member countries of the International Civil Aviation Organization, committed to developing new strategies for second-generation biofuels that would not affect food production. ""We returned to Mexico with a mission,"" Lopez told CNN. Lopez's agency teamed up with the state of Chiapas, where Gov. Juan Sabines had already made a name for himself pushing his state toward alternative fuels. Chiapas began cultivating jatropha, whose seeds contain oil that can be extracted and converted into biofuel. The state already uses a jatropha biofuel mix on its buses and trucks, and President Felipe Calderon was on hand in November of last year to inaugurate a biodiesal plant there. ASA partnered with American company UOP, which refined the Chiapas jatropha into jet fuel. When the standards for biofuel use in commercial flights was approved July 1, Mexico was ready to make the domestic Interjet and international AeroMexico flights a possibility. The goal of ASA, which provides almost 100% of the jet fuel in Mexico, is to commercialize and distribute biofuels, Lopez said. ""We've been working on this project as part of a global effort to combat climate change,"" he said. By 2015, the goal is to have 1% of all jet fuel in Mexico be biofuel, and by 2020, 15%, he said. ""This is a huge goal,"" Lopez said. ""One percent doesn't sound like a lot, but it equals more than 40 million liters (10.6 million gallons)."" Mexico has several things in its favor to become a leader in biofuels, he said. It has plenty of land not being used for food, it has a high demand for energy, and it is located next door to the energy-hungry United States. ""Mexico has made the very important first step to be in a very priviledged place,"" Lopez said. Halfway across the world, researchers at Oxford recently published a study extolling the benefits that ethanol derived from agave. Agave can grow in arid land, and produces less than half of the carbon dioxide emissions produced by corn-based ethanol, Oliver Inderwildi, one of the study's authors, told CNN. Sugar-based ethanol produces even less emissions, but it needs arable land for cultivation. ""We need every space we can get, every arable land, for food,"" Inderwildi said. ""We think agave may be one part of the solution."" For their study, the researchers did a life-cycle analysis for the production of ethanol based on a hypothetical plant in Jalisco, Mexico, where 90% of tequila is produced. Potentially, agave plantations could boost local economies and create jobs, Inderwildi said. Mexico, the native home of agave plants, stands to benefit if such an ethanol industry takes off. Food prices would be spared, but would drinkers have to pay more for their margaritas and tequila shots? The tequila business is very small compared to the fuel business, and is also more expensive than fuel ethanol, so Inderwildi predicts that alcohol prices would remain stable. And unlike tequila, which requires the harvesting of the agave stem only, ethanol production would also require harvesting the leaves of the plant. ""Our study backs up that this is a good idea from an environmental perspective,"" he said. The catch, for now, is that neither jatropha or agave biofuel production is cost-effective. But technological advances and oil prices make such alternatives more desirable. When that tipping point comes, Mexico will be ready, the experts said. But James Row, CEO of Houston-based Producers Energy and part owner of a Mexican-based biodiesel company, told CNN that Mexico is still far from being an ideal place to produce biofuels. ""Mexico is absolutely a perfect country for biodiesel, especially if it can be domestically grown,"" he said, but the country's ejido system -- collectively-held land in rural areas -- creates hurdles for private investment. The result is difficulty in finding continuous large areas of rural land that can be negotiated for use for cultivation, or high prices that make it cost prohibitive. Without land reform, issues with land availability will continue, and Mexico will fall a decade or more behind other countries in the biofuels sector, Row said. The demand is there, the land is there, but there is no way to get it, he said. ""Now is the time for Mexico to get its act together for biofuels,"" he said.","Mexico has quietly positioned itself as a potential biofuels leader .
It oversaw the first transatlantic commercial flight using biofuel .
The agave plant also has potential for the country .
Without land reform, private investment in sector is tough ."
"(CNN) -- California's vote on a controversial cigarette tax remained too close to call Wednesday morning, although votes counted so far suggest it was narrowly rejected. With all precincts reporting, the tally was 50.8% against the proposal and 49.2% in support of it, according to the California Secretary of State website. But the vote was listed as a ""close contest"" with no final result. Counties have 28 days to count every vote-by-mail, provisional and damaged ballot, the secretary of state's office said. With nearly 3.9 million votes cast in precincts, the ""no"" votes were ahead by only about 63,000. Proposition 29, would raise about $735 million a year. About three-quarters of the money raised would go to cancer research. ""The American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association and the American Lung Association wrote the initiative carefully,"" Lori Bremner of the American Cancer Society told CNN's ""Sanjay Gupta MD"" last week. ""The money is going to be invested in cancer research here in California and on tobacco prevention and cessation programs to protect kids and reduce smoking here in California."" Studies show the tax would help decrease smoking and save lives, she said. Opponents slammed the tax as a misguided burden in an already tough economy. ""What we're seeing in the state of California is a lot of frustration on the part of our citizenry that it's just another tax,"" said Dr. Marcy Zwelling, a general practitioner. The tax, she said in an interview with CNN, ""goes to build bigger bureaucracy, build business, build buildings, not necessarily to go to cancer research."" The opposition in California was fueled by a huge influx of cash from big tobacco companies. About $47 million was raised in efforts -- including TV advertising -- to defeat ""Prop. 29,"" including $27.5 million from Philip Morris and $11 million from R.J. Reynolds, according to figures from MapLight, a nonpartisan research firm. About $12 million was raised in support of the initiative, including $8.5 million from the American Cancer Society and $1.5 million from the Lance Armstrong Foundation, known as Livestrong. Armstrong himself appeared in ads urging people to ""vote yes on 29."" (Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent, is a board member of the foundation.) There is already an 87-cent tax on each pack of cigarettes in California. According to California's official voter guide, the health groups behind Prop. 29 said it would ""save lives, stop kids from smoking, and fund cancer research,"" while those opposed said the initiative ""doesn't require revenue be spent in California to create jobs or fund schools."" Bremner insisted the campaign against Prop. 29 traded in ""deceptions."" The biggest misconception is that the money collected ""will be somehow wasted or used otherwise,"" she said. But Zwelling said it would heavily affect poorer Americans, who are more likely to smoke. And other efforts, including the state's ban on smoking in public places, have succeeded at pushing people to quit smoking, she said. John Seffrin, CEO of the American Cancer Society, said if the bill passed, ""It would make California the second-largest funder of cancer research after the (National Cancer Institute) in the entire country."" Some grant proposals that currently go unfunded would find a source of revenue, he said. ""So, it's a tremendous opportunity for California to do the right thing -- not only for California, but for the whole world."" CNN's Caleb Hellerman, Nadia Kounang and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","NEW: The vote is a ""close contest,"" the California secretary of state's office says .

"Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- Bahrain's king reshuffled his cabinet Saturday as protesters continued to call for reforms and a key opposition leader returned to the country. King Hamad replaced the ministers of housing, health, and cabinet affairs. He expanded the portfolio of the oil and gas minister to include electricity and water, and he appointed a new minister of labor. The king also announced that all government housing loans will be reduced by 25%. Saturday's announcement came after opposition leader Hassan Mushaimaa said he had returned to the islands nation, where he planned to join the tens of thousands of protesters camped out at the Pearl Roundabout in the heart of the capital. Mushaimaa, the leader of the Haq Movement, a major Shiite group, had planned to return earlier in the week to give a speech on the importance of national unity. His return was delayed by his detention in Lebanon, which he blamed on Bahrain's rulers. Mushaimaa said after arriving in Bahrain that he was preparing a speech about the protesters' demands for a new regime. Thousands of people have been demonstrating in Bahrain in recent days for political reforms and other concessions. Mushaimaa had earlier said he planned to join them. The anti-government rallies in Bahrain have occurred alongside similar protests in other regional states, but they have also unfolded amid major gestures by the kingdom. King Hamad on Tuesday touted a ""national dialogue"" and urged Bahrainis ""to engage in this new process"" and ""move away from polarization."" Mushaimaa said Saturday he doesn't believe the king's offer for dialogue. ""They are always lying -- they are promising to do something and they don't do it,"" he said about the monarchy. ""We talked about dialogue for a long time. Nobody listened, nobody heard us,"" he said. ""They are just listening now because of the pressure. If the pressure will finish, they will not listen again."" Mushaimaa, who has been living abroad, had previously been detained by the government for campaigning for more democratic rights in the island monarchy. In September, Bahrain said it requested Interpol -- the world's largest international police organization -- to help in arresting Mushaimaa, whom the government accused of a terrorist plot to destroy state buildings and of planning a coup. Monday, King Hamad ordered the release of a number of prisoners and closed cases against several Shiite leaders accused of plotting against the kingdom. That cleared the way for Mushaimaa to return to Bahrain from London, where he had been living in exile. Mushaimaa's Haq Movement is more hard-line than the opposition Wefaq party, which includes 18 people in the 40-member parliament. Many members of his movement are opposed to the government monarchy.","The king replaced three cabinet ministers and made changes in two posts .

"(CNN) -- As a former Royal Navy officer, keen angler and the UK's heir apparent, it makes sense that Prince Charles would be inclined to worry about the future of fish and chips. Britons have been eating the iconic national dish since the mid-19th century, but with around 30% of the world's fish stocks thought to be over-exploited, the Prince of Wales has concerns. ""When I was at school here in Scotland, I remember one occasion buying fish and chips from a shop in Inverness,"" he told an audience of scientists and fisheries executives at the sixth World Fisheries Congress. ""It never occurred to me then that I was eating food that had such a reliance on how we treat a wild natural resource. But, of course, how we harvest the fish has a direct impact on how many are left to catch next time."" Study: Organic yields 25% lower than conventional farming . In 2010, Prince Charles launched the International Sustainability Unit (ISU), a charity focused on monitoring and facilitating consensus on environmental management issues. Drawing on the ISU's latest research, the Prince noted that sustainable fisheries tend to have three things in common: ""a strong economic rationale"" for their efforts, ""a robust management structure"" under which rules are enforced, and a holistic approach that takes into account ""the whole ecosystem, rather than individual stocks in isolation."" ""I am particularly encouraged to hear that the cod stocks in the North Sea have shown signs of recovery from what was, only a decade ago, a much depleted fishery,"" he said. ""By reducing the effort at sea and other management techniques, the stock, I am told, has doubled over the past six years."" Watch: Keeping fish on the menu . Prince Charles also met with members of the National Federation of Fish Friers (NFFF), winners of this year's Young Fish Frier of the Year competition, and fisheries executives gathered aboard a Scottish marine research vessel moored in Edinburgh's harbor to fry some sustainably sourced Scottish haddock, and discuss how to safeguard the future of a beloved national dish. Britons eat fish and chips twice as much as any other takeaway meal, with 382 million meals consumed a year, according to Denise Dodd, General Secretary of the NFFF. Collectively, Britain's 10,500 fish and chip shops use 10% of the UK's potato crop and buys 30% of its white fish, generating a turnover of $1.9 billion. ""Many businesses are family owned independents, some second and third generation or more, and are the focal point of many communities,"" Dodd says. ""Fish and chips have been firmly on the menu for 150 years and we'd like it to continue for at least another 150 years"" Beauty trumps beast in conservation efforts . Although, Dodd says 90% of Britain's fish and chip shops ""use frozen at sea fillets caught by large modern trawlers in well-managed waters."" With input from Young Fish Friers, and from sustainability award-winning fish and chip shop owners, the NFFF, which turns 100 next year, intends to draw up a Responsible Sourcing Code to ensure that fish and chip shops are selling fish from sustainable fisheries. It will also work with the Marine Stewardship Council, which certifies sustainable seafood, to make it easier for fish and chip shops to gain Chain of Custody certification, so consumers can eat ""conscience free"" cod. Britons concerned about the provenance of the fish they're eating can consult the Marine Conservation Society's newly revised Good Fish Guide, which confirms that Scottish North Sea haddock, farmed organically or caught from sustainable or certified fisheries, is amongst the best choice they can make.","The Prince of Wales is concerned about sustaining stocks of fish, used in Britain's favorite meal.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- After two nail-biting periods, the New Jersey Devils and Los Angeles Kings remained tied 0-0 in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals Wednesday. New Jersey goaltender Martin Brodeur and Los Angeles goalie Jonathan Quick seemingly put up walls in front of their nets in a defensive struggle. Among the celebrities in attendance were longtime Kings fans Matthew Perry and Alyssa Milano, along with Will Ferrell, who made a raucous video cheering the Kings that went viral throughout now-hockey-crazy Los Angeles. Kings fans, most dressed in their home team's black, roared throughout the contest and chanted ""MVP"" each time Quick stopped a serious scoring chance by the Devils. From the start, the Los Angeles Kings seemed doomed to be underdogs. They are a hockey team in a land without snow or even ice. They couldn't even find a puck for their first practice in 1967. Not even the Great One, Wayne Gretzky, could bring the team a Stanley Cup. And to marginalize them further, the Kings had to compete for fans against other local teams, some legendary: the Lakers, the Dodgers, the Angels and the Clippers. But the Kings are positioned to win their first Stanley Cup in the franchise's 44-year history, and they could do it in grand fashion by sweeping the Devils in game 4 of the best-of-seven championship series. The Kings have been having a Cinderella run, entering the playoffs as the lowest seed in their conference. But they have been nearly unbeatable, with a 15-2 playoff record. In his 39th season as the announcer for Kings games, Hockey Hall of Famer Bob Miller said the anticipation was unbearable. ""It is emotional for me, and I'm wondering what it's gonna be like when it actually happens and I see (team captain) Dustin Brown lift that Stanley Cup, because there were years that a lot of us in the organization felt, 'will we ever see this?' "" Miller said. At their first practice in 1967, after the league awarded a franchise to Los Angeles, the team's pucks were ""stored under boxes and equipment, and they had no puck,"" Miller said. Making sense of the L.A. Kings . A Hollywood producer borrowed a puck that had been a gift from the Montreal Canadiens and gave it to the team, Miller said. ""They've come a long way since the days of one puck, that's for sure,"" Miller said. The Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, home of the Kings, is seeing a run on team apparel. It's an unlikely scenario because the arena usually sports the colors and merchandise of the Lakers and Clippers, the NBA teams that both call it home. ""I'm so fired up right now that I got up this morning, put shoes on and came down here to get this jersey. I had a T-shirt. I said, 'I need a jersey to keep me for real, be there for them. Let's be there when they end it!' "" fan Vincent ""Butch"" Frankel said. ""That's gonna be Wednesday night! Kings goin' to go all the way!"" Inside the stadium, fans were anxious. ""I've been a Kings fan for 40 years and had a season's seat for 25 years,"" said Cheryl Baggs, holding a plastic cup of white wine. ""I've waited a long time for this, so it's chardonnay now, and I hope it's champagne later."" Grabbing a beer at a concession stand, Daniel Medina said he was glad to see the Kings as the successful ones this time of year now that the Lakers and Clippers have been eliminated from the playoffs. ""It's just great to see the focus on the Kings now instead of those other teams,"" Medina said. Two other fans drove in from Las Vegas, five hours away. ""They underachieved all season, and so I think that now they are actually living up to their potential and showing everybody that they really were the team to beat,"" said Emily Kolbus, who was joined by her friend, Kaleigh. Kings have found a way to be better . Actor and rapper LL Cool J, more of a basketball fanatic, has even caught the fever, he said. ""Normally during this time of year, I'm watching the NBA playoffs, but a friend of mine invited me to the hockey game, and I decided to take him up on his offer, and I gotta tell you, it did not disappoint,"" he said. ""You know, the hockey games live, the hockey match live, is some serious business. It's serious. It's great.""","NEW: L.A. Kings and New Jersey Devils are tied 0-0 after two periods .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A judge ordered two men to stand trial on charges relating to the beating of San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow after a Los Angeles Dodgers game last year. Marvin Norwood, 30, and Louie Sanchez, 29, both of Rialto, California, are each charged with mayhem, assault and battery, and all three charges are felonies, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. The Los Angeles judge made the ruling in the defendants' preliminary hearing, which began last week. The two men have pleaded not guilty. Stow, a 42-year-old paramedic from Santa Cruz, California, went into a coma as a result of the March 31, 2011, beating in the parking lot of Dodger Stadium after a game with the Giants. Stow is recovering from a brain injury suffered in the beating, and a website set up by his family stated last week, ""As we have said before, Bryan's memory was hugely affected, mainly his short term. It's really hard to see him forget even something that happened minutes ago. ""Bryan still doesn't understand or realize what has happened. When he expresses frustration or seems sad or confused we just remind him of how far he has come and how strong he is,"" the website said. Sanchez is also charged with two misdemeanor counts -- one for battery and the other for assault -- against one person inside the ballpark and another person in the parking lot on the same day, according to court documents provided by prosecutors. Sanchez and Norwood were arrested at their San Bernardino County homes July 21. The defendants' next court date is June 22.

"(CNN) -- IndyCar racers won't return next year to the Las Vegas track where two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dan Wheldon died in a fiery, 15-vehicle crash, the racing series said on Thursday. Wheldon's name wasn't mentioned in a news release explaining IndyCar's decision not to have its season-ending race next October 14 in Nevada, as originally planned. And there was no indication that the circuit had ruled out its drivers coming back another year, after 2012. The move followed consultations between IndyCar and Las Vegas Motor Speedway officials, in which the key parties said ""considerable testing with the new car is needed prior to returning to the facility,"" according to the release. The new car for the IZOD IndyCar racing series is set to debut next year. ""We feel we need to give our technical team ample time to conduct thorough testing at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, once we complete our ongoing investigation"" into the October 16 crash, IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard said. Weeks before the fatal wreck, Wheldon was behind the wheel of the new prototype car -- one meant to make his sport safer, and ideally no less exciting. The Englishman had been outspoken for months about safety. IndyCar Vice President Will Phillips said in an October story on IndyCar.com, the racing series' official website, that Wheldon had provided ""consistent and concise"" feedback in this effort. The crash that killed him raised even more questions, about safety in motor sports generally and at the Las Vegas track specifically. The 33-year-old was among those driving at about 220 mph in tight quarters in the 34-vehicle field when several members of the pack spun out of control and burst into flames. Two days later, IndyCar announced there would be an investigation. It is being done by the Automobile Competition Committee of the United States and the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile, the sport's national and international governing bodies. The loop in Las Vegas is 1.5 miles, one mile shorter than the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. It also is wider than many others -- such that more cars can run alongside -- and potentially collide with -- one another. After Wheldon's death, driver Dario Franchitti told ABC News that the oval offered ""nowhere to get away from anybody."" ""This is not a suitable track, and we've seen it today,"" he said.","Two-time Indy 500 champ Dan Wheldon died at Las Vegas track in October .

"(CNN) -- The number of cholera deaths in Zimbabwe is approaching 1,000, according to U.N. figures published Monday. Two Zimbabweans rest in a cholera rehydration tent on the South Africa-Zimbabwe border. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said 978 people have died and 18,413 suspected cases have been recorded. U.N. figures have been compiled since August. The latest death toll is reported amid claims by one of Zimbabwe's top officials blaming the  cholera outbreak on ""a genocidal onslaught"" by Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler -- Britain. ""Cholera is a calculated, racist attack on Zimbabwe by the unrepentant former colonial power, which has enlisted support from its American and Western allies so that they can invade the country,"" Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu told reporters. Britain ruled the country as a colony until 1965. Ndlovu's claims triggered quick and pointed reaction from Britain and the United States. In Washington, State Department spokesman Rob McInturff called Ndlovu's accusations ""patently ridiculous."" Referring to Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, McInturff said Friday that, ""Mugabe is clearly unwilling to take any meaningful action (to stop the cholera outbreak)."" On Thursday, Mugabe said ""there is no cholera in the country."" His spokesman later said that Mugabe was sarcastically ridiculing what he believes are Western designs to invade the country. Britain's Africa minister, Mark Malloch-Brown responded by saying, ""I don't know what world he (Mugabe) is living in,"" according to the British newspaper The Guardian. Malloch-Brown made the comment during a one-day trip to South Africa, where he visited a Johannesburg church housing 1,600 Zimbabweans who have fled their country, the newspaper said. ""There is a raging humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe as well as an economic crisis and still there is no representative government able to lead the country out of this disaster,"" he said, according to The Guardian. The outbreak, which has already killed nearly 1,000, could surpass 60 000 cases, according to an estimate by the Zimbabwe Health Cluster, which is a group coordinated by the World Health Organization.  View image gallery of Zimbabwe's cholera crisis » . Cholera, a bacterial waterborne disease that causes diarrhea, dehydration and, if not treated, death in a matter of hours, is widespread in Zimbabwe but help is not. Like the general Zimbabwean economy, the country's health delivery system is strapped, lacking modern drugs and machinery, while doctors and nurses have been striking for over a month. On Friday, the State Department issued a travel warning for U.S. citizens because of the cholera outbreak and violence that has flared as Zimbabwe's economy has deteriorated. ""The public health system in Zimbabwe no longer provides even basic services due to a lack of staff, electricity, clean water, and medical supplies,"" the travel warning said. ""Americans who fall ill while in Zimbabwe may find it difficult to find treatment."" At the State Department's daily press briefing Friday, spokesman Sean McCormack said the situation in Zimbabwe will be one of the topics Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will discuss when she visits the United Nations next week. ""The number of cases of cholera -- statements from Robert Mugabe notwithstanding -- is going up, not down,"" McCormack said. ""The crisis has not ended. People's lives are in danger."" Health experts say the Zimbabwean government can win the battle against cholera only if it imports adequate stocks of water-treating chemicals and disposes of refuse and sewerage properly. A Doctors Without Borders epidemiologist in Zimbabwe said, referring to the capital city, that ""the scale and sheer numbers of infection, especially in Harare, is unprecedented."" He said the group has treated more than 11,000 patients since August and has 500 international and local staff members treating people in cholera centers across the country. He said the main reasons for the outbreak are poor access to clean water, uncollected garbage in the streets and burst and blocked sewage systems. ""The fact that the outbreak has become so large is an indication that the country's health system can't cope,"" he said. Meanwhile, in his statement Thursday Mugabe said, ""I am happy to say our doctors, assisted by others and the World Health Organization, have now arrested cholera. So now that there is no cholera, there is no cause for war anymore. Let's tell them (Britain and the United States) that the cholera cause does not exist anymore, if it was cause for war."" The pro-government Herald, quoting presidential spokesman George Charamba, said Mugabe had been sarcastically reacting to ""calls for intrusive action"" against Zimbabwe from European leaders. Charamba said the country continues to want international assistance to combat the disease and has declared a state of emergency. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change, which rivals Mugabe's ZANU-PF party, issued statements deploring the Mugabe government's ""indifferent and casual approach"" to cholera and saying it was ""alarmed by Mugabe's irresponsible and false remarks"" on Thursday. ""The ZANU-PF caretaker government is in a denial mode. The MDC believes that it is such careless and reckless statements that have not helped the situation,"" MDC said. ""We should be honest with ourselves and with the world. The truth is that cholera remains a major disaster in Zimbabwe,"" the MDC said. In his remarks to reporters in Zimbabwe, Ndlovu -- who said the country's health system is working on the outbreak -- labeled the cholera outbreak ""a serious biological, chemical war force, a genocidal onslaught, on the people of Zimbabwe by the British,"" He also made reference to U.S. President George W. Bush and Rice: ""To the outgoing warmongers, please leave in peace and not in pieces."" Ndlovu also slammed news outlets including CNN for what he called ""gunboat journalism."" ""They take photos (of) people dying (in) the DRC and Darfur and say these are cholera victims from Zimbabwe,"" he said, making reference to the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Darfur region of Sudan.","NEW: U.N.: Cholera deaths approach 1000 in Zimbabwe .

""This will allow the United States and other countries to unfreeze billions of dollars to help Libyans build their new democracy,"" U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said. The sanctions had been imposed early this year by U.N. Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973 in an attempt to halt the killing of unarmed demonstrators by forces loyal to longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. ""Now, as Libyans develop their new state, these sanctions can be ended responsibly,"" Rice said.

"(CNN) -- There had been no confirmed deaths in the United States related to swine flu as of Tuesday afternoon. But another virus had killed thousands of people since January and is expected to keep killing hundreds of people every week for the rest of the year. People are nervous about swine flu, but the regular flu kills 36,000 people a year in the United States. That one? The regular flu. An outbreak of swine flu that is suspected in more than 150 deaths in Mexico and has sickened dozens of people in the United States and elsewhere has grabbed the attention of a nervous public and of medical officials worried the strain will continue to mutate and spread. Experts are nervous that, as a new strain, the swine flu will be harder to stop because there aren't any vaccines to fight it. But even if there are swine-flu deaths outside Mexico -- and medical experts say there very well may be -- the virus would have a long way to go to match the roughly 36,000 deaths that seasonal influenza causes in the United States each year. ""That happens on an annual basis,"" Dr. Brian Currie said Tuesday. Currie is vice president and medical director at Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, New York. Since January, more than 13,000 people have died of complications from seasonal flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's weekly report on the causes of death in the nation. No fewer than 800 flu-related deaths were reported in any week between January 1 and April 18, the most recent week for which figures were available. The report looks at deaths in the 122 largest cities in the United States. Worldwide, the annual death toll from the flu is estimated to be between 250,000 and 500,000. About 9 out of 10 of those deaths are among people older than 65, Currie said. Most times, they already have health problems that the flu makes worse, he said. ""Regular influenza can be taxing,"" he said. ""It causes their underlying disease to decompensate and then they don't have the reserves to get through it. ""While it may not be the direct cause listed on the death certificate, it certainly contributed."" One of the reasons medical experts are nervous about the swine flu outbreak is that many of the people who have died in Mexico have been young and otherwise healthy. The strains found in the United States have so far been weaker. But even the regular flu is sometimes fatal for younger victims. ""It's not unheard of. It happens, either directly from influenza or they get a bacterial superinfection"" like staph, said Currie. While researchers haven't developed a vaccine to fight the new swine flu, it can be treated with antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza, the same drugs used on the regular flu. Many times, seasonal flu itself is tough to prevent because it has mutated to a form different than it was when the vaccine was made. Seeking to put the swine flu outbreak in perspective Tuesday, Los Angeles County public health officer Dr. Jonathan Fielding echoed other public officials calling it ""cause for concern, but not for alarm."" ""Given the size of L.A. County, given the traffic between here and Mexico, it would be very surprising if we didn't have any cases,"" Fielding said. He said the county, where the CDC had confirmed 10 cases of swine flu by Tuesday, sees more than 1,000 flu-related deaths every year. ""So it would also not be surprising if there were deaths with swine flu -- even if it had the pattern of seasonal flu,"" he said. ""Thus far, the pattern we see in the United States is very similar to that of seasonal flu -- relatively mild to moderate cases."" CNN's Samira Simone and KC Wildmoon contributed to this report.","Swine flu getting focus, but so far it's not deadly in United States .

"Washington (CNN) -- A magazine designed for and by gay military members may soon be displayed at military installations worldwide, an advocacy group announced Monday. ""Our first objective with the magazine is to let all the gay, lesbian, bi, and trans members currently serving know that they are not alone,"" an active-duty officer who goes by the pseudonym JD Smith said in a statement. Smith, along with co-director Ty Walrod lead the organization known as OutServe, the group describes themselves as an underground network of actively serving military members of the United States Armed Services who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. ""Visibility is key,"" Smith said, who added that OutServe hopes to have its next version available in print at ""some larger military bases."" The magazine can currently be downloaded from the internet, the statement said. ""We are not about highlighting our differences."" Smith said the goal of the publication is to demonstrate ""how LGBT troops are proud soldiers, sailors, airmen, Coasties, and Marines just like everyone else."" The magazine will contain features about ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"" repeal implementation and OutServe chapters, as well as other information of interest to currently-serving LGBT military members, the statement said. ""We also want to communicate to all troops that there are capable gay military members serving honorably, and that accepting that and moving on will make our military stronger,"" said Smith. On December 22, President Barack Obama signed the DADT bill repealing the 17-year-old law. The repeal ""will strengthen our national security and uphold (America's) ideals,"" Obama said. ""No longer will tens of thousands of Americans in uniform be asked to live a lie.""

"(CNN) -- McLaren's Lewis Hamilton has apologized for causing a collision with Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi which ended the Briton's involvement in Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix. The 2008 world champion Hamilton overtook the Sauber racer on the 13th lap heading into the corner known as Les Combes, but the 26-year-old failed to see Kobayashi making a counter move. The two cars subsequently made contact with Hamilton spinning into the barriers and out of the race. The crash prompted the Briton  to apologize to Kobayashi and his McLaren team via the social-networking site Twitter. ""After watching the replay, I realize it was my fault today [Sunday] 100%. I didn't give Kobayashi enough room though I thought I was past,"" tweeted Hamilton. 20 years of Schumacher: Is his legacy on the line? ""Apologies to Kamui and to my team. The team deserves better from me. Best wishes, Lewis."" Hamilton's retirement from the Spa race left him fifth in the drivers' standings, 113 points behind the Red Bull of championship leader Sebastian Vettel. Vettel, who claimed the world title in 2010, took the checkered flag in Belgium ahead of teammate Mark Webber, with Hamilton's McLaren colleague Jenson Button recovering from 13th on the grid to take third position. Button, a world champion in 2009, was pleased with his performance and the condition of his car. ""Our car is the best it's been all year, and I feel better than I ever have in Formula 1,"" the 31-year-old told McLaren's official web site. ""We just need to stop the little mistakes from happening so that we can win even more races."" Meanwhile, Polish driver Robert Kubica underwent surgery on Sunday for the final time on arm injuries sustained during a pre-season rally crash. Renault driver Kubica crashed out of the Ronde de Andorra rally in Italy in February, and was subsequently replaced by German driver Nick Heidfeld for the beginning of the 2011 season. Renault released a statement which said the surgery was a ""total success,"" after the former Sauber driver awoke from the procedure in good spirits. ""Robert underwent one last scheduled operation in Italy, aimed at recovering the full mobility of his right elbow,"" read the statement. ""The surgeons are happy to report that they have been able to complete 100% of their task and did not encounter any complications. They have described the outcome of the operation as 'a total success.' ""On waking up, it was immediately clear Robert was in good spirits. Why? Well, as soon as he opened his eyes, he asked for the results of today's race! He will now rest in hospital for a few days before resuming his rehabilitation and training program.""","Lewis Hamilton has said his crash with Kamui Kobayashi on Sunday was his fault .

"(CNN) -- A controversial car modification pioneered by McLaren will be banned for the next Formula One season after the rest of the teams voted against it. The f-duct aerodynamic system, which channels air flow to allow vehicles to go faster on the straights, has also been adapted by Ferrari. However, concerns have arisen about how the feature is operated, with Ferrari's version requiring the driver to open and close a hole in the cockpit with his hands -- meaning less control over the steering wheel. McLaren unsuccessfully tried to convince the other teams at a meeting before Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix, won by Red Bull's Mark Webber, that the innovation should not be barred. The Formula One Teams Association told CNN that the decision was part of a package of measures that will be forwarded to motorsport's governing body, the FIA, for ratification. A FOTA spokesperson said details of the other recommendations would not be made available at this stage. Red Bull boss Christian Horner outlined his opposition to the f-duct system. ""It is a clever piece of engineering and hats off to the guys who invented it, but some of the solutions this weekend look a bit marginal when you see drivers driving with finger tips and no hands,"" he said in quotes carried by Autoweek.com. ""So I think there is a safety issue and a cost issue to take into account."" At the weekend, Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, who finished second in Barcelona, denied claims that he had to drive with his hand off the wheel, saying he has a pad sewn into his left glove to close the air hole. ""In the simulator we practiced with this method so that now it is automatic. But in the future we will find a more comfortable solution for the drivers,"" he told France's Auto Hebdo. However, Mercedes chief Nick Fry also backed the banning of the system, according to Autosport.com. ""I personally think that it is sensible to nip in the bud technologies that, on the face of it, don't really have a relevance for use outside of F1,"" he said. ""By the end of the year I know we, and I am sure most of the other teams, will have an F-duct on their car -- and that neutralizes the advantage of having it. ""The engineers have already come up with ideas for next year that are zany in the extreme, and it is difficult to see how they would be used elsewhere. Plus they would be expensive. ""What we should be encouraging is stuff that we can be using elsewhere, and I am personally a big proponent of KERS because of that."" Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems were used to great effect by McLaren and Ferrari last year, while Renault and BMW Sauber also used the technology. It was banned for this year, but some teams hope to have it reinstated for 2011. Earlier this year, the F1 teams voted to ban the double-diffuser system from next season. Brawn successfully used it at the start of 2009 to gain a big advantage which led to it winning the world constructors' title and also the drivers' crown for Jenson Button.","McLaren team pioneered f-duct system, which allows cars to go faster on the straights .

"(CNN) -- Mark Webber climbed to the top of the Formula One championship standings with a runaway victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday as Red Bull teammate and polesitter Sebastian Vettel paid for a mistake while the safety car was out. The Australian moved four points clear of previous leader Lewis Hamilton, who retired in the 24th lap of 70 after a mechanical failure ended his hopes of a second successive win at the Hungaroring, where he also triumphed in 2007. ""It was a bit of a gift for me but you know I haven't had many of them,"" the 33-year-old said after ending his 150th Grand Prix in fine style. ""It was an incredible day for the team. One-two was our goal but we were unfortunate not to get that."" The safety car was already out when the leading McLaren ground to a halt, and its introduction allowed Webber to take the lead having lost second place to Ferrari's Fernando Alonso at the start. Vettel and Alonso had pitted for the first time on lap 16, allowing Webber to establish a crucial buffer that he kept extending until he also came in for a tire change on lap 44 -- meaning he came back out of the lane still in front. F1 championship standings . His fourth victory of the season lifted Red Bull eight points clear in the team standings as previous leaders McLaren's world champion Jenson Button claimed eighth place after starting the race 11th on the grid. Vettel was hit with a 25-second drive-through penalty after not hearing team radio orders to move clear of Alonso and subsequently dropping too far behind the leader while the safety car was out. ""I didn't understand what was going on and why I was penalized,"" Vettel told reporters. ""I didn't hear anything on the radio after briefly losing connection. I was warming up my car and was sure we had another lap. It's a disappointing day for me."" Alonso, who won last time out at Hockenheim, kept his hopes of a third world title alive as he held off Vettel to take second place -- 17.821 seconds behind Webber -- despite the German setting the fastest lap of any driver. Vettel moved up to third overall, 10 points behind Webber, despite failing to capitalize on his seventh pole position this year as his early 12-second lead was wiped out. Alonso remained fifth in the standings, but is now only 20 points off the leader with seven races to go ahead of a four-week break before the next event in Belgium. Alonso's teammate Felipe Massa, second at the German Grand Prix, was fourth on his return to the circuit where last year he suffered horrific head injuries after a freak accident during qualifying which ended his season. Renault's Vitaly Petrov finished fifth for the Russian's best result in his debut season, while fellow rookie Nico Hulkenberg of Williams was sixth ahead of Sauber's veteran Pedro de la Rosa. Button, the winner here for Honda in 2006 for his maiden race win, was next -- a whole lap behind Webber -- while Kamui Kobayashi picked up more points for Sauber. The Japanese driver had started 23rd on the grid after failing to stop for a weigh-in after Saturday's qualifying. Rubens Barrichello rounded out the top-10 for Williams after overtaking his former Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher late in the race -- the seven-time world champion faces a stewards inquiry after dangerously pushing his fellow veteran wide of the track. It was another disappointing day for the German -- who was lapped by Webber -- and Mercedes, with teammate Nico Rosberg retiring on lap 15. Schumacher's younger compatriot lost his rear right wheel while coming out of the pit lane, but fortunately the flying object did not strike any of the nearby team mechanics.","Mark Webber overtakes previous leader Lewis Hamilton in the F1 drivers' standings .

"(CNN) -- A few hundred yards from the Pearl Roundabout, the epicenter of Bahrain's protest movement, you can be blissfully unaware of the turmoil that has suddenly engulfed this island kingdom. Caressed by the muzak of Richard Clayderman, you can wander the polished floors of a mall that would dwarf many in suburban America. There's a Radio Shack, a Krispy Kreme doughnut shop and, it seems, every apparel store known to the United States. You can escape the political drama playing out here by taking in a movie at the 16-screen megaplex cinema. Bahrain's malls -- and there are dozens of them -- are emblematic of an aggressive drive to make this kingdom a Gulf powerhouse. The slogan is ""Business Friendly Bahrain."" Big international banks are coaxed into setting up here; Bahrain is the banking center of the Gulf. There is a surfeit of luxury property for rent. High-profile international events are staged here -- including round one of the 2011 Formula 1 Grand Prix, but that was canceled last week due to the unrest. A large pool of migrant workers provides cheap labor -- sometimes it seems there are almost as many Pakistanis and Filipinos here as Bahrainis. Through the hazy glare, the Manama skyline boasts shining high-rise complexes, with more to come, despite a sharp decline in rental values over the past two years, according to international real estate agency Knight Frank. But just a few miles from the malls, there are non-descript villages of narrow alleys and general stores, where the jumble of cheap goods spills onto the curbside. In the past week, the streets of several have been festooned with black flags of mourning. On Tuesday, 32-year-old Reida Houmeid was laid to rest in the seaside village of Al Malkiya. He was shot in the head by security forces last Friday near the Pearl Roundabout and succumbed to his injuries three days later. At his funeral, the Imam delivered a harsh judgment against Bahrain's rulers, reminding mourners of the slaying and beheading of Hussein Ibn Ali in the year 680, an event widely regarded as marking the definitive break of the Shia and Sunni branches of Islam. Houmeid's eight-year-old son stood near his father's grave with a photograph around his neck. It showed him sitting on his father's shoulders, a broad smile on his face. This day, his face was a study in confusion and sadness. Within sight of Houmeid's grave is the sea he loved as a fisherman. The gentle Gulf waters are the color of lapis lazuli; the well-worn boats of the fishermen nudge against grander leisure craft. After the funeral, his brother Ghidir said Reida would sit in his boat and talk for hours about Bahrain and ""what was wrong."" The village saw a bitter and sometimes violent dispute about the fishermen's access to the seafront, an incendiary issue here. Much of Bahrain's coastline has become private property as the kingdom has become richer. It is just one of many grievances felt by the majority Shiite community in Bahrain, which has been ruled by the Sunni al Khalifa dynasty for 200 years. At the Pearl Roundabout, re-occupied by protesters since Saturday, one display shows satellite photographs of all the property purportedly owned by King Hamad and the royal family on the island. The Shia complain of discrimination in housing, incentives offered by the government to non-Bahraini Sunnis to move here, and a lack of job prospects. But the Shia also have political demands, demands that have suddenly taken on a sharper edge with the events of the past week. The chants of tens of thousands of marchers in Bahrain Tuesday included ""No Shia, no Sunni, only Bahraini,"" but also ""The regime must go."" The call that most echoes around the Pearl Roundabout is ""Down, Down Khalifa."" Late Wednesday, some of the 23 political detainees released on Tuesday were due to appear at the roundabout to address a growing crowd. A campaign that began barely two weeks ago to demand constitutional reform is, at least in some quarters, morphing into one for regime change, according to both opposition sources and human rights activists. Not that the king or Crown Prince Salman bin Hamid bin Isa Khalifa will entertain such a prospect. The crown prince is leading an initiative to start a dialogue with opposition groups, and the government is offering various olive branches. Besides the release of the detainees, it has promised an investigation into the killings of protesters -- the opposition says 10 died last week -- and it has cancelled the arrest warrant for Hassan Mushaimaa, leader of the more hardline Haq movement. Mushaimaa was due back from self-imposed exile in London late Wednesday. The crown prince has also set no deadline for protesters to leave the Pearl Roundabout. For his part, King Hamad said Tuesday that ""the best alternative is to sit at the national dialogue table."" But this is not a state accustomed to fast-paced political change, and diplomats say there is still disagreement within the ruling elite about what concessions to offer. And then there is the regional dynamic. No sooner was King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia home after medical treatment in the United States than King Hamad flew to meet him. The two royal houses are close allies -- Sunni, hostile to Iran and pro-western. The U.S. Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain. Regional commentators say the Saudi nightmare is to see the al Khalifa family toppled, with the Shia gaining ascendancy on an island so close to Saudi Arabia that it is linked by a causeway. Adjacent to that causeway are Saudi Arabia's own Shia communities, in its oil-rich eastern provinces. In another world away from those sparkling malls, a gritty and unpredictable power struggle is underway in the Gulf's smallest country.","Modern Bahrain is courting big businesses .

"(CNN) -- This year ""will mark a turning point"" in Afghanistan and other regions, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Tuesday. In Afghanistan, ""our troops have been able to obviously reduce the levels of violence there. We've seen the lowest levels of violence there in almost five years there now. They are successful in securing some of the key areas in Afghanistan,"" Panetta told reporters during a flight on his overseas trip. He's visiting Djibouti, Iraq, Turkey and Libya as well as Afghanistan, where war still rages. He arrived Tuesday in Kabul and is meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai; Ryan Crocker, U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan; and Gen. John Allen, commander of NATO's International Security Assistance Force. ""Obviously, there is greater success in the Afghan military and police. The Afghan military is engaging in operations,"" Panetta said. He said he thinks Afghanistan ""is on a much better track in terms of our ability to eventually transition to an Afghanistan that can eventually govern and secure itself."" The issue of supply routes being cut off from Pakistan is expected to come up during Panetta's trip. The United States is still sending supplies through the air from the north and south. Pakistan closed NATO supply lines in Afghanistan after a November 27 cross-border strike by NATO that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers. Panetta will meet with Afghan Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak and will discuss the American commitment to Afghan security forces, a senior defense official told reporters before the trip. So, far, the official said, all indications and reporting back in the U.S. is that the supplies are still ""in pretty good shape."" Supplies continue to flow in from the north and the stocks that they have on hand in Afghanistan ""are quite ample."" ""This whole trip (will) give the secretary a chance to get a feeling for the situation on the ground,"" and the supply routes issue will be a topic of discussion, the official said. In an indication that the freeze on U.S.-Pakistani communications is thawing, Allen, the NATO commander, told reporters he recently talked to Pakistani Chief of Army Staff Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Allen said Pakistan will soon send liaison officials back to NATO headquarters in Kabul. Panetta said the ""principal purpose"" of his journey is to visit U.S. troops and ""wish them happy holidays and a merry Christmas and happy new year."" ""This is a difficult time for them to be away from their loved ones and it's important that we go there and express my thanks, our thanks as a nation, for their service and for their sacrifice,"" he said. ""We'll be touching a lot of key places that reflect some of the achievement that have been accomplished over these last 10 years as a result of the sacrifice and service of our men and women in uniform."" He said he'll participate in a ceremony marking the end of the U.S. combat mission in Iraq at the end of the year. ""This will be a historic moment where we basically enter a new chapter in Iraq, in which we will deal with them in a way that represents the kind of normal relationship we have with other countries in that part of the world,"" he said. He said the drawdown of bases and infrastructure has been a ""tremendous achievement."" Panetta said Turkey is now a key ally, both in the Middle East and within NATO. ""They are extremely important to the ability to try to keep what's happening in the Middle East heading in the right direction. They can have an influence on what happens in Egypt, in Iraq, in Iran, what happens in Syria. They have already taken a strong position to demand that Assad step down,"" he said, referring to embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ""To add to that the fact that they are willing to accept a defense radar system, I think it's important for us to work closely with Turkey at this critical time because they can be an important ally and an important influence on the direction in the Middle East."" Libya ""represents kind of the ultimate of what the Arab Spring should be about,"" Panetta said, using the term for the uprisings across North Africa and the Middle East this year. He said he'll pay tribute to the Libyans and offer them support in developing a democracy. He said the NATO mission helped Libyans bring down Moammar Gadhafi's regime, but now ""that country is headed back to the Libyan people."" ""All is an indication that there are changes going on,"" Panetta said. ""This is a turning point that we've all been a part of. But most of this is due to the sacrifice and commitment of our troops and the great work that they've (given) over these last few years.""","NEW: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta meeting with officials in Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- A fourth person who died while in the custody of Bahrain police in recent days may have been tortured, Human Rights Watch said Wednesday, as it called for urgent investigations into the deaths of detainees. The death of Kareem Fakhrawi, 49, was the fourth detainee death reported by the Bahrain government in nine days, the human rights group said. He was detained April 3 after going to a police station to complain about a predawn raid on the house of a relative, the agency said. Police reported he died Tuesday. ""Four detainee deaths in nine days is a crime, not a coincidence,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""The government tells families of detainees nothing about their whereabouts or well-being while they are alive or about the circumstances of their deaths."" At Fakhrawi's funeral Wednesday, a crowd of mourners demanded to see his corpse because of concerns he had been tortured, then took photos and videos of the body, the agency said. A video of a dead body, purported to be Fakhrawi's, was posted on Facebook Wednesday and showed a badly bruised corpse as people crowded around to take pictures. The body had ligature marks around one of the ankles and deep reddish-purple bruises on the entire upper arms and on a large part of one thigh. The face was black and blue and blood was on the right side of the neck. In a posting on Twitter, the Bahrain News Agency said an official at the Bahrain Defense Force Hospital attributed Fakhrawi's death to kidney failure. Human Rights Watch said its personnel did not see the body in person, but urged a thorough and impartial investigation into allegations of torture. ""Bahrain is flagrantly violating the most basic human rights by arbitrarily detaining hundreds, keeping their whereabouts secret, and covering up the reasons for deaths in custody,"" Stork said. The human rights agency did view the body of another person who died in custody -- protester Ali Isa Saqer -- and said it showed signs of ""horrific abuse"" and torture. The human rights agency said there may be as many as 430 people who have been arrested in Bahrain in the government's effort to quell protests there. A member of Human Rights Watch observed Saqer's body Sunday after Bahraini authorities said he died in detention. ""His body showed signs of severe physical abuse. The left side of his face showed a large patch of bluish skin with a reddish-purple area near his left temple and a two-inch cut to the left of his eye,"" Human Rights Watch said in a statement. ""Lash marks crisscrossed his back, some reaching to his front right side. Blue bruises covered much of the back of his calves, thighs, and buttocks, as well as his right elbow and hip. The tops of his feet were blackened, and lacerations marked his ankles and wrists."" Saqer, 31, died at a detention center in early April, according to the general director of Muharraq Governorate Police. Saqer was being held on charges of attempted murder of policemen while trying to run them over with his car March 13. Authorities said Saqer was creating chaos at the detention center, and when security forces sought to subdue him, he resisted them and sustained various injuries in the process. He was sent to the hospital, where he later died. Human Rights Watch said there were at least two other people who have died in the custody of police in Bahrain recently. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon spoke with Bahrain's foreign minister Wednesday about the situation. ""He said he was very concerned about the violence in which demonstrators have been killed or injured,"" a U.N. statement said. ""He called for maximum restraint and caution."" The foreign minister, Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Khalifa, recently spoke to CNN about accusations that protesters were being abused. He said the demonstrations had quickly led the country to ""the brink"" and that calling in the military had been necessary to restore stability and safety. ""Our economy came to the brink of collapse,"" Sheikh Khalid said. ""So we had no choice but to protect the interests of our country ... from collapse, from total collapse internally. And from external threats.""","NEW: A fourth person dies in Bahrain police custody .

"(CNN) -- IndyCar driver Dan Wheldon was killed by a fence pole that sliced through his car, causing fatal injuries, an investigation into his death concluded Friday. The 33-year-old Englishman, a two-time winner of the famous Indy 500, died in a 15-car crash at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway during the final round of the 2011 series on October 16. The report, published on the official IndyCar website, said the circumstances of the accident were a ""perfect storm"" as his car flew into the air and hit the track side fence. ""The chassis impacted a vertical post along the right side of the tub that -- as the car passed by -- created significant damage extending from the pedal bulkhead, through the cockpit and shearing off the roll hoop,"" IndyCar President of Operations Brian Barnhart was quoted. ""As the pole intruded the cockpit, the impact with the driver's helmeted head produced non-survivable blunt force trauma."" Wheldon, who had started at the rear of the 34-car field, was in 24th place on lap 11 when the accident occurred, causing him to decelerate from 224 mph to 165 mph before he hit a car in front of him. Wheldon killed in horror crash in Las Vegas . ""It is a tragedy. Our thoughts and support will always be with Dan's family,"" added Barnhart. In the aftermath of the crash, safety concerns were raised about the number of cars racing on the 1.5 mile circuit in Las Vegas, but these were rejected by the report. ""The 34-car starting field was determined to be acceptable based on factors such as length and width of the racetrack and pit space capability, and review of the incident supports the conclusion. ""Similar consequences could have occurred with any size starting field at any track,"" it added. However, IndyCar organizers have decided against including Las Vegas on their schedule for the 2012 season. ""Las Vegas is a great city, a resort destination. Our fans, our sponsors and everyone likes Las Vegas and it's a great place for the race,"" IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard said. ""But I don't want to go back there if the conditions aren't right and it's not safe for our race cars."" IndyCar said they would continue testing at the facility with the next-generation 2012 car ahead of a possible return in 2013.","IndyCar star Dan Wheldon killed by fence pole in October 15 crash in Las Vegas .

"(Mashable)  -- Google plans to create 20 special channels on its YouTube site, and will spend $100 million to create original programming to populate them, according to sources who talked with the Wall Street Journal. Like Netflix announced last month, Google wants to create its own streaming video programs, however, according to the WSJ sources, the company will create low-cost programming designed specifically for the web and YouTube, and support the shows with advertising. The sources said this will be a ""major overhaul"" to YouTube, which already has a lucrative advertising system in place. It was unclear when Google would begin spending the money to create the new programs, but the source said that Google has visited top Hollywood talent agencies in search of ideas, and will probably end up making deals with production companies and directors to produce the content. Good move, Google. The direction broadcast television is taking is beginning to look obvious, where web-connected screens are finding their way into the living room and home theater in ever-increasing numbers. In addition to a plethora of set top boxes, many new TV sets are equipped with Internet connections, and Google's own Google TV hardware is starting to make sense in light of this latest initiative. With original content produced specifically for the web inserted into the battle for viewers, it's going to be more difficult for cable TV, broadcast and satellite TV to dominate television broadcasting as they still do. Now, instead of 500 channels and nothing on, there will be 5 million channels, and if Google has anything to do with it, there will be something on. It might be cats playing the piano -- now dressed up in tuxedos because of their expanded budget -- but it will be something. And that something is just the beginning. © 2011 MASHABLE.com.

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- The pope looked unscathed Friday as he delivered his Christmas message in St. Peter's Square, just hours after a woman jumped a barrier and dragged him down during Christmas Eve Mass. Pope Benedict XVI, 82, delivered the traditional address known as ""Urbi et Orbi"" -- Latin for ""To the City and the World,"" sending a message of hope to the world's afflicted. He recognized those who have been affected by the global financial crisis, and by war and conflict. ""May your hearts be filled with hope and joy for the savior has been born for us,"" he said. He expressed solidarity with the victims of natural disasters and poverty, especially mentioning those who were forced to flee their homes. ""In the face of the exodus of all those who migrate from their homelands and are driven away by hunger, intolerance or environmental degradation, the church is a presence calling others to an attitude of acceptance and welcome,"" he said. He then sent Christmas greetings in 65 languages with tens of thousands gathered before him. The pope was not injured when an assailant, identified as Susanna Maiolo, lunged at him during mass Thursday night, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said. Maiolo, 25, is the same woman who tried to attack the pontiff on Christmas Eve last year, Lombardi said. She was detained by Vatican police and then taken to a mental institution, he added. The pope was quickly helped to his feet by his aides -- prompting cheers from the crowd -- and the service resumed, Lombardi said. John Allen, senior Vatican analyst for CNN, said such security breaches aren't uncommon. ""As compared to say, the president of the United States, the security membrane around the pope is pretty thin and fairly permeable,"" he said, citing similar past incidents, including one that happened last Christmas Eve. Allen said that generally, these disruptions are caused by people who aren't seeking real harm, but who want to be close to the pope. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","Pope Benedict XVI dragged to ground by woman during Christmas Eve Mass .

"(CNN)  -- Power-sharing talks in Zimbabwe have stalled, with the government and main opposition parties unable to agree on the distribution of ministries. A women holds a sign inside a Harare hotel where power-sharing talks took place Thursday. Just one day earlier, there were reports that President Robert Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) were close to reaching an agreement. But that fell apart Thursday. ""We've reached a deadlock on the issue of allocating ministries, therefore we've referred the issue to the facilitator hoping that he finds creative ways of unlocking that deadlock,"" said MDC spokesman, Nelson Chamisa. ""We are hoping that tomorrow the process will continue to try and find a resolution to the outstanding issues."" Mugabe acknowledged that the negotiations have stalled. ""We are hopeful for a breakthrough,"" he said. ""The MDC has their position, and we have ours. ""What we need is a compromise on both sides."" It was reported Wednesday that the ZANU-PF party would oversee the Justice and Legal Affairs Ministry, while the MDC would control the Finance Ministry. Mugabe sounded confident at the conclusion of Wednesday's negotiations, saying: ""We finish tomorrow."" But MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai was cautious. ""The proceedings have been going on quite circuitously, but we have not concluded,"" he said. Both parties said they would consider the deal overnight. However, MDC spokesman Chamisa said Thursday that the two sides were deadlocked. ""There has been some movement, but not enough to seal the deal,"" he said. It also appeared that more ministries remained on the table than had been indicated Wednesday. ""What we seek is to achieve an equal distribution of the key ministries and responsibilities for the sake of giving the deal a chance,"" Chamisa said. ""It is not on just Finance. They range up to 10: Justice, Information, Defense."" The allocation of government ministries had emerged as the latest hurdle in efforts to sort out the power-sharing deal signed by Mugabe and Tsvangirai on September 15. The deal allowed Mugabe to retain his office while making Tsvangirai the prime minister. Arthur Mutambara, head of an MDC splinter group, became deputy prime minister. The two sides were sorting out the distribution of Cabinet posts last Saturday, when the state-run newspaper published what it said was the official list. That list gave key government ministries to the ZANU-PF, including Defense, Home Affairs, Foreign Affairs and Justice and Legal Affairs. The MDC said it had not agreed to the selections, but a ZANU-PF spokesman said all parties had given their approval. Former South African President Thabo Mbeki, who mediated talks to reach the power-sharing deal, arrived in Zimbabwe on Monday to participate in the negotiations. Media reports Wednesday had suggested the talks were stalled because Mugabe wants to shield his generals -- accused of election violence earlier this year -- from prosecution. Giving ZANU-PF control of the Justice Ministry would ensure no generals are tried, and the MDC has assured Mugabe they will not go after those allegedly responsible for the violence, according to another CNN source. Of the other ministries, ZANU-PF was fighting hardest to retain finance, sources told CNN. They said the party fears that if the MDC controls that ministry, it could audit how money has been spent by Mugabe's government. It is widely believed that the government misappropriated funds and used the public purse for itself, enriching party loyalists with government contracts and neglecting to develop the economy, which has all but collapsed. ZANU-PF would let go of finance only if the MDC promised not to investigate how government money was used in the past, the sources said. The contention around the home affairs portfolio is more complex. Mugabe had suggested that ZANU-PF and MDC share that ministry, with each party having control for six months. For years, the home affairs portfolio has been under the control of a key Mugabe ally, a ZANU-PF faction called ZAPU that has helped Mugabe retain influence in Matabeleland, an area where the president is hated. Mugabe fears giving home affairs to the MDC will alienate ZAPU members, causing them to join the opposition and further weakening the ruling party. Home Affairs also controls the voter rolls, which Mugabe's government has been accused of manipulating. The recent disputes threatened the power-sharing agreement, which was to end months of turmoil and violence after the country's presidential election in March. Tsvangirai garnered the most votes but did not win enough to avoid a runoff with Mugabe, who has ruled the country since independence from Britain in 1980. The MDC leader withdrew days before the June 27 runoff, alleging that Mugabe's supporters had waged a campaign of violence and intimidation against opposition supporters.

"(CNN) -- Belarusian human rights activist Ales Bialiatski was convicted in Minsk of tax evasion Thursday and sentenced to 4Â½ years in prison, with all his assets confiscated, Human Rights Watch said. The successful prosecution of Bialiatski, head of Viasna Human Rights Center, was condemned by Human Rights Watch and the Lithuanian foreign minister, who's also the current chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). ""Ales Bialiatski's conviction is a disgraceful example of abusing the courts for political ends,"" Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. ""If you scratch just below the surface, the trial had next to nothing to do with tax evasion and everything to do with the Belarusian government trying to silence someone who for many years dared to help victims of abuse."" Lithuanian Foreign Minister Audronius Azubalis said the conviction showed that Belarus is repudiating Western standards and added he would nominate the human rights defender for the Nobel Peace Prize, according to the nongovernmental, Moscow-based Interfax news agency. ""This is an obvious sign that the Belarusian regime has turned its back on Europe and the entire Western democratic world and chosen other standards, tested by Eastern autocracies,"" said Azubalis, according to Interfax. Viasna Human Rights Center, established in Minsk in 1996 in the wake of opposition protests, has more recently been working on behalf of political prisoners and their families in Belarus following government crackdowns last December, Human Rights Watch said. Belarusian authorities withdrew the group's registration in 2003 and haven't granted it since, the rights group said. Human Rights Watch urged the Belarusian appellate court to overturn the conviction. A judge found Bialiatski guilty of large-scale tax evasion on his personal income, Human Rights Watch said. Defense attorneys said Bialiatski used the money from his accounts in Lithuania and Poland to support his human rights group -- not for personal income, the group said. The Belarusian secret service, the KGB, received an anonymous letter in October 2010 alleging that Bialiatski was concealing income and receiving foreign aid to finance ""radical opposition,"" which initiated the investigation, Human Rights Watch said. Lithuanian and Polish authorities gave Bialiatski's bank information to the Belarusian government, but they have since publicly apologized and suspended bilateral legal assistance treaties with Belarus, the group said. A Human Rights Watch court monitor found that the prosecution's case rested mainly on how Bialiatski maintained personal accounts in Lithuania and Poland, which he allegedly concealed from the Belarusian authorities, the rights group said. Details of Bialiatski's accounts from Lithuania and Poland were in the form of uncertified copies of bank printouts, even though Belarus law requires certified copies as legally admissible evidence, Human Rights Watch said. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Belarusian human rights activist Ales Bialiatski is sentenced to more than 4 years in prison .

"(CNN) -- Formula One world championship leader Mark Webber believes it is too early to start thinking about winning the title despite having a 14-point lead with only three races left. The main rivals to the Red Bull driver are his teammate Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, who are tied for second in the standings. McLaren pair Lewis Hamilton and reigning champion Jenson Button are also still in contention for the crown. Webber knows he will become champion if he wins one of the season's remaining races and scores podium finishes in the other two, with trips to Brazil and Abu Dhabi finishing off this year's calendar. The Australian driver told the official F1 website: ""It's ridiculous to start calculating things because a lot of things can happen. ""I win the next two races, it's all over anyway in terms of doing well. But this is another event, another race here and (I must) keep doing what I'm doing."" ""The (points) gap has been edging away, the right way in the last few races. I need to try to do that. Then just keep doing our best, that's the most important thing. I'm doing my best and then hopefully the result will take care of itself."" Alonso has made a big impression in his first season with Ferrari and will take away the positives even if he cannot land the title for the third time. ""In terms of happiness, in terms of motivation, driving, the team itself, it's the best one. Obviously it will be nice to become champion this year but even if we cannot do it, I will anyway have great, great memories of 2010."" Button and 2008 champion Hamilton know they have to make up ground fast at the Korea International Circuit this weekend. Button, who is fifth in the rankings, is aware of how difficult it will be for him to close the 31-point gap between himself and Webber, but he is excited to still be involved in the fight for the sport's top prize. ""It is good to still be involved in the championship hunt with three races to go,"" said Button. ""Obviously it's most difficult for me as I am 31 points behind. But there is always a possibility. ""We are still very hopeful and I am looking forward to the next three races. I am sure it is going to be pretty mixed up as we go through these next three races. That will make an exciting fight for the end of the season."" His fellow Briton Hamilton, who at present finds himself in fourth place, was also in bullish mood, despite trailing the Red Bulls and Ferrari in recent races. ""I think it's possible, anything's possible. ""I think you can tell that us, as a team, and the Ferraris as well, are pushing very hard because I don't think the gap is that big, so it's not impossible. I'm happy where I am, we're still in the fight for the championship, so it's not a bad position to be in."" With doubts being cast over Korea's ability to host the event, Vettel, who won the last round in Singapore, is pleased with what he has seen so far. ""I think the main things have been covered. We will see how grippy it will be, but given the fact there was a lot of concern and we were even talking about not racing here, lately they did a very good job.""","Mark Webber thinks it is too soon to talk about winning the F1 world title .

"(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso insists he is not thinking about the prospect of his Red Bull rivals Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel combining to deprive him of a third Formula One world title this weekend. The season comes to a climax at Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix with four drivers battling to take home motorsport's biggest prize. Ferrari's Alonso holds an eight-point lead over second-placed Webber, with Vettel in third 15 points off the top. McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton has an outside chance of claiming his second crown, being 24 points behind Alonso with only 25 on offer to the winner. With Red Bull having already secured the constructors' championship, this has led to speculation that the 23-year-old Vettel will be asked to allow his Australian teammate to overtake him if the pair are leading the field at the Yas Marina circuit. Latest F1 championship standings . But two-time champion Alonso -- whose team was fined $100,000 in September for telling Felipe Massa to allow the Spaniard to win July's German Grand Prix -- says he is focusing on his own race, needing a first or second-place finish to ensure another title. ""I don't think I would lose even one second of my energy this weekend thinking of what is going to happen on Sunday afternoon,"" the 29-year-old told F1's official website when asked whether he would understand if Vettel assisted Webber. ""Our only picture of the race at the moment is winning it or finishing second. That's the target and I think that's what we're going to achieve this weekend. ""I think there's not anything we can do other than try to finish second or first in the race, that is mathematically our position to win the championship, so it's our goal, from Friday to Sunday, our preparation will be to reach that target."" Vettel would not be drawn on whether he is planning to support his colleague during Sunday's race, but he did admit he was keen to avoid a repeat of this year's Turkish Grand Prix where he and Webber crashed while battling for position. ""If the situation occurs then I think we know that we're driving for the team,"" the German said. ""We have had some occasions this year where we got close and it didn't look too good, so I think the main target is not to repeat that, and the rest we will see. ""There are lots of things happening, and more important things happening before we enter this possible stage, whatever the scenario."" Meanwhile, Webber claimed he would take a lot of positive memories from the 2010 season, even if he does miss out on the world championship. ""I know that I've been very fortunate even to have a chance to get to this point,"" the 34-year-old said. ""It's been a very long season for all of us, and as the season's gone on we've achieved so many amazing things, and obviously, personally, for me, to have some very special weekends."" Hamilton must come home first and hope Alonso is outside the top-10 to stand any chance of repeating his 2008 success. ""I have nothing to lose,"" the 25-year-old British driver said. ""The guys in front of me have everything to lose, so for me I am going to be flat-out as always. ""They have got generally faster cars than me but that doesn't mean that we cannot fight for a win. Obviously I have to win this race. That's what we plan to do.""","Fernando Alonso is not concerned about possible Red Bull team orders in Sunday's season finale .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- A government warplane crashed north of the capital city of Yemen on Wednesday morning, state television reported. The television report blamed three members of the opposition for shooting down the plane. The incident came as anti-government protests continue to attract huge crowds. Opposition tribes shot down the aircraft as it was bombarding a residential compound in Arhab district, a number of eyewitnesses told CNN. ""The government is attacking and killing our loved ones because they have the weapons. We have to fight back and we will do so,"" said Abdullah al-Shaleef, a resident of Arhab who has clashed with government forces. The eyewitnesses said the government air raids Tuesday night on residential areas in Arhab and Nehm districts had killed two people and injured four. The plane came down in Bani Hareth, 7km (4 miles) south of Arhab, on the outskirts of the capital, Sanaa, they said. Earlier Tuesday, Yemen's defense minister escaped an assassination attempt when a suicide bomber attacked his convoy. The violence comes as anti-government protests in Yemen continue, with tens of thousands taking to the streets of Sanaa on Monday. President Ali Abdullah Saleh returned Friday from three months in Saudi Arabia, where he received medical treatment following an assassination attempt in June. The United States, the United Nations and the European Union have called on Yemen to halt the violence and called on both sides to establish a peaceful transfer of power.

"Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- The outspoken head of a Bahrain human rights group said Sunday that he was handcuffed, blindfolded and beaten when authorities detained him for about two hours. Nabeel Rajab of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights said about 25 people in about a dozen cars pulled up to his house early Sunday morning and took him to the offices of the interior ministry's investigative department. ""They said that they were looking for a suspect who was armed and thought I might know him,"" Rajab said. ""They beat me, punched me, kicked me, handcuffed me. Blindfolded me."" The government confirmed Rajab was arrested but did not provide additional details. Rajab and his group have been vocal about the government's violent crackdown on anti-regime protesters. Thousands of people have been demonstrating in Bahrain since last month, part of a wave that has spread through North Africa and the Middle East. To quell the unrest, Bahrain called in troops from members states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Police also arrested several prominent opposition figures in armed raids and without warrants, Amnesty International said. On Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Bahrain to allow its people to demonstrate peacefully as opposition members reported the death of a fifth protester. ""We have made clear that security alone cannot resolve the challenges facing Bahrain,"" Clinton said. ""Violence is not and cannot be the answer. A political process is. We have raised our concerns about the current measures directly with Bahraini officials and will continue to do so."" The demonstrators were killed when Bahraini security forces cleared protesters from the Pearl Roundabout in the capital, Manama, on Tuesday. The roundabout had been a rallying site for anti-government demonstrators since the unrest began. On Friday, the government demolished the landmark monument at the center of the traffic circle.

"(CNN) -- Unless governments in the Middle East stop offering ""cosmetic changes"" to calls for reform, they should brace themselves for another year of protests, Amnesty International warned Monday. The protests and bloodshed will continue unless governments and the international community ensure the demonstrators' demands are addressed, the rights group said in a new report. Protesters are not interested in ""piecemeal"" reforms, it said. ""With few exceptions, governments have failed to recognize that everything has changed,"" said Philip Luther, director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa. ""The protest movements across the region, led in many cases by young people and with women playing central roles, have proved astonishingly resilient in the face of sometimes staggering repression."" Protesters want accountability and change in governance, according to Luther. The 80-page report is called ""Year of Rebellion: State of Human Rights in the Middle East and North Africa."" It highlights the success of Tunisia, Egypt and Libya in removing their longtime regimes, but underscores the need to institute democracy to ensure past actions are not repeated. ""The uprising in Tunisia brought significant improvements in human rights, but one year on, many consider that the pace of change has been too slow, with families of the victims of the uprising still awaiting justice,"" Amnesty said. In Egypt, for example, military rulers are yet to deliver on demands of the revolution and are in some cases behind attacks that are ""worse than under Hosni Mubarak"" regime, the report said. Amnesty warned that some governments ""remained grimly determined to cling onto power"" at all costs, citing an example of Syria. ""Syrian armed forces and intelligence services have been responsible for a pattern of killings and torture amounting to crimes against humanity, in a vain attempt to terrify protesters and opponents into silence and submission,"" the report said. "" By the end of the year there were over 200 cases of reported deaths in custody, over 40 times the recent average annual figure for Syria."" International powers and regional bodies such as the United Nations and the African Union have taken a stronger stance in some nations than others, the report said. Despite the unequal treatment, the lack of foreign intervention has had it positives, according to Amnesty. ""What has been striking about the last year has been that -- with some exceptions -- change has largely been achieved through the efforts of local people coming onto the streets,"" Luther said. A Tunisian vegetable vendor torched himself out of economic despair last year, sparking the so-called Arab uprisings that led to the toppling of Tunisia, Libya and Egypt leaders. The uprisings continue in a series of other nations, including Syria, where President Bashar al-Assad is trying to cling to power amid monthslong protests. In Yemen, protests led to President Ali Abdullah Saleh agreeing to step down. The Yemeni government has approved the final draft of an immunity law that will give Saleh and his aides immunity from prosecution.","Report: Protests will rage on unless demands are met .

"(CNN) -- President Robert Mugabe's Zanu PF party dismissed Monday a ""confidential"" cable released by WikiLeaks that claims the Zimbabwean leader has cancer. WikiLeaks claimed Friday that Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor Gideon Gono had told the former U.S. ambassador Christopher Dell during a private meeting in 2006 that Mugabe had prostate cancer that had spread to other organs. ""If he was that ill (in 2006), how come he is still going strong? I have seen him for a long time and even last week, he has no health problems. There is a lot of things that are not true in that,"" said Rugare Gumbo, Zanu PF spokesperson, referring to the WikiLeaks cable. The cables claimed that Grace, Mugabe's wife, had told Gono that the 87-year-old was ""out of it about 75% of the time."" ""The governor (Gono) confided that Mugabe appeared to be deteriorating mentally and losing his capacity to balance factional interests,"" Dell wrote in his report after meeting Gono who has repeatedly denied claims of having an affair with Grace.

"(CNN) -- Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has rejected reports that the elite motorsport's owner CVC Capital Partners may sell up. Media mogul Rupert Murdoch is lining up a bid along with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, according to Sky News -- which is owned by Murdoch's News Corp. But the 80-year-old Ecclestone, who runs F1 on behalf of CVC since selling his rights to the private equity firm in 2006, said such a deal would not be in the commercial interests of the sport. ""Formula One is not for sale. And, anyway, we would not sell to a media company because it would restrict the ability to negotiate with other broadcasters,"" he told British newspaper The Times on Wednesday. Ecclestone, who first secured the rights to negotiate television contracts for races in the late 1970s, said News Corp had not made any approach to CVC. ""If they were interested for sure they would have called me and they haven't,"" he told Bloomsberg. ""If someone was to come along with an enormous offer, a lot more than it were worth, then they have to look at it. They have never talked about selling, though."" The current Concorde Agreement between the F1 teams expires next year, and Ferrari -- one of eight marques on the grid who made a failed breakaway bid in 2009 before signing the deal -- is reportedly among the parties seeking to wrest control of the sport from Ecclestone. The British entrepreneur has been helping German prosecutors investigating Gerhard Gribkowsky, who handled F1's sale to CVC five years ago. Gribkowsky, who has been arrested under suspicion of fraud, is a former employee of state-run BayernLB -- which had a stake in Formula One up to 2006. ""I have been co-operating with the State Prosecution Office's investigation of the affairs of Dr. Gribkowsky since the outset,"" Ecclestone said in a statement last week. ""When I was informed that there was a first suspicion in relation to my perceived involvement in the matter, I went to see the Senior State Prosecutor and her team in Munich earlier this month to clear up any allegations against me.

"(CNN) -- Liechtenstein, a tiny principality nestled in between Switzerland and Austria, is attempting to shake its tag as a tax haven following intense international pressure. Since 2008, it has signed at least 20 Tax Information Exchange Agreements with countries across the world including Germany, the UK and the United States. The principality's Hereditary Prince Alois said Liechtenstein still has strong banking secrecy but has a more open taxation system. ""I would say today we are a safe haven, rather than a tax haven,"" he said. Liechtenstein is one of Europe's most robust economies, but despite this Prince Alois is not immune to concerns over the eurozone debt crisis. According to the heir apparent, the general view of the situation is ""that we have to suffer in the next few years."" With this in mind the nation is considering cutting back its social security system as it faces the headwinds of Europe's economic crisis. The Prince said such a move would be unpopular, but there may be no option. ""Our social security system is on a higher level than Switzerland, people won't like it if we move down to a Swiss level, but it would be much easier,"" he told CNN. It's an area the Prince has identified which needs to adapt amidst the current uncertainty. That compares to the principality's manufacturing industry, which he says will more or less have the ability to continue in the same as it has always. Liechtenstein has a population of just 35,000 but has managed to build and sustain a strong industrialized economy, with production making up a large proportion of its GDP. The Prince said Liechtenstein's challenge was to ensure it remained an attractive business environment, and that it continued to lure highly skilled professionals. The principality's location is a major benefit, the Prince said. Its proximity to Switzerland, Australia and Germany allowed it to tap markets with high quality universities.

"London, England (CNN) -- A member of al Qaeda's wing in Yemen intent on staging an attack was arrested in Britain earlier this year, the British home secretary said Wednesday. Theresa May disclosed the development in a wide-ranging address on counter-terrorism, in which she discussed threats of violence and approaches to fighting them. ""Our police and agencies have been working to disrupt AQAP operatives in this country,"" she said, making reference to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. ""An AQAP associate was arrested here earlier this year. He is alleged to have been planning a terrorist attack in this country. Threats such as these are likely to continue."" Officials believe that AQAP is behind the recent plot to send bombs from Yemen to the United States. The group is based in Yemen, which has emerged as a major operating base for al Qaeda and other terror groups.  May noted that ""one of the devices was intercepted and made safe here."" She said in the wake of that incident, Britain ordered the suspension of air freight from Yemen and other actions, such as the ""suspension of unaccompanied air freight from Somalia."" ""The specifics of this attack -- notably the type of device and how it was concealed -- were new to us.  The principle of the attack -- a device placed in unaccompanied baggage -- was not. It bears some resemblance to the attack on Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie in 1988."" She said last week's incident showed ""beyond doubt"" that ""we will continue to face a threat from international terrorism for the foreseeable future."" That threat is now more diverse and more fragmented than ever before,"" said May, who emphasized that ""public policy must respond to this changing threat."" May said that last month the government came out with a national security strategy that said terror from Northern Ireland and in the international realm ""remain two of the highest risks our country faces."" She pointed out that an explosive device intended to cause civilian casualties was found Saturday in a car at the Belfast airport. ""It is testimony to the success of the police and the agencies that we have not had a successful attack in this country since 2007 and there have been no casualties since 2005. But as we saw last week, the absence of an attack does not mean an absence of threat."" She says al Qaeda is weaker but still remains dangerous. ""We should neither overstate the strength and significance of al Qaeda, nor underestimate its continuing capability,"" she said. May cited the dangers of Al-Shabaab, the militant group in Somalia ""just across the Red Sea from Yemen."" That group ""has developed links to al Qaeda and, we assess, to AQAP. It thrives in a failed state. It has aspirations beyond Somali borders."" She also mentions the North African group al Qaeda in the Maghreb, which has resorted to kidnapping. ""We do not believe the group yet has the capability to carry out a terrorist attack on British soil, but I don't doubt that would be their aspiration."" She said there has been an emergence of a ""more diverse and devolved terrorist threat"" that lacks a ""strong, directive and commanding center and (is) joined more by ideology than hierarchy."" ""The attempted attack in Times Square by the Pakistani Taliban perfectly illustrates the challenge we face,"" referring to a failed attempt to set off a bomb in New York's Times Square. May cited the ""new and deadly method of attack"" utilized by Lashkar-e Taiba in the November 2008 Mumbai strike. ""These attacks were conducted by terrorists with assault rifles, handguns and improvised explosive devices. The attackers also used off-the-shelf technology -- satellite guidance and encrypted communications -- which you can buy across the counter anywhere in the world. ""We cannot assume that such an attack would be replicated exactly here, but we must plan for the possibility of a terrorist firearms attack in this country."" May also stressed the importance of balancing liberty and safety. ""We want to ensure that where powers are intrusive they are proportionate to the threat, necessary to reduce it to a level which we judge acceptable, and effective. These criteria -- proportionality, necessity and impact -- are vital."" She said it is important to tackle the causes of terror, such as some social and economic factors. ""We need a new approach to our engagement with Britain's Muslim communities -- one that helps to create the integrated society that we need. ""We will stop talking to Muslim communities only about counter-terrorism, and start treating them like the mature and integral parts of society that they are."" She also emphasized that success in domestic counter-terror requires ""international cooperation and collaboration overseas.""","Theresa May delivered an address on counter-terrorism .

"(CNN) -- The Ugandan government paraded four suspects in last month's deadly bombings in Kampala before reporters Thursday, with one of the men calling himself an ""evil man."" ""I know no one can believe that I did this evil,"" said one suspect, Idris Nsubuga, who spoke at a press conference organized by government officials. ""...But deep down in me I broke down -- honestly I didn't know the impact of those explosives."" A series of bomb blasts that Ugandan police say were likely set off by suicide bombers tore through an Ethiopian restaurant and a rugby center during a World Cup match July 11, killing 79 people. The government raised the death toll, which it had previously set at 76, on Thursday. ""Now before you I have these four individuals, they are all Ugandans, and these are the ones who are responsible for the execution of the operation,"" Uganda's chief military intelligence officer, James Mugira, said at the Thursday press conference. ""We have apprehended all those who are responsible for financing, planning and execution of the operation,"" he said. Uganda announced last month that it had charged three people in connection with the bomb blasts, saying they were extradited from Kenya. At a separate press conference Thursday, Ugandan Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura said he believed the four men presented on are members of al Qaeda. One of the suspects cried at Thursday's event. Nsubuga, 30, recalled his thoughts and actions on the night of the bombings. ""I was tense -- I called a friend just to relieve myself of the tension just to know how the match was,"" he said, referring to his time waiting at the rugby center and wondering about the World Cup finals. ""I had just finished talking to that friend a few minutes passed, and that's when the first blast went off,"" Nsubuga said. ""It scared me, and I reached in my pocket and pulled out the other phone and called that number."" That call triggered another bomb. ""I want to extend my sincere apologies to the families and friends of all those who perished in that tragic night,"" Nsubuga said. ""I thought by answering this call my life would be better,"" he said. ""But it changed it entirely -- I've never been the same since then."" The Al-Shabaab militant group, which is currently battling the weak transitional government in war-torn Somalia, has claimed responsibility for the bombings. Members of the group have said they were acting in retaliation for Uganda's contribution of troops for peacekeeping operations in Somalia, which has been at war for nearly two decades. Authorities in Uganda and Kenya previously said they had made more than 20 arrests in connection with the blasts.","One of the suspects called himself and ""evil man""

"(CNN) -- A Bahraini hunger striker protesting the assault and detention of her father and husband was taken to hospital Sunday but was released after refusing an intravenous tube, a human rights activist told CNN. Zainab Al-Khawaja was entering the sixth day of her hunger strike when her health deteriorated to the point that her family took her to the hospital, said Nabeel Rajab, head of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights. She was so ill that she could not talk or move, he said. At the hospital, however, Al-Khawaja refused to allow doctors to administer an IV, and she returned home, Rajab said. On April 9, at 3 a.m., masked officers burst into Zainab Al-Khawaja's home and assaulted her father, Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, and her husband, Mohammed Al-Masqati, according to family members and human rights activists. Zainab Al-Khawaja said the officers beat her father severely. Abdulhadi Al-Khawajais a former president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights. In February, he resigned from his position as director of the Middle East-North Africa region for the International Foundation for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders' Front Line organization. The Bahraini government declined to comment on Al-Khawaja's case. Human Rights Watch says Bahraini police forces have arrested more than 430 people in recent weeks, often violently and late at night.

"(CNN) -- Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone confirmed on Monday a decision on rearranging the postponed Bahrain Grand Prix will be made prior to the start of the 2011 season. Ecclestone, 80, also ruled out a replacement venue being used after political unrest in the Gulf kingdom led to the opening race of the new season being called off. Although the elite motorsport's season will now begin on March 27 in Australia, instead of the scheduled March 13 kick-off in Bahrain, Ecclestone admitted it could be fitted in at a later date. ""The FIA World Council will meet at the beginning of March and could look into the situation,"" the Briton told Formula One's official website. Bahrain Grand Prix called off . ""I have already spoken with FIA President Jean Todt about the possibility of finding a new date and we both agreed that a decision has to be made before the season starts."" The sport's rights-holder also suggested the grand prix could be rescheduled for Formula One's mid-season break in July, during the oppressive heat of the Bahraini summer. ""We don't need an alternative race anywhere in Europe or any other place. We need a race in Bahrain. If the Crown Prince is of the opinion that his country is able to host a race we will return to Bahrain. ""I think the teams are sensible enough even to race in Bahrain in the summer break, and despite high temperatures, because this is the way we can support the country."" Ecclestone also said a decision on whether or not to hold the race at the country's Bahrain International Circuit could not have been made any sooner. The grand prix was officially axed on February 21. ""Shortly before the crisis I had lunch with the Crown Prince (HRH Prince Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa) and there was absolutely no indication of what would come just days after. ""He asked what I would do if I were him, and I answered, 'You are there. We in Europe are hardly in the situation to make a serious judgment of the conditions. Decide what is best for your country.' ""He then cancelled the race and I think it was the right decision.""

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Police in India summarily execute prisoners, torture and threaten suspects and arrest people without reason, a leading rights group said Tuesday. Human Rights Watch says individial officers are not to blame for abuses. India's police have largely failed to evolve from the repressive forces they were designed to be under Britain's colonial regime, according to a new report by the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch. ""While 60 years later, much of India is in the process of rapid modernization, the police continue to use their old methods,"" the group said. Officials at the Federal Home Ministry -- which is responsible for the police -- offered no immediate comment. The report cited abuse and threats as a primary tactic for investigating crime and enforcing the law in India. It said the system rather than individual officers or commanders was partly to blame. ""The institutional culture of police practically discourages officers from acting otherwise, failing to give them the resources, training, ethical environment and encouragement to develop professional police tactics,"" it said. The Federal Home Ministry will study the report before responding, said R.K. Sharma, its deputy secretary dealing with human rights issues, but some former police officers agreed that the force had yet to modernize. Nikhil Kumar, former police commissioner of New Delhi and head of an association of retired officers from the Indian capital, charged that almost all Indian states had been reluctant to carry out police reforms. State chief ministers, he said, had rejected any moves aimed at granting greater autonomy to the police for fear it would loosen their control over the force. ""The police inherited a colonial legacy. In the last 60 years or so, they should have come out of it, but this hasn't happened. What has happened is that British masters have been replaced by Indian masters,"" Kumar remarked. The legal basis for much of India's state and federal police services is a law dating back to 1861, which was drafted in the wake of an 1857 uprising against British rule. India gained its independence from Britain in 1947. Kumar said a national police commission had recommended scrapping the 1861 law some 30 years ago, but said it had not been acted upon except for what he called ""small changes."" Top serving officers from Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, states HRW used for its field research, refused comment on the report. ""I have to study it first,"" Karnataka police chief Ajay Kumar Singh said. Brij Lal, additional director general of police in Uttar Pradesh, gave the same response. Successive governments for decades have failed to deliver on promises to hold the police accountable for abuses and to build professional, rights-respecting police forces, HRW said. ""Colonial-era police laws enable state and local politicians to interfere routinely in police operations, sometimes directing police officers to drop investigations against people with political connections, including known criminals, and to harass or file false charges against political opponents,"" it added. Moreover, abysmal conditions for police officers also contribute to violations, the report noted. Low-ranking officers often work in difficult conditions and are required to be on-call 24 hours a day, every day, it said. ""They often lack necessary equipment, including vehicles, mobile phones, investigative tools and even paper on which to record complaints and make notes,"" the HRW said. The 118-page report, ""Broken System: Dysfunction, Abuse and Impunity in the Indian Police,"" is based on interviews with more than 80 police officers of varying ranks, 60 people who said they were victims of police abuse, and numerous discussions with experts and civil society activists. ""It's time for the government to stop talking about reform and fix the system,"" said Brad Adams, HRW's Asia director, in a statement.","Human Rights Watch accuses Indian police of abuses .
Group blames colonial-era police system rather than individuals .

"(CNN) -- Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone has reportedly cast doubt on the participation of two new teams ahead of the 2010 season, suggesting that a Serbian outfit will instead be on the starting grid in Bahrain. The Stefan Grand Prix team, owned by businessman Zoran Stefanovic, announced this week that they have already sent a container of equipment to Bahrain and will be testing drivers in Portugal later this month. Last year Stefan GP applied to take part in 2010 but missed out when Virgin Racing, Campos Meta 1 and U.S. F1 Team were handed places, and then Sauber salvaged a spot on the grid despite the pullout of BMW. Stefan GP have also announced a technical support deal with Toyota, who withdrew from F1 last year and have reportedly sold equipment and cars to the Serbians. Web site Autosport.com has reported that Stefan have been working with former McLaren chief designer Mike Coughlan, who was sacked in 2007 due to his involvement in the Ferrari spy scandal. Ecclestone told German sports paper Sport Bild that he doubted that Campos and US F1 would be ready for the opening race in Bahrain on March 15. ""I do not believe in the participation of U.S. F1 and Campos,"" the 79-year-old said. ""Instead, I have good contacts with Stefan GP and would like to give this team a good starting point. Ralf Schumacher would be the perfect driver for them, he knows the team and he has experience."" Schumacher, the younger brother of recently-returned seven-time world champion Michael, has not raced in F1 since leaving Toyota at the end of 2007. He drove in the DTM touring car series in 2008, finishing 14th. Autosport claims that former Williams driver Kazuki Nakajima will be involved with Stefan, who plan to launch their new car before tests at the Portimao circuit on February 25-28. ""SGP Team will be testing with two drivers over three days. [The] identity of drivers will be announced in due course. First driver has already two years in F1,"" Stefan said on their official Web site on Tuesday.","Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone casts doubt on two new teams ahead of 2010 season .

"(CNN)  -- FIFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against six match officials after claims that two international friendly games fell victim to match-fixing. The games under suspicion are Bulgaria against Estonia and Latvia against Bolivia, two friendlies which took place last month. Football's world governing body was alerted after unusual betting patterns on the two games, which were both held at the Turkish resort of Antalya. A FIFA statement Wednesday read: ""FIFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against six match officials in relation to the international friendly matches Bolivia v Latvia and Estonia v Bulgaria played in Antalya (Turkey) on 9 February 2011."" It continued: ""The proceedings were opened following an evaluation of all documentation and information received by FIFA, in relation to a possible match-fixing situation in these matches. ""The FIFA Disciplinary Committee will be in charge to deal with the matter."" Latvia beat Bolivia 2-1 before Bulgaria and Estonia played out a 2-2 draw, with all seven goals coming from the penalty spot. At the time, Estonian Football Association spokesman Mihkel Uiboleht admitted there had been concern about the matches. He told CNN: ""The friendly was organized by an agency with whom we will not work any more. ""We received information of possible manipulation even before the game as the same agency also organized the match between Latvia and Bolivia and there was the same scenario there."" FIFA has demanded a detailed report on the matches from both the Bulgarian and Estonian football federations.","FIFA places six match officials under investigation after match-fixing claims .

"(CNN) -- The man who led Germany to a World Cup win both as a player and a coach admits he has lost faith in FIFA due to the way the voting process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments was handled. Franz Beckenbauer, a member of FIFA's executive committee, criticized football's governing body after the amount of votes each bidder received was made public. Beckenbauer was one of the 22 FIFA members who voted in the process and claims he was assured that the details would remain private. Yet soon after it was announced that Russia had won the right to host the 2018 competition, and Qatar had secured the 2022 version, media were reporting that two of the favorites, England and Australia, attracted just two votes and one vote respectively. It led to an angry reaction from representatives of the England and Australia bid teams and Beckenbauer acknowledges his faith in FIFA has been shaken as a result. ""I am disappointed with the way FIFA dealt with the result. The seven losing countries were treated disgracefully, particularly England and Australia, Beckenbauer told German newspaper Bild. ""All of us ExCo members were told ahead of the ballot that neither we nor the public would ever know the exact number of votes for each country. After each round of voting we were told only which country had been ruled out. ""Then, a few hours later, I was hearing from journalists what the exact voting had been. It's certainly affected my confidence in FIFA."" England were particularly vociferous in their criticism of FIFA and claimed several committee members promised them votes that didn't materialize. Ron Walker, a member of the Australian Football Federation, claimed the voting process had been ""contaminated"" in the year leading up to the announcement on December 2. Beckenbauer was instrumental in taking the World Cup to Germany in 2006 having won the tournament as a player in 1974 and as a coach in 1990. He announced in November that he will step down from his current role with FIFA in March in order to spend more time with his family.","Franz Beckenbauer says he's lost faith in FIFA after the World Cup voting process .

"(CNN) -- FIFA has requested evidence from England's Football Association following claims from its former chairman of corruption by four top-level members of world soccer's governing body. It has also asked The Sunday Times newspaper to provide details about further claims that two more FIFA executive committee members were paid $1.5 million to vote for Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup. David Triesman was head of England's failed bid to host the 2018 tournament before standing down after being secretly taped by a reporter last May making accusations against rival candidate nations Spain and Russia. On Tuesday, the former FA chairman told a British parliamentary committee that Jack Warner, Nicolas Leoz, Ricardo Teixeira and Worawi Makudi had all sought favors in order to secure England's vote. Triesman accuses FIFA members of seeking bribes for votes . The Sunday Times also submitted evidence to the UK House of Commons hearing alleging that FIFA vice-president Issa Hayatou of Cameroon and Jacques Anouma from the Ivory Coast were paid by Qatar. FIFA has already suspended executive members Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii following similar accusations ahead of last December's World Cup ballot. Nigeria's Adamu is trying to overturn his three-year suspension from all football activities at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. FIFA said on Wednesday that its secretary general Jerome Valcke had written to Football Association chairman David Bernstein asking for a complete report from Triesman on the statements that he made as well as ""any and all documentary evidence at his disposal in relation to those statements."" ""He has also sent a letter to The Sunday Times to ask the newspaper to provide FIFA with any piece of evidence with regard to the statements made to MP John Whittingdale,"" FIFA said in a statement on its website. Can Bin Hammam change FIFA for the better? Valcke said in his letter that FIFA and its president Sepp Blatter were concerned about the accusations, and had also asked for a full record of Triesman's testimonies in the House of Commons. The ruling body stated that it believed The Sunday Times ""had already provided all of the evidence and documentation at its disposal"" before these latest allegations. ""Nevertheless, FIFA asks the English newspaper to submit as soon as possible any other piece of evidence that it may be in possession of and which has not yet been sent to FIFA,"" it said. ""In particular, reference is made in the letter to the allegations regarding a 'whistleblower who had worked with the Qatar bid,' who allegedly made some declarations regarding the matter in question."" Mohamed Bin Hammam, who is Blatter's only rival at next month's presidential elections, denied on Wednesday that his native country had offered any such bribes. ""I can assure you nothing like this has happened from our side. If someone wants to damage reputations like this then they have to provide the proof,"" the the president of the Asian Football Confederation told the UK Press Association. ""You can't just accuse people just like that. It didn't happen. It is fine to say something, to try to damage the reputation of somebody, but where is the proof?"" Warner, accused by Triesman of demanding £2.5 million ($4 million) to build an education center in Trinidad, has also denied any wrongdoing. ""I never asked anybody for anything. When these guys came here, we promised to help,"" the 68-year-old told Trinidad newspaper Newsday. ""I showed them a place where they can put a playground. They promised to come back but they never did. That's all.""","FIFA urges English FA and Sunday Times newspaper to provide evidence .

"(CNN) -- Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has paid tribute to former Lotus boss Peter Warr, who died of a heart attack aged 72 on Monday. Warr took over the management of the of the F1 team in 1969, and enjoyed a successful career in motorsport in the 1970s and '80s. ""When Peter was in Formula One he helped me to build it to what it is today,"" the 79-year-old Ecclestone told the official F1 website on Wednesday. ""Not only have I lost a good friend but Peter Warr will be missed by the thousands of people that knew him."" As a driver Warr won the Japanese Grand Prix for Lotus in 1963, but his career in motor racing flourished when founder Colin Chapman asked him to become the manager of the team six years later. The Briton guided Brazil's Emmerson Fittipaldi to win the world championship in 1972, before going on to run the newly-created Wolf team. Warr then returned to his origins at Lotus in 1982, taking over as principal after Chapman's death. He worked with then-upcoming stars Nigel Mansell, Ayrton Senna and Nelson Piquet before stepping down from his role in 1989. The former officer in Queen Elizabeth's Royal Guards became a steward for motorsport's governing body the FIA, and later secretary of the British Racing Drivers' Club. Warr retired to live in France but was a guest at this year's season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix in March.

"(CNN) -- Peter Hedblom overcame a final-round charge from fellow Swedish golfer Martin Erlandsson to win the Johnnie Walker Championship by one shot in Scotland on Sunday. Peter Hedblom went one better than his second-placed finish at the KLM Open last weekend. Erlandsson had resumed play in 20th place six shots adrift of third-round leader Hedblom, but surged up the leaderboard with a sensational 10-under-par 62 to set the clubhouse lead on 12-under 276. The 35-year-old, who was third at Gleneagles two years ago after a closing 66, birdied seven successive holes from six to 12. He had already picked up shots at two of his opening four greens, then also birdied 17. Hedblom, however, kept his nerve as he went one better than last weekend, when he lost the Dutch KLM Open in a play-off with England's Simon Dyson -- the fourth time out of four he has been beaten in sudden death. The 39-year-old started birdie-bogey-birdie, then rattled off four successive birdies before dropping a shot at the 15th hole. However, he immediately bounced back with a birdie at the par-five 16th and parred the last two to take victory, his third on the European Tour following wins in Malaysia and Morocco. He carded a five-under 67 to follow up successive rounds of 68 as he denied world No. 365 Erlandsson a maiden title on the circuit. Erlandsson is becoming noted as a strong finisher, having closed with a course-record 63 at the KLM Open, where he tied for 15th. Defending champion Gregory Havret of France closed with 67 to share third place on 278 with former British Open champion Paul Lawrie, who carded 69 after starting the day one shot adrift of Hedblom in second. The Scot had led the tournament for the first two rounds, in which he did not drop a stroke. His final round featured an eagle on the par-five ninth hole, which followed two birdies, but his title challenge faded with bogeys at 12 and 15. Lawrie's compatriot Gary Orr was fourth on nine-under 279 following a fine 64, which featured 10 birdies and a double-bogey at the par-four fifth hole.","Peter Hedblom wins Johnnie Walker Championship by one shot in Scotland .

"(CNN) -- FIFA appointed a normalization committee on Tuesday aimed at reforming the currently suspended Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Federation (FFBH). The FFBH was banned from international football and continental club competition on April 1 after it failed to amend its three-headed presidency, which saw a Bosnian, a Croat and a Serb all perform the role at the head of the organization. The split in the presidency reflects the political make-up of the former Yugoslav republic and mirrors the nature of the domestic presidency, which since the end of the Bosnian war in 1995 has rotated every eight months to a leader from one of the three separate ethnic groups. But football's governing body and the organization in charge of Europe, UEFA, require the FFBH to provide a single figurehead. Six stakeholders will make up the committee, two from each ethnic background, with the honorary president of the Slovakian association taking an advisory role. Bosnia and Herzegovina hit with international ban . ""The FIFA Emergency Committee has decided to appoint a normalization committee in order to solve the problems faced by the FFBH,"" read a statement of FIFA's official web site. ""A six-person normalization committee made up of football personalities from Bosnia-Herzegovina has been established and put in place with immediate effect."" The newly-instated group will be charged with severing all ties to the previous regime, which FIFA claimed had led taken ""some major financial risks, which may even lead to bankruptcy due to its debts towards the tax authorities."" National team coach Safet Susic, whose team currently sit fourth in Euro 2012 qualifying Group D, will remain suspended from competitive matches until FIFA and UEFA statutes have been adopted by the FFBH. The normalization committee's first responsibility will be to call a general assembly before May 26, before electing new representatives by no later than November 30. After the ballot, the committee would hand over responsibility for football in Bosnia and Herzegovina to the elected parties. As the situation stands, Susic's squad will be unable to fulfill their next qualifying fixture against Romania on June 3.","FIFA have appointed a committee to reform the Bosnia and Herzegovina federation .

"(CNN) -- FIFA has suspended two of its top officials as it probes reports they solicited bribes in exchange for supporting 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids, the world soccer governing body announced Wednesday. Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii are barred from taking part in any soccer-related activity -- whether it is administrative tasks, athletic competitions or otherwise. The bans take effect immediately, though the move is ""provisional"" and could be reversed as the investigation continues. ""Today is a sad day for football and for FIFA,"" said Claudio Sulser, chairman of FIFA's ethics committee, which voted unanimously to issue the suspensions. A FIFA member since 2006, Adamu, 57, is the director of sports development in his native Nigeria. Temarii, 43, is president of the Oceania Football Confederation and advisor to the French Polynesian government. He has been on FIFA's executive committee for the past six years. In addition, the ethics committee provisionally suspended four other officials -- Slim Aloulou, Amadou Diakite, Ahongalu Fusimalohi and Ismael Bhamjee -- from soccer-related activities after tying them to the World Cup bribe scandal. All four are members of international soccer federations affiliated with FIFA. The announcement comes three days after the Sunday Times of London published an article headlined, ""World Cup votes for sale."" In an undercover operation, the newspaper's reporters said they approached six current or former FIFA officials, all of whom ""suggested paying huge bribes to FIFA executive committee members."" Two of the six asked for direct payment themselves, the paper reported. FIFA began investigating Adamu and Temarii on Monday. The ethics committee will meet again in mid-November as it investigates all six cases, according to FIFA. The six suspensions will last 30 days and could be extended another 20 days, FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke said Wednesday. ""We have enough time until mid-November to see if (the allegations) are more than rumors, but facts,"" said Valcke. There are four candidates, all in Europe, to host the 2018 tournament: England, Russia and a pair of dual bids, one from Spain and Portugal, the other from Belgium and the Netherlands. The United States, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Qatar all hope to be home to the 2022 tournament. All the committees behind each country's World Cup bids have denied wrongdoing, according to the Sunday Times. FIFA's Switzerland-based executive committee will meet in Zurich on October 28 and 29 to further discuss the final voting process ahead of the December 2 decision on both tournaments.

"(CNN) -- They are the beautiful game's must-have fashion accessory -- but now soccer's governing body are considering a ban on snoods. The trend of wearing a neck-warmer has become prevalent in the European game, especially in the English Premier League with stars such as Manchester City's Carlos Tevez and Arsenal midfielder Samir Nasri sporting them. But FIFA now say they could be outlawed from football if they are proved to be a safety issue. A FIFA spokesman said: ""We want a debate over the snood and whether it could be dangerous. ""There may be a safety issue -- if for example a player was running through on goal and an opponent grabbed his snood, that could pose a potential danger to his neck.""

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The Iraqi Olympic Committee said Saturday it stands by its decision to disband the country's soccer association -- a move that led to the association's suspension from international football. World governing body FIFA said Friday it had decided to suspend the Iraqi Football Association (IFA) because of the Iraqi Olympic Committee's move to disband it. FIFA described that as governmental interference. The suspension means Iraqi soccer clubs and teams may not play in international matches or receive financial assistance, though FIFA made an exception for Iraqi female players to play in a weeklong under-16 regional football festival in Jordan starting Sunday. FIFA said it learned Monday that the Iraqi Olympic Committee had disbanded the IFA and that governmental security forces had seized control of the IFA headquarters. FIFA officials gave the committee 72 hours to revoke the decision and hand the headquarters back to the IFA. ""The deadline has expired without revocation of the decision by the Iraqi Olympic Committee and the IFA has not been restored to its headquarters,"" FIFA said in a statement Friday. ""The FIFA Emergency Committee has therefore decided to immediately suspend the IFA until the decision of the Iraqi Olympic Committee is revoked and the IFA retakes possession of its offices."" The Iraqi Olympic Committee's actions are in ""total contradiction"" to FIFA statutes, which require national teams to have full independence, FIFA said. Two top Iraqi officials said Saturday the decision to disband the IFA was based on financial and administrative irregularities and violations, and that they were not surprised by FIFA's decision and had expected it. Samir al-Moussawi, a senior member of the Iraqi Olympic Committee, told CNN he was hopeful the issue could be resolved with FIFA in the coming days, and that the Olympic committee had international lawyers working on the issue. He denied, however, that government security forces had seized IFA headquarters, saying the men were protection services personnel guarding the building. Ali al-Dabbagh, the Iraqi government spokesman who has been delegated for months to deal with the International Olympic Committee, told CNN he will work on cooperating with FIFA's demands and holding transparent IFA elections. He said the suspension ""will not have a major effect"" on Iraqi football because the national team has no international matches scheduled over the next six months. It is the second time FIFA has suspended Iraqi football. The first time was in May last year, after the Iraqi government dissolved the national Olympic committee and all national sports federations. FIFA lifted the ban after the Iraqi government excluded the IFA from dissolution. Iraqi soccer has come a long way since the days of Saddam Hussein, when Hussein's son, Uday, was president of the Iraqi Olympic Committee and regularly threatened players with physical violence and torture if they played poorly. The national soccer team has continued playing, however, and has been viewed as something that has united Iraqis across sectarian lines. Although Iraq has not qualified for next year's World Cup in South Africa, the national team was able to celebrate becoming the Asia champions in 2007. In July, Iraq played its first home game since 2002, beating its Palestinian opponents 4-0. Tens of thousands attended the match in the capital after FIFA lifted its ban on international games in Iraq. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","Iraqi Olympic Committee stands by decision to disband Iraqi football association .

"(CNN) -- FIFA have confirmed they made $3.655 billion from the World Cup in South Africa, after the organization announced buoyant financial figures between 2007 and 2010. President Sepp Blatter said that the figures proved it was the right decision to award the 2010 tournament to South Africa, despite fears that hosting the biggest event in football on the continent was a financial risk. ""I am the happiest man to announce that the World Cup in South Africa was a huge, huge financial success for everybody -- for Africa for South Africa, for FIFA,"" Blatter told reporters after a meeting of the executive committee of football's world governing body in Zurich on Thursday. ""For the first time in FIFA's four-year accounts we are over four billion dollars,"" the Swiss added. Deputy secretary general and finance chief Markus Kattner confirmed that FIFA earned $4.189 billion over the last four years -- 87% of which came from the 2010 World Cup. Kattner said that the the bulk of the organization's earnings came from the sale of broadcasting rights and marketing or sponsorship contracts from the tournament. However, as a non-profit organization under Swiss law, the $631 million surplus raised by FIFA in 2010 will be distributed among footballing nations to be re-invested back into the game. Meanwhile, Blatter also said that he expected to be unchallenged for a fourth term as FIFA president when elections take place in June this year. This is despite American Sports Illustrated journalist Grant Wahl having stated his intention to challenge Blatter. Mohammed Bin Hammam, president of the Asian Football Confederation, is also expected to run. Blatter has been president of FIFA since 1998 and was recently criticized over his handling over the World Cup cash-for-votes scandal. ""There was not one single approach as long as I am informed for candidates for the future,"" the 72-year-old, who revealed he he had received nomination for his own candidature from the Somalia Football Federation on Thursday.","FIFA announce they made $3.6 billion from World Cup in South Africa .

"(CNN) -- Michel Platini has positioned himself for a future tilt at the FIFA presidency by claiming that world soccer's ruling body needs to be run by sporting specialists rather than administrators such as the incumbent Sepp Blatter. Platini, one of France's greatest players, has backed the 75-year-old Blatter to be re-elected next week if he is not found guilty of corruption at a hearing on Sunday. ""Of course I support him. But we will see. If these allegations are proved, I can't support him anymore,"" he told CNN World Sport's Pedro Pinto on Saturday. ""I don't know what the disciplinary will say. But I will support him."" FIFA includes Blatter in bribery probe . Platini, also a FIFA vice-president as well as being head of European football at UEFA, said the ruling body needed to follow the example of the International Olympic Committee. ""I think that FIFA is like the IOC was some years ago, I think we are at the end of a system based on politics,"" the 55-year-old said. ""The future of this big international sports company is owned by people who are specialists -- not political people like you have Mr. Juan Antonio Samaranch in the IOC, Mr. Havelange, Mr. Blatter who comes from politics, and you have many companies like that in sport. ""I think it will finish in the next few years and we will have people from the sport. I think FIFA has to come back to football."" FIFA to investigate new bribery allegations .

Bin Hammam himself faces an investigation along with FIFA vice-president Jack Warner after a report by colleague Chuck Blazer indicated they had offered cash payments to delegates at a Caribbean Football Union meeting this month in return for voting for the Qatari on Wednesday. Bin Hammam, head of the Asian Football Confederation, claimed that Blatter would have known about any such payments and therefore should have reported them himself. There have also been claims that Qatar bribed voters to win the right to host the 2022 World Cup last December, which Hammam also denied. Platini said he was surprised that the probe will happen before the election. ""I don't understand why you can't do the election quietly and then you open the case. I know you can say everything, but you need evidence and I have no evidence or nothing,"" he said. ""We will wait for what the disciplinary committee says and then I don't know what will happen.

"(CNN) -- The Italian Grand Prix will be held at the historic Monza track until 2016 after a new four-year deal was clinched. Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone confirmed the new contract with the company that run the track on Thursday. There had been speculation that Rome would replace Monza as the venue of the Italian Grand Prix after Ecclestone confirmed plans to stage a race in the capital. But a new contract means Monza's future is secure for at least another six years. ""The Italian Grand Prix will be at Monza until 2016,"" Claudio Vigano, the head of SIAS, the company that controls the circuit, told reporters. ""The extension of the contract has been signed."" Monza is one of the most famous tracks on the F1 circuit and hosted its first Grand Prix in 1922. This year's event is scheduled for September 12. Ecclestone also suggested that F1 could return to Indianapolis in the United States after the weekend's opening race of the season in Bahrain. He told Reuters.com: ""It's only the fact that it's all the wrong crowd and the wrong people. Nothing worked there really, we'd have to have a big change round but we'd like to get back there."" The F1 season currently runs 19 races but Ecclestone has confirmed that India will host one next year.","The Italian Grand Prix will remain at Monza until 2016 .

"(CNN) -- Football superstar David Beckham has condemned controversial comments made by Sepp Blatter, who is refusing to stand down as FIFA president despite widespread criticism. The head of world soccer sparked fury when he told CNN World Sport that racism is not a problem on the football field, and that any issue could be resolved by ""shaking hands"" after a match. Beckham, who was a leading figure in England's failed bid to host the 2018 World Cup, said that the Swiss administrator had made a big mistake. ""Something has to happen because those kind of remarks from a man who is so high up in the game is obviously not right,"" the 36-year-old told CNN ahead of Sunday's MLS Cup final between his Los Angeles Galaxy team and Houston Dynamo. Pedro Pinto: My crazy day with Sepp Blatter . ""And, it's obviously something that I don't personally agree with, and I think everyone else doesn't agree with. Things can't be just sorted out by a handshake, simple as that. ""What will happen with Sepp Blatter in the future, I have no idea and obviously I have not control over that. But, all I care about is keeping racism out of soccer and out of sport, because it's not just in sport, it's in life in general. It needs to be stopped, and we hope we're a part of that."" Former England international Ian Wright revealed on Friday that he now cannot host the prestigious FIFA Ballon D'Or awards ceremony in January due to his anger at Blatter's comments. ""There is simply no way I feel I could stand on that stage in Zurich, in front of Lionel Messi, Pele, David Beckham, Ronaldo and co., feeling like it was a token gesture. And believe me, that's how it would feel now,"" he told The Sun newspaper, for which is a columnist. ""It would be like he was saying, 'I'm no racist -- look, I like this black guy so much I've got my arm around him, he's doing my show.' It would be very, very uncomfortable in front of 140 countries watching. "" Blatter, in his fourth term as president after standing unopposed in July's election, has apologized for offending people. But on Friday he insisted he would not accept demands that he resign from anti-racism campaigners, England's players' association chief Gordon Taylor and UK Prime Minister David Cameron. ""I cannot resign. Why should I?"" Blatter told the BBC. When you are faced with a problem you have to face the problem. To leave would be totally unfair and not compatible with my fighting spirit, my character, my energy. ""When you have done something which was not totally correct, I can only say I am sorry for all those people affected by my declarations."" When asked by CNN's Pedro Pinto if racism exists on the field of play, Blatter said: ""I would deny it. ""There is no racism, there is maybe one of the players towards the other, he has a word or a gesture which is not the correct one, but also the one who is affected by that, he should say it's a game, we are in a game. ""At the end of the game, we shake hands, this can happen, because we have worked so hard against racism and discrimination."" The comments sparked outrage in the football world, and Blatter released a statement on FIFA's website soon after trying to clarify his stance. ""I think the whole world is aware of the efforts we are making against racism and discrimination,"" he said. ""And, on the field of play sometimes you say something that is not very correct, but then at the end of the game, the game is over and you have the next game where you can behave better."" However, he was criticized on Twitter by many contributors including England international Rio Ferdinand, whose younger brother Anton has accused Chelsea captain John Terry of making racially abusive comments to him during a Premier League match. ""I feel stupid for thinking that football was taking a leading role against racism ..... it seems it was just on mute for a while,"" the Manchester United star wrote on the social networking website. Sol Campbell, a former England international, told CNN that Blatter's comments had sent football back 40 years. ""His remarks show he is completely out of touch. The longer he stays the weaker FIFA become,"" Campbell said. ""I think he has to step down very, very quickly. He should not wait to be sacked, he should have a little bit of honor and step down.""","David Beckham says comments about racism by Sepp Blatter are ""not right""

"(CNN) -- This week MME speaks to the man charged with boosting growth in the Kingdom of Bahrain: Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa. Sheikh Mohammed is concerned the nuclear dispute with Iran  is deterring potential investors . As chief executive of the Economic Development Board, one of Sheikh Mohammed's main tasks is to ensure Bahrain stays ahead of its competitors. The government's pushing ahead with economic reforms to reduce the Kingdom's dependence on oil. But with crude prices near $100 a barrel, John Defterios asked whether the appetite for change had diminished. SM: The reforms are being done for aspirational reasons rather than necessity, so we are trying to enter the post-oil area because we want to. And therefore, because of this aspirational aspect, trying to get to as opposed to people pushing us somewhere we don't want to go. JD: How do you redefine Bahrain's role? Traditionally it's been a financial center, but you have Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Dubai even Abu Dhabi emerging in financial services. How you redefine it to sustain a lead? SM: The rising tide lifts a lot of places and as the region is booming and growing, financial services are growing throughout the region. Bahrain's strengths have been and will continue to be its human capital, the people that have led the financial sector and the long standing regulations that have been established in Bahrain. JD: Strategically and a geopolitical question here: the Crown Prince came out and declared what Iran's intentions really are -- in his view -- for a nuclear policy, and called for greater diplomacy right ahead of a visit by the President of Iran to the country. What's the motivation here? SM: We feel that the distraction caused by the Iranian nuclear issue is holding investment back in the region as a whole, and increasing the security threat of the region. Nobody is debating the right to peaceful nuclear power, but we all have that need and we all need a peaceful resolution to this. JD: Historically, Iran has even made claims against Bahrain, what do you do now moving forward now? Do you bring Russia, China, the United States and the European Union closer together, in terms of where we should be going in the future? SM: We've resolved our historical issue with Iran, and we are well beyond that, but going forward... This is such a important issue affecting security worldwide, that we feel it is important and at a level high enough that we need all powers involved because it does affect everybody. JD: Can the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) become much tighter as an organization to have a voice in that process; as opposed to speaking from the sidelines and hoping that the major powers move forward? SM: Absolutely, I mean, the GCC is speaking with a unified voice. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia came out with a proposal for providing nuclear fuel from an independent authority; this was completely backed from the GCC. We are all moving forward and are willing to play a beneficial role to resolve this issue. Meet the Sheikh: . Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa is chief executive of the Economic Development Board, the organization responsible for stimulating and supporting growth of the Bahraini economy. He was appointed in June 2005, following 10 years working directly for His Highness Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Crown Prince, Commander-in-Chief of the Bahrain Defense Force and Chairman of the Economic Development Board. From 1995 to 1999, he was director of the Crown Prince's office. In 1999, he was appointed head of the court and also deputy head of the Crown Prince's International Scholarship Program. During this time, Sheikh Mohammed was heavily involved with the Crown Prince's initiatives to liberalize the telecommunications sector and with labor market and economic reforms. A keen motor sports enthusiast, Sheikh Mohammed was deputy board chairman of the Bahrain International Circuit and is a former vice president of the Bahrain Motor Club, now known as the Bahrain Motor Federation. Sheikh Mohammed, who is married with two sons and one daughter, was born on April 14, 1969. In 1992, he received a bachelor's degree in economic theory from the American University, Washington DC. Two years later, he received a post-graduate diploma in business studies from the London School of Economics.

"(CNN) -- World governing body FIFA have announced that France international striker Thierry Henry will not be punished for his handball in last November's World Cup qualification play-off against the Republic of Ireland. FIFA''s disciplinary committee concluded there was ""no legal foundation"" for them to deal with the case. The decision means Henry will not face a ban for any matches of this summer's World Cup finals. FIFA said in a statement: ""The disciplinary committee reached the conclusion that there was no legal foundation for the committee to consider the case because handling the ball cannot be regarded as a serious infringement as stipulated in article 77a) of the FIFA disciplinary code. ""There is no other legal text that would allow the committee to impose sanctions for any incidents missed by match officials."" Henry's handball in the run-up to William Gallas' decisive goal in the World Cup play-off qualifier ended the Republic's dreams of qualifying for the finals in South Africa. The Football Association of Ireland were infuriated by the goal and demanded a replay, even suggesting they should be allowed to go to the World Cup as a 33rd team. FIFA dismissed their demands but did agree to have another look at the possibility of using video evidence in the future, and instructed the disciplinary committee to investigate possible action against the 32-year-old former Arsenal player. Henry's defence argued successfully that FIFA's disciplinary code does not give the committee the ability to punish such incidents. Under current rules, only the illegal use of a hand to prevent a goal being scored is covered in relation to possible sanctions.","France striker Thierry Henry will not be punished for his handball in November's World Cup play-off against Ireland .

"(CNN) -- The Mexican Football Federation have pulled out of the bidding process for both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups because of financial concerns during the current economic downturn. The World Cup will not be returning to Mexico after the country pulled out of the buidding process. In a statement on their official Web site, the federation said: ""The decision is based on two premises: the global economic environment and the investment required in infrastructure. ""The outlook regarding the global economic environment does not allow the country's authorities -- neither at federal nor local government level -- to commit funds towards the necessary works that will be required."" The federation added that it would be ""practically impossible"" to find the public and private investment required to bring the country's stadia up to scratch in time to stage the event. ""In Mexico we do have a sufficient number of stadia to stage the contest, but the majority of these were built several years ago to meet old FIFA requirements,"" the statement continued. Mexico, who hosted the World Cup in 1970 and 1986, were always considered outsiders in the 2018/2022 tender. With the neighbouring United States putting together an impressive bid and the 2014 edition being staged in Brazil, it was always unlikely that FIFA would opt for more than one country in the Americas when voting on the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 events. The other bidders include England, Australia, Indonesia, Japan and Russia, while Portugal and Spain have tabled a joint bid, as have Belgium and the Netherlands. South Korea and Qatar will compete with the other eight bids to host the 2022 World Cup, with FIFA set to decide on the hosts of both events in December 2010. FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke added: ""Even though Mexico, one of the biggest football nations on earth and host of two FIFA World Cups, has finally opted to withdraw its bid to stage a third edition, FIFA wishes to thank the whole Mexican football family for having taken part in this process. ""We obviously fully respect this decision and are very much looking forward to continued cooperation with the Mexican Football Federation as another very nice goal approaches, namely the FIFA Under-17 World Cup 2011, for which the preparations are well on track.""","Mexico pull out of the bidding process to stage the 2018 and 2022 World Cups .

"(CNN) -- FIFA President Sepp Blatter said Monday his organization would ban for life any players and administrators found guilty of match-fixing. ""We can't intervene at this early stage, but when those people are condemned and found guilty we will ban them for life. They will not be allowed back into football,"" Blatter told reporters in Harare, as he wrapped up a one-day visit to Zimbabwe. FIFA security chief Chris Eaton arrived in Zimbabwe ahead of Blatter on Sunday. The organization is looking into allegations of match-fixing committed two years ago, which resulted in the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) boss being fired in October 2010. Player Method Mwanjali was one of five athletes who told a ZIFA inquiry last year that he accepted bribes in return for losing matches against Thailand and Syria in 2009. ZIFA submitted its findings to FIFA, which is now conducting its own investigation. ""We are working with Interpol and the governments. What FIFA is doing is to clean up the situation,"" Blatter said. Besides meeting with the country's football administrators, the FIFA president met with President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai during his one-day visit. He is scheduled to head next to South Africa to attend an International Olympic Committee meeting on Tuesday.","FIFA is looking into allegations of match-fixing .

"(CNN)  -- FIFA opened the door to the introduction of goal-line technology at the 2014 World Cup, but has put in place a rigorous testing program for companies hoping to win the contract. The world governing body said Tuesday that prototype systems will need to demonstrate a 90% accuracy rate in order to get through the first phase of the bidding process from September to December this year. They must then return with a 100% accurate product for the second and final testing phase between March and June 2012. The International FA Board, the game's law-making body, will be presented with the results of the testing at a special meeting in July 2012. If the IFAB is satisfied with the accuracy of the system, it could be in place for football's global showcase in Brazil two years later. Blog: Has the time arrived for change in football? FIFA said that the second round of tests would be held in ""different lighting conditions"" to simulate those likely to be found in the South American country. Pressure has grown on FIFA since this year's World Cup in South Africa after Frank Lampard's disallowed goal for England in the second-round match against Germany. Replays showed the ball had clearly crossed the line and FIFA later softened its stance on the introduction of technology. There have been renewed calls for action after last weekend's English Premier League match between Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur. Ironically, this time midfielder Lampard benefited from the status quo as he was awarded a crucial goal despite TV replays showing Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes had prevented it crossing the line after his fumble. British company Hawkeye, whose products are used in international cricket, is expected to be one of the companies to take part in the process. Preliminary tests held at FIFA headquarters in February saw 10 companies under the spotlight and all failed the 100% criteria, but it is believed three came close.","FIFA introduces testing program for goal-line technology at 2014 World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's Football Association faces punishment after FIFA decided to investigate an incident which saw Algeria's team bus pelted with stones before last Saturday's World Cup qualifier in Cairo. The world governing body has opened disciplinary proceedings after confirming that it had received reports about incidents affecting the Algerian team on its way from the airport to the hotel two days before the game. Three Algerian players were injured when Egyptian fans threw rocks at the team bus as it arrived in the capital on Thursday. Egypt won that match 2-0 to force a play-off at the Khartoum Stadium in Sudan on Wednesday night, which Algeria won 1-0 to book a place at the World Cup finals in South Africa next year.

"(CNN) -- Football's world governing body FIFA have fined the Ivory Coast Football Federation following the crush prior to their World Cup qualifier against Malawi in March that saw 22 supporters killed. A young fan is carried away following the crush that saw 22 supporters lose their lives in Abidjan in March. FIFA imposed a sanction of 50,000 Swiss francs ($46,800) and ordered Ivory Coast to limit the attendance of September's match against Burkina Faso to just 20,000 after concluding their inquiry into the tragedy at the Felix Houphouet-Boigny Stadium in Abidjan. Apart from the fans who lost their lives, another 130 people were injured when a stampede occured 40 minutes before kick-off, amid reports that 36,000 supporters were trying to cram into a stadium which has a capacity of 34,600. FIFA also announced a donation of $96,000 to a fund which has been set up to help the families of the victims. As well as limiting the attendance for the Burkina Faso match, FIFA have imposed a mandatory traffic control cordon, which will be established at least 1km away from the stadium itself. There will also be a spectator control cordon, established between 100 and 200 meters from the stadium, in order to filter the access of fans.

"(CNN) -- A Somali militant group publicly executed two teenage girls Wednesday after accusing them of being spies for the Somali government, according to the group, eyewitnesses and a relative of one of the girls. ""Those two girls were evil and they were spies for the enemy (the Somali government), but the mujahedeen caught them and after investigation, they admitted their crime, so they have been executed,"" said Sheikh Yusuf Ali Ugas, commander of Al-Shabaab in Beledweyne, a town in central Somalia. The teens were blindfolded with their hands behind their backs against a tree, and shot, according to a local journalist. A resident of Beledweyne told CNN that Al-Shabaab called on the town's residents to come out and watch the execution. ""Hundreds of people came out to watch the execution,"" he said. ""It was very bad ... the girls looked shocked and were crying but [no one] could help."" A relative of one of the teens denied they were spies. ""My cousin, Ayan Mohamed Jama, was just 16 years old and she was absolutely innocent,"" said the relative, who did not want their name used out of fear of retribution from Al-Shabaab. ""And Al-Shabaab caught her and the other girl between El-gal and Beledweyne and simply accused them of what they were not."" The other girl, said the relative, was 15. Al-Shabaab refused their families' request to see the teens while they were in detention, ""and they executed them at a public gathering, so this is inhumane and cruelty."" The El-gal area has been the scene of heavy fighting recently between Somali government forces and Al-Shabaab. ""Ayan didn't have any contact with the government and even in her life, she never had a mobile [phone] so we can't understand how she could be accused of being a spy,"" the relative said. Last year, Al-Shabaab stoned a teenage girl to death in Kismayo, a town in southern Somalia. Al-Shabaab is waging a war against Somalia's government in an effort to impose a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia. Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, and fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated the humanitarian crisis in the famine-ravaged country.","""Those two girls were evil,"" says an Al-Shabaab commander .

"(CNN) -- Formula One star Felipe Massa plans to thank the people who helped save his life a year ago as he makes an emotional return to Hungary this week. The Ferrari driver suffered horrific head injuries after a freak accident during the second qualifying session for the 2009 race in Budapest, when a spring from another car smashed into his helmet. The Brazilian was ruled out for the rest of the season, but has returned this year alongside new teammate Fernando Alonso. ""My first meeting when I arrive at the Hungaroring circuit will be with all the marshals and medical staff who did such a very good job of carefully getting me out of the cockpit,"" he told the F1 website on Wednesday. ""I want to thank these people, with whom I now feel a special bond. I had to stay in hospital for a week after the accident and I got to know the staff, who all treated me so well -- and one unusual result of the whole unfortunate episode is that I know I now have a lot more fans in Hungary."" The 29-year-old was a close runner-up in the 2008 world championship to this year's leader Lewis Hamilton, but has had only two podium finishes on his return to the Italian team. He finished second in the opening race of 2010 in Bahrain behind Alonso, and then repeated that result in Germany last weekend in controversial circumstances as he appeared to allow his teammate to pass him after receiving instructions on his radio. Ferrari boss slams F1 'hypocrisy' ""Quite often this year, journalists ask me if I feel I am back to normal and if I am driving as well as before and my answer is always the same: Yes, in terms of my work, absolutely nothing has changed,"" Massa said. ""But as a person, the accident did change me. It made me value life much more than before, and I appreciate the ordinary things in life 10 times more, and it has put life and my health in perspective, not taking anything for granted and not just for me, but also for life in general and what it means to everyone. ""I know what it means now and I feel I am much more mature as a human being. However, on the professional front, nothing has changed, because once you shut the visor and go out on the race track, you just do everything as before, without thinking of the accident."" Massa hopes Ferrari can build on the Hockenheim performance at a circuit where he has never won. ""Bridgestone is bringing its super-soft and medium tires that have always suited the F10 very well, so maybe we can have another very competitive race,"" he said. ""Personally, I have never had a good result at this circuit, but that has simply been down to circumstances, as I do enjoying driving here a lot. In 2008 for example, the last time I actually raced here, I led for 60 laps until my engine failed."" Ferrari fined as Alonso denies Massa . Alonso, who moved to within 34 points of Hamilton with his second victory of the season, has better history at the venue -- though he failed to finish last year after starting from pole, with Hamilton the victor for McLaren. ""The Hungaroring is a special circuit for me. It was here in 2003 that I scored my first Formula One win,"" the Spaniard said. ""The track can almost be described as a go-kart track for Formula One cars. The corners follow on, one from the other, so there is nowhere for a driver to pause for breath, and it is vital to have a car that deals with the many bumps in the track surface and handles riding the kerbs. ""From the physical and mental point of view it is a pretty demanding race, so it is important not to get impetuous and overcook things, because any mistake is heavily penalized, especially in qualifying."" Meanwhile, the future of the Monaco Grand Prix has been assured after its organizers agreed a new 10-year deal with F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- At least two prisoners were killed and 14 people wounded Sunday when a riot erupted at a Tikrit, Iraq, prison, police officials in Tikrit said. The wounded included seven prison guards and seven inmates, authorities said. The riot erupted about 3 p.m. Sunday (8 a.m. ET) at the central prison for Salaheddin province, police officials said. Prisoners set fires in cells that hold hundreds of inmates, police said. They said the instigators were from insurgent groups such as al Qaeda, who were planning to escape after creating chaos in the facility. However, two prisoners -- speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation -- told CNN that the inmates set the fires to protest against ill treatment, poor conditions inside the prison and also against corruption. The families of many prisoners are forced to pay prison officers and guards each month so their relatives will receive better treatment, they alleged. Attempts by CNN to contact police officials in Tikrit to comment on the inmates' allegations were unsuccessful Sunday night. Corruption is one reason behind widespread protests in recent months in Iraq, part of a larger wave of unrest sweeping the Middle East. Other reasons include unemployment, poor basic services and a lack of freedom. In late February, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki gave government ministers 100 days to deliver results and eliminate corruption or be fired. Tikrit is about 160 kilometers (99 miles) north of Baghdad.","The wounded include guards and inmates, police said .

"(CNN) -- Google opened an online music store and a free Web storage locker on Wednesday for listening to tracks from computers, tablets and phones, the company announced at a news conference in Los Angeles. The music store sells songs and albums for prices comparable to iTunes and Amazon MP3, but Google's catalog is smaller. The storefront can be found in the Android Market, an application and website where Google smartphone users can download apps. Songs purchased from the store are automatically uploaded to Google Music, a locker that can be accessed from an app coming to recent Android phones and tablets in the next few days, or from a website. They allow users to stream songs from their various devices. The Google locker service launched to a small group in May, and it opened to everyone in the United States on Wednesday. Google Music is free for storing as many as 20,000 songs. More than half of all smartphones sold worldwide in the last quarter run Google's Android software, according to market research firm Gartner. Google said more than 200 million devices have been activated. But in the music download market, Apple is king, selling more than half of all U.S. downloads through its iTunes Store, analysts say. Apple took steps to broaden its offering with the belated launch of iTunes Match on Monday. ITunes Match is similar to Google Music in that it allows customers to store their music catalogs, up to 25,000 songs, on Apple's servers and access them from their computers, iPhones and iPads. Match costs $25 per year. ""At Google, digital music has become fundamental to many things we care very much about,"" Jamie Rosenberg, Google's director of content for Android, said onstage at the news conference. ""Other cloud music services think you have to pay to listen to the music you own. We don't."" ITunes Match has a technological leg up on Google because subscribers can upload their libraries much more quickly. That's thanks to Apple's deals with the music labels that allow it to provide customers with access to the high-quality versions of songs that iTunes sells. With Google Music or Amazon.com's Cloud Drive, users with a lot of music may have to wait several days for their entire catalogs to upload. The iTunes Store has about 20 million songs, whereas Google has 8 million. Google has signed deals with three of the big four record labels. Warner Music Group, the third largest, whose musicians include Death Cab for Cutie, the Grateful Dead, Muse and T-Pain, is a holdout. Even without Warner, Google said it will add 5 million songs over the next several months. Customers of T-Mobile USA's cellular network will be able to charge songs to their phone bills rather than setting up a Google account with a credit card.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- A child was killed and six other people were wounded on Thursday when security forces shot at protesters in Yemeni city of Taiz, a medical team said. Yemen's Republican Guards started shooting and fired tear gas at demonstrators after they refused to disperse and end a march, witnesses said. The protesters railed against tough government actions against peaceful marchers and a failed assassination attempt on a senior opposition leader in Sanaa on Wednesday, witnesses said. Yemen has been wracked by widespread civil strife, country-wide demonstrations against the government and insurgent activity. The nation's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, is the object of the protesters, who want him to leave his position. Saleh is being treated in Saudi Arabia for wounds he received last month in a failed assassination attempt.","The demonstration took place in Taiz .

"(CNN) -- The global football transfer market is big business, with star players swapping countries, even continents to play for richer, more prestigious clubs. The exact figures involved in these transactions are often difficult to ascertain, but football's world governing body, FIFA have introduced a system which allows the transfer market to be accurately tracked and analyzed. The Transfer Matching System (TMS) was first conceived in 2007 and was designed as a way of monitoring international transfers and ensuring FIFA's regulations were adhered to. In 2009, former Cameroon defender Jean-Joel Perrier-Doumbe became the first player to switch clubs using the TMS when he left Celtic in Scotland for French club Toulouse. And last week FIFA were able to release a full year's worth of figures for the first time for international transfers conducted between January 1 to December 31 2011. ""Thanks to TMS, football authorities have access for the first time to global, directly reported data on the transfer market,"" read FIFA's first annual Global Transfer Market release. ""As additional information is entered in the system and we continue to work to enhance the integrity and usability of the data, future editions will be able to provide unparalleled insight into the evolution of the global market for international football."" So, if you want to know how often an international transfer was made, the total amount spent on international transfers or the average wage of a footballer, check out the above gallery. Data from all 208 of FIFA's member associations was collected. Some of the results may surprise you.","FIFA have released figures regarding international football transfers in 2011 .

"Cleveland, Ohio (CNN) -- Last week, Libya's former leader, Moammar Gadhafi, was killed, apparently by rebel forces. When he was captured, he was by all accounts alive, with a gunshot to the arm. But the official autopsy report indicated that Gadhafi died of a gunshot wound to the head. Now, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and even U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are calling for an outside investigation into the circumstances of Gadhafi's death, and the International Criminal Court has asked to inspect his body. Was the killing of Gadhafi a war crime? There are several competing versions of what happened to Gadhafi. Unfortunately, the Libyan doctor who conducted the autopsy has not disclosed whether the forensic evidence indicated that he suffered the head wound in a crossfire, as leaders of Libya's interim government have claimed, or at close range. The latter would obviously suggest that Gadhafi was murdered after he was taken into custody. Since this was the closing chapter of an internal armed conflict dating back to February, the situation was governed by the international laws of war as codified in the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Under these rules, it is a war crime to kill a combatant after he has been disarmed and taken into custody, except after a fair trial. Such a summary execution is to be distinguished from the killing of Osama bin Laden, which occurred during his capture and amid the fog of battle. Will the International Criminal Court (ICC) get involved? Since the situation in Libya has been referred to the ICC by the U.N. Security Council, the ICC has jurisdiction over crimes against humanity and war crimes in Libya since February 2011. Under this grant of authority, the ICC's jurisdiction extends not only to Gadhafi and his troops, but also to the anti-Gadhafi forces and leaders of the national transitional government. The ICC has indicted Gadhafi, his son Saif al-Islam and the head of the secret police but has so far not focused on the acts of anti-Gadhafi forces. That's because the ICC's governing statute guides the prosecutor away from isolated acts toward large-scale atrocities, providing that ""the Court shall have jurisdiction in respect of war crimes in particular when committed as part of a plan or policy or as part of a large-scale commission of such crimes."" That focus could change, however, if evidence emerges of a policy of widespread retaliatory killings by anti-Gadhafi forces, and if the ICC concludes that Gadhafi's death was a part of that policy. To prevent the ICC from taking further action, the new Libyan authorities have announced that they are undertaking their own investigation into Gadhafi's death. Under the ICC statute, the international court must defer to domestic investigations unless there is evidence that such investigations are a sham. Gadhafi's was not the only mysterious death in Sirte last week. Human Rights Watch has reported evidence of the apparent murder of 53 people, believed to be Gadhafi supporters, in a Sirte hotel that came under the control of anti-Gadhafi fighters. Many of the bodies were reportedly found shot in the head with their hands bound behind their backs. This latest atrocity suggests that the new Libyan authorities should not be trusted to investigate the death of Gadhafi on their own. What does this mean for the new Libyan government? At present, leaders of the new government are promising early elections and a quick transition to democracy. To gain international financial assistance, the new government needs to prove its commitment to basic human rights. Lingering concerns about extrajudicial killings will set back that effort. An international commission of inquiry, launched by the U.N. Human Rights Council and headed by former ICC President Philippe Kirsch of Canada, is investigating reports of extrajudicial killings, torture and other crimes in Libya. This is an appropriate body to examine the circumstances of Gadhafi's death. Cooperating with the Kirsch Commission would be an important first step on the road to proving that the new Libya can be a nation pledged to the rule of law. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael P. Scharf.","Michael Scharf: Gadhafi taken alive but died with bullet to head; rights groups want investigation .

"Lagos, Nigeria -- Nigeria's president ordered security forces Tuesday to step up their search for 15 children kidnapped in the country's southeastern region when gunmen hijacked a school bus. President Goodluck Jonathan condemned the ""utterly callous and cruel kidnapping"" of 15 nursery and primary school pupils on Monday. A statement from the president's office said the Nigerian leader order the Inspector-General of Police and heads of other security agencies ""to take all necessary steps to rescue the abducted children and return them safely to their parents."" The incident occurred near Aba, the capital of Abia state. Kidnapping has been rampant in the region for years. In this case, the abductors are asking for a ransom of 20 million naira, or nearly $130,000 . Police don't know the whereabouts of the children, and they won't confirm their nationalities and identities. Geofrey Ogbonna, the state's police spokesman, said four gunmen boarded a bus headed to Apayi International School in Aba and took the children away. The bus driver and the school teacher who were on board are in police custody and helping law enforcement efforts. Jonathan urged the children's parents and relatives ""to remain calm"" and assured them that the government ""will do everything possible to apprehend the kidnappers and bring closure to these ugly incidents as soon as possible."" Militants in the southern oil-producing region, who have been fighting for years over fairer distribution of the country's oil wealth, have abducted oil workers, and people engaged in criminal activity have snatched up citizens to get ransom money. Kidnappings and rape in Abia state are common and have become more frequent in recent years. They include vehicle hijackings and even people being snatched off the street. The motive is usually money. Some people travel with security -- if they can afford it. As foreign oil workers improved their personal security, the kidnappers have increasingly targeted Nigerians.","The incident occurred in Abia state .

"(CNN) -- If you think all conservatives support a deportation-only approach to immigration, think again. Last week, hundreds of conservative evangelicals gathered in Alabama to engage in a reasonable, respectful discourse on immigration. You read that right. Less than a year after Alabama enacted the strictest immigration law in the land, evangelical students, pastors and national faith leaders gathered at Samford University in Birmingham for ""a Christ-centered conversation on immigration"" called the G92 South Immigration Conference. Following the example of Cedarville University's inaugural G92 gathering last fall in Ohio, evangelical Christians gathered in Birmingham to discuss immigration through the prism of the Bible. Instead of listening to partisan sound bites, participants looked to the word of God -- specifically the 92 references to ""ger,"" the word for ""stranger,"" in the Old Testament alone. Calls for humanity and compassion came from national and local evangelicals who recognize the law's devastating effects. Dr. Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, said, ""As Christians, we have a responsibility to obey the rule of law, not to enforce the law. And, as citizens of heaven, we also have a responsibility to feed those who are hungry without asking them for [their] immigration status."" He is right. Policymakers' misguided race to the bottom on immigration has also affected faith leaders' ability to minister to all of God's children, regardless of immigration status. And, the economic impact to the state has been dramatic. The Alabama law, HB56, resulted in some crops rotting on the vine and police arresting a visiting executive of a multinational car manufacturer with a new plant in the state. Now, economists forecast that the law will cost the Alabama economy billions of dollars. Closing the event, Dr. Michael Wesley Sr., of the Greater Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Birmingham, reflected on the nation's ongoing struggle for civil rights: ""America is a land of opportunity. And, if done correctly, it can be a land of opportunity for all of God's children."" A fundamental shift is occurring among conservatives toward a new consensus on immigrants and America. These are the early steps in a march by Americans of all political stripes fed up with partisan attacks on immigrants and immigration -- a groundswell ready and willing to skewer political extremism from either side of the aisle. The conference in Alabama was a quest for spiritual guidance to forge a path forward on immigration reform. Contrast that with a meeting of another group of conservatives, about 1,500 miles to the west. Ahead of this week's primaries in Arizona and Michigan, the four Republican candidates for president ""debated"" immigration by choosing the same path: political expedience and division over practical, humane immigration solutions. In Mesa, Arizona, around the birthplace of that state's own anti-immigrant law, SB1070, the candidates were quick to endorse the family-separating tactics of Sheriff Joe Arpaio and call for the building of (double) walls at our borders. The candidates' only hint of compassion was Rick Santorum's suggestion that he would not require individual homeowners to verify the legal status of their domestic help. In other words, undocumented immigrants can care for our children, do our laundry and mow our lawns, but we will do nothing to keep their families together or provide a way for them to emerge from the shadows. Ignoring the economic and social value of immigrants and immigration to our nation, the GOP candidates' strategy is to tap into the fear and unease of our constantly changing society. Rather than work toward a political consensus on immigrants and America, they would rather implement unjust immigration laws that separate families, cost tens of billions of dollars every year and undermine American workers by pushing immigrants further underground. The Republican candidates for president are stuck in reverse. Instead of treating immigration like other important conservative issues and actively seeking to change the law, they trumpet fantasies such as self-deportation and fail to lead America forward. Their race to the margins runs the risk of pushing conservative Americans away. They're missing an opportunity, as the events in Ohio and Alabama make clear. Times are changing. Americans want reasonable, humane solutions for our nation's immigration system. It is time the GOP offered them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ali Noorani.","Evangelical students, pastors, faith leaders gathered for conference on immigration .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- A Japanese freelance journalist who was kidnapped for five months in Afghanistan and released Saturday says his kidnappers weren't members of the Taliban, but corrupt Afghan soldiers. Kosuke Tsuneoka, 41, posted a message to his Twitter account on his arrival at the airport in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on Monday. He was on his way back to Japan from Afghanistan, which he left on Sunday, according to Japan's Foreign Ministry. Tsuneoka was kidnapped in late March. ""They were corrupt military factions that blackmailed the Japanese government by pretending they were Taliban,"" Tsuneoka posted in Japanese on his Twitter account. His message revealed the name of the commander in Kunduz and the factions in Takhar province that kidnapped him. However, the Japanese Embassy in Kabul said the kidnappers' affiliations were still unclear. Tsuneoka said in a separate message on his Twitter account that he was prepared for death. He added that he survived because, though the group's ranking officials were corrupt, they could not justify killing him to lower-ranking soldiers and civilians in the region. He called the lower-ranking soldiers and civilians proper people. ""The Japanese government and the family of the kidnap victim did not pay a ransom to the culprits,"" Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshito Sengoku, said Monday at a news conference. It was not clear what led to Tsuneoka's release. Dozens of foreigners have been kidnapped in Afghanistan since the United States and its allies invaded in 2001 to unseat the Taliban government. Journalists have been prime targets.","The Japanese journalist says corrupt Afghan soldiers abducted him .

"(CNN) -- Felipe Massa has been forced to backtrack on comments he made claiming that new Ferrari teammate Fernando Alonso was aware of Renault's plans to deliberately crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. Felipe Massa is still showing the scars of his horror crash at the Hungarian GP in July. Alonso won that race after the safety car was brought out when Renault's No. 2 driver Nelson Piquet Jr spun out on lap 14, and Massa subsequently claimed it cost him that year's world title as he finished one point behind champion Lewis Hamilton. Motorsport's ruling body the FIA cleared Alonso of any wrongdoing as it banned Renault boss Flavio Briatore, who quit his role before the ruling, while Piquet was immune from prosecution in return for giving evidence. Massa told reporters in his native Brazil on Wednesday that he believed two-time world champion Alonso -- who is replacing Kimi Raikkonen at Ferrari next year -- must have known about Renault's race plan. ""It was the team and Nelson -- but Alonso was part of the problem. He knew. We cannot know it, but of course he knew. It's an absolute certainty,"" he said ahead of this weekend's Brazilian Grand Prix. However, the 28-year-old later released a statement on the official Ferrari Web site in a bid to avoid conflict with his future teammate. ""What I've said is the outcome of a hunch I've had and is not based on any concrete evidence,"" Felipe said. ""The FIA World Council announced that there was no indication that Fernando may have been informed of what had happened and I respect this outcome. ""Obviously I'm very disappointed about what transpired last year in Singapore: I have already said several times what I thought about it and now it's time to close that chapter and to look to the future. ""What is certain is that this episode will not mar in any way the relationship I'll have with Fernando when we will be teammates."" Massa will not be racing at his beloved Interlagos circuit this weekend as he is still recovering from serious head injuries suffered in qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix in July. He has been allowed to test a 2007 Ferrari this week, but the team announced that he will not be ready to return to competitive action until next season.","Felipe Massa backtracks on claim Fernando Alonso knew of Renault's plans .

"(CNN) -- By the end of last week, congressional Democrats and a few moderate Republicans succeeded in requiring most employers to include contraception as part of health insurance coverage, in spite of deep opposition from the GOP majority. Across the Potomac in Virginia, Democrats and, again, a few Republican moderates were able to soften or kill GOP bills that would have put into place humiliating obstacles to abortion. These are good things. Thousands of ordinary women across the country have been writing letters, sending e-mails, leaving phone messages, and buttonholing state and national lawmakers in support of cheaper contraceptive methods and greater access to abortion. Though they didn't get everything they want, many are, I suspect, thankful for the partial victories so far. But I have to ask -- where in these recent debates are the voices of ordinary men? Why aren't we hearing publicly even now from husbands who are not ready to have children they would have to support? Or from boyfriends who do not have the means to support a child? Why don't we hear more from fathers who are working two jobs so that their daughters can attend college and, if they wish, start on a career unencumbered by child-raising responsibilities? Other than female-friendly lawmakers and a handful of TV news/comedians, older men have been curiously slow to publicly support women's reproductive freedom. Do they really want their sons and daughters to have to take a second or third job in order to pay the costs of raising an unplanned child, or have to decide whether to risk an abortion? The truth is, many men of the baby boom generation would prefer not to talk about pregnancy. Fetuses are not exactly what they chat about with the mechanic who's fixing their car. For baby boomer women, on the other hand, the ability to control when or if you have a baby is nothing short of a miracle. We remember, as if it were yesterday, when the pill became available and the diaphragm was improved. We happily took charge of preventing pregnancy or resolving an unplanned pregnancy. And as a friend of mine remembers, it never occurred to us to talk to the men in our lives about contraception. As I've gotten older, I've realized there were consequences of not including male partners early in such discussions. At my college reunion a couple of years ago, a former male classmate confessed privately that when we were students, his girlfriend, also a student, had gotten pregnant twice. Both times, she had traveled hundreds of miles to New York, at that time one of a few states where abortion was legal. ""Weren't either of you using birth control?"" I asked him. He muttered something that sounded like ""No,"" his eyes staring at some point over my shoulder. Had he accompanied her to Manhattan? He looked surprised by the question, and then shook his head. He had the good sense not to appear cavalier about it all. But it was clear that he had never thought of birth control or abortion as a guy thing. I suspect his girlfriend hadn't either. Could such cluelessness or discomfort help explain -- though by no means exonerate -- the silence of men of a certain age when male lawmakers introduce downright abusive bills relating to female reproduction? I strongly suspect that conservative lawmakers will continue to attempt to control a conversation that many of us thought had been settled, and they have the money and party support to get re-elected. When I read how Texas and other states are passing bills that, in the words of columnist Nicholas Kristof, ""are treating women in ways that are patronizing and humiliating,"" I despair. Then I remember that many of these legislators are part of a generation that is moving off the stage of public life. I have hope that the generation that succeeds them will be different. Men in their 20s and early 30s had more sex education in school than their fathers did, often in coed classes. They are more involved in sexual decision-making with their partners than previous generations. Polls show that the majority of them, like the majority of young women, support contraception and legalized abortion. I recently talked to one woman in her early 20s who said her boyfriend keeps up with advances in birth control as much as she does. Their decision about which method to use is always made together, she said. Another young woman said she and her partner debated methods for more than a year, sometimes heatedly. They recently married, and she is happily pregnant. A young man told me that in the beginning of his current relationship, he and his girlfriend split the cost of her birth control pills. When he cut back on his hours at work in order to start graduate school, his girlfriend picked up his share because she was earning more money than he was. Once he's earning more money again, he'll resume paying part of the tab. It's only fair, he said, adding, ""Women may have to give up a little control, but men can share the burden.""
