Alex Salmond may have acted illegally by denying expat Scots the right to vote in the independence referendum, a top lawyer has claimed. Aidan O’Neill, an expert in European law, said the rules imposed by Scotland’s first minister had ‘good prospects’ of being overturned in court. He believes the decision could be reversed in a judicial review on the grounds that it violated the right of Scottish expatriates to enjoy freedom of movement under EU law. This would add an estimated 1.15million Scottish expats to the voting rolls and court action could delay the referendum, which is due to take place on September 18. Legal challenge: Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond (pictured with Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon) has denied expatriates the right to vote - but this might be illegal . That figure includes some 750,000 who are currently living in England. Dumfries-born lawyer James Wallace, who is now based in London, asked Mr O'Neill for his legal advice on the matter. If unsuccessful, Mr O'Neill says a petition demanding a judicial review can be lodged within a week and fast-tracked to the Supreme Court for a judgement before this September's planned referendum. More than 2,700 signatures backing a legal challenge have already been collected. The campaign for Scottish home rule began almost as soon as unification took place in 1707 . 1934: The Scottish National Party was established . 1998: The Scotland Act paved the way for devolution . 2007: SNP won their first minority government . 2011: SNP election victory leads to securing a mandate for a referendum . 2014: A referendum on Scottish independence has been earmarked for September 18 . Among those supporting the action are former Scottish rugby union player Kenny . Logan, husband of presenter Gabby Logan and Alex McLeish, a former . football manager for Scotland. Both now live in England. A judicial review could however cost as much as £100,000, so donors are being sought who are willing to support the action. In contrast to the expatriates who are currently denied the vote, many Commonwealth, Irish and EU citizens living in Scotland - whose citizenship would remain unaffected whatever the outcome of the referendum - are allowed to vote. Mr O'Neill told the The Sunday Times that other points to consider are that while Scottish-born British citizens have been promised Scottish citizenship if the referendum favours independence - they may in turn lose their British citizenship. An independent Scotland might also need to apply for EU citizenship, meaning expatriates would for a period of time lose their rights to free healthcare, benefits and the right to work in EU countries.

Hillsborough campaigners may have been spied on by police through a centralised 'tapping unit', a leading lawyer has claimed. Elkan Abrahamson has lodged a series of complaints with the police watchdog over the claims. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) confirmed it has received three referrals about officers spying on campaigners following the 1989 tragedy in which 96 Liverpool fans lost their lives. Mr Abrahamson, of Broudie Jackson and Canter, said the firm has received strikingly similar accounts of family members picking up the phone to make a call, only to hear an ongoing conversation between other Hillsborough campaigners in a different part of the country. The Liverpool Memorial for Hillsborough victims. A lawyer has claimed officers spied on campaigners following the 1989 tragedy . He said: 'We've had a few separate complaints of phone tapping. 'It involved a family member picking up the phone only to hear two other family members speaking elsewhere.' He demanded that allegations of police officers spying on Hillsborough families was included in the public inquiry announced by Home Secretary Theresa May on Thursday after a report found Scotland Yard had spied on murder victim Stephen Lawrence's family. Paying respects: Children lay floral tributes to the victims of the Hillsborough disaster . Mrs May told the Commons that conclusions that the Metropolitan Police planted 'a spy in the Lawrence family camp' were 'deeply troubling'. Mr Abrahamson said: 'It is essential that the enquiry announced by the Home Secretary includes the concerns about surveillance in the Hillsborough case. 'It will, of course, focus on Lawrence, but the Hillsborough tragedy should equally be subjected to the same scrutiny on this subject of spying.' Loss: 96 people were killed, 766 injured in the accident . The inquiry will be led by Mark Ellison who fronted the independent report into the Lawrence surveillance concerns which sparked this week's government decision. The latest Hillsborough complaint echoes the story of Hilda Hammond, who lost her 14-year-old son Philip, and who was on the phone to a friend in 1990 when she could suddenly hear another chat of fellow campaigner Jenni Hicks who was in conversation at her home in Middlesex. Broudie, Jackson and Canter has also documented a further complaint of a relative believing they were followed by police in Sheffield at the time of the inquests into the tragedy, between 1990 and 1991. The IPCC also said one of the surveillance complaints related to property being stolen. The Independent Police Complaints Commission also said one of the surveillance complaints related to property being stolen . The Metropolitan Police, and other . forces, has refused to deny or confirm they took part in surveillance of . Hillsborough families. Home Secretary Teresa May has now volunteered to write to every chief constable in the UK to demand they hand over any documents on Hillsborough to the new inquiry. The move was welcomed, but Mr Abrahamson added: 'She should ask police forces to provide information on all relevant areas, like surveillance. 'To hide behind reasons of national security seems particularly unfair when we're talking about bereaved families.' Tribute: Scarves adorn the memorial at Anfield . It also emerged that some retired cops who had refused to give evidence were now 'reconsidering', the IPCC said. Of the 243 officers whose statements were suspected of being doctored, just 12 of them remain to be questioned. Rachel Cerfontyne, deputy chairwoman of the IPCC, said: ""Concerns have been raised been raised by families about alleged surveillance from police. 'We believe the Home Secretary's letter may also assist in identifying whether any documentation relating to surveillance exists.'","Lawyer Elkan Abrahamson has demanded allegations form part of enquiry .

He is now one of the world's most recognised celebrities with a string of expensive houses to his name, but when David Beckham bought one of his first properties in the mid-1990s, he was just making his name as a star player for Manchester United. While his newest digs come in the form of a £30million London mansion, one of his first homes in Worsley, Greater Manchester, has gone under the hammer for a comparatively modest £350,000. Comprising just four bedrooms, the star sold the home in 1997, shortly before moving into the famous Beckingham Palace in Hertfordshire, which cost £2.5million. Humble beginnings: One of David Beckham's first houses, a four-bed semi in Worsley, Greater Manchester, has gone on sale for £350,000 . The house was bought by the Manchester United footballer in the mid-90s, just as he was becoming a household name before moving on to grander homes . The sporting star sold the property in 1997, shortly before he moved into the famous Beckingham Palace property in Hertfordshire which cost £2.5million . Back in the day: A very youthful David Beckham plays for the Manchester United youth team in 1993, shortly before buying his first house . The Beckhams bought the 12-acre estate just three months after their wedding, allowing Brooklyn, 14 and Romeo, 11, and Cruz, eight, to call it home for a few years. However, as one of the world's most successful footballers, Beckham's career soon forced the family to relocate abroad. In 2003 the sporting super-star signed for Real Madrid, relocating his wife and children to an exclusive gated community near the city, paying £4.5million for a villa in Las Encinas where third child Cruz, now eight, soon came along. Up-sizing: David bought the 12-acre estate just after his marriage to Victoria Beckham and the couple raised their children there until their next move in 2003 . As they were: David and Victoria Beckham pictured in 1998 just after announcing their wedding and shortly before moving into Beckingham Palace . While Beckham has not lived permanently in the property for many years, it was only sold in 2013 for £12million, netting a £9.5million profit . This villa had seven bedrooms, four bathrooms, a heated outdoor swimming pool, tennis court and extensive grounds. The estate was also surrounded by forest, with residents allowed to hunt wild deer. The family up-sized in 2007 when Beckham changed clubs again, this time heading for US team LA Galaxy. Naturally, only a villa in Beverly Hills would do, and the couple paid a reported $22million (£13m) for a 13,000sqft home complete with outdoor swimming pool, five bedrooms and nine bathrooms. The family's next move was to Spain as David signed for Real Madrid, buying up this villa in one of the most exclusive gated communities in the city for £4.5million . Another foreign mansion was on the cards in 2007 when Beckham again changed clubs, moving to LA Galaxy. This Beverly Hills pad cost a reported $22million (£13m) In 2013 Beckham made his final move to French side Paris Saint-Germain, and was said to be renting a property in London while searching for a more permanent residence in the city. At the end of last year the Beckhams announced they were returning to live the capital permanently in the 'New Beckingham Palace', a four-storey, £30million home in central London. At more than 9,000 square feet, it is one of the largest in its area, boasting eight bedrooms and seven bathrooms. Now the couple have paid £30million for New Beckingham Palace, a four-storey property in London which is being fitted with its own catwalk and nail salon . Homeward bound: David and Victoria, pictured in 2012 with children Cruz (left), Romeo (centre) and Brooklyn (right), have now returned to England . Victoria, 39, was said to have instructed the interior designer Kelly Hoppen — who is a friend — to renovate the house with an upper budget of £5 million. The new interior will include a catwalk, nail salon, secret entrance built into a bookcase and entrance tunnels into the property underneath the 100ft oriental garden out the back.","One of David Beckham's first houses, in Worsley, Greater Manchester, has gone up for auction at £350,000 .

The taxpayer faces a compensation bill running into the tens of millions of pounds from miscarriages of justice linked to a secret undercover police unit. Hundreds of animal rights activists, neo-Nazi groups, campaigners for black justice and other campaigners who, unknowingly, were spied on by the Special Demonstration Squad could have their convictions overturned. Only a handful of cases involving officers from the special Met squad, which operated from the late 1960s, have been made public. Anyone jailed and found to have suffered a miscarriage of justice could launch civil proceedings against the Met and the Home Office. Those spied on by the Special Demonstration Squad could have their convictions overturned. Anyone jailed and found to have suffered a miscarriage of justice could launch civil proceedings against the Met . Last night, Jules Carey of Bindmans solicitors warned the cases which have become known about represented the ‘tip of the iceberg’. Nearly 150 officers worked for the SDS from its formation but only nine names have come to light. Yesterday two animal rights activists jailed for firebombing a department store said they would appeal against their convictions. Police Minister Damian Green said the SDS was not operating within the rules and it was 'out of control by modern standards throughout its existence' Andrew Clarke and Geoff Sheppard, of the Animal Liberation Front, were convicted of planting bombs at Debenhams stores in Romford and Luton in 1987 over its selling of fur products. But they claim an undercover police officer planted a third device at a branch in Harrow to help convict the men. In January, 29 climate change protesters had their convictions quashed because the role of an undercover officer, Mark Kennedy, was never disclosed. The protesters boarded a freight train carrying coal to the Drax power plant in Selby, North Yorkshire in June 2008. At their trials it was never revealed that Kennedy had infiltrated the group. The Appeal Court quashed the convictions because of the lack of disclosure. A review of all cases involving the SDS was ordered on Thursday by Home Secretary Theresa May. It is thought the activities of undercover officers could even extend to families of Hillsborough victims, who allege they were spied upon. Police Minister Damian Green said the SDS was not operating within the rules. He told the BBC: ‘All the evidence suggests that it was out of control by modern standards throughout its existence. Not just this government but previous governments have tightened up the way undercover operations can happen. ‘It does seem... that what was happening then was outside the rules even at the time. If illegality is proved then clearly there should be prosecutions.’ Mr Carey, whose firm represented the Drax protesters, said: ‘The harm and injustice caused by undercover policing operations is shocking. An officer linked to the SDS is claimed to have invaded the Lawrence family's privacy - reporting to Scotland Yard bosses about the breakdown of their marriage. The revelations were exposed in the Ellison report into the case today . ‘Woman deceived into long term sexual relations, mothers who discovered that the identity of their dead baby had been appropriated, justice campaigners around the Lawrences and others smeared, wrongful convictions caused by officers acting as agent provocateurs and workers deprived of employment because they were put on a blacklist, to name but a few. ‘But in reality this is the tip of the iceberg. We are a long way from knowing the true scale of injustice and the damage caused by undercover policing. ‘It is my sincere hope that the scope of the proposed public inquiry will be sufficiently broad to cover all these matters so that a line can finally be drawn under this shameful episode in British policing.’","Payouts over secret police unit could run into tens of millions, it is thought .

"By . Ian Drury, Defence Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 18:01 EST, 7 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 03:15 EST, 11 March 2014 . Paratrooper Ben Parkinson of Doncaster in south Yorkshire was offered only £570,000 after he was injured on the Afghan frontline . A Royal Navy sailor has been paid £1million after injuring her back playing a drunken game during an Armed Forces function. The 25-year-old – who is still serving – was hurt plunging from the top of a human pyramid built by alcohol-fuelled troops as they larked about in the mess. In stark contrast, the compensation is double the amount paid to Ben  Parkinson, the most seriously hurt British soldier to survive the Afghan frontline. Then aged 23, the paratrooper was blown up by a mine in 2006. He was left in a coma for months with 37  injuries, including losing both legs,  damage to his spine, skull, pelvis, hands, spleen and ribcage. Initially the Lance Bombardier was offered just £152,000 plus a £19,000-a-year pension. After a battle by his mother Diane Dernie and public outrage, the hero was awarded £570,000. This is now the maximum payout a soldier can receive for battlefield  injuries from the Ministry of Defence. The sailor’s injuries were described as ‘very serious’. Although she is not understood to have been paralysed, it is believed she has problems with mobility. The deal is certain to undermine morale within Britain’s beleaguered Armed Forces. It comes as the MoD pushes through severe cuts to save  £4.7billion and plug a £38billion hole in the equipment programme. Last night her payout after a six-year legal battle was condemned by Major Charles Heyman, a senior defence analyst and editor of Armed Forces of the UK. He said: ‘It seems utter madness to use such an enormous amount of  taxpayers’ money when there appears to be at least some negligence on the part of the person concerned. ‘If somebody sustains life-changing injuries on the battlefield, then everyone understands why they should receive compensation. But to foot a £1million bill for a drunken accident is nothing short of scandalous. ‘It is even more disgraceful that this can happen at a time when the MoD is facing such severe financial restraints. Terribly injured in Afghanistan and after learning to walk again on his new legs Lance Corpral Ben Parkinson, of the Parachute Regiment lays a wreath at the remeberance service in Doncaster, South Yorkshire . ‘Someone high up needs to answer some very searching questions.’ Shadow Armed Forces Minister Kevan Jones said: ‘It’s right that when our Armed Forces are injured on duty, they are compensated and, if required, looked after. ‘But this seems a very large sum given the financial constraints the MoD is under and [Defence Secretary] Philip Hammond should explain why.’ Shaun Rusling, vice-chairman of the National Gulf  Veterans and Families Association, said ministers had only spent £6million investigating ill-health which affected 7,500 troops who fought in the 1991 conflict. Parkinson was seriously injured in a land mine explosion in Afganistan serving with 7 Paratroopers, serving 37 injuries as the result of an explosion . He said: ‘It is absolutely outrageous that veterans who became ill serving their country are neglected for medical equipment and treatment, yet the Government insists it can’t pay for more. This case really raises questions about where their priorities lie.’ The payment to the sailor is also more than 50 times the basic £17,767 salary of a  private fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. Better days: He lost both his legs and sustained grievous damage to his spine, skull, pelvis, hands, spleen and ribcage, leaving him in a coma for months . The unnamed woman, who is understood not to be an officer and is now 31, was attending the official event at a base on land. During the evening in 2007, she became involved in ‘drunken high jinks’ with high-spirited troops climbing on each others’ shoulders, sources told the Mail. But the human tower  collapsed and the servicewoman plummeted up to 30ft to the floor. The woman took legal action, arguing that top brass had responsibility for her well-being as she was invited to the event. In 2012-13, the Armed Forces’ bill for civil cash claims topped £108.9million, up £21million on the previous financial year. The payouts were inflated by troops claiming that negligence by top brass caused their injuries as well as cases brought by Iraqi nationals alleging abuse by British forces. Desk staff at the MoD pocketed £18million from 724 claims for a string of bizarre accidents, including a  fractured leg from tripping over a frayed carpet. Service personnel were behind another 2,517 payouts totalling £51.3million which did not include those injured on active duty. MoD officials have refused to give further details about the sailor’s case but other awards have caused controversy. Last November, it was revealed three female RAF recruits were each given £100,000 after suffering spinal and pelvic injuries caused by marching in step with taller male colleagues. In 2007, the MoD paid £484,000 to an RAF typist who said she suffered repetitive strain injury to her thumb. A Daily Mail campaign was prompted by anger at paltry sums for servicemen and women hurt on duty. In 2010, huge rises in awards were announced by Labour.","25 year old sailor was hurt falling off human pyramid while drinking in mess .

"Internal ECB review to include all players and staff . Alastair Cook and Andy Flower unlikely to be criticised . England players active on phone app Tinder while in Australia . By . Charles Sale . PUBLISHED: . 18:00 EST, 5 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 18:26 EST, 5 January 2014 . The internal ECB review into the shambolic Ashes surrender will include each player and all support staff giving their comments about this dismal tour. And their feedback, to be collated by new England managing director Paul Downton, will need to be critical in the extreme about Andy Flower and Alastair Cook for there to be any changes to that leadership duo. ECB chairman Giles Clarke and chief executive David Collier have been unequivocal that Flower and Cook will stay on as team  director and captain respectively, despite the 5-0 whitewash that would certainly lead to sackings in other sports. Going nowhere: England captain Alastair Cook, pictured here leading his team from the field after losing the final Ashes Test to Australia, is unlikely to be removed from his position . The players’ response, with the dressing room staying remarkably united in the circumstances, is unlikely to condemn captain or coach and nor will Downton, who needs time to settle into a job he does not start officially until next month. After such a fiasco, it would be ridiculous for no heads to roll. So batting coach Graham Gooch and Richard Halsall, Flower’s deputy and fielding coach, are the most likely scapegoats. ....................................................................... The hallowed home dressing room at the Sydney Cricket Ground was opened up to Manchester United when they held a training session there on a pre-season tour. Unimpressed with the setting was . United boss David Moyes, who shares his predecessor’s belief that if . Brazil don’t play it, it doesn’t count as a sport. Coincidentally, . England captain Alastair Cook revealed after the 5-0 whitewash that he . is halfway through Sir Alex Ferguson’s book, which is giving him the . inspiration to carry on. ...................................................................... Poor Monty Panesar might have failed to . lure American backpacker Alison to his hotel room in Melbourne via . social media after the fourth-Test defeat. But it is understood a couple of the . divorced spinner’s single England team-mates have had a lot more success . on tour using the same matchmaking phone app Tinder that facilitates . meeting viable partners in the user’s surrounding area. No luck: Some of England spinner Monty Panesar's team-mates are believed to have had success with matchmaking app Tinder while in Australia . This England tour seems to have gone pear-shaped since some of the squad got upset that their last few days at home before 10 weeks Down Under would be taken up by a team-bonding exercise — still, bizarrely, the subject of the utmost secrecy. It was organised by former SAS soldier Floyd Woodrow, who is CEO of Chrysalis Worldwide, described as one of the leading values-based performance optimisation organisations. Too strong: England performed poorly against Australia, pictured here celebrating their Ashes victory, after attending a team-bonding exercise before travelling Down Under . The only public mention of the Staffordshire-based trip is Woodrow’s tweet: ‘Outstanding three days with one of my favourite teams. 'They picked up complicated training quickly and executed the drills to perfection.’ If one word sums up England’s displays since, it ain’t perfection. ‘Assassins’ fire blanks . The Test team dressing-room doors display — as part of security regulations — the mugshots of all those allowed access. There were 34 on the England door compared to Australia’s 31, including an excessive number of support personnel who only helped muddle minds judging by the performances. Struggling: England's Jonathan Trott was forced to quit this winter's Ashes series with a stress-related illness . The work done by sports psychologist Mark Bawden has to be questioned with so many England players failing to cope with the stresses of an Ashes tour. Bawden, who gave up cricket after suffering the yips, uses profiling tools to characterise people. He said pre-tour: ‘Alastair Cook is a really good example of an assassin (a thinker), someone who’s able repeatedly to stay within his bubble and do his own thing.

Watching her pout over a hot stove, viewers have grown used to seeing Nigella Lawson's plump lips dressed with a touch of rouge. But after losing the red lipstick for a more natural look, it appears the 54-year-old TV chef may have sparked a trend - with sales of nude lipsticks rising by 62 per cent. According to high street chain Debenhams, nude and sheer lipsticks have been outselling bright reds and hot pinks for the first time in three years. Change: The TV chef was famed for her love of pillar box red lipstick but has since swapped it for a nude shade . The natural trend - which has been mirrored across fashion catwalks - also appears to have been favoured by Hollywood's leading ladies. Arriving on the red carpet of last weekend's Oscar Awards Ceremony Julia Roberts and Cate Blanchet who ditched their usual crimson lips for a nude look. However retail experts yesterday claimed it is not celebrity trend setters fuelling the rise in sales but instead a theory dubbed the 'lipstick index'. Economists believe sales of bright red lippy will rise during economic recession and therefore fall during an upturn. Surprise: Her scaled-down make up on the latest cover of British Vogue was a surprising change from her usual look . Midas touch: Within days of her shoot for The Taste being released, this Midhurst dress was sold out . EstÃ©e Lauder chairman, Leonard Lauder, coined theory in 2001 although the effect was first noted in the 1930s Depression. Speaking about the rising sales figures post-recession, health and beauty director for Debenhams, Sara Stern said: 'The trend for sheer, nude lips and more natural make-up was first highlighted on the spring, summer 2014 catwalks and has been seen on countless celebrities ever since. The glamorous chef, who used to write for Vogue, has a history of sparking style trends in both fashion and cooking. Her penchant for Donna Karan's figure-hugging dresses led to high street stores stocking similar garments, and a spike in the designer's sales. In January, it emerged the blue Midhurst dress by Diva Catwalk that Nigella wore in The Taste sold out within days of the advert hitting screens. And retailers such as Waitrose have dubbed her the reason for an upturn in home-baking during the summer months - it is normally a winter activity. 'The Oscars saw a large number of stars wearing neutral make up, and the same can be said for our popular and favourite TV personalities. 'Even reality star Kim Kardashian has recently undergone a make-under, transitioning from bright red lipstick and heavy application, towards a softer more relaxed appearance I like to call naked make-up. 'This look creates an illusion of being make-up free but with full coverage, perfect for summer.' Today an estimated 81 per cent of women worldwide wear lipstick, with best nude sellers including Rouge Dior Nude, Clinique's Twilight Nude and Urban Decay's Naked. But despite the move to a more natural look, red lipstick look is still a firm favourite among a host of stars such as actresses Scarlett Johansson and Anne Hathaway. The iconic scarlet look was also always worn by Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor. Even Elizabeth I used beeswax and plant extracts to create crimson lips. But in 1770 parliament made lipstick illegal, ruling women found guilty of 'seducing men into matrimony using cosmetic means' could be tried for witchcraft. Queen Victoria also found lipstick vulgar, but it was popularised by silent movie actresses in the early twentieth century. The first modern swivel lipstick tube was patented in 1923 and companies such as Chanel, Helena Rubenstein, and Max Factor soon ensured almost every woman had one in their handbag.","Nude and sheer lipsticks outselling hot pinks for first time in 3 years .

Dan Harris, the co-host of ABC's Nightline, revealed that it was drug abuse that caused an embarrassing on-air meltdown in 2004. Then a fill-in anchor for Good Morning America, Harris was giving news updates one morning when he suddenly seized up and had to cut his segment short half-way through. At the time, Harris was using cocaine and ecstasy to quell depression he developed after covering war for several years. That drug use is what caused the panic attack, Harris admitted in a confessional blog post on ABCNews.com. That professional slip-up in front of five million viewers provided Harris a much-needed intervention, and he gave up drugs right then. Coming clean: Nightline co-anchor Dan Harris admitted to a past of cocaine and ecstasy abuse in a confessional blog post on ABC News' website . Video Source ABC . He's finally decided to come forward about his dark past in hopes that it might help others find solace the same way he has - through meditation. That spring morning, Harris was filling in, giving news updates when the panic attack struck. 'I was overtaken by a massive, irresistible blast of fear. It felt like the world was ending. My heart was thumping. I was gasping for air. I had pretty much lost the ability to speak. 'And all of it was compounded by the knowledge that my freak-out was being broadcast live on national television. Halfway through the six stories I was supposed to read, I simply bailed, squeaking out a ""Back to you.""' Harris said he first started self-medicating in 2003, after returning from the Middle East where he covered war in Afghanistan, Israel, Palestine and Iraq for several years. When he got back to the states, Harris said he became depressed and started using the drugs as a way to mimic the adrenaline of the battlefield. He says he never mixed his work life with drugs, and mostly took them on the weekends. Author: Harris says it was meditation that helped him overcome his post-war problems, and wrote about the practice in his new book . But even if he wasn't taking the drugs at work, they still had a impact on his adrenaline levels all the time - boosting his chances of having a panic attack. 'It didn't matter that I hadn't gotten high in the days or weeks leading up to my on-air Waterloo; those side-effects lingered,' he said. After the attack, Harris' boss Peter Jennings assigned him to cover religion and through his reporting he found a solution to his post-war problems. 'Leveraging my position as a reporter, I explored everything from mainstream religion to the bizarre fringes of self-help to the nexus of spirituality and neuroscience. 'The accidental yet enormously helpful end result of all this poking around: I became a reluctant convert to meditation.' He says he practices meditation because it has a direct impact on his attitude, making him 10 per cent happier. Harris has written about his transition to a life of meditation in new book '10% Happier: How I tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works - A True Story'. Harris co-anchors Nightline and continues to work for the weekend edition of Good Morning America.

People who have trouble sleeping tend to have less volume in certain regions of the brain than those without sleep problems, a new study of Persian Gulf War veterans suggests. 'People discount the importance of sleep. So many things seem so much more important than a few extra hours of sleep a night,' lead author Linda L. Chao told Reuters Health. 'The study suggests we shouldn't discount sleep importance,' she said. The researchers of the study studied the brains of 144 mostly male veterans using MRI . Chao, from the University of California, San Francisco, collaborated with researchers at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Francisco on the study published in the journal Sleep. Previous research has linked sleep disturbances to structural brain changes, the authors note. In their study, sleep was associated with the amount of gray matter in the brain's frontal lobe in particular. 'There's other corroborating data showing that insomnia and a variety of psychiatric illnesses are reflected in reduced volumes in the brain, which makes sense because sleep and mood are functions of the brain,' Dr. John Winkelman told Reuters Health. A psychiatrist, Winkelman is chief of the sleep disorders clinical research program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was not involved in the current study. He described the frontal lobes as ""an essential part of human functioning,"" necessary for planning, strategizing, mood and affect.Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently complain about sleep difficulties, according to Chao and her colleagues. Studies have found high rates of sleep disorders among veterans of America's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who had head injuries or PTSD (see Reuters Health story of October 28, 2011. People with reduced sleep quality had reduced frontal lobe gray matter and more psychological problems than people who didn't . For the current study, the researchers scanned the brains of 144 mostly male veterans using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They measured sleep quality with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, a crude, self-rated index that asks broad questions about sleep patterns over the past month. For example, the index asks participants a single question about the time they usually went to bed over the past month and another about how long it usually took them to fall asleep. The researchers found participants who reported poor quality sleep overall had less frontal lobe gray matter than vets who reported sleeping relatively well. In addition to sleep troubles, a host of psychological problems plagued the study veterans. Half had abused alcohol, 40 percent had had major depressive disorder at some point and 18 percent had PTSD. Still, the link between sleep troubles and brain volume held even after the researchers took those problems and psychotropic medicine use into account. The more people study veteran sleep patterns the more they can help veterans improve their life and their mood . Winkelman cautioned against inferring a cause-and-effect relationship between sleep and brain volume or generalizing the results of a study on veterans with a range of psychiatric problems to the general population. But Chao believes the findings could apply to anyone, not just war veterans. Although she stressed that the study underscores the importance of a good night's sleep, she agreed that it's not possible to say that troubled sleep causes a decrease in frontal lobe gray matter, or vice versa. 'We only know there's a relationship,' Michael Breus, an Arizona clinical psychologist who is board-certified in sleep disorders, told Reuters Health. 'We don't know which came first.' Breus was not involved in the current study. He applauded the researchers for examining sleep patterns in war veterans, a group particularly plagued with disturbed sleep. 'If they've been in an active theater of war, they haven't slept well since they've been in an active war,' he said. He said polysomnography, which monitors people's sleep and collects objective data, would have made the results of the current study more meaningful.Chao also said she would have preferred to use objective sleep data. But the current report was based on a second look at data from a prior study. 'The data says to us this could be a very interesting population to learn more about,' Breus said. 'If we can learn more about veteran sleep, we can help them sleep more.'","For the current study, the researchers scanned the brains of 144 mostly male veterans using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

It was one of the few moments that San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick decided to challenge Sherman, trying to find Crabtree on a throw to the end zone in the final minute.

An investigation into the racially charged Miami Dolphins bullying scandal detailed widespread harassment in the team's locker room that extended beyond the two players at the centre of the probe. The NFL-ordered report stated there was a 'pattern of harassment' committed by at least three players and extended to two lineman and an assistant trainer, all targets of vicious taunts and racist insults. Lawyer Ted Wells released the report, saying guard John Jerry and center Mike Pouncey followed Richie Incognito's lead in harassing Jonathan Martin, who left the team in October. They threatened to rape his sister, called him a long list of slurs and bullied him for not being 'black enough'. Bullied: An investigation found that Richie Incognito (left) engaged in a 'pattern of harassment' against teammate Jonathan Martin (right) 'Bully': Offensive lineman John Jerry also is accused of harassing Martin and others in the Miami Dolphins organization . Harassment: Mike Pouncey (pictured), Richie Incognito and John Jerry engaged in a 'pattern of harassment' against Martin and others . In a statement emailed by a league . spokesman, the NFL did not make any mention of possible punishment . stemming from the case. The league only confirmed it had received the . report and said it appreciated the Dolphins' cooperation with the . investigation. Wells said he does not intend to comment further. Martin is biracial, Incognito is white, and Jerry and Pouncey are black. Martin's agent Kenneth Zuckerman said his client feels 'vindicated' by the report. 'He . feels a great sense of relief,' Zuckerman told The Associated Press. 'Jonathan Martin is a great man and he's only shown me that he is very . honest since the day I met him. He loves football and is eager to get . back on the field, regardless of what team he plays for.' Incognito's . attorney, Mark Schamel, released a statement calling Wells' report . 'replete with errors' and said that Martin 'was never bullied by Richie . Incognito or any member of the Dolphins' offensive line.' Incognito . sent a tweet Friday night, saying: 'You could not define me in 144 . years let alone 144 pages Mr Wells. Thank you for your hard work and . dedication.' Martin, who has two years left on his contract with the Dolphins, declined interview requests.Incognito was suspended in November, but Pouncey and Jerry remained starters throughout the season. The . report mentioned another offensive lineman and an assistant trainer who . also routinely came under attack from the trio. Neither was identified . in the report. The . report chronicled Martin's struggle to deal with a 'pattern of . harassment', including emotional text exchanges with his parents and a . description of him crying in the bathroom after one particularly painful . attack. Martin also . told investigators that he 'believed that trying to engage in a physical . confrontation with these three - whom he viewed as a united group - . would only make matters worse.' The . inquiry said Martin was taunted and ridiculed almost daily. After . Martin left the team, Incognito boasted about 'breaking Jmart' in a . notebook the linemen used to tally fines and bonuses among themselves. When the investigation began, Incognito asked another player to destroy . the book, saying: 'They're going to suspend me.' The . other harassed player was 'subjected to homophobic name-calling and . improper physical touching,' while the assistant trainer, who was born . in Japan, was subjected to racial slurs. 'It . was not difficult to conclude that the Assistant Trainer and Player A . were harassed, but the questions raised in Martin's case were more . complex, nuanced and difficult,' the report says.Although Wells . concluded that Martin was abused by three teammates, the report said . 'they did not intend to drive Martin from the team or cause him lasting . emotional injury.' Investigation: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell ordered an investigation of the Dolphins after Martin quit the team in October . Investigation: Attorney Ted Wells was hired by the NFL to conduct an independent investigation into the Miami Dolphins . April 23, 2013 - Martin writes to his mother: 'I'm a push over, a people pleaser. I avoid confrontation whenever I can, I always want everyone to like me. I let people talk about me, say anything to my face, and I just take it, laugh it off, even when I know they are intentionally trying to disrespect me. I mostly blame the soft schools I went to, which fostered within me a feeling that I'm a huge p****, as I never got into fights. I used to get verbally bullied every day in middle school and high school, by kids that are half my size. I would never fight back, just get sad & feel like no one wanted to be my friend, when in fact I was just being socially awkward. Most people in that situation are witty & quick with sarcastic replies, I never have been. I'm awkward around people a lot of the time because I simply don't know how to act around them.' April 29, 2013 - Martin writes to his father: 'People call me a Nigger to my face. Happened 2 days ago. And I laughed it off. Because I am too nice of a person. They say terrible things about my sister. I don't do anything. I suppose it's white private school conditioning, turning the other cheek.' May 5, 2013 - Martin writes to his mother: 'I'm never gonna change. I got punked again today. Like a little b****. And I never do anything about it. I was sobbing in a rented yacht bathroom earlier. January, 2013 - Martin writes to his mother: 'I have really severe depression. There are many instances where I can't get out of bed... I'm really embarrassed to talk about it with anyone in person, I tried to with you when I was home but I couldn't do it. I've managed to keep it under control for the most part on my own. Anyways, I really do wanna take care of it, because it is debilitating & keeps me from reaching my potential in all facets of life.'May 28, 2013 - Martin writes his mother: 'I just don't really see the point in things. It's a major accomplishment for me if I brush my teeth or eat more than 1 meal in a day on off days. It's not that I'm sad, just unmotivated.' Evaluating . Martin's claims was difficult, 'given his mental health issues, his . possible heightened sensitivity to insults and his unusual, ""bipolar"" friendship with Incognito,' the report said. 'Nonetheless, . we ultimately concluded that Martin was indeed harassed by Incognito, . who can fairly be described as the main instigator.' The . report comes about three months after the league hired Wells to . investigate the case, which prompted a national debate about hazing and . workplace bullying. 'To a . great extent, Incognito dictated the culture,' the report said. 'We . doubt that matters would have gotten so out of hand had Incognito not . set a tone on the offensive line that made extremely vulgar taunting a . typical form of communication.' Dolphins . offensive line coach Jim Turner didn't attempt to stop the behavior and . even took part in some of the taunting of 'Player A', the report said. Several people interviewed told investigators that Turner gave Player A, . a male sex doll as a gag gift around Christmas 2012. Turner told . investigators he did not remember the incident, but investigators said . they did not believe him. However, . the report found no evidence that the Dolphins front office or head . coach Joe Philbin was aware of the conduct Martin found abusive. The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin abruptly left the team on October . 28. He was briefly hospitalized and then joined his family in . California and underwent counseling for emotional issues. Incognito was . barred from the season's last eight games. Incognito . expressed regrets about the racist and profane language he used with .

"By . Ricky Ponting . PUBLISHED: . 17:30 EST, 31 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:30 EST, 31 December 2013 . Deep down, England will know it’s going to be hard to avoid the whitewash now. They had a great chance to make it 3-1 in Melbourne, but it was almost as if they had forgotten how to win. When you’re more than 100 ahead with all 10 wickets in hand, you have to think you’re not going to lose from there. Their confidence just seemed shot to pieces. It’s amazing, really, when you think where they were a few months ago. Michael Carberry played an innings that was totally out of character, and Joe Root was just too tentative. You could see them waiting for something to change, but you have to make things changes yourself. People have been getting stuck into Alastair Cook’s captaincy, and I agree that he has to think a bit more outside the box. But he’s had a good bowling attack at his disposal for a while, and generally speaking that means you don’t have to do anything fancy. Despair: Alastair Cook's England team has forgotten how to win and missed a gold chance in Melbourne . Out of character: Michael Carberry wasn't himself and Joe Root was too tentative in the Melbourne Test . What he’s discovering now is that victorious captains rarely get as much credit as they should, while defeated captains get all the flak. I don’t buy into the argument that he’s too nice to be a Test captain - there’s nothing wrong with being nice. But you’ve just got to make sure you stay ahead of the game, and he’s not been able to do that with this team. He’s still young, this is his first series defeat out of six, and there aren’t too many others queuing up to replace him. Let’s give the guy a chance to turn things round. That said, a couple of things have surprised me. It was strange to see Graeme Swann retire in the middle of the series. I don’t know how much his body is hurting him, but I thought he took a potshot or two at his team-mates, especially when he made the point that he couldn’t be expected to bowl so many overs in the second innings with his elbow. To me, that sounded like he felt his batters weren’t giving him enough runs to defend or enough time to recover from the first innings. Who knows, perhaps he was told that he wouldn’t be playing at the MCG and decided to get in there first. I felt that if England were going to . get anything out of the series, their senior players had to stand up as a . unit. That hasn’t happened. I . was also surprised by the decision to drop Matt Prior, especially . because Jonny Bairstow doesn’t look like a long-term choice as . wicketkeeper. Why not allow Prior to play until the end of the series, . because I can’t see Bairstow keeping the gloves for England’s first Test . next summer. Strange call: Graeme Swann's retirement came at a curious time and he may have had a dig at his batsmen . Long-term: Matt Prior should have seen out the series, as Jonny Bairstow doesn't look permanent replacement . The question Cook and the selectors will have to ask themselves now is whether they can get another couple of years out of the likes of Kevin Pietersen and Jimmy Anderson, because they’ll want them for the 2015 Ashes. The nucleus is certainly there. As for Australia, it’s been a case of some outstanding individual performances from Mitchell Johnson and Brad Haddin, with good back-up from David Warner, Michael Clarke and Ryan Harris. Their senior players have seized the moments, and they’ve played good team cricket. It’s going to be fascinating to see . how they fare in South Africa, who have just lost Jacques Kallis and . will start to find soon that life is less straightforward when some of . your best players begin to call it a day. Lethal: Mitchell Johnson has been a stand-out for Australia with 31 wickets in the series so far . Outstanding: Australia's pace spearhead Ryan Harris and keeper-batsman Brad Haddin have been stand-outs . England have experienced that first hand on this tour, whereas Australia feel like a team on the way up (as do India, who have some great young batters). If Harris stays fit in South Africa, where Johnson has had some success in the past, it could be a great shootout between the two sets of fast bowlers. Australia have spoken about regaining the top of the Test rankings, but they have to be realistic about where they’re at. There’s a long way to go, and their first goal has to be to wrap it up 5-0 in Sydney this week. I thought they would be at their most vulnerable at Melbourne, after the euphoria of regaining the Ashes at Perth. But they came through a scare at the MCG, and now they have a great chance to inflict some scars on the England team before the sides next meet in 18 months’ time. Sorry, England, but it’s hard to see it being anything other than 5-0.","The tourists have forgotten how to win in a short few months .

The privately educated sister of Boris Johnson has tried being poor for a week for a BBC documentary . She said: 'The poor people you see on the box are all fat.

She said the diet comprised mostly of 'white bread, sugar, and frozen stuff', and the realisation soon dawned that poverty and obesity are two sides of the same coin. The Mayor's sister said the experience had made her realise how much money she has wasted, and think twice about spending £3 for a 'flat white' coffee, after realising how much food the figure could buy for a 'poor family'. She told the Radio Times: 'There's this terrible sense of human waste. They're existing, rather than living, like battery hens. Apart from the telly and the cigarettes, they are living like animals.'

Paris Saint-Germain are back on the trail of Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic but are set to be disappointed. The powerful Serb, a cult hero at Stamford Bridge, has opened discussions over a new contract and wants to stay with Chelsea. PSG coach Laurent Blanc is keen to add a new right back with Ivanovic, Manchester City's Pablo Zabaleta and Newcastle's Mathieu Debuchy among his prospective targets. Blocked: Chelsea are set to reject any offer from French champions PSG for Branislav Ivanovic (right) Wanted man: PSG boss Laurent Blanc is targeting a new right back this summer and Ivanovic is his No 1 target . Alternatives: PSG are also looking at Man City's Pablo Zabaleta (left) and Newcastle's Mathieu Debuchy . Indeed Ivanovic was courted by the French champions last summer but he was assured he had a significant role to play under Jose Mourinho and the Portuguese coach has been satisfied with the 29-year-old's contribution to Chelsea's challenge for the Premier League title. Ivanovic has two years left on a deal worth around £120,000 a week but is expected to revise those terms and extend by another two years if all goes to plan over the coming weeks. He has figured in 31 games this season and scored the decisive goal in in what could prove a pivotal 1-0 win at Manchester City last week. He is regarded by Mourinho as one of his trusted senior professionals and his influence on the squad will prove all the more important as Chelsea bring in younger players in the summer. Kurt Zouma, the 19-year-old France defender, is arriving from St Etienne and 18-year-old left back Luke Shaw is expected from Southampton should they successfully fend off competition from Manchester United and City for his £25m transfer. Chelsea were once again among clubs represented at PEC Zwolle's game against Ajax on Sunday.The Stamford Bridge club were joined by scouts from Manchester United, City and Arsenal as they continue to monitor Ajax defender Joel Veltman. MailOnline revealed last week that 22-year-old Veltman and his club mate Stefano Denswil were among the centre backs being considered by United in particular as they weigh up prospective replacements for Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand. David Moyes would prefer someone with greater experience but won't let that get in the way of recruiting a player of such promise. Get to grips: Chelsea have been tracking Ajax right back Joel Veltman in recent months . Described by Frank de Boer as 'Not Veltman but a veldheer (a general)' following a man-of-the-match performance against Celtic in November, Veltman has overcome fears about an old knee injury to show why he is regarded as one of Ajax's finest academy graduates. Much credit has also been given to his one-to-one coaching sessions with former United defender Jaap Stam. Underlining a determination to snub all bids though, Ajax director Marc Overmars says the club intend to increase his £9,000 a week wages and extend his contract beyond 2017. 'I will barricade the doors and I will go and stand behind the door myself to stop them from taking him. He means too much to us,' said Overmars. 'Jaap has been working on him really hard with individual coaching at Ajax. He is a massive talent and players have been leaving this club too early in their careers.' Dinamo Zagreb are trying to see if Premier League clubs can outbid Barcelona in the battle for teenage prospect Alen Halilovic. Barcelona . have already had a £3.2million bid rejected in recent days for the . 17-year-old who has been studied closely by Tottenham and Manchester . United over the past two years and been hailed as a player of even . greater potential than Luka Modric. Twinkle toes: Barcelona have already bid for Alen Halilovic, but Dinamo Zagreb want more money for him . The . Spanish league leaders are due to send a delegation to Croatia this . week as they crank up the pressure on Zagreb to sell. They see Halilovic . as the long-term replacement for Xavi and are ready to give him time to . develop as the Spanish midfield maestro closes out his career at the . Nou Camp. Zagreb chairman . Zdravko Mamic wants closer to £12m for Halilovic but recognises most of . that will be offered in instalments. However, that won't stop Zagreb . asking Premier League sides to make them an offer in the hope of . triggering an auction. Barcelona, . meanwhile, have added FC Basle centre half Fabian Schar to their list of . potential summer recruits. The Switzerland defender has been . watched by Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea. Manchester City are in discussions over signing 12-year-old Kevin Ackermann, which has raised eyebrows at his club IFK Gothenburg. Ackermann and his family are prepared to move to England after deciding City's academy would be the best place for the youngster's development. Talking to the Swedish media, IFK academy director Roger Gustafsson said: 'We certainly think it's scary here. It's not a trend we want to see. I understand this opportunity may never come again so I don't want to judge anyone. 'We've been in contact with City and these guys have gone over with our approval and we had a coach who was with them in England. 'I have not heard of clubs looking for 12-year-olds in Sweden before. But the work is going in an entirely different way abroad, especially in the Premier League. 'They're betting harder and harder and taking in all younger players.' City are also among European clubs keen on Gremio's 17-year-old Brazilian forward Everton who made his senior debut last month. He scored 20 goals for Gremio’s youth side last season. Arsenal are looking at inviting Djurgardens prospect Filip Tasic back for further trials. The 15-year-old right winger has just completed a short spell at Arsenal's academy and met up with idols Mesut Ozil and Jack Wilshere. He told dif.se: 'It was powerful. Ozil is my idol so when I got to meet him, it was incredible. Yet I did meet all the first team players every day at the training ground when they were in, for example, the restaurant and the pool. 'The most sociable was Jack Wilshere. He always came down and talked with the young players and gave advice and tips.' Seamus Coleman's ongoing improvement at Everton has been attracting admiring glances from far and wide this season. The Republic of Ireland full back has been one of several success stories at Goodison Park this season as he continues to develop. Arsenal and Manchester United are both considering approaches for the summer, but so are AC Milan. Clarence Seedorf is replacing right back Ignazio Abate and Coleman has been recommended as one to bear in mind. Attack-minded: Both Manchester United and Arsenal are tracking Everton's right back Seamus Coleman . AC Milan general manager Adriano Galliani said: 'There’s a lot of dialogue between myself and Clarence and it’s clear that when changing the formation, you need new players. In June, we’ll sort out what needs sorting.' Everton will resist all offers as they look to build on this season's performances and challenge for a top-four place again next year. However, they could be offered a healthy profit on the £60,000 David Moyes paid to Sligo Rovers in 2009. Manager Roberto Martinez wants to sign Gareth Barry on a permanent deal and will look at the possibility of signing for Romelu Lukaku. He also wants a left-sided centre back. Southampton are the latest club to show interest in Sheffield United centre back Harry Maguire. Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United have already checked on the 20-year-old who has more than 120 appearances under his belt for the Bramall Lane club. Powerful: Southampton are the latest team to show an interest in Sheffield United's young defender Harry Maguire . The 6ft 4in England U21 defender also impressed during last week's 1-0 FA Cup victory over Premier League Fulham. His goals are an added bonus and he has six this season. That in mind, Southampton's scout was among interested observers during Saturday's 2-0 win over Shrewsbury Town. Liverpool are continuing checks on Nottingham Forest defender Jamaal Lascelles. Everton, Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle have also asked about the 20-year-old in recent weeks. Liverpool are planning to take a closer look at Chesterfield's 6ft 8in goalkeeper Aaron Chapman. The 23-year-old was signed from non-League Belper Town last summer by Paul Cook, who is keen to get him more experience. Chapman agreed a new two year contract last week and has been loaned out to Conference Premier side Chester for a month. Bolton have looked at Chapman while Everton have also had him in for a week's training and now Liverpool are willing to let him train with them as they weigh up his prospects of stepping up. A deal may be unlikely at this stage but Liverpool are in the market for another keeper. They have watched Lee Nicholls at Wigan and Karl Darlow at Nottingham Forest but remain on the look-out. ......................................................................................................................................................................................................... Former West Ham left back Razvan Rat is in talks over a move to Rayo Vallecano. The Romanian was released from his contract last month and is a free agent.

Newcastle boss Alan Pardew is not expected to contest a Football Association charge over his headbutt on Hull midfielder David Meyler. Sportsmail understands the 52-year-old will accept the charge of improper conduct announced on Monday after headbutting Meyler on the touchline at the KC Stadium on Saturday. Pardew has until 6pm on Thursday to respond, and has the right to request a personal hearing to give himself an opportunity to explain his actions. Pardew apologised immediately after the game, which his side won 4-1, but was fined £100,000 pounds and handed a formal warning by the Magpies hours later. VIDEO Scroll down to see Alan Pardew and Steve Bruce's comments after the headbutt . What was he thinking? Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew headbutts Hull City player David Meyler . Clashing point: David Meyler had to restrained by fellow player Hull City player Ahmed Elmohamady . Anger: Meyler was seen pushing Pardew as the pair clashed when a stray ball went out of play . Newcastle . United manager Alan Pardew has been charged in relation to an incident . in his side’s game against Hull City on 1 March 2014. It . is alleged that in the 72nd minute of the fixture, Pardew was involved . in an incident with a Hull City player that amounted to improper . conduct. Due to the serious violent and/or aggressive nature of the reported behaviour this case has been designated as non-standard. Pardew has until 6pm on Thursday 6 March 2014 to respond to the charge. He is likely to receive a significant further penalty if he either accepts or is convicted on the FA charge, and that could include a stadium ban. However, he will not face criminal charges over the incident with Humberside Police having confirmed neither Meyler nor Hull have made a complaint. Meyler is on international duty with the Republic of Ireland, who face Serbia in Dublin on Wednesday night. An FA statement said: ‘Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew has been charged. It is alleged Pardew was involved in an incident with a Hull City player that amounted to improper conduct. ‘Due to the serious violent and/or aggressive nature of the reported behaviour, this case has been designated as non-standard.’ His position could be reviewed by club owner Mike Ashley if the manager is hit with a stadium ban. Pardew did at least discover that he had escaped criminal charges on Monday. A Humberside police chief said Pardew’s conduct could have been deemed ‘offensive’, but added that no-one had requested that the matter be taken further. Chief inspector Richard Kirven said: ‘Having reviewed the circumstances of the incident, it has been agreed that the matter will be dealt with by the FA, rather than considering criminal proceedings. ‘There has been no complaint received from either the player involved or Hull City. Humberside Police will not be taking any further action.’ We have been working with the FA and the football club to progress the matter appropriately. Having . reviewed the circumstances of the incident it has been agreed that the . matter will be dealt with by the FA rather than considering any criminal . proceedings. There has been no complaint received from the player involved or Hull City Association Football Club at this time. Whilst . we appreciate that some people may have found the behaviour displayed . at the game on Saturday offensive, Humberside Police will not be taking . any further action.' It was only recently that the club dismissed reserve-team coach Willie Donachie amid allegations that he struck a player, understood to be 19-year-old defender Remie Streete, and the pressure could mount on the club to be just as tough. FA chairman Greg Dyke has already described it as a ‘serious’ issue while leading figures in the game have said Pardew’s position is ‘untenable’. When the then Blackpool manager Paul Ince was punished for physically confronting the fourth official in the tunnel at Bournemouth earlier this season, he was hit with a five-game stadium ban. A 10-game ban for Pardew would see . him miss the rest of the season with matchday duties switching to . assistants John Carver and Steve Stone, leaving Newcastle owner Mike . Ashley looking at the long-term repercussions. The . controversial owner, who gave Pardew an eight-year deal last season, is . understood to have acted swiftly on Saturday evening in an attempt to . draw a line under the incident and end speculation that he intends to . sack Pardew. But Ashley . holds a review of all aspects of the club at the end of every season . and Pardew’s behaviour is certain to come under scrutiny despite him . being almost certain to provide the top-half finish which was his target . for this season.

Newcastle United are disappointed with the actions of its manager Alan Pardew this afternoon (Saturday, 1st March). His behaviour was unacceptable and is not the behaviour we expect from the manager of Newcastle United. It is most disappointing that this incident has taken the focus away from what was a fantastic performance by the team and an excellent result away from home which leaves the club in eighth place in the Barclays Premier League. Sadly, the headlines tomorrow will not be focused on the result or the efforts of the players, but instead on the actions of our manager. Alan unreservedly apologised immediately following the game to the player, to Hull City Football Club and its fans, and to the fans of Newcastle United. We have held discussions this evening with Alan who has offered his sincere apologies to the Club and it is clear he deeply regrets his actions. Alan has accepted a formal warning from the Club in relation to his behaviour today and also a Club fine of £100,000. The Club is now drawing a line under this matter and will be making no further comment. The Newcastle manager fined himself last month for a foul-mouthed attack on Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini. At the start of last season he pushed a linesman in the back and was involved in an ugly row with ex-Sunderland boss Martin O’Neill during the Tyne-Wear derby. On Sunday even Richard Bevan, the chief executive of the League Managers’ Association, could not defend Pardew. Bevan was keen to stress that the second longest-serving manager in the Premier League was ‘extremely sorry’, but having spoken to Pardew, he said: ‘The buck stops with Alan. It’s unacceptable, it’s inappropriate and it’s insupportable from every perspective. Not happy: Arsene Wenger took issue with Pardew's celebrations as West Ham beat Arsenal 1-0 in 2006 . Heated: Martin O'Neill took exception to Pardew's over-zealous celebrations in the 2011 Tyne-Wear derby . Frankly, I was shocked and disgusted by Pardew’s incredibly irresponsible action. And yet, and even more disturbingly, I wasn’t completely surprised. Pardew has a lot of previous, a lengthy list of touchline bust-ups and misbehaviour. When manager of Ipswich Town, I had personal experience of Pardew’s touchline impropriety during a play-off semi-final with his then club West Ham. I was alarmed, to say the least, by the way he tried to influence the officials. 'Alan knows that. He immediately realised . the serious error, made sincere apologies to all parties. But Alan does . need to think about how not to put himself in that position again.’ Pardew has said he would have to ‘sit down and stay out of the way’ rather than roam his technical area. Bevan nevertheless believes certain issues need to be addressed. Bevan told Sportsmail: ‘We did a technical report last year. Now we are working on a second report. I don’t mention this now because of Alan but because it is an important project. 'There can be too much traffic in the technical areas and sometimes problems arise because of that.' Hot water: Pardew called Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini a 'f****** old c***' in January . Best of pals: Barton, who has often found himself in trouble for acting out, came out in Pardew's defence . Spitting feathers: Pardew was banned for two matches after pushing a linesman against Tottenham in 2012 . Room with a view: The Newcastle boss was banished to the St James' Park stands after the push . November 2006: Pardew had earlier in the year criticised Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger for failing to field an English player in the Champions League match against Real Madrid and matters came to a head in West Ham's 1-0 win over Arsenal. Then West Ham boss Pardew's enthusiastic celebrations appeared to irritate Wenger, who claimed he was 'provoked in a disrespectful way', with the pair having to be kept apart by the fourth official. On this occasion, it was the Gunners boss who was fined by the Football Association, with Pardew cleared of all charges. March 2012: In a Tyne-Wear derby, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the tension boiled over, with Pardew, now Newcastle boss, clashing with Martin O'Neill following his celebration to Shola Ameobi's late equaliser in a heated match. Both managers pledged afterwards to keep their emotions in check in future. August 2012: Pardew came under severe criticism and then afterwards labelled his behaviour 'ridiculous' when he shoved linesman Peter Kirkup in the Magpies' season opener against Tottenham after disagreeing with the official's decision to award Spurs a throw-in. Pardew once again apologised for his actions but the Football Association took a dim view and hit him with a two-match touchline ban and a £20,000 fine. January 2014: Pardew became involved in another touchline row, less than a month after having heated words with Southampton boss Pochettino, with Manchester City manager Pellegrini.

United manager Alan Pardew has been charged in relation to an incident . in his side’s game against Hull City on 1 March 2014. It . is alleged that in the 72nd minute of the fixture, Pardew was involved . in an incident with a Hull City player that amounted to improper . conduct. Due to the serious violent and/or aggressive nature of the reported behaviour this case has been designated as non-standard. Pardew has until 6pm on Thursday 6 March 2014 to respond to the charge. This means that the FA will not need to call on an experienced and expensive QC to chair the commission. An FA statement said: ‘Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew has been charged. It is alleged Pardew was involved in an incident with a Hull City player that amounted to improper conduct. ‘Due to the serious violent and/or aggressive nature of the reported behaviour, this case has been designated as non-standard.’ Pardew has already been fined £100,000 and issued with a formal warning by Newcastle, but his position could be reviewed by club owner Mike Ashley if the manager is hit with a stadium ban. Pardew did at least discover that he had escaped criminal charges on Monday. A Humberside police chief said Pardew’s conduct could have been deemed ‘offensive’, but added that no-one had requested that the matter be taken further. Chief inspector Richard Kirven said: ‘Having reviewed the circumstances of the incident, it has been agreed that the matter will be dealt with by the FA, rather than considering criminal proceedings. ‘There has been no complaint received from either the player involved or Hull City.

Whilst . we appreciate that some people may have found the behaviour displayed . at the game on Saturday offensive, Humberside Police will not be taking . any further action.' It was only recently that the club dismissed reserve-team coach Willie Donachie amid allegations that he struck a player, understood to be 19-year-old defender Remie Streete, and the pressure could mount on the club to be just as tough. FA chairman Greg Dyke has already described it as a ‘serious’ issue while leading figures in the game have said Pardew’s position is ‘untenable’. When the then Blackpool manager Paul Ince was punished for physically confronting the fourth official in the tunnel at Bournemouth earlier this season, he was hit with a five-game stadium ban.

Newcastle United are disappointed with the actions of its manager Alan Pardew this afternoon (Saturday, 1st March). His behaviour was unacceptable and is not the behaviour we expect from the manager of Newcastle United. It is most disappointing that this incident has taken the focus away from what was a fantastic performance by the team and an excellent result away from home which leaves the club in eighth place in the Barclays Premier League. Sadly, the headlines tomorrow will not be focused on the result or the efforts of the players, but instead on the actions of our manager. Alan unreservedly apologised immediately following the game to the player, to Hull City Football Club and its fans, and to the fans of Newcastle United. We have held discussions this evening with Alan who has offered his sincere apologies to the Club and it is clear he deeply regrets his actions. Alan has accepted a formal warning from the Club in relation to his behaviour today and also a Club fine of £100,000. The Club is now drawing a line under this matter and will be making no further comment. The Newcastle manager fined himself last month for a foul-mouthed attack on Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini. At the start of last season he pushed a linesman in the back and was involved in an ugly row with ex-Sunderland boss Martin O’Neill during the Tyne-Wear derby. On Sunday even Richard Bevan, the chief executive of the League Managers’ Association, could not defend Pardew. Bevan was keen to stress that the second longest-serving manager in the Premier League was ‘extremely sorry’, but having spoken to Pardew, he said: ‘The buck stops with Alan. It’s unacceptable, it’s inappropriate and it’s insupportable from every perspective. Not happy: Arsene Wenger took issue with Pardew's celebrations as West Ham beat Arsenal 1-0 in 2006 . Heated: Martin O'Neill took exception to Pardew's over-zealous celebrations in the 2011 Tyne-Wear derby . Frankly, I was shocked and disgusted by Pardew’s incredibly irresponsible action. And yet, and even more disturbingly, I wasn’t completely surprised. Pardew has a lot of previous, a lengthy list of touchline bust-ups and misbehaviour. When manager of Ipswich Town, I had personal experience of Pardew’s touchline impropriety during a play-off semi-final with his then club West Ham. I was alarmed, to say the least, by the way he tried to influence the officials. 'Alan knows that. He immediately realised . the serious error, made sincere apologies to all parties. But Alan does . need to think about how not to put himself in that position again.’ Pardew has said he would have to ‘sit down and stay out of the way’ rather than roam his technical area. Bevan nevertheless believes certain issues need to be addressed. Bevan told Sportsmail: ‘We did a technical report last year. Now we are working on a second report. I don’t mention this now because of Alan but because it is an important project. 'There can be too much traffic in the technical areas and sometimes problems arise because of that.' Hot water: Pardew called Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini a 'f****** old c***' in January . Best of pals: Barton, who has often found himself in trouble for acting out, came out in Pardew's defence . Spitting feathers: Pardew was banned for two matches after pushing a linesman against Tottenham in 2012 . Room with a view: The Newcastle boss was banished to the St James' Park stands after the push . November 2006: Pardew had earlier in the year criticised Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger for failing to field an English player in the Champions League match against Real Madrid and matters came to a head in West Ham's 1-0 win over Arsenal. Then West Ham boss Pardew's enthusiastic celebrations appeared to irritate Wenger, who claimed he was 'provoked in a disrespectful way', with the pair having to be kept apart by the fourth official. On this occasion, it was the Gunners boss who was fined by the Football Association, with Pardew cleared of all charges. March 2012: In a Tyne-Wear derby, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the tension boiled over, with Pardew, now Newcastle boss, clashing with Martin O'Neill following his celebration to Shola Ameobi's late equaliser in a heated match. Both managers pledged afterwards to keep their emotions in check in future. August 2012: Pardew came under severe criticism and then afterwards labelled his behaviour 'ridiculous' when he shoved linesman Peter Kirkup in the Magpies' season opener against Tottenham after disagreeing with the official's decision to award Spurs a throw-in. Pardew once again apologised for his actions but the Football Association took a dim view and hit him with a two-match touchline ban and a £20,000 fine. January 2014: Pardew became involved in another touchline row, less than a month after having heated words with Southampton boss Pochettino, with Manchester City manager Pellegrini.

Sportsmail's Jonathan McEvoy goes on the trail of the Blade Runner . South African prosecutors who charged Olympian Oscar Pistorius with murder have admitted he may not have had his prosthetic legs on when he fired the shots that killed his girlfriend, removing the key argument the shooting was premeditated. Pistorius, who goes on trial on March 3, denies the charge of murder and claims he mistook his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp for an intruder when he fired a number of bullets through his bathroom door, killing her instantly. Steenkamp, a South African model, was 29. Denial: Oscar Pistorius pleaded not guilty to the charge of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp last year . Killed: Oscar Pistorius will stand trial on March 3 for murdering his girlfriend n Valentine's Day . But documents obtained by South African television news channel eNCA revealed the state’s own ballistics expert said the 27-year-old was ‘most likely’ on his stumps when he pulled the trigger repeatedly. During an extensive bail hearing, prosecutors argued Pistorius took time to put on his prostheses before firing the shots through the locked bathroom door, indicating he was not panicked by the prospect of an intruder. Prosecutors believe security guards at Pistorius’ gated community called the athlete after the shooting to check if everything was okay, to which he replied he was fine and did not require assistance, eNCA reported. Police also claim a neighbour who lives less than 100 metres away heard shouting on Valentine’s Day, the night of Steenkamp’s death. Hero to zero: Pistorius pictured here winning gold at the London 2012 Paralympic Games . Nervous wait: New evidence means Oscar Pistorius may avoid jail after he shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius claims it was an accident, fearing it was an intruder in his home . The National Prosecuting Authority said it had not leaked the documents. ‘The defence has access to everything, to the docket and all evidential material we have,’ spokesman Nathi Mncube said. ‘We don't give anything to any other person other than the defence and if it gets leak(ed), it won't be us. We can't do that because it's damaging to our case.’ Known around the world as ‘the Blade Runner’ for competing on two fibre-optic blades and running against able-bodied athletes in the London 2012 Olympic Games, Pistorius has turned his official website into a noticeboard to post updates and messages of support relating to the case. Last week, on the anniversary of Steenkamp’s death, Pistorius posted on his website: ‘No words can adequately capture my feelings about the devastating accident that has caused such heartache for everyone who truly loved - and continues to love Reeva. ‘The pain and sadness – especially for Reeva’s parents, family and friends consumes me with sorrow. ‘The loss of Reeva and the complete trauma of that day, I will carry with me for the rest of my life.’ Pistorius, who had his legs amputated below the knee when he was a young boy, became the first amputee to win an able-bodied world track medal at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics.

Neurologists have warned that Michael Schumacher now seems unlikely to make a full recovery after spending nearly two months in a drug-induced coma. The 45-year-old fell while skiing in France and hit the right side of his head on a rock, cracking his helmet. Doctors operated to remove blood clots from his brain, but some were left because they were too deeply embedded. Nearly two months after Michael Schumacher suffered serious head injuries in a skiing accident some neurologists say the seven-time Formula One champion seems unlikely to make a full recovery. The racer with his wife Corrina . The seven-time Formula One world champion's condition stabilised after he was placed in the coma. Late last month, doctors began the process of withdrawing sedatives to try to wake him up. His agent, Sabine Kehm, said in an email that 'Michael is still in the wake-up phase' and that 'this phase can be long.' Schumacher's family has released few details of his condition to protect his privacy. 'It does not bode well,' said Dr Tipu Aziz, professor of neurosurgery at Oxford University who is not connected to Schumacher's care. 'The fact that he hasn't woken up implies that the injury has been extremely severe and that a full recovery is improbable.' His agent, Sabine Kehm, said in an email today that 'Michael is still in the wake-up phase' and that 'this phase can be long' Patients who have had major head injuries are sometimes put in a drug-induced coma to give the brain a chance to heal; a coma reduces the need for blood flow and may help the swelling go down. Aziz said doctors typically try every few days to bring someone out of a coma. 'If you don't start getting any positive signs, that becomes very worrisome,' he said, adding that Schumacher's doctors are probably doing regular brain scans to look for signs of activity - though such signs may be difficult to detect if he is still being sedated. Other experts said it was premature to make an accurate prognosis. 'About 90 percent of the recovery is made within nine to 12 months, so this is still early days,' said Dr Anthony Strong, an emeritus chair in neurosurgery at King's College London. 'The longer someone is in a coma, the worse their recovery tends to be.' His agent, Sabine Kehm, said in an email today that 'Michael is still in the wake-up phase' and that 'this phase can be long' Now that several weeks have passed since the accident, doctors may also have a better idea of how the rest of Schumacher's brain is doing. 'MRI scans can show any secondary deterioration in the brain structure,' said Dr. Colin Shieff, a neurosurgeon at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London and a trustee for Headway, a British brain injury charity. He said other parts of Schumacher's brain that weren't directly affected by the accident might now be starting to show worrying signs that may not have been visible before. Shieff said that if Schumacher does eventually come out of the coma, he probably would face significant disabilities because of the length of time he has already spent comatose. While there have been rare instances of people emerging from comas months and years later with the ability to communicate, Shieff was doubtful that would be the case with Schumacher. He said the cases where comatose people made a surprising recovery had mostly suffered things like poisoning, strokes or failed resuscitation attempts. Treatment: Schumacher is currently being kept under anaesthetic at the University Hospital (above) in France .","The 45-year-old fell while skiing in France and hit his head .

On Sunday night FA insiders were not ruling out a stadium ban that could run for at least six games, and possibly even as many as 10, which would keep him away from Newcastle games for the rest of the season. Pardew would also receive another hefty fine. It was only recently that the club dismissed reserve-team coach Willie Donachie amid allegations that he struck a player, understood to be 19-year-old defender Remie Streete, and the pressure could mount on the club to be just as tough.

The Newcastle manager fined himself last month for a foul-mouthed attack on Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini. At the start of last season he pushed a linesman in the back and was involved in an ugly row with ex-Sunderland boss Martin O’Neill during the Tyne-Wear derby. The FA certainly see this as the most serious of Pardew’s cases, and once the governing body has received the referee’s report an independent disciplinary commission will be appointed to deal with what is an unprecedented situation.

"PUBLISHED: . 08:21 EST, 24 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 09:08 EST, 24 February 2014 . Doctors treating stricken Formula One legend Michael Schumacher have reportedly abandoned their attempts to bring him out of his artificial coma following setbacks. German news magazine Focus - which enjoys a close relationship with the 45-year-old's inner circle - claims the slow waking-up process for the seven-time world champion was put on hold last week. Schumacher has lain in an artificially induced coma since December 29 in the University Hospital of Grenoble in France after seriously injuring his head during a low-speed ski accident the same day. Denial: Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm said the waking-up process remained 'unchanged' 'On hold': A German magazine claimed the slow waking-up process had been halted last week . Stricken: Seven-time F1 champion Schumacher with his wife Corinna in the Dolomites, Italy . Doctors announced three weeks ago that they were reducing the anaesthetic keeping him under to slowly bring him around. Now, . according to Focus, that has been halted because of 'complications' although just what those problems are has not been announced. Official . news about Schumacher's condition is scant with the family preferring . only to issue the briefest of bulletins every few weeks. The . latest claim will only add to the concerns of fans worldwide that the . severity of his brain trauma is causing experts concern every step of . the way on his torturous road to recovery. Focus said that, for now, the recovery phase is back on ice and Schumacher is once again medicated to keep him under. The . process was initiated because his  brain injury was so severe doctors . needed to suppress its normal functions to allow it to operate at . low-speed and, hopefully, recover more quickly. Concerned: Corinna Schumacher arrives at Grenoble University Hospital Centre where her husband is being treated . Hope: Felipe Massa has claimed he saw Schumacher's mouth move as he spoke to him . Optimism: Massa says he told 'sleeping' Schumacher all about his car and prospects for the coming season . Only last week, his former Ferrari colleague Felipe Massa had visited Schumacher in hospital and spoken to him. 'He sleeps but looks quite normal,' he said. 'I think he even reacted a bit.' Doctors . may have decided to break off his awakening for a variety of reasons, . including reduced blood flow, a new infection or signals that the drugs . lying in the fatty tissue of his body were not shifting as fast as they . would have hoped. Just a . fortnight ago he contracted, and fought off, a bout of mild pneumonia contracted through the breathing tubes keeping him alive. Now with the latest news the fear is that his hopes of making a complete recovery are dimmer than ever. Trials: Williams driver Massa has been in Bahrain for Winter Testing since Wednesday . Legend: Schumacher is one of the greatest drivers to ever grace a Formula One track . His . wife Corinna, 44, and teenage children Gina-Marie and son Mick are . constantly at his bedside, talking to him throughout the day when he is . massaged, turned and cleaned while hooked up to a bank of machines . keeping him alive. They are said to be deeply troubled at the latest turn of events. It . emerged last week that Schumacher was involved in a road accident with a . motorbike rider in Spain just weeks before his horror ski crash. The . Formula 1 driver was allegedly driving a hire car when he knocked . the man off his bike when he failed to give way at a roundabout. A . court is still looking into the crash in Seville on November 17. The . motorcyclist apparently broke his wrist when hit by Schumacher’s rented . Audi A4. The case is not expected to go to trial as the racing driver's insurer will pay compensation.","Michael Schumacher is lying in an artificially induced coma .

"By . Mia De Graaf . PUBLISHED: . 13:04 EST, 11 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 14:02 EST, 11 March 2014 . Israel's Prime Minister has blasted the West for failing to condemn Iran after he unveiled a shipment of deadly weapons from the country. Benjamin Netanyahu accused Britain and the US of 'hypocrisy' as few statements have been made about the stock of rockets and bullets allegedly bound for Palestinian militants. The haul - including 40 M-302 rockets, 181 mortar shells, and 400,000 bullets - was discovered on March 5 by an Israeli commandos in the Red Sea. Benjamin Netanyahu blasted the West's 'self-deception' as few statements are made about the haul . He addressed a press conference at Eilat naval base, south Israel, where 40 missiles, and 400,000 bullets were being held after commandos stormed an Iranian ship on March 5 - thought to be heading for Gaza . Standing beside cases of weaponry at a naval base in Eilat, south Israel, Mr Netanyahu said: 'At most I heard a few faint condemnations of Iran from the international community. 'In contrast, if we build a balcony in Jerusalem we hear harsh condemnation from the international community.' The rockets are said to have come from Damascus via Tehran, where they were shipped on the Klos C vessel. Mr Netanyahu told the press conference the haul was hidden by bags of cement. Flanked by the defence minister and the army's deputy chief-of-staff, he said the shipment - rumbled by Israeli intelligence - was organised. He added: 'There are those in the international community who would prefer that we were not holding this event today. The KLOS C freighter was holding 40 M-302 rockets, more than 180 mortar shells, and 7.62 calibre bullets . Israel's Prime Minister blasted the US and Britain for condemning Israel's treatment of Palestine but only making faint condemnations of the weaponry that was shipped from Tehran hidden by cement bags . Journalists were transported to the naval base to see the haul and hear Mr Netanyahu's warning . He said world leaders must 'wake from their slumber' and take tougher action on Iran's weapon-building . 'They feel uncomfortable that we are showing what is really happening in Iran. It's difficult for them to accept that we are exposing the truth behind the fake smile of Iran. They prefer to nurture the illusion that Iran has changed direction.' Israel believes that Iran is trying to build a nuclear weapon, a charge Iran denies. Israel says a nuclear-armed Iran would pose a threat to the existence of the Jewish state, citing Iranian calls for Israel's destruction, its development of long-range missiles and its support for militant groups. Netanyahu has been an outspoken critic of the efforts by six world powers to negotiate a deal with Iran that would substantially scale back its nuclear program in exchange for ending international sanctions. Israel believes Iran is trying to build a nuclear weapon, a charge Iran vehemently denies . Mr Netanyahu said a current interim agreement between Iran and the six powers is too lenient . He says a current, interim deal gives Iran too much relief while getting little in return, and fears a final agreement would leave Iran with the capability to make a bomb. Since the global powers reached their interim deal with Iran last November, Netanyahu's warnings about Iran have been largely ignored by world leaders. In the interview, which came following a meeting with President Barack Obama, Netanyahu pressed further. 'I don't just want Iran not to have a bomb. I don't want Iran to have the ability to make a bomb,' he said. Flanked by the defence minister and the army's deputy chief-of-staff, Mr Netanyahu told the press conference the shipment - rumbled by Israeli intelligence - was highly organised . He said: 'If we build a balcony in Jerusalem we hear harsh condemnation from the international community' 'I don't outsource Israeli security.' In a separate interview with America's Channel 2, part of a series that were the first Netanyahu granted to Israel media outlets in more than a year, the prime minister said he was prepared to reach a peace accord with the Palestinians so long as it marked an end to the conflict. He added that while in was clear some Jewish settlements won't be part of a future peace accord, he would make sure the number left out 'will be as low as possible'. He would not elaborate on the fate of these settlers. More than 500,000 settlers live in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories that Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war and which the Palestinians hope will be part of their future state.","Benjamin Netanyahu blasted six powers for 'self-deception'

School officials have confirmed that Yates, from West Seneca New York, is also a student. A news release from Brockport force said: 'Through a joint investigation between the SUNY Brockport Police, the Brockport Police Department and the Sweden Dog Warden, it was learned that a dog was held upside down, and apparently forced to consume beer from a keg during a party that occurred on Saturday, March 8, 2014 at a house located on Monroe Avenue in the village of Brockport.' The pair have been charged with a misdemeanor under Agriculture and Marketing Law for torturing an animal. They will stand trial on April 2 at Sweden Town Court, Monroe County, N.Y. A spokesman for the college told USA today that officials 'were alarmed to see the photos and will investigate it and take appropriate action.' 'But other than that it's pretty difficult to comment because the student privacy laws really tie our hands in terms of what we can say as it relates to specific student discipline,' said spokesman John Follaco.

A Brigham Young University freshman who suffered life-threatening injuries when she was hit by a car as she rode her longboard near campus is making a miraculous recovery, her family has said. Lexi Hansen, 18, remains in critical but stable condition in hospital in Provo, Utah - but has amazed doctors by breathing on her own, spelling out words and even trying to get out of her bed. Her family said they believe they are witnessing a miracle. 'When . they brought her in, the doctors gave her less than a 5 per cent chance . of survival,' Doug Hansen, Lexi's father, told the Deseret News. 'Miracle': Lexi Hansen, 18, was hit by a car while riding her longboard outside campus a week ago and slipped into a coma. But her family said she is now alert and recovering unexpectedly quickly . 'They told us to call our . family and get them here quickly because she wasn’t going to last too . long.' Hansen, who regularly posts photos and videos of her longboarding feats to Facebook, was riding on University Avenue near the BYU campus on Wednesday 26 February when she was hit. A witness told Provo Police that the teenager had her earphones in and appeared to be trying to beat a car that was turning across the road at about 6.20pm. But she was hit by the vehicle, which had right of way. The driver immediately stopped and was not issued with a citation, in what police have called an unfortunate accident. Hansen was not wearing a helmet at the time and sustained a head injury that put her in a coma for several days. Doctors have said that her brain could still continue to swell. But on Sunday, she came out of the coma as her family sang hymns at her bedside, they said on a Facebook page dedicated to her recovery, Pray for Lexi. Hopeful: Doctors were initially not sure if the teenager would survive but she is now breathing on her own . Support: Her large family, including her siblings (pictured), were singing hymns by her bed when she came out of her coma. Lexi (pictured third from right) then gave a hand signal for 'I love you', they said . 'While we were singing, . she hand signed, ""I love you,"" moving her arm around so that everyone . could see,' the family, who are Mormon, wrote on Facebook. 'She then reached for each person's hands individually so she . could squeeze them. We could hardly sing due to the tears streaming down . our face. We knew we were witnessing a miracle.' On Monday, she had her breathing tube removed but her family said she remains in pain and spends much of her time sleeping. Still, they know their daughter is a fighter. 'Every single day is a miracle, every single day,' her mother Marcia said. 'It was a zero per cent when she was found, then one per cent the next day. 'Every doctor and nurse that comes in there, and therapist and whatever, they are just like, ""You know this isn't supposed to happen. You know we are calling her the miracle girl, right?""' Scene: She had her headphones in and was attempting to beat a car so that she could cross this intersection near BYU's campus - but the vehicle hit her and she suffered head injuries . The family said they do not blame the driver for the accident - and have even had dinner with him after reaching out to him. 'He's . gone through torment,' Marcia told the Deseret News. 'We just wanted him . to know that accidents happen, and we love him and we don't want him to . feel guilty.' She said she was grateful for messages of support from friends and strangers, which they have passed on to Lexi. The teenager is a communications major at BYU and wants to be a motivational speaker. Just ahead of the accident, she told her family that motivational speakers had all suffered hardship. 'She said to me, ""You know, Mom, to be a . motivational speaker, everybody has been in some big accident or . something.""

A Virginia family is campaigning to encourage a drug company to allow their sick little boy who is fighting for his life access to life-saving medicine. Josh Hardy, a seven-year-old cancer survivor, needs a drug called Brincidofovir, made by small North Carolina drug company Chimerex, to fight off a viral infection he developed after a recent bone marrow transplant. The drug has not been approved by the FDA, but it has been administered to hundreds of other patients under 'compassionate use' allowances. Fighter: Seven-year-old Josh Hardy has survived four bouts of kidney cancer, heart failure and a bone marrow transplant . Chimerex CEO Kenneth Moch told Fox News that the company made the decision two years ago to stop the compassionate use program, saying they 'cannot afford it' anymore. 'As we progressed to larger and more complex safety trials, we made the decision two years ago to stop the program and focus resources on earning FDA approval,' Moch said. Moch says that saying yes to Josh would mean saying yes to many more patients, draining the company's resources and delaying the time it will take for the drug to progress through the formal studies required before it can be given FDA approval and help many more future patients. However, the company received $72 million in federal funding to develop Brincidofovir. Josh Hardy's mother, Aimee Hardy, says the situation is devastating, especially for a boy who has fought so hard to live. 'There’s no good excuse for us,' she said. 'There’s nothing they can say that will really keep us from asking. We’re begging them to give it to us.' Mother: Aimee Hardy appeared on Fox and Friends, saying she was infuriated that she was not sitting by her son's side and holding his hand, but had to campaign so that he could get the medicine he needs . Family first: Aimee Hardy (with her children - son Josh is second from left) says she will not stop campaigning until her son has the medicine he needs . Courageous: Josh has already battled cancer four times in his seven years . Josh Hardy was diagnosed with cancer of the kidneys in 2007. Since then, he has battled the disease four times. He had been in remission for two years when a bone scan in November of 2013 revealed he had developed a bone marrow disorder due to earlier cancer treatments. In January of this year he had a bone marrow transplant and endured another round of chemotherapy at St Jude's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Following the successful surgery he  developed adenovirus, an infection that can be deadly in people with weakened immune systems. 'Normally, Josh’s immune system would be able to handle the adenovirus if his immune system was set free,' Hardy wrote on her son’s CaringBridge page. 'The challenge is his immune system . can’t be set free yet because his body is still trying to adapt to the . new bone marrow cells. So to keep the body from killing the new cells, . they have to suppress the immune system, thus creating ideal conditions . for adenovirus to advance. Catch 22.' Deadly virus: Josh is in hospital battling a virus that could claim his life, even though a drug exists that could cure it . In his hands: Kenneth Moch, CEO of Chimerex, says the company no longer has a 'compassionate use' program . Brincidofovir has been shown to clear up adenovirus in children in two weeks, reports Fox and Friends. Josh's doctors have also contacted Chimerex requesting their patient be allowed to have the drug, to no avail. 'I feel that it’s just an excuse and we need them to totally change their stance, not only for us but for hundreds or even thousands of people that need [this drug],' Hardy told Fox and Friends. '…To me, [it’s] almost a crime to not make it available to everyone who needs it.' Aimee Hardy has launched a campaign to save her son, and says she will not stop until Josh gets the medicine, even though the fight is stealing precious moments she could be spending with her son. 'I want to be by his bedside, holding his hand, telling him, ""It’s going to be okay,"" but because of this unwillingness to release this drug, I have to leave him and come talk to you and it infuriates me,' Hardy told Fox and Friends. Curable: Josh is suffering from a curable virus that's preying on him because of his compromised immune system . A chance to live: The little boy has been in and out of hospital for much of his short life, never having a chance to do the things other little boys get to . Kenneth Moch said that even a visit to see Josh at St. Jude would not change his mind about letting the child have the medicine. Aimee Hardy told Fox and Friends what Moch would see if he visited Josh's bedside. 'He would see a frail little boy who has a very weak voice and has a hard time staying awake because he’s in so much pain,' she said. 'It’s horrible for us as parents to see, because he’s a vibrant, strong little boy, and even though he is frail, he has a very strong will about him. But things just keep stacking against him, and we just want to do everything we can to give him the opportunity to make a full recovery.' Moch told Fox and Friends that seeing Josh in this state would not change his mind. 'We have have great compassion for this family,' Moch says. 'But this is not just about a single boy.'

The former mayor of New Orleans has been found guilty on 20 of the 21 federal corruption counts he faced including taking bribes and free trips from contractors in exchange for securing city contracts. The federal jury alleged that Ray Nagin accepted the bribes after helping the private companies win million-dollar projects. Nagin is best remembered for his impassioned pleas for help after levees broke during Hurricane Katrina, flooding much of New Orleans and plunging the city into chaos. The corruption that he was charged with occurred both before and after the devastating hurricane in August 2005. Scroll down for video . 'I'm good': Ray Nagin said that he had come to terms with the corruption case filed against him after being found guilty on 20 out of 21 counts on Wednesday (pictured) Time table: His sentence has still not been handed down, but each of the 20 counts he was charged with carries a 3 to 20 year sentence . The Democratic mayor who led the city from 2002 to 2010 was indicted in . January 2013 on charges he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in . bribes and truckloads of free granite in the illegal dealings. He also was charged with accepting thousands of dollars in payoffs from another businessman for his help in securing city contracts. Before the verdict was read, Nagin said outside the courtroom that he's 'been at peace with this for a long time. I'm good.' Nagin testified that key witnesses lied and prosecutors misinterpreted evidence including emails, checks and pages from his appointment calendar linking him to businessmen who said they bribed him. Darkest hour: Nagin, seen here on September 15, 2005 when he announced portions of the city would reopen after the storm, stayed in power until 2010 . Low point: Nagin was in charge of the city during the natural disaster, which eventually called for members of the National Guard t help secure the French Quarter (pictured on September 26, 2005) The defense repeatedly said prosecutors overstated Nagin's authority to approve contracts. His lawyer said there is no proof money and material given to the granite business owned by Nagin and his sons was tied to city business. Back in the day: Nagin is greeted by President Bush after he landed in New Orleans in 2007, two years after the Hurricane . The charges against Nagin included one overarching conspiracy count along with six counts of bribery, nine counts of wire fraud, one count of money laundering conspiracy and four counts of filing false tax returns. He was acquitted of one of the bribery counts. Each charges carries a sentence from 3 to 20 years, but how long he would serve was unclear and will depend on a pre-sentence investigation and various sentencing guidelines. No sentencing date was set. The charges resulted from a City Hall corruption investigation that had resulted in several convictions or guilty pleas by former Nagin associates by the time trial started on January 27. Fradella and Williams, both awaiting sentencing for their roles in separate bribery schemes alleged in the case, each testified that they bribed Nagin. Nagin's former technology chief, Greg Meffert, who also is awaiting sentencing after a plea deal, told jurors he helped another businessman, Mark St. Pierre, bribe Nagin with lavish vacation trips. St. Pierre did not testify. He was convicted in the case in 2011. Nagin said he did not to know his vacation trips to Jamaica and Hawaii were paid for by St. Pierre. He also said he wasn't told that a family trip to New York was paid for by a movie theater owner who, prosecutors said, received help with a city tax issue after Katrina wiped out the theater. Corruption is not a new issue in the Pelican State as it has been rocked by corruption in public office for decades. The most infamous case was that of Governor Huey Long, who went on toe become a Senator before he was assassinated in 1932. The Democrat, who gave himself the nickname of 'the Kingfish', Long was the state's governor during the Depression from 1928 to 1932 and pushed through public works programs using threats, blackmail and all political means he could think of. Many called for his impeachment but he was able to fight off the charge- and eventually win a third term as governor- after he had enough members of the state legislature sign a document saying they would not vote against him in spite of the evidence in exchange for cash and state jobs. Perhaps the most infamous is former governor Edwin Edwards, who had four terms in the 1970s, 80s and 90s before serving time in federal prison for bribery and extortion over a scheme to rig riverboat casino licenses. On release from jail in 2011, the ex-con  launched himself as a reality TV star in a show called The Governor's Wife, following the 86-year-old and his 35-year-old wife Trina. Louisiana was the state that had the most convictions against public officials in the past ten years, according to a September 2013 Justice Department report. The Southern state had nine convictions per 100,000 population. Overall Louisiana convicted 403 public officials in the past ten years- and that figure does not include Nagin's guilty verdict.

Miles O'Brien, the PBS reporter who recently had his left arm amputated in emergency surgery, has spoken out about his 'mind boggling' injury and how he feels as though the limb is still there. The science correspondent appeared on the Today show on Tuesday to share how he's adjusting to life just a month after losing his arm while abroad on assignment. The 54-year-old was wrapping up reporting trips to Japan and the Philippines when he dropped a suitcase of television camera equipment on his arm. 'When I think of all the risky . things I've done in my life - jumping out of airplanes, flying little . airplanes, scuba diving - the fact that a heavy equipment case could . take my arm is mind-boggling,' he said. Scroll down for video . Staying positive: PBS reporter Miles O'Brien said he has been throwing himself into his work since his left arm was amputated last month following a minor accident . He initially ignored the pain, but two days later he asked for the details of a doctor from his hotel and went immediately. The doctor admitted him into a local hospital for acute compartment syndrome, where internal pressure builds within a muscle compartment and stops blood flow. He underwent surgery to relieve the pressure and was warned that he might have to have an amputation if the condition was particularly severe. When he woke up, his arm was amputated above the elbow - but he could feel it. Shock: O'Brien dropped luggage on his arm and when the pain became worse after 2 days he went to a doctor - who rushed him to surgery. When he woke up he discovered his arm had been amputated . Life-changing: An image shows from where the limb was amputated - complete with 'no chew' tape . 'I . felt my arm as if it was there,' he told Guthrie. 'I thought, ""OK, I . dodged that bullet! and then you look down, and it's like, ""Uh oh, that . did not go well."" That was not a good moment for sure.' Despite the life-changing procedure, O'Brien told no one. 'If . I had told everybody and they flew in, I would have felt like I had to . take care of them,' he said. 'I frankly just wanted some time on my own . to sort this whole thing out, try to get my head together on it, much to . the chagrin of my family and friends, that I didn't say anything. 'I . think for me, it was the way to do it.' Instead, he focused on work and completing a project for the anniversary of the earthquake in Japan, where he had been before the earthquake. He got himself to the airport and revealed his news when he returned home, as well as in a blog post on February 25. Adjusting: O'Brien recently figured out how to open a bottle of wine with one hand, pictured . Technology: He is using a mirror for his phantom limb pain. When he makes a movement with his missing arm, he copies the movement with his remaining arm in the mirror - and miraculously, the pain subsides . Treatment: He is pictured undergoing acupuncture treatment for the phantom limb pain . Now he is slowly coming to grips with every day tasks and recently celebrated opening a bottle of wine on his own. But he is also exploring ways to alleviate his phantom limb pain with the help of a 'mirror box'. 'You're tricking yourself into believing your arm is there,' he said. 'You use a mirror and you look at it and you try to move your phantom limb, which I feel very much. 'Match that movement with the limb that's left, and your brain starts thinking, ""Oh, the arm's there""â€™ and that alleviates some of that phantom pain. I don't think anybody really knows why.' He now hopes to ride his bike, fly a plane and shoot video - all activities he did before the injury. Doctors have told him that prosthetics will make all of these possible.

Use of the gallows hasn't taken place in Sri Lanka since 1976, even though there are currently 405 convicts on death row . Sri Lanka is searching for a new hangman after the latest recruit got upset on seeing the gallows for the first time and quit immediately. The Prisons Department appointed the new hangman, the third most qualified from 176 applicants, last week, months after two hangmen chosen late last year failed to show up for work. Chandrarathna Pallegama, commissioner general of prisons said: 'We gave him one week's training, but he resigned after seeing the gallows. 'He said that he didn't want the job. 'He told me that after seeing the gallows he got upset. 'Next time, we will show the gallows to the new recruits before giving them basic training.' According to reports, he wouldn't have been likely to hang anyone anyway as the job is mostly light administrative work only. The Indian Ocean island nation is a predominantly Buddhist country, and has not carried out an execution since 1976. Despite this, there are at least 405 convicts who have been sentenced to the death penalty. However, there has been an alarming rise . in child abuse, rapes, murders, and drug trafficking in the country . since the 25 year war against the Tamil Tiger separatists. Since . the war ended in 2009, lawyers and politicians have pushed for the . death penalty to be reintroduced following the dramatic rise in violent . crimes. The history of the death penalty in Sri Lanka starts with the British restricted the death penalty after they took control of the island in 1815. It was limited to murder, and 'waging war against the King'. But after independence, the then Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike abolished capital punishment in 1956. But it was very quickly reintroduced after his assassination in 1959. President Chandrika Kumaratunga has made several attempts to reintroduce the death penalty. In March 1999, after spurts of violence near the end of her first term in office, she stated that the government would be reintroducing the death penalty but was forced to back down because of public protest. But on November 19, 2004, a judge, Sarath Ambepitiya, was gunned down as he arrived home from work. This caused President Kumaratunga to reinstate capital punishment immediately. Sri Lanka is a nation mostly based around the Buddhist religion, which is one of peace. But despite this, there has been a rise in violent crime causing many politicians and lawyers to call for a renewed use of the death penalty . While there are less countries that use the death penalty than there are that don't, Sri Lanka is by no means the only country to have legal capital punishment. Of the 195 independent states that are UN members, 51 per cent have abolished the death penalty. Meanwhile, 4 per cent retain it for crimes committed in exceptional circumstances, such as war. 25 per cent  permit its use for ordinary crimes, but have not used it for at least 10 years and are believed to have a policy or established practice of not carrying out executions (such as Sri Lanka), and 20 per cent maintain the death penalty in both law and practice.","Indian Ocean nation's latest hangman quit almost immediately .

Former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow is taking a job as a TV analyst, leading to strong speculation that his playing days are over, but he's not giving up on an unlikely return to the field just yet. ESPN announced on Monday that Tebow, 26, has been hired as a college football analyst for their new SEC Network in a return to his Florida glory days, where he won The Heisman Trophy in 2007. Tebow will appear on SEC Nation, a pregame show that will travel to a different campus each week after the channel launches in August, but he'll start his new duties as soon as January 6. Scroll down for video . Behind the mike: Former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow talks to reporters during his short spell at the New England Patriots. He is now taking a job as a TV analyst with ESPN . The former Denver Broncos and New York Jets star will take up the mike at the BCS Championship game in the first week of 2014. His multiyear deal 'will not preclude him from continuing to pursue playing opportunities in the NFL,' ESPN said in a statement on Monday. Tebow did not play in the league in 2013 after he was cut by the Patriots in August. In just over one season, he went from a national sensation who led the Broncos to the playoffs, to a backup, to out of the NFL. 'While I continue to pursue my dream of playing quarterback in the NFL, this is an amazing opportunity to be part of the unparalleled passion of college football and the SEC,' Tebow said in a statement. Rise and fall: In just over one season, Tebow went from a national sensation who led the Denver Broncos to the playoffs, to a backup, to out of the NFL. He was cut by the Patriots (who he is pictured throwing for in a pre-season game) in August . Yet many experts were skeptical that the former star could make a successful return to NFL. Former NFL cornerback turned ESPN analyst Eric Allen said that working at the network and continuing a pro career would be 'very difficult.' 'You can't do both,' the ex-Philadelphia Eagles, New Orleans Saints, and Oakland Raiders star added. ESPN senior vice president Justin Connolly called Tebow an 'SEC icon with a national fan base and broad appeal.' After winning the 2007 Heisman and two national championships for the Gators in the SEC, Tebow became one of the biggest stories in the NFL in his second season. He went 7-1 in his first eight starts in 2011 then threw an 80-yard touchdown pass on the first play of overtime to give the Broncos a 29-23 playoff win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. College days: ESPN cover the SEC in Hoover, Alabama. Tebow will appear on SEC Nation, a new pregame show in August, but he'll start his new duties as soon as January 6 . But he was still dogged by doubts about his passing ability, and Denver traded him that offseason to the New York Jets after acquiring Peyton Manning. He languished on the bench while coach Rex Ryan ignored fans' calls for Tebow to replace a struggling Mark Sanchez. Tebow threw just eight passes, ran only 32 times and was cut last April 29. For six weeks no team wanted him until the Patriots signed him to a low-risk, two-year contract with no guaranteed money.","Tim Tebow takes analyst job with ESPN, covering college football and will make screen debut on January 6 .

A group of passengers who were stranded aboard a Carnival cruise liner for five days last year as sewage ran along the hallways are suing for $5,000 a month for the rest of their lives. The lawsuit brought by 33 passengers of the ill-fated Carnival Triumph voyage says they suffered mental anguish following the February 2013 ordeal and require the sum to cover medical bills. Many claimed they suffer from PTSD, anxiety and depression, while others have physical ailments from the ordeal, including leg pain, diarrhea, respiratory problems and aggravated hemorrhoids. The suit filed in Miami is the first to go to trial after the liner, which launched from Galveston, Texas, broke down in the Gulf of Mexico following an engine fire last year. Trouble . at sea: The Carnival Triumph, pictured in February 2013, became . stranded in the Gulf of Mexico after an engine fire. Now 33 passengers . are hoping to get $5,000 a month for injuries they suffered . The Triumph was left without engine power, air conditioning or working toilets. Passengers described scenes of human waste seeping . into hallways, sleeping under makeshift tarps and no cooked food. A federal judge in South Florida . last week finished hearing three weeks of testimony from passengers and . is expected to issue a judgment in the next two months. The . lawsuit is the first from the Triumph incident to go . to trial, with others in preparation, according maritime lawyers. Battle: Debra Oubre, one of the plaintiffs, said she has since experienced panic and anxiety attacks . Most of the passengers are seeking $5,000 in damages a year for the rest of their lives, claiming they will need medical monitoring because of the incident. They have said they want the money in lump sums based on government predictions estimating their life expectancies. One . plaintiff, Debra Oubre, 59, from Friendswood, Texas, said she suffered a . urinary tract infection due to the cruise and has since experienced . panic and anxiety attacks. 'It was chaotic,' she told Reuters. 'People were in dire need of help. We were standing in line for food for five hours.' But . in a statement Carnival Corp said that while it knows it was an . uncomfortable experience, families returned safely and were given a full . refund, a free future cruise and an additional $500 per person. 'This . is an opportunistic lawsuit brought by plaintiff's counsel and . plaintiffs who seek to make a money grab,' a company spokeswoman said. Carnival . attorneys have asked Senior U.S. District Judge Donald Graham, who is . hearing the case without a jury, to reject all of . the damage claims, saying passengers haven't proved their health issues . are linked to the cruise. Others have failed to show any health . problems at all, they say. Plea: The passengers in the lawsuit claim they were left with mental anguish and physical ailments . Passengers aboard the stricken cruise liner detailed the horrifying conditions. Debra Rightmire, passenger: 'Toilets are overflowing in the cabins, we are having to sleep in the hallways. Onion and cucumber sandwiches last night. Cabin carpets are wet with urine.' Gary Keyes, whose wife was on board: 'No power, no water, having to use the bathroom in bags.' Brent Nutt, whose wife was on board: 'People are fighting over food and stuff - that's a bunch of savages.' Blogger Clinty76 reporting on his wife's experience: 'We have no power AT ALL, which means we can't use the toilets, wash our hands, or take a shower' Donna Gutzman, passenger: 'There's no lights, no water, we can't flush.' Graham . has already ruled that the engine fire is negligence on the part of . Carnival, a significant blow for the cruise line, according to Robert . Peltz, a Miami maritime lawyer. 'It . would seem rather obvious that ships shouldn't just catch fire and then . have fire suppression systems that don't work,' Peltz said. Carnival has since started a fleet-wide 'enhancement', including a major . re-wiring of its engine rooms and improvements to fire safety and . emergency power features, Reuters reported. The cruise line also said it would . repay the U.S. government for the costs of responding to the stricken ship and another vessel, the Splendor. This latest case could change how cruise lines insulate themselves from legal actions, according to maritime legal experts. A . second pending lawsuit with even more plaintiffs has the potential to . further undo the advantageous legal position cruise lines have long . enjoyed. Cruise . lines have successfully inoculated themselves against . passenger lawsuits by printing stringent terms on tickets that . require passengers to waive their right to a class-action lawsuit. Relief: Passengers finally arrive in Mobile, Alabama last year after being stranded at sea for five days . The great escape: Passenger Kendall Jenkins kisses the ground after stepping off the cruise liner in Mobile, Alabama last year. Numerous lawsuits have been brought against Carnival in the aftermath of the ordeal . Graham's . ruling, which is expected to come in the next two months, could find . the terms of conditions printed on the tickets, so-called 'contracts of . adhesion,' to be overreaching. The contracts have rankled some . federal judges in southern Florida where several cruise lines are based, . according to maritime lawyer, David Neblett. The myriad . cruise cases for relatively meager sums clogs their calendars, he said. One . term of the ticket contract is that passengers can only bring their . cases to the Southern District of Florida and lawyers . complain that people coming from other states to litigate is too costly . for them.","The Carnival Triumph became stranded in the Gulf of Mexico last year after an engine fire and passengers reported disgusting conditions on board .

The 27-year-old, named on several lists of eligible single princesses, was led in handcuffs into Cupar Sheriff Court. She faces nine charges - including assault and acting in a racially aggravated manner. Leaving court: Her Serene Highness Theodora-Louise, Prinzessin zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (centre), is accused of attacking three people at an event near St Andrews, Fife, where she is at university . The princess - who denies all of the charges - is understood to have been attending a student Oktoberfest event on Saturday, which is aimed at promoting cultural understanding. She allegedly assaulted a man called Damon Creevy by kicking him and acted in a racially aggravated way towards a woman named Farah Hussain by making remarks about killing Muslims. The incidents are believed to have taken place at Kinkell Farm, and the princess is also said to have kicked a woman called Cara Anderson, struggled with her and attempted to head-butt her. At the event, which was raising money for Tayside Children with Cancer and Leukaemia, the princess is alleged to have made offensive and homophobic comments towards security staff.

Robin Cyr, 34, gave birth to her fourth child early Saturday morning in Halifax, Nova Scotia but was soon after told the baby girl hadn't survived after being wedged in the birth canal during delivery. For 25 minutes, Cyr waited for a sign of life but began to give up hope.

A new storm brought more snow to areas of Montana where hundreds of people have been left cut off by swollen rivers and impassable waterlogged roads. Authorities warned that the new precipitation Monday night and Tuesday could make the flooding worse. The snow was expected to move Tuesday into neighboring Wyoming where members of the National Guard were helping to protect two towns threatened by high water. Bad state: Floods that washed out rural roads in central Montana left hundreds of people stranded on Monday and forced the evacuation of 30 homes in one small town, as forecasts predicted more rain and snow that could worsen conditions in the region . A real mess: In Montana, a network of dirt roads linking rural Montana neighborhoods and ranches outside of Roundup were submerged in water or washed out by Monday, making them impassable . Evacuation: Some 30 houses in Roundup, a town of 2,000 residents about 50 miles north of Billings, were evacuated and dozens of people were warned to prepare for evacuating at a moment's notice as rapid melting of mountain snows and ice jams force the swollen Musselshell River to overflow its banks . The National Weather Service said 1 to 6 inches of snow could fall in the flooded areas of Montana and Wyoming before Tuesday night. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock declared a flood emergency late Monday after forecasters put 30 of the state's 56 counties under some type of high water warning. Musselshell County in central Montana appeared to be hardest hit: Dirt roads in rural areas turned to mud, some bridges were blocked by high water and the Musselshell River threatened to overcome protective dikes in Roundup. Warm weather over the past week unleashed massive amounts of water from record snowfalls that have blanketed the region. That pushed many streams and rivers over their banks, authorities said. Inundated: Residents in Livingston, Montana began sandbagging their properties on Thursday after melting snow flooded creeks and ditches and sent water running down city streets . Dangerous: A state of emergency has been declared in the city of Livingston, Montana, making some roads impossible to pass through . Impassable roads cut off about 350 people south and east of Roundup, Musselshell County disaster coordinator Jeff Gates said. Officials advised residents to stay in place if possible, and were crafting plans to ensure sufficient food and medical supplies were available to any stranded residents. Hundreds more in the Dean Creek subdivision southwest of Roundup also were cut off for a time until the situation improved Monday evening. But officials advised residents to remain ready to leave if necessary. Temperatures were forecast to drop below freezing overnight as the rain turns to snow. ""If it freezes and we get snow the roads will freeze and it will help us,"" Gates said. Crisis management: Emergency workers are trying to remove sediment from the Livingston Ditch as flooding water flows in . Flooded: Recent heavy snowfall and warm temperatures in Montana have caused rapid snow melt and flooding . In Wyoming, Guard members stacked up sand bags in Manderson and Greybull. The National Weather Service says sandbags were used to divert water around the Manderson school and water treatment plant. No evacuations were reported. Seven homes were damaged in Greybull over the weekend but the extent of damage wasn't immediately clear, said Wyoming Office of Homeland Security spokeswoman Kelly Ruiz. Video posted by the homeland security office showed the river full of ice chunks on Sunday and a home protected by sand bags surrounded by water. Mountain snowpack across both states already is well above average, setting the stage for more high water when the spring runoff arrives. That's expected in May or early June, said National Weather Service forecaster Chauncy Schultz. Officials were keeping a wary eye on ice-jams along the Musselshell River west of Roundup, which has about 1,900 people. Ice jams also were reported on the Yellowstone, Big Horn and other rivers in Montana and Wyoming. Economic cost: In the town of Manhattan (pictured), Mayor Dave Rowell said flooding in the downtown area late last week caused at least a million dollars in damages . Not over yet: Conditions could worsen in coming days as a pair of Pacific storm fronts are expected to bring more rain and snow to central Montana and elsewhere in the Northern Rockies . If the ice jams break free, water levels downstream could rise and more people in low-lying areas evacuated on short notice, Gates said. A makeshift dike in Roundup built after flooding three years ago was successfully holding back the water. By late Monday, the Musselshell had risen to levels not seen since severe flooding damaged hundreds of homes in 2011. More than two dozen houses near the Musselshell River were evacuated. Schools in Roundup were canceled for Tuesday in anticipation that many teachers and students would not be able to make it. Bullock's emergency declaration allows the Democrat to mobilize state resources â€” including the National Guard if necessary â€” to help local authorities. ""We're quite concerned about the moisture that's going to drop in the Little Belt Mountains and the Snowy Mountains. That could add more issues along the Musselshell River and in Roundup,"" said Steve Knecht, chief of operations for Montana Disaster and Emergency Services. Repeat weather: It is the second time in three years that Roundup has faced severe flooding. Hundreds of residents were displaced and dozens of homes in Roundup were destroyed in 2011 during historic flooding in the Missouri River basin . In Yellowstone County, high waters that flooded the basements of many homes were starting to dissipate, said county emergency services director Duane Winslow. Five homes south of Laurel remained evacuated. A boil water order was in effect in Clyde Park north of Livingston, the Billings Gazette reported. In the town of Manhattan, about 19 miles northwest of Bozeman, Mayor Dave Rowell said flooding in the downtown area late last week caused at least a million dollars in damages, television station KTVM reported.","Floods washed out rural roads in central Montana leaving hundreds of people stranded .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 12:44 EST, 11 March 2014 . Jail time: A judge has denied a new trial for Missouri's Alyssa Bustamante (pictured) A judge has denied a new trial for a young Missouri woman who pleaded guilty to murder for the slaying of a nine-year-old neighbor girl but later sought a do-over because of a U.S. Supreme Court case invalidating mandatory life sentences for juveniles. Alyssa Bustamante was 15-years-old in 2009 when she killed Elizabeth Olten and buried her in a wooded area west of Jefferson City. Bustamante wrote in her diary that it was an 'ahmazing' and 'pretty enjoyable' experience. She originally was charged with first-degree murder, which would have carried a mandatory life sentence without parole. But shortly before her 2012 trial, Bustamante pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and armed criminal action. She was sentenced on the murder charge to life in prison with the chance of parole, plus 30 years for the other charge. Several months after Bustamante pleaded guilty, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a separate case that juveniles cannot face automatic life sentences without the possibility of parole. Bustamante then got a new attorney, who claimed her original public defenders were ineffective. At a court hearing in January, the now 20-year-old Bustamante testified that she wouldn't have accepted the plea deal had she known about the possibility for the nation's high court to wipe out mandatory life sentences for juveniles convicted of murder. But Charles Moreland, one of her original attorneys, testified that they had talked to her about the issues pending before the Supreme Court. He said Bustamante 'stood a very strong risk of being found guilty' by jurors of first-degree murder had she not pleaded guilty to the lesser charge. Cole County Circuit Judge Pat Joyce wrote in a decision dated Thursday, but released today, that Bustamante's request to set aside her guilty plea and sentence was 'meritless' and her original attorneys weren't deficient. Scroll down for video . Horrific: Alyssa Bustamante was 15 (left) when she strangled, stabbed and buried her nine-year-old . neighbor Elizabeth Olten (right) because she wanted to know what it felt . like to kill . Joyce, who also presided over Bustamante's original case, wrote that the evidence against her 'was both strong and aggravating'. The judge found that Bustamante would have pleaded guilty to second-degree murder 'regardless of the advice of her attorneys, and her testimony otherwise is not credible'. An attorney for Bustamante did not immediately return a telephone message Monday. Cole County Prosecutor Mark Richardson said Monday that Bustamante had committed 'an adult-like crime' and received 'an adult-like punishment', which he said was appropriate. 'Just because that sentencing hearing went badly for her in terms of more years than maybe she expected, that's not a reason for a judge to allow a defendant to withdraw their plea,' Richardson said. Morbid fascination: Bustamante had attempted . suicide and cut herself before the murder . Under Missouri guidelines, Bustamante must serve at least 35 years and five months before being eligible for parole. Evidence . presented during Bustamante's 2012 sentencing hearing revealed she had . dug a shallow grave in the woods several days before the slaying and . used her younger sister to lure Elizabeth with an invitation to play. Bustamante said she had a surprise for Elizabeth in the forest but instead strangled her, sliced her throat and stabbed her. After . hundreds of volunteers searched for two days, Bustamante led . authorities to Elizabeth's buried body about a half-mile from . Bustamante's house. Prior . to receiving her life sentence in February 2012, Bustamante said to the family of her . victim: 'If I could give my life to bring her back, I would. I just want . to say I'm sorry for what happened. I'm so sorry.' The . teenager's defense attorneys had argued for a sentence less than life . in prison, saying Bustamante's use of the antidepressant Prozac had made . her more prone to violence. They said she had suffered from depression for years and once attempted suicide by overdosing on painkillers. But prosecutors sought a longer sentence, describing the teen as a thrill killer who lacked remorse. They . noted that Bustamante had dug two graves several days in advance, and . that on the evening of the killing had sent her younger sister to lure . Elizabeth outside with an invitation to play. Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt . David Rice testified that the teenager told him 'she wanted to know what . it felt like' to kill someone. Over the course of the two-day hearing, the court heard the girl's family's history with drug abuse, mental disorders and . suicide attempts, noting her father was in prison and her mother had . abandoned her. Various mental . health professionals testified . that Bustamante suffers from major depression and displays the features . of a borderline personality disorder. Some also said she showed early signs of a bipolar disorder. Bustamante . began taking the antidepressant drug Prozac after a suicide attempt on . Labor Day 2007 at the start of her eighth grade year. Her . dosage of the medication had been increased just two weeks before she . murdered Elizabeth. Bustamante's attorneys presented evidence from a . psychiatrist who testified that Prozac could have been a 'major . contributing factor' in the slaying â€” a theory rejected by a prosecution . psychiatrist who insisted there was no scientific evidence of Prozac . causing homicides, or even increasing aggression. Life behind bars: Alyssa Bustamante was sentenced to 35 years jail in 2012 . At the time of the killing, Bustamante suggested to FBI and the Missouri State Highway Patrol officials that the girl had probably been kidnapped and that whoever had done so deserved to be convicted. At one point, law enforcement officers discovered a hole in the ground in the shape of a shallow grave near Bustamante's home. They testified that Bustamante acknowledged digging it but said she just liked to dig holes. It was only later that Elizabeth's body was found concealed under leaves in another grave in the woods behind the Bustamante home. Lies: Bustamante suggested to police at the time of the the killing her victim may have been kidnapped . At one point Bustamante had written that she intended to burn down a house and kill all the occupants, but she never followed through with that. On October 14, one week before Elizabeth's slaying, Bustamante had written that she was unable to use her cell phone because the charger had died, which meant she couldn't talk to anyone about the depression and rage she was feeling. 'If I don't talk about it, I bottle it up, and when I explode someone's going to die,' she wrote in a journal that was read to the court by her defense attorney, Charlie Moreland. Prosecutors said Bustamante plotted Elizabeth's death, even digging two holes to be used as graves, then attended school for about a week while waiting for the right time to kill. Hundreds of volunteers searched for two days for Elizabeth before her body was found. On a now-defunct YouTube page in her name, one of Bustamante's hobbies were listed as 'killing people'. A few weeks before the murder she tweeted: 'This is all I want in life; a reason for all this pain.'","Alyssa Bustamante was 15 when she killed neighbor Elizabeth Olten, nine, and buried her in the Missouri woods in 2009 .

Two former state correctional officers are going to federal prison for conspiring in the severe beating of an inmate at Roxbury Correctional Institution near Hagerstown in Maryland in 2008. Forty-one-year-old Lanny Harris and 42-year-old Philip Mayo were both sentenced Monday in Baltimore to two-and-a-half years. They are the first among 15 federally convicted officers to be sentenced in the case. Black and blue: Inmate Kenneth Davis was severely beaten by guards at a Maryland correctional facility . Both pleaded guilty after they were charged in Febrary 2013. Harris, a former sergeant, approved a plan for other officers to assault prisoner Kenneth Davis as punishment for punching a guard. He then helped organize a cover-up of the incident, including erasing incriminating surveillance video. Mayo held Davis down while others kicked and punched him. He shielded Davis' face, at least partly to prevent obvious injuries. Davis suffered a broken nose, back and ribs from being beaten by officers on three successive shifts. U.S. District Judge James K Bredar was livid as he sentenced the pair. 'How in God's name did this culture evolve to the point where officers on three different shifts, including supervisors, came to the conclusion ... that the appropriate solution was raw, crude violence?' Bredar asked from the bench. 'Where was the leadership of this institution and of this state department?' he said. Roxbury Correctional Institution: 22 guards were fired or forced into early retirement after the incident . Mark Vernarelli, a spokesman for the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, said the department took swift action within days of the attack, resulting in 22 officers being fired or taking early retirement. Federal prosecutors said in a filing that Davis received about $100,000 to settle an administrative complaint against the state stemming from the assault. Attorney Michael McGowan, who represented Davis in those proceedings, said Monday that he doubted Davis would consider the guards' sentences appropriate punishment. 'If you were severely beaten multiple times over an extended period of time by the people who were responsible for your safety, and then they lied about it, would you think that that was enough time?' McGowan asked in an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press. Four other former officers are scheduled for sentencing this week. Other sentencing hearings are scheduled through July. Two other officers pleaded guilty to state charges and were sentenced to probation in 2010 after defying what one called a 'brotherhood of silence' to testify against co-workers. Of seven others charged in state court, five were acquitted by juries, one had charges dropped before trial and one had charges dropped after his trial ended in a hung jury.","Lanny Harris, 41, and Philip Mayo, 42, were sentenced to two-and-a-half years prison .

Generous: Madison Holleran's former teacher Edward Modica (pictured) has started a petition urging universities to implement proactive anti-suicide strategies . A former teacher of a popular University of Pennsylvania track star who committed suicide in January has started an online petition urging universities to become more proactive before and after such tragedies. Edward Modica, 64, was Madison Holleran's fifth-grade teacher at Brookside School in Allendale, New Jersey. He said there has been a 'void' in his heart since the 19-year-old jumped to her death from a parking garage on Spruce Street, Philadelphia on January 17 because she couldn't deal with the pressures of college life. The New Jersey teen left a suicide note and gifts for her family before she plunged to her death. The tragic loss prompted Modica to post the 'Passage of The Madison Holleran Law' petition on MoveOn.org. He wants New Jersey colleges to accurately list the numbers of suicides and attempted suicides on their campuses annually and new laws requiring that they provide certified suicide prevention personnel counselors to help potential victims. 'It seems, unfortunately, that suicides have become a regular occurrence on campuses,' the retired teacher told the Daily News. 'This would allow parents to know what's going on and the parents could delve into those issues before school begins.' More than 3,380 people have signed the petition.

Final moments: The 19-year-old freshman posted this image of Rittenhouse Square to Instagram an hour before her death . The freshman's shocking death rocked the UPenn community and sent shock waves through her hometown of Allendale, New Jersey. Her . father, James Holleran, told the New York Post that she killed herself because she was . overwhelmed with schoolwork at UPenn - changing her from the happy . student she had been throughout high school. Although he and his wife Stacy had encouraged their daughter to stay home or transfer at Christmas, the determined teen insisted on going back to school. 'There . was a lot more pressure in the classroom at Penn,' Mr Holleran tearfully told . the Post. 'She wasn't normal happy Madison. Now she had worries and . stress.' Mr Holleran said that she had told her parents in December that she was feeling suicidal and was seeing a therapist. 'We . knew she needed help,' he said. 'She knew she needed help. She had lost . confidence in academics and she also lost confidence in her track . abilities.' On the day that . she jumped to her death, her father texted her encouraging . her to see a therapist for some anti-depressants, and she said she . would. But just hours later, . she took her life. She left her parents a note and gifts for her family . on top of the parking garage before she jumped. Her family would not . detail the contents of the note. Just an hour before she jumped to her death, the young woman posted an image of a sunset over Rittenhouse Square to her Instagram . account. Distraught: Madison, who was one of five children, poses at a Penn meet with her mother Stacy . Beautiful: Hundreds of friends have shared their condolences on Madison's social networking pages . Mr Holleran said that he did not blame the school for his daughter's suicide but that he wanted to warn other parents. Holleran . was a member of UPenn's varsity track and field team. Her teammates were given the option of whether or not they wished to . compete in the upcoming meet. 'The . entire Penn community is deeply saddened by the death of Madison . Holleran,' Penn president Amy Gutmann said in the statement. Family friend Bob Weckworth said the high-achiever ultimately couldn't cope with the expectations she'd set herself. 'People talked to her within hours of her act of suicide and there were no red flags, warning signs, nothing,' he told the Daily News. 'This kid didnâ€™t have a boyfriend. There were no drug issues. There were no mental health issues in her background. It was just the last two, three weeks where they saw a change in her. Something snapped. 'She got a 3.5 her first semester, and I think just the high expectations that she put on herself was that thatâ€™s just not acceptable.'

During the mass, Mr Holleran said that his daughter used to rally her team by saying: 'Now is a time to be strong.' He added: 'Today, we all have to be strong for Madison.' He then urged the congregation to learn from the loss of an 'iconic' young woman: 'Please seek therapy if you need it. This is not a weakness, but a struggle.'

A southeast Missouri man was sentenced Monday to life in prison without parole for abducting and killing his 3-year-old neighbor girl in 2011. Shawn Morgan, of Senath, was handed his sentenced after pleading guilty to first-degree murder, armed criminal action and child kidnapping. He had previously been scheduled to go to trial in August. Breeann Rodriguez went missing August 6, 2011, while riding a small pink bicycle with training wheels near her home. Her disappearance set off a frantic . search. Residents of Senath, a town of 1,600 residents near the Arkansas . border, joined the FBI, Missouri State Highway Patrol and local police . in the search. Her body was found on the banks of a drainage ditch 10 days later, about eight miles outside of the small community. Morgan . was arrested three days before the body was found.

A Florida man who confessed to shooting dead a neighbor's dog for straying onto his property and then threw the animal into a dumpster has been charged with animal cruelty. The Pasco County Sheriff Office says that 55-year-old Hugh Matthew Schnacky aimed his .22-caliber rifle at a two-year-old black Labrador named Hunter last month and shot him for crossing his property line in Hudson. A police report states Schnacky was behind his front gate when he shot the dog, who was 145 feet away. Schnacky was arrested on Sunday and charged with one count of animal cruelty. He was released on $5,000 bond several hours after his arrest. This is his first arrest in Florida. Hunter, a two-year old black Labrador, allegedly shot by a neighbor for crossing into his property . The Patsches family is dealing with the loss of their beloved pet, who they describe as gentle. No one was at home when Hunter was shot and the family found out about his death from neighbors. 'I would pet him and he would lick me,' 12-year-old Samuel Patsches told FOX13 Tampa Bay. '(I'm) sad and mad. I cry about it sometimes.' After arriving home and finding Hunter missing, Randall Patsches and his son went out looking for the dog. As they were driving by a nearby street, a woman stopped them and told them what had happened. Randall Patsches then went to confront Schnacky about the shooting, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Schnacky told Patsches he shot the dog since it went on his property. When Patsches pressed about where the body was, Schnacky told him he loaded it in a pickup truck and drove to a nearby dumpster where he deposited the carcass. 55-year-old Matthew Hugh Schnacky told authorities he shot the chocolate Lab named Hunter with a .22-caliber rifle for walking onto his property . Even worse, when Patsches and his son went to the dumpster to retrieve Hunter, they found it had been emptied. Since they have no body to bury, the Patsches family has not created any grave or memorial for Hunter. The Patsches have another dog, Bella, who would play with Hunter. 'Bella always kept him going, playing, bugging him,' Samuel Patsches told the Tampa Bay Times. He liked to stay . outside and lay and sit in the sun. And now he's in heaven.

The FBI has offered a $20,000 reward for information that helps them find a 2-year-old girl who disappeared 10 days ago and is believed to have been kidnapped. Myra Lewis vanished on March 1 after playing with her sister outside the family's Camden, Mississippi home. Her mother Ericka Lewis was arrested last week for a probation violation because police found that she was in possession of a firearm. Missing: Myra Lewis, 2, disappeared after playing with her sister outside the family home on Saturday March 1 . Mitigating factors: An Amber Alert was issued and police searched the surrounding area in case she wandered off but her family believes that she has been kidnapped . The arrest is reportedly being considered as unrelated to her daughter's disappearance, but Ericka's mother says that the arrest is serving as an unnecessary distraction. 'They should have waited because that even took their mind off Myra for a moment,' Myra's grandmother Martha Samders said. 'They can pressure Erica, but she'll never give in. She'll never give in because she didn't do anything.' The missing girl's father Gregory Lewis told local station WJTV that both he and his wife have taken polygraph tests as well as other members of their family. Not connected: Myra's mother Ericka Lewis has a previous felony conviction, the subject of which has not been revealed, but because police found guns in her home during the investigation, she was arrested for parole violation . Doing their part: Ericka's husband said that they have both taken polygraph tests in connection to Myra's disappearance and police confirmed that the relatives have been helpful and cooperative . Madison County sheriff Randy Tucker said that the relatives have been fully cooperative and have turned over their SUV for inspection as well as a number of undisclosed items from their home. 'At far as what was in the bags, obviously we'll start where the child was last seen and we have evidence response folks who are going to that location and recovering evidence and all of this is a collective effort to discover where little Myra is,' FBI Special Agent Dan McMullen told CBS. 'I'm not going to talk about anything specific with regard to the investigation.' Sheriff Tucker did tell WJTV that one of the reasons why the SUV is being checked out is in case the toddler was run over by the vehicle. Remaining hopeful: Police have told parents Gregory (left) and Ericka Lewis (right) that they believe their daughter is still alive even though temperatures have dropped down to below freezing at night . Myra disappeared between 10.30am and 11am on Saturday March 1 but the family did not report it to authorities until about 4pm because they said they did an initial search themselves. An Amber Alert was issued on Sunday March 2. 'Since her disappearance was reported, multiple state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies have participated in a massive, collaborative search effort,' the Jackson, Mississippi FBI office said in a statement. 'Significant resources have been dedicated to this investigation, including extensive ground and air searches, and utilization of specially trained search teams.' What happened? Myra, right, was playing with her sister, left, when she vanished but police have not said anything about what the sister did or didn't see . Local and federal authorities have searched 4-square-miles surrounding the family's home with the help of 300 officers and volunteers as well as search dogs. In spite of the fact that she has been missing for 10 days at this point, they still remain confident that she is alive, citing a kidnapping as the most likely scenario. 'We fully expect a positive outcome,' Sheriff Tucker said. 'We need to get Myra home, and again we want to stress to everyone we need your help, the family needs your help and we appreciate your calls.'","Myra Lewis vanished on March 1 after playing outside with her sister near their family's Camden, Mississippi home .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 20:35 EST, 10 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:38 EST, 11 March 2014 . Joe McGinniss, the adventurous and news-making author and reporter who skewered the marketing of Richard Nixon in ‘The Selling of the President 1968’ and tracked his personal journey from sympathizer to scourge of convicted killer Jeffrey MacDonald in the blockbuster ‘Fatal Vision,’ died Monday at age 71. McGinniss, who announced last year that he had been diagnosed with inoperable prostate cancer, died from complications related to his disease. His attorney and longtime friend Dennis Holahan said he died at a hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts. Few journalists of his time so intrepidly pursued a story, burned so many bridges or more memorably placed themselves in the narrative, whether insisting on the guilt of MacDonald after seemingly befriending him or moving next door to Sarah Palin's house for a most unauthorized biography of the former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential candidate. Passed on: Veteran writer and journalist Joe McGinnis, seen here at the home he rented next to Sarah Palin's in Wasilla, Alaska to write a book about her, is dead . Prolific: McGinnis covered everything from politics to sports and travel. He suffered from terminal prostate cancer . The tall, talkative McGinniss had early dreams of becoming a sports reporter and wrote books about soccer, horse racing and travel. But he was best known for two works that became touchstones in their respective genres — campaign books (‘The Selling of the President’) and true crime (‘Fatal Vision’). In both cases, he had become fascinated by the difference between public image and private reality. McGinniss was a columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1968 when an advertising man told him he was joining Hubert Humphrey's presidential campaign. Intrigued that candidates had advertising teams, McGinniss was inspired to write a book and tried to get access to Humphrey. The Democrat turned him down, but, according to McGinniss, Nixon aide Leonard Garment allowed him in, one of the last times the ever-suspicious Nixon would permit a journalist so much time around him. Garment and other Nixon aides were apparently unaware, or unconcerned, that McGinniss' heart was very much with the anti-war agitators the candidate so despised. The Republican's victory that fall capped a once-unthinkable comeback for the former vice president, who had declared six years earlier that he was through with politics. Having lost the 1960 election in part because of his pale, sweaty appearance during his first debate with John F. Kennedy and aware of his reputation as a partisan willing to play dirty, Nixon had restricted his public outings and presented himself as a new and more mature candidate. McGinniss was far from the only writer to notice Nixon's reinvention, but few offered such raw and unflattering details. ‘The Selling of the President’ was published in 1969, spent months on The New York Times' best-seller list and made McGinniss an eager media star. He quit the Inquirer and followed more personal interests. He wrote a novel, ‘The Dream Team,’ and the idiosyncratic ‘Heroes,’ a memoir that told of the breakup of his first marriage and romance with his eventual second wife, Nancy Doherty, and his failed quest for role models, among them author William Styron and Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy. In 1979, he was a columnist for the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner when an argument without end was born: McGinniss was approached by MacDonald, a fellow California resident, about a possible book on the 1970 killings for which the physician and former Green Beret was being charged. Diverse interests: McGinnis's Palin book The Rogue seen as a tawdry exercise in gossip mongering by some, but his willingness to go the extra mile by literally moving in next door to the former governor made him stand apart. Fatal Vision, on the other hand, was a massive success and famously follows McGinnis's befriending a Green Beret-turned-physician accused of slaying his wife and child in 1970 . In the early hours of Feb. 17, 1970, MacDonald's pregnant wife and two small children were stabbed and beaten to death at the family's home in Fort Bragg, N.C. The date, location and identities of the victims are virtually the only facts of the case not in dispute. MacDonald, who sustained a punctured lung and minor injuries, had insisted that the house was overrun by a gang of drug-crazed hippies that chanted slogans such as ‘Acid is groovy’ and spelled ‘PIG’ in blood on a bedroom wall, a murderous rampage seemingly inspired by the then-recent Charles Manson killings. But investigators suspected otherwise, believing that MacDonald killed his family and arranged the apartment to make it appear others had committed the crime. MacDonald was initially cleared of charges, then indicted, then finally brought to trial in 1979. He was found guilty and sentenced to three consecutive life terms. Groundbreaking: McGinnis gained renown when he skewered the marketing of Richard Nixon in The Selling of the President 1968. His work became the model for political journalism . ‘Fatal Vision,’ published in 1983, became one of the most widely read and contested true crime books in history. McGinniss wrote not just of the case but of his own conclusions. He had at first found MacDonald charming and sincere but came to believe he was a sociopath who'd committed the killings while in a frenzied state brought on by diet pills. McGinniss' findings weren't welcomed by MacDonald or by some fellow journalists. MacDonald sued in 1987, alleging McGinniss had tricked him by pretending to believe in his innocence, and he received an out-of-court settlement of $325,000. New Yorker writer Janet Malcolm cited McGinniss as a prime case of the reporter as a ‘kind of confidence man, preying on people's vanity, ignorance, or loneliness, gaining their trust and betraying them without remorse.’ McGinniss wrote in his defense: ‘The . attempt to manipulate through 'cons and lies' was — it seems clear to me . now in retrospect — something Jeffrey MacDonald engaged in with me. Appearance of the book was forceful proof he had not succeeded.’ McGinniss hoped to have the last word with the e-book ‘Final Vision.’ ‘Jeffrey . MacDonald was convicted of the murders of his wife and two young . daughters in 1979,’ McGinniss said in 2012. ‘In all the years since, . every court that has considered the case — including the United States . Supreme Court — has upheld that verdict in every respect. MacDonald is . guilty not simply beyond a reasonable doubt, but beyond any doubt. No . amount of speculation, conjecture and innuendo can change that.’ McGinniss, who had been working on a book about his illness, wrote openly about his personal and professional follies and setbacks, whether cheating on his first wife or helping himself to the gourmet crabmeat in Styron's kitchen. He struggled financially at times and battled depression and alcohol abuse. A 1993 biography of Sen. Kennedy, ‘The Last Brother,’ was widely ridiculed for including invented dialogue. None of his latter books approached the popularity of ‘Fatal Vision’ or such other crime works as ‘Cruel Doubt’ and ‘Blind Faith.’ He returned a $1 million advance to write a book on the O.J. Simpson murder trial, expressing disgust that the former football star had been acquitted. But by the 21st century he had cleaned himself up. He was an enthusiastic commentator on Facebook, posting regular updates about his health and current events. And he was back in the news, if not on the best-seller lists, with a biography of Palin, ‘The Rogue,’ which failed to sell many copies despite allegations of drug use and a premarital fling Palin had with basketball star Glen Rice. The real headlines were in the reporting: Anxious for a close look into Palin's world, McGinniss scored a front-row seat when he rented a house next door to her in Wasilla, Alaska.

A condo in Michigan has become so overrun with the junk and filth left by its hoarder owners that neighbors in adjoining units have had to pick and move thanks to vermin spilling over into their homes. The unit in the Wingate Condominium Complex has already been condemned by the Ypsilanti Township and one neighbor sick of the roaches, mice and fleas settling in her home has moved out. Another neighbor says she'll soon do the same as the condo association and even the town itself band together to sue the homeowner, who's been MIA for a month. Hoard: Trash, clothes and collectible cars are piled to the point of blocking walkways and windows in an Ypsilanti Township, Michigan condo . Filthy: Roaches crawl the walls in the condo (left) that was so filthy for so long that vermin began taking up residents in adjoining units, and forcing neighbors out . Piled up: A man lived in the home in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan along with his daughter and grandchild . 'I’m kind of in the same boat as (the . neighbor who moved),' Stacie Vinson told MLive. 'It’s a nuisance, a . headache, it’s embarrassing and there’s a stigma to it.' Photos from from several visits to the home over the course of years show the floors, countertops and virtually all surfaces covered in progressively more trash, food waste and household items. Roaches crawl up the walls and at least six chihuahuas roamed the filthy floors, adding their feces to the mess. Officials at the time showed up because a baby was living in the home in the unsanitary conditions. The area humane society also joined the fray because of the dogs. According to MLive.com, a subsequent court order barred the homeowners from keeping pets from there on. Unassuming: 'They¿re always really nice,' said future ex-neighbor Stacie Vinson. 'You never would know what was going on if you saw them' Litigation: The mess is so bad that the city and condo association have filed suit against the owners of the unit . Piles of filth: Nearly every surface in the home is covered in trash and forgotten items . Dangerous: Trash strewn about the house not only sent neighbors packing thanks to the vermin, but has officials concerned about the potential to start a massive house fire . In the latest inspection, a child was living in the home along with its mother and grandfather. Two dogs were found in the home. After the most recent inspection, a Washtenaw County judge gave the owners 10 days to rectify the situation. 'The infestation did affect the entire building,' said township building director Ron Fulton. 'The owners say they are going remove everything and scrub the bare walls and floors.' Fit for a baby? Officials visited the home in 2011 to address an infant living there in unsanitary conditions . At least six chihuahuas were found in the home during the February 2011 visit and a judge told the owners they could no longer keep pets . Feces was found all over the floors from the dogs . It's not known what became of the dogs that were taken from the home in 2011, but two dogs were found during last month's visit . The township and condo association have joined litigation against the homeowners, who've not been seen at the property since last month, despite the judge's order to get it clean. Meanwhile, the current neighbors just want things to be normal again and stayed positive, even when talking about the nuisance neighbors. 'I would love to stay. This has been the only issue,' Vinson said. And of the hoarder owners: 'They’re always really nice,' she said of the condo owners. 'You never would know what was going on if you saw them.'

It was once the hub of a filthy, bustling and intense trade in human cattle, which saw millions of men, women and children pass through its docks. The Valongo wharf in Rio de Janeiro was a slave market and centre for the industry in the early 1800s, when Brazil was a far greater buyer of slaves than anywhere in North America. But the dark hub of the slave trade in Rio, which was unearthed by archaeologists in the scramble to redevelop the city ahead of the 2016 Olympic Games, has once again become the centre of controversy. Uncovered: A construction worker walks on the 1840s Empress Wharf, which was built on top of the notorious Valongo . Uncovering: Work has continued in the area ahead of the 2016 summer Olympics, though . For while architects and developers in the city hurry through their construction projects, scholars of Brazilian history - and the descendants of the country's slave population - have begun a fight to properly acknowledge and memorialise the historic discovery, rather than covering it with buildings. The port area, once the home to 'fattening houses' where exhausted and diseased slaves would be groomed and sent on to plantations, is being rapidly reshaped into a development which will be known as the Porto Maravilha - which translate as 'marvellous port'. It will be many visitors' first sight of Rio as they approach the city in 2016. But the area is currently occupied, and also prominent Brazilian historians have complained that efforts to commemorate the area's past are far too little. A local campaign is applying pressure to have the area recognised as a world heritage site by Unesco. Construction: The area is being cleared out so that skyscrapers and gated villas can be built . Works: Locals and campaigners have said that the work is happening too quickly and more needs to be done to recognise the area's history . Finds: Archaeologists discovered the area in 2011 and uncovered hundreds of items related to the slave trade . Critics have said the efforts which are being made, such as the $100million Museum of Tomorrow, dedicated to science and technology, are a step in the opposite direction, along with the skyscrapers and gated villas earmarked for construction. Sonia Rabello, a legal academic who once sat on the city's council, complained that the potential for properly recognising the space was being ignored in favour of speedy development. Speaking to the New York Times, she said: 'We’re finding archaeological sites of . global importance, and probably far more extensive than what’s been . excavated so far, but instead of prioritizing these discoveries our . leaders are proceeding with their grotesque remaking of Rio.' Cláudio Lima Carlos, an architect, told the newspaper: 'Archaeologists are exposing the . foundations of our unequal society while we are witnessing a perverse . attempt to remake the city into something resembling Miami or Dubai. Found: This bronze token is a religious object which would have belonged to slaves or their descendants . 'We’re losing an opportunity to focus in detail on our past, and maybe even learn from it.' The Valongo wharf was in operation from 1818 to 1830, when it was later replaced with a more ornate version in honour of a Portuguese empress. The slave trade continued for decades after in Brazil, and was only abolished in 1888, more than 80 years after it was abolished in the British Empire. Even while the trade was in full flow, visitors from England were horrified, with clergyman Robert Walsh writing at the time: 'They are handled by the purchaser in different parts, exactly as I have seen butchers feeling a calf,' he said. 'I sometimes saw groups of well-dressed females here, shopping for slaves, exactly as I have seen English ladies amusing themselves at our bazaars.'

New Zealanders are to vote on whether to change their national flag, with many including the country's prime minister wanting to see it replaced with the silver fern symbol used by the All Blacks rugby team. Prime Minister John Key today announced plans to hold a referendum within three years, receiving the backing of his political opponents who said they would follow through with plans even if they oust Key in this year's national elections. The current flag depicts the Southern Cross star constellation and includes Britain's Union Jack in the top left corner. The current New Zealand flag, left, and the silver fern symbol of the New Zealand All Blacks rugby team, right . Many complain it is too similar to Australia's flag and doesn't reflect New Zealand's independence from former colonial ruler Britain. But . many who have served in the military oppose a change. And among those . advocating a change, there's plenty of debate about a replacement. Key said he favours a silver fern set against a black background, an image that's popular among sports teams. Some . say that would equate the country too much with its sporting heroes and . would be too reminiscent of a pirate ensign. Some argue the country's . indigenous Maori should be represented in any new flag. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said he favours a switch to the silver fern . In a speech on Tuesday, Key said the flag represents a past era. 'The . flag remains dominated by the Union Jack in a way that we ourselves are . no longer dominated by the United Kingdom,' he said. He . said Canada's 1965 decision to embrace a distinctive maple leaf design . was a good example, and he couldn't imagine Canadians now wanting to go . back to their old Union Jack flag. 'We . should be represented by a flag that is distinctly New Zealand's,' said . Key, adding it would not signify an end to the South Pacific nation's . constitutional ties to the British monarchy or participation in the . Commonwealth group of countries. Don . McIver, president of the Returned and Services Association (RSA), said . he's proud of a flag that represents more than 100 years of tradition. 'The . view of the RSA is there is no need to change the flag,' he . said.'Thirty-two thousand New Zealanders have given their lives under . the flag and many more thousands have served under it in a combat . environment.' The . Republican Movement of New Zealand, which advocates an end to . recognizing the British monarch as New Zealand's head of state, remains . indifferent. 'We . realize there is momentum to change the flag, and we are not against . it,' said the movement's chairman, who goes by the single name Savage. 'But the substance is changing the head of state. It's symbolic only to change the flag.' Yet for many, a new flag would represent another small step by New Zealand toward disentangling itself from its British past. The silver fern is the proud symbol of the all conquering New Zealand All Blacks rugby team . In 2004, for instance, the country established a Supreme Court to replace Britain's Privy Council as the final court of appeal. Recent opinion polls have yielded conflicting indications about whether a majority favor a change. Victor . Gizzi, the national sales manager at flag manufacturer Flagmakers, said . 'older people tend to want the status quo,' while younger people feel . differently. Earlier this year Mr Key said  he would personally like to see a new flag using a symbol drawn from New Zealand's native flora.

An engine casing that exploded on a Delta flight to the Dominican Republic forced the passenger jet to return to Minneapolis airport on Monday. Dramatic pictures taken by a passenger show the casing ripped back to reveal the inner workings of one of the engines of the Boeing 737. After noticing vibrations from the engine about an hour into the flight, the crew made an emergency return to Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport. Shocking: A passenger took this picture of the snapped back casing, which exposed the engine of the Delta plane . The Boeing had been carrying 149 passengers on a 7.10am flight to Punta Cana in Dominican Republic when it was forced to turn back. An emergency was declared to give the plane priority for landing when it reached the airport, though it had to circle for 25 minutes to get rid of excess fuel for safety reasons. The crew were able to land safely, and the aircraft is currently being examined by technicians. It is not clear what caused the casing, which is part of the engine cowling, to burst open, but aircraft experts said it is possible to continue to fly without it. A Delta Air Lines spokesman said the crew had been following standard procedure when they made the decision to return after noticing the vibrations. 'These fellows did the right thing by . immediately landing even though they knew there was no major danger,' Ross Aimer, chief executive of Aero . Consulting Experts, told Fox 9 News. He added: 'At that speed, sometimes that cowling - if it's not latched properly - would come apart.' After their frightening ordeal and a three-hour delay, passengers were able to board a different plane to continue their journey. The casings are not vital to aircraft security, but it is unusual for them to break free during a flight. A report by the National Transportation Safety Board in 2008 recorded 41 cases between 1992 and 2008. The board suggested that checks to ensure the cowlings are attached properly may not be adequate enough.","Engine trouble forced plane to make emergency landing .

The state pension age should rise to 70 by 2040, Britain's pension tsar said last night (library image) The state pension age should rise to 70 by 2040 – more than 20 years earlier than scheduled under government changes, the country’s pension tsar said last night. At present, a woman can claim her State pension at the age of 62 while men receive theirs from the age of 65. Ministers have already outlined plans to first align and then increase the ages at which men and women become eligible for the pension - but Lord Turner said the current timetable should be speeded up even more dramatically. Under the current plan, the State pension age for women will match men at 65 by 2018, and then both men and women will rise to 66 by 2020, 67 by 2028, 68 by the ‘mid-2030s’ and 69 by the ‘late-2040s’. As the State pension age is increased with life expectancy in the future, experts say the Government’s rules indicate it will reach 70 by around 2063. Speaking in London last night, former UK Pensions Commission chairman Lord Adair Turner said: ‘I think 70 by 2040 would be a good thing to aim for.’ Lord Turner, who was hired by the Labour government to solve the country’s pensions crisis, also said there is a case for workers to be forced to save into a pension. Under the current rules, all bosses must pay into a pension for their workers - but workers can ‘opt out’ of the scheme, deciding for whatever reason that they do not want to save. At the event, organised by the think-tank, Policy Exchange [must keep], the ex-chairman of the Financial Services Authority said: ‘There is a case for compulsion.’ Lord Turner urged people to accept that working later in life is often a good, not a bad, thing. He said: ‘For most people, leaving the workforce too early in life is a bad idea. People need the social interaction of work.’ He added that he believes ‘60 is the new 40.’ On the prospect of forcing people to save into a pension, he said it was simply not possible to do unless rip-off pension charges are scrapped.While describing himself as ‘open-minded’ about compulsion, he added: ‘We cannot compel people to save and then start taking money off them. State pension age is increased with life expectancy and experts say the government's rules indicate it will reach 70 by around 2063 (library image) ‘I don’t think it is OK to compel people to save and then there being any danger of them paying one per cent fees. You’ve got to get it lower than that.’ The increasing State pension age represents one of the most dramatic social changes in Britain, with millions of people set to work longer than their parents or grandparents. For many women, they saw their mother stop work and start claiming her State pension at 60 while they will have to wait a decade longer. David Robbins, a senior consultant at the pension advisers Towers Watson, said: ‘Making people wait an extra two years to claim saves about £15,000 per person, as well as generating more tax revenue if they work longer in response. ‘Whether that’s better or worse than cutting the weekly amount [of State pension] depends on how long you live for.’ Last night, a Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ‘We are making the State pension more sustainable for the future. ‘This government had already outlined increases to 68 and have built a mechanism for future reviews which will take account of life expectancy and other factors.’","Presently, women can claim pension aged 62 and men at 65 .

At least one in every 20 prisoners is from the gipsy, Romany or traveller communities, a report reveals. With 4,276 prisoners in England and Wales being from these groups, they total 5 per cent of the jail population. It means there are as many gipsies, Romany and travellers in our jails as there are women. The report, entitled 'People in Prison: Gypsies, Romany and Travellers' was commissioned to help understand the experiences of particular groups . in the prison system . The figures are higher among youth . offenders. Around 12 per cent of all inmates aged 12 to 18 in prisons . known as Secure Training Centres are gipsies, Romany or travellers. The . study, by HM Prisons Inspectorate, concluded that people from these . backgrounds are ‘significantly over-represented in prison’. It . called for ‘comprehensive monitoring’ of the number of prisoners from . the groups to understand why so many are behind bars. ‘The reasons for . this over-representation lie outside the prison service and more needs . to be done to understand and address this,’ the report said. The HM . Prisons Inspectorate added that its prediction of total numbers is . likely to be an underestimate. The report was commissioned to help understand the experiences of particular groups in the prison system. It . finds that many from the three groups have a ‘mistrust’ of the police . and the justice system, because they think it is designed to help . ‘permanently settled communities’. Around five per cent of prisoners identified themselves as Gypsy, Romany or Traveller in the national prison survey. There are around 85,000 inmates in England and Wales, giving an estimated total of 4,276 behind bars . They . cite evidence that gipsy offenders are more likely to be given a prison . sentence and be remanded in custody because they do not have a . permanent address and because of fears that they may abscond. The . 2011 census included 58,000 people who identified themselves as gipsy . or traveller. However, it did not survey for Romany and the census has . struggled to track travellers. In . April 2012, the Mail reported on a gang of gipsy pickpockets, the . Rostas family, who stole from at least 185 commuters on late night . trains leaving London and used the cash to build five mansions in . Romania. There are around 85,000 inmates in England and Wales. The population of women prisoners is nearly 4,000. In the report, prisoners were asked to identify themselves as gipsy, Romany or traveller. The . report says the word gipsy refers to Romany groups from Europe who . settled in England in medieval times and lived nomadic lives. Romany or . Roma speak the Romani language or did so in the past, while traveller . refers to communities including Scottish, Welsh and Irish travellers who . live nomadically. The definition includes ‘occupational travellers’ such as ‘showpeople’ and ‘new travellers’. HMP . Woodhill was praised in the report for celebrating ‘Gipsy and Traveller . Month’ and giving more telephone credit to gipsy prisoners to help pay . for phone calls to their families. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We are committed to ensuring fair and equal treatment for all prisoners. ‘As . part of this, we recently launched a campaign to encourage and support . gipsy, traveller and Roma prisoners to declare their heritage and . address some of the sensitive issues affecting them and their . communities. ‘Since the start of this, we have seen a 50 per cent increase in declarations.’","There are about as many gypsies in jail as there are women prisoners .

Christine Houston was trying to strangle muscular dystrophy sufferer Stewart with a cravat when the Sainsbury's delivery van arrived at the family home on May 26 last year. The door-knock brought an end to the attack, which left Mr Houston with blood spotting behind his eyes. Christine Houston, 66 of Chester-le-Street, Co Durham (above left) tried to strangle her husband of 29 years Stewart with a cravat before being interrupted by Sainsbury's delivery van, arriving at Newcastle Crown Court . The killing bid has been linked to 'carer’s fatigue', where a person snaps through the pressures of looking after a loved one. At Newcastle Crown Court this afternoon, the 66-year-old pleaded guilty to attempted murder of Mr Houston at their home in Waldridge, Chester-le-Street, on May 26 last year. She appeared in court wearing a lilac fleece and was allowed to sit in the well of the court, rather than enter the dock. Muscular dystrophy is an incurable illness that targets a patient's muscles causing them to waste away. The disease is caused by a mutation in the person's genes, and can often be inherited. More than 70,000 adults and children suffer from MD in the UK. As the disease progresses, it can affect a patient's heart and breathing muscles. In severe cases, this can be life-threatening. There are several types of MD and not all of them cause serious disability. Source NHS choices . It is understood Mr Houston did not support the prosecution of his wife, who he has been with for 29 years and has cared for him for many of those years. She was granted bail to a secure unit, in Chester-le-Street, until sentence is passed next month. At least one psychiatrist will give evidence at the hearing about her mental health problems. Judge James Goss QC told her: 'You must understand, the fact that although you have now pleaded guilty to attempted murder and I am going to grant you bail for reports does not mean I am giving you any indication of what the sentence is going to be.' Mr Houston was in court when his wife entered her guilty plea and the couple smiled at each other when the hearing ended. He simply said “no comment” when approached by reporters after the hearing. Mr Houston, who is in his 50s and is confined to a wheelchair, is severely effected by his condition and has extremely limited mobility.

Today . it emerged that Mr Robinson’s lawyers at Irwin Mitchell are taking . legal action over the accident and are currently agreeing a figure with . Long’s insurers to pay for his recovery.

A City fund manager who fathered a child during an affair and lied to the courts about his wealth to reduce his paternity payments cannot be named, a judge ruled yesterday. The financial chief executive sold a company abroad for £111,000 and hid the profit from the family courts for more than three years. The attempt to cover up his wealth was exposed after the mother of his son found evidence of the lie and wanted his dishonesty made public, the High Court heard yesterday. A High Court judge has ruled that the details of a man who lied about his wealth to the courts should not be given to the police, Crown Prosecution Service or to the City regulator . But a judge ruled that the man’s name . and details of his cheating should not be given to the police or the . City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. His identity and that of his former girlfriend and child should be kept secret from the public, Mr Justice Bodey ordered. Although . the City case ‘came close to the line’, it would not be in the public . interest for the cheating fund manager – who is such a leading figure in . his field that he has assisted Prime Minister David Cameron in . furthering British business interests abroad – to be threatened with the . ruin of his career, or prosecuted for perjury, the judge said. The . City chief had ‘lied about his resources’ because ‘he did not wish to . have to pay the mother for the benefit of his child any more than he . could possibly avoid’, Mr Justice Bodey said. The . judge added: ‘This is in no way at all to excuse his conduct, which was . inexcusable, greedy, and unfair; but it is to put what he did in its . context.’ The City boss, . who is now 42, had a ‘relatively brief’ relationship with a ‘successful . professional’, now aged 40, which ended in 2007. While . the woman thought the affair was ‘an intense relationship’, the fund . manager thought it was ‘not quite a one-night stand, but very close to . it’. When the woman . became pregnant, the man told her to have an abortion. When she asked . for support, he denied he was the father and called for DNA testing. He has shown no interest in having regular contact with his son, who was called John in the courts. John . was awarded a settlement of £250,000, and his mother £40,000 for his . care. She then had to pay costs for a series of failed appeals. The . fund manager – who has since married – said that if his lies were . disclosed, ‘there is a grave risk it would spell his financial ruin’. After . the man’s real income was revealed, the courts awarded the mother a . further £80,000 and ordered him to pay £29,500 of her legal costs. Mr . Justice Bodey said it was not the role of the family court to . ‘proactively disclose information which might be of interest to outside . agencies, such as the police, the Revenue, regulatory bodies or . employers’. Mr Justice Bodey (pictured) said it would not be in the public interest for the cheating fund manager to be exposed to the ruin of his career . However, the mother persuaded a journalist abroad to make inquiries into the father's dealings. Evidence was turned up that a business had been sold, in a country called by the court 'Anonland', in 2009. In 2012 the father assured the courts he knew nothing about the sale and had made no money from it. Mr Justice Bodey said that in a hearing in December 2012, confronted by email evidence of his involvement, 'it was at this point only that he put his hands up and admitted that his case up until then had been false.' The mother, who is now training to be a barrister, told the High Court that the father's identity should be made known to police, regulators and the public because there is a public interest in the prosecution of crime, including perjury and perverting the course of justice. She said that it was in the public interest that regulators should be told, because the father was 'in a position of responsibility holding investors' funds and it is only right that the Financial Conduct Authority should investigate,' and that the disclosure of his behaviour 'would deter would-be liars from lying' in the courts. The mother said there would be no effect on John if the father was prosecuted, because he had no contact with his father. Children, she said, do not shield people from the consequences of their criminality. The father - who has since married and has two young children with his wife - said that if his lies were disclosed 'there is a grave risk it would spell his financial ruin'. He said this would harm John because it would mean the loss of support from his father. He said he had 'put his hands up', apologised and given evidence about the £111,000 undisclosed profit. The father said the mother had a single-minded determination to bring him down, and 'the family courts deal routinely with cases of high emotion, bitterness and recrimination which is particular to the relationship between the parties, and which leads people to do discreditable things like lying, which they would not do in other spheres of their life'. Since the father's real income has been revealed, the courts have awarded the mother a further £80,000 and ordered the father to pay £29,500 of her legal costs. Mr Justice Bodey said it was not the role of the family court 'proactively to disclose information which might be of interest to outside agencies, such as the police, the Revenue, regulatory bodies or employers. 'Given the number of skeletons which come out of cupboards in family proceedings, where would it end?', the judge asked.","Financial chief executive quietly sold a company abroad for £111,000 and then hid the profit from the family courts for more than three years .

Northerners have pilloried Evan Davis after the broadcaster suggested that the BBC should say it's based in Manchester, not Salford. Today programme presenter Davis, 51, said the change would boost the North West's international reputation and help forge a 'mega-city' stretching from Merseyside to Leeds. He said it was a 'serious problem' that parts of Greater Manchester such as Salford, home to the BBC's MediaCity UK since 2011, refused to simply be called 'Manchester'. 'Go back to London': said it was a 'serious problem' that parts of Greater Manchester such as Salford, home to the BBC's MediaCity UK since 2011, refused to simply be called 'Manchester' But Northerners have reacted to his comments with disdain, with Salford's mayor calling the presenter 'London-centric' and another local suggesting that he 'go back to London'. Davis made his proposal in an interview with the Manchester Evening News ahead of the broadcast of the second episode of his BBC2 programme Mind The Gap, which looks London's dominance among UK cities. 'Itâ€™s a serious problem for Manchester that other people refuse to be called Manchester. Itâ€™s doing it no favours. It [Salford] should be called Manchester,' he said. He pointed out that the two cities, despite their difference in names, share the 0161 telephone area code, the M post code, and the same inter-city rail connections.

A teenager plotted a Columbine-style massacre on his school using pipe bombs, knives and a crossbow, a court was told today. Michael Piggin, 18, stored weapons and terrorist manuals in his room as he drew up a ‘hit list’ of pupils and teachers he wanted to attack, jurors heard. Piggin allegedly planned to target two schools in his area and a mosque, cinema, university and council offices. Accused: Michael Piggin, 18, is accused of plotting a Columbine-style massacre at his Loughborough school . He dubbed his plans for an armed assault on his former school as ‘the new Columbine’, the Old Bailey heard. The English Defence League supporter allegedly kept a notebook of potential targets and plans for his attack in a notebook covered in swastika flags. Inspired by Heath Ledger’s portrayal of Batman nemesis the Joker in The Dark Knight, Piggin scrawled the mantra ‘When order fails, violence prevails’ in his diary. He also wrote, ‘Take down anyone I see, hold out in a classroom and possible take hostages and fight the police until the end’. More... Teenager, 17, who sold fatal dose of MDMA to 15-year-old girl is spared prison and handed a curfew as judge despairs at 'the folly of youth' Muslim families are begging anti-terror police to arrest their sons and prevent them from joining jihadists in Syria, says top Scotland Yard officer . How one in 20 prisoners are gypsies: Disproportionate number of travellers are in jail - more than the total number of woman inmates . The notebook had Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara on the front alongside slogans including ‘EDL: No Surrender’, ‘British and Proud’, and Nazi swastika drawings. Piggin, who wore a black Arctic Monkeys T-shirt, jeans and glasses, appeared in the dock beside two intermediaries because he has autism. Prosecutor Max Hill, QC said: ‘This case concerns a young man, 17 years of age when he was arrested, who lives in the Midlands in Loughborough and who despite his Asperger’s Syndrome has extreme views and until his arrest he was serious about putting those views into action against others. ‘That is why he faces terrorism charges in this court, terrorism having a broad definition. ‘There are five charges on the indictment.’ Loughborough teenager Michael Piggin, 18 (left), is accused . of planning a massacre at his school similar to the Columbine . killings in Colorado on April 20, 1999 perpetrated by Dylan Klebold . (right) and his friend Eric Harris . The jury were shown extracts from the teenager’s notebook, allegedly outlining his attack plans. Piggin had drawn in his notebook a stick figures with arrows showing where knives, a machete, a sawn-off air rifle, ammunition, and pipe bombs would be concealed inside a trench coat, the court heard. Mr Hill said: ‘Columbine in America was the scene of an infamous mass shooting in 1999 in which staff and students died. ‘It was purported by two students of that school aged 17 and 19. ‘The younger was the same age as Michael Piggin when he was arrested.’ He added: ‘Even making allowances for his age and Asperger’s Syndrome this is a man with extreme views and serious intentions.’ Piggin, the the Old Bailey heard, has a particular hatred of Muslims. He is accused of having the Mujahideen Poisons Handbook in his bedroom, which the prosecution say was for terrorist purposes. ‘There can be no good reason for having a poisons handbook like this’, said Mr Hill. ‘On any view, he has got what can only be called a terrorist possession. ‘We see the way this young man explains and tries to justify himself. ‘He is writing for others to read later to understand what by then he will have done.’ Piggin rants about stopping the spread of Islam in Britain and says he wants to stop Muslims ‘and other social scumbags’ from coming into the country. ‘What he is talking about is if that Islamic invasion of Europe isn’t dealt with soon, it will be too late,’ Mr Hill said. ‘He says if there is one British child born in Luton, there will be four Muslim children born.’ Columbine High School in Colorado was unknown to the world at large until April 20, 1999. That was the day when two pupils of the school Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, went there and murdered 13 pupils and one teacher and injured 24 others before committing suicide in the library where they had killed 10 of their victims. The pair appeared in school plays and worked on the school’s computer system, maintaining the server. Both were keen gamers but also took a more disturbing interest in violence and posted videos online of themselves experimenting with explosives. It is believed that although they were subjected to some bullying they were not the social pariahs that they have subsequently been portrayed as. At 11.19am on April 20, 1999 (Hitler’s birthday) the first shots were fired at the school. Harris and Klebold had already placed two sports bags each containing a 20lb bomb in the school café and they began firing at their classmates. Harris was responsible for eight of the 13 confirmed deaths, including that of a teacher, while Klebold killed the remaining five. The shooting spree ended at 11.42am and 20 minutes later Harris and Klebold went to the library where at 12.08pm they killed themselves. In among plans to make bombs out of jerry cans, which could be detonated by mobile phone, Piggin wrote about planning to bomb Loughborough Mosque, the court heard. He wrote: ‘There’s too many Muslims in the UK and Europe, so we must stop them coming over here and send the ones already over here back home before they take over European governments and put Sharia Law in place.’ In recordings played to the jury Piggin was heard ranting about an ‘Islamic invasion of Europe’ and quoting from the violent Nick Love film Outlaw. ‘The reason I’m about to take this action is to show that even the smallest and least powerful people have the power to hit back against the strong and the powerful,’ he said. ‘They have the power to hit back at the strong and corrupt and hopefully it will cause people to do what I am, to rise up and take power back. ‘I can’t alone change much but hopefully my actions can ensure a revolution against the system. ‘People are living in a world of delusion. ‘Even if I lose or will be known as evil I would rather fight and die than live a long and unhappy life.’ Piggin and his friends filmed themselves making bombs ‘for their own amusement or for other people to view’,’ the jury heard. He and two other 18-year-old boys who cannot be named for legal reasons, called themselves the Urban Revolutionary Army, have already admitted possessing petrol bombs and pipe bombs. Piggin, of Beaumont Road, Loughborough, denies possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism and possession of a document or a record containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism on or before February 19, 2013. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Michael Piggin, 18, allegedly kept weapons and terrorist manuals in his bedroom .

Jailed: Nathan Scotford, 23, was almost twice the legal drinking limit when he offered his sister a lift home in his Transit van from a night out . A drink-driver who killed his own sister when he crashed into a river has been jailed for 20 months. Nathan Scotchford, 23, was almost double the legal limit when he offered 19-year-old Natalie, a beauty therapist, a lift home after a night out. Losing control, he plunged his Transit van into a river and it overturned and sank, trapping Natalie inside. Scotchford managed to free himself and local fishermen heard him shouting: 'Help! My sister is in there'. She was freed from the wreckage in the River Nene near Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, but died in hospital shortly after. A breath-test two hours after the accident, which happened around 3.40am on July 6 last year, found he was almost twice the legal alcohol limit with a reading of 61mgs/100mls. Scotchford, of Ramsey, Cambridgeshire, admitted causing death by driving without due care and attention while drunk. His grieving parents John, 60, and Sharon, 59 - who have vowed to stick together as a family - wept as he was jailed at Peterborough Crown Court. His elderly grandparents were also present. Judge Patrick O'Brien told Scotchford: 'I want to extend my sympathies to the tight-knit Scotchford family and extended family. 'It is clear the grief your thoughtless actions have inflicted upon them and the support they have given you in letters that are effectively asking mercy for you. 'I must look at the matter not just from the point of view of the Scotchford family and friends but from the public gain. 'And to try to ensure that we won't have more young people with cars driving relations and friends home after they have had far too much to drink for it to be safe for them to do so.' The judge added: 'I take into account you're 23 years of age and your clean driving record for four years up until the time of the accident and your remorse. Tragic: Natalie, 19, became trapped in the van when it overturned in the River Nene, near Peterborough . 'And I take into account your attempts in the icy water to try to free your sister, and your vulnerability in prison. 'I am forced to consider a suspended sentence but my answer is no. 'The sentence upon you is to 20 months imprisonment but you will serve 10 of them with good behaviour. 'I disqualify you from driving for the minimum level I can while taking in the job you have been offered and the need to drive it around for work.' Defending, James Macwhirter said Scotchford feels 'unbearable guilt when he looks his parents in the eyes.' He said: 'The defendant no longer drinks. He has in fact stopped socialising since the awful event. 'It was a momentary lapse of concentration. 'It was one moment's impulsiveness, that decision to drive, that decision to drive his sister Natalie home, to make sure she got home, ironically, safely. 'I do fear I can't adequately convey the shame and guilt he feels, the shame and the hatred he will carry with him for the remainder of his life. 'This is the burden he carries and that's the burden he will continue to carry. Nathan managed to break free and called for help, but Natalie died later in hospital on July 6 last year . 'The burden manifests itself in the physical anguish born from the loss of his sister. And the obvious unbearable guilt when he looks his parents in the eyes.' Mr Macwhirter added that the Scotchford family had said: 'We cannot properly grieve for Natalie if we have to grieve for Nathan as well.' In a statement after the accident Mr and Mrs Scotchford said their family would remain united. They said: 'Words cannot begin to convey how devastated we are at the loss of our beautiful Natalie. 'She was a popular, caring and loving young woman who loved her friends, her family and having fun. 'She'd just become a doting auntie and was doing a magnificent job supporting her sister looking after her little nephew. 'We are an exceptionally close family and we will remain united - as we have always been - to support each other through the difficult times ahead.' After the case accident investigator PC James Thorne said: 'This is an extremely tragic case which has clearly had a devastating impact on all of the family. 'Justice must be done and the sentence has been passed however there can be no greater punishment than knowing you are responsible for your sister's death. 'This is a sad example of the devastating effects driving over the limit can cause.' Scotchford, who showed no emotion as he was sent down, was also subject to a victim surcharge of Â£100.","Nathan Scotford, 23, was almost twice legal limit when drove sister home .

A proud resident of York has been awarded compensation from his bank after they wrongly claimed his home city was part of North Yorkshire. Peter Brown, a former sheriff of the historic city, received a letter from Lloyds Bank addressed to his house in 'York, North Yorkshire'. In his reply, he pointed out that the city has been legally independent from the country for nearly two decades. Compensation: Peter Brown has been given £75 by Lloyds Bank after they wrongly addressed a letter to him saying he lived in 'York, North Yorkshire' The bank apologised for their error, and gave Mr Brown £75 to make up for the 'frustration and inconvenience' he suffered. Mr Brown, an accountant, served in the honorary post of sheriff between 1990 and 1991, and took an oath to preserve and protest the city. He informed Lloyds that York had been self-governing since the 14th century, apart from a brief interlude between 1974 and 1995.

Proud: York has been independent from its surrounding county nearly continuously since the 14th century . Carved out: The city was given the status of a unitary authority in 1995 . York is geographically located in the county of North Yorkshire, but forms its own legally separate unitary authority. The city has been formally independent from the county since 1386, when King Richard II granted it a distinct identity and appointed the city's sheriff. It was incorporated into North Yorkshire for the first time in 1974, as part of Ted Heath's nationwide reforms to local government. However, in 1995 the city was granted unitary authority status, giving it freedom from the county once again. Lloyds customer services official David Fellows replied to his complaint saying he had verified his address with Royal Mail and accepted his assertion. 'As you mentioned, North Yorkshire ought not to be included as one of the lines of your address,' he wrote. 'Please accept our apologies for this mistake. 'To put things right, I am offering to pay you £75 for any frustration and inconvenience caused. 'I have today submitted a request to have your address corrected thoroughly and properly.' Mr Brown said he hoped the acknowledgement would spare other residents of the city from suffering the same misunderstanding as him.","Peter Brown complained after receiving incorrectly addressed letter .

The main railway line from London to Cornwall will re-open within weeks after millions of pounds were spent rebuilding a section of track which swept into the sea. Three hundred engineers have used 5,000 tonnes of concrete, 150 tonnes of steel, scaffolding bridges and long stretches of cable to repair the track in the Devon town of Dawlish, which bore the brunt of the fierce storms which battered Britain last month. Photos show dramatic progress on the 100m stretch of track, where workmen have had to build a new sea wall, lay new track and demolish and rebuild an entire platform at Dawlish station after a storm surge left the railway dangling over the sea. Mammoth project: The cost of rebuilding the railway line through the Devon town of Dawlish is thought to be around £15m after it was swept into the sea . Hard at work: More than 300 engineers have been tasked to work on the two-month project, using more than 5,000 tonnes of concrete and 150 tonnes of steel . Then and now: Left, the section of track which was left dangling over the sea on February 5 in stormy weather; right, workers in the sunshine as the repairs move on . Devastated: How the worst-affected section of track looked on February 6. The collapse destroyed part of a house which was perched on the seafront near the line . Repairs: The same area on February 27 after workers made a temporary sea wall using shipping containers full of stones and poured concrete into the gap . Rail chiefs hoped to re-open the line this month, but had to put the date back to mid-April as the project slipped behind schedule. Now, however, they have brought the date forward two weeks and say it will re-open on April 4. It will be welcome news to the thousands of commuters who will have been stranded on replacement buses and coaches for two months. Immediately after the track collapsed some passengers were forced to pay double because the rail firm which runs services on the line withdrew all its advance tickets, which come at a heavy discount. Amid a fierce backlash, First Great Western was forced to deny 'profiteering' and the next day introduced a 25 per cent discount for all its more expensive on-the-day fares. Despite the gesture traders in Devon and Cornwall have claimed the works have cost the South West's tourist economy more than £1million a day. Battering: Waves smash against the seafront in Dawlish on the morning after a storm surge washed away the sea wall under a 100m stretch of railway track . Mess: Workers arrived soon after the track was left dangling in mid-air, but had to continue battling storms which damaged the sea wall for more than a week afterwards . Damage: While the hole in the sea wall was the biggest in Dawlish, several other parts of the historic railway designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel were damaged . The repair work is reportedly costing £15million but Network Rail has refused to confirm its estimate for the final cost of the project. A spokesman told MailOnline only that it would run into 'millions of pounds'. The spokesman said: 'Network Rail is acutely aware of the value of the railway to the economy of the south west of England and has been working closely with local authorities, business groups and transport providers in and around Dawlish to ensure that disruption is minimised. 'Restoring this vital asset in time for the busy school holiday period will provide a welcome boost to the regional economy as business and tourism return to South Devon and Cornwall.' Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin added: 'I saw for myself the scale of the damage to the line at Dawlish caused by the recent exceptionally bad weather. Today’s confirmation that the line should now be back in operation before the Easter holidays will be a real boost for local communities and businesses. 'I know that Network Rail staff have been working tirelessly to get the line up and running as soon as possible. I would like to thank everyone for their hard work so far.' Spray: The storms continued for more than a week after the collapse but workers were already on site, as shown in this photo from February 9 . Sea view: Network Rail released a series of photos showing how work has progressed on the site of the disaster. This one is dated February 12 . Romantic walk on the beach: Works continued on February 14, Valentine's Day, when this photo was taken. Huge shipping containers formed a temporary wall . Damage: Work continues on February 19. The project is costing an estimated £15m and more repairs will be needed to secure the sea wall in the future . Just keep digging: Workers on the seafront on February 26. The route is more than 150 years old and was opened as a channel from London to the south west . Progress: This photo, also taken on February 26, shows how work on the sea wall has progressed since much of it was swept away . Landslips: Workers on the line on March 5. Several landslips in more than a week of storms pushed the work behind schedule amid protests from Cornwall businesses . More work will have to be done on the line to safeguard it against future storms once the railway has been reopened, with the final cost yet to be confirmed. The Army and Royal Marines were called in to help with emergency repairs after the track gave way on the night of February 4. It had already been closed for safety reasons after heavy waves and a storm surge were predicted. More than a week of storms badly damaged a 3.7 mile section between Dawlish and Teignmouth - with other breaches at Dawlish Warren and Teignmouth and five landslips near the famous Smugglers’ Cove. The route is more than 150 years old, and . was designed by the engineering legend Isambard Kingdom Brunel to take . tourists to the south west from London. Sunny at last: Workers in Dawlish have finally been able to bask in warm weather, which has helped push the re-opening of the line ahead of schedule . Tuesday 4 February . Forecasts warn of six-metre waves and at 3.15pm the line through Dawlish is closed to trains, with staff withdrawn to 'safe locations'. The storm continues through Wednesday as engineers arrive on site to begin repairs. Thursday 6 February . Work begins on demolishing what is left of the battered railway. Rails and sleepers spanning the hole in the sea wall are cut off and removed. A ramp into the hole is constructed for access. Sunday 9 February . A row of shipping containers is put in place and filled with rubble to provide a breakwater for the workmen, who spray quick-drying concrete on sections that need urgent repairing between each high tide. Wednesday 12 February . Workers create scaffolding and a cable bridge to access parts of the site which have been cut off. Friday 14 February . Another sea surge swamps the Dawlish cost during the night, damaging the 10-tonne shipping containers forming the temporary sea wall. Further sections of the old sea wall are destroyed - making the hole a third bigger - and another section of the wall breaks away near Dawlish Warren. Wednesday 26 February . The storms have finally blown over. Track begins to be built for the area near Dawlish station as the platform is rebuilt and some of the 5,000 tonnes of concrete continue to set into a new sea wall.

Speedy: Peregrine falcons are some of the world's fastest creatures - and are also widely distributed globally . Peregrine falcons are the most widely distributed birds in the world - inhabiting all continents, except Antarctica. However, in Britain, they are usually spotted in the skies above  mountain ranges, wild cliffs and other remote spaces. Photographer Sam Hobson, 34, said it was 'amazing' to capture the birds hunting above the bustling cities. 'There is something amazing about seeing one of the world's fastest animals perched on a building you see every day,' he said. 'There are . plenty of tall buildings in cities for the birds to perch on.' Mid-flight: But the birds are usually spotted in the skies above mountain ranges and wild cliffs in remote areas .

Above, a peregrine falcon flies over Bristol . 'Perfect habitat': 'We have unwittingly created the perfect habitat for the falcons in Britain,' said the 34-year-old . Mr Hobson, who has been tracking and photographing urban falcons in Bristol and London for the past two years, said the birds had been attracted to the cities because of their large number of pigeons and other migratory birds. 'I have seen falcons doing things they don't do in the countryside,' he said. 'For example, I witnessed them hunting at night. 'The . falcons were using the city lights to spot other birds and then . swooping on them. Perching: Mr Hobson said March was a good month for picturing the birds. Above, a falcon on a perch . 'We are used to seeing nocturnal hunting behavior in . owls, but not peregrines. 'They were hunting different birds as well, not just pigeons. They preyed on a lot of migratory birds.' He added that March was a good month for photographing the birds - saying: 'We are coming up to the time when falcons lay their first eggs of the year. 'Males are particularly territorial during this time, and attack other birds like seagulls which come anywhere near their nests. 'A couple of years ago two falcons in Bristol only managed to lay one egg, and a seagull knocked it into the floating harbour. Some workmen managed to fish it out with an umbrella, and it was saved.' Mr Hobson said he had captured the falcons from vantage points on high buildings - while carefully observing their nesting habits to determine where they will appear. 'I stood on top of a car park all day, waiting for something to happen,' he said. 'From the pictures you would think these are really active birds, but often I sit there watching them perched on a ledge, digesting their food all day.' Ben Hoare, features editor at BBC Wildlife Magazine, said peregrines have undergone a 'spectacular renaissance' in Britain - and have been attracted to cities because of their 'suitable prey'. 'There is plenty of suitable prey here, especially pigeons, and lots of nest sites too - a high ledge or flat roof is a perfect substitute for a cliff,' he said. 'The falcons have even learned to hunt after dark using the glow from streetlights, targeting the migratory birds that fly over our cities at night.

Former referee: John Gardener, who bit his fingernails until they bled, died of a heart attack at the age of 40 after contracting septicaemia, an inquest heard . A former football referee who would bite his fingernails until they bled died of a heart attack at the age of 40 after contracting septicaemia, an inquest heard. John Gardener would frequently chew the ends of his fingers to the point where they were 'often bleeding', resulting in a septic infection. The former amateur football referee died from a heart attack, just days after his 40th birthday and two weeks after he was admitted to Wigan Infirmary, where he had undergone an operation to remove the tip of one of his fingers. Bolton Coroner's Court was told that Mr Gardener's fingernails were in a constant poor condition and he lost a lot of feeling and sensation in them. GP Dr Daniel Vernon told the hearing that Mr Gardener would probably not realise the severity of the condition because of this. 'John’s nails were always in bad condition,' said the doctor. 'It was likely they were often bleeding when he came to the doctors.' Mr Gardener, who was diabetic, had also been treated for anxiety and depression in the years leading up to his death, the inquest was told. He underwent surgery to remove the tip of his finger eight days after being admitted into hospital. Before this he was treated with intravenous antibiotics and was monitored by medical staff daily to see if his condition improved as he expressed that he didn’t want to lose his finger. The inquest heard that Mr Gardener, from Wigan, Lancashire, showed signs of slow but gradual improvement and did not display any signs of high temperature or fevers. Consultant hand and orthopaedic surgeon Mr Chye Ng said he was as shocked by his patient’s sudden death on September 22 last year as the family were. 'The passing of John Gardener was really upsetting and shocking for all of the team,' said Mr Ng. The court was told how in 2011 he also underwent an operation to amputate his lower right leg after he contracted leg ulcers - a not uncommon problem among diabetics. Bitten: Bolton Coroner's Court was told that Mr Gardener's fingernails were in a constant poor condition and he lost a lot of feeling and sensation in them . Surgery: Mr Gardener died two weeks after he was admitted to Wigan Infirmary, where he had undergone an operation to remove the tip of one of his fingers . 'We would like to extend our sincere sympathies to the family and friends of Mr Gardener,' said a spokesman from Wrightington Wigan and Leigh Hospital Trust (WWL). 'The Trust always strives to provide safe, effective and compassionate care to all patients. 'It is clear from the evidence given at the inquest that Mr Gardener received a high standard of treatment throughout the time he was under our care.' Recording a narrative verdict, coroner Alan Walsh said: 'This is a death of great sadness to everybody that somebody in this situation could just die so suddenly.' He added: 'I believe he had a difficult life after being diagnosed with diabetes at just 10 months old and not only this, he had to come to terms with self-injecting himself twice a day. 'And then he had problems with leg ulcers and problems after surgery because of this.' Following the hearing Mr Gardener's mother Jean said in a statement that she had 'concerns' about her son's hospital treatment, and had instructed solicitors to investigate a claim to determine whether his treatment and surgery for the removal of the tip of his finger was adequate. 'According to his mother Jean, John felt as though his medical condition was not being taken seriously, his family said in a statement released by EAD Solicitors. 'This matter is the subject of an ongoing investigation by EAD Solicitors.' Septicaemia is another name for blood poisoning and refers to a bacterial infection of the blood, whereas sepsis, which can affect the whole body including organs, can also be caused by viral or fungal infections. The life-threatening illness is caused by the body overreacting to an infection, setting off a series of reactions that can lead to inflammation and blood clotting. Symptoms usually develop quickly and include: . In severe cases patients may also feel dizzy when they stand up, be confused or disorientated and suffer from nausea and vomiting. Although anybody can develop sepsis from a minor infection, those with a medical condtion that weakens their immune system, who are already in hospital with a serious illness and those who have just had surgery or who have wounds or injuries as a result of an accident are more at risk. Severe sepsis occurs when the body’s response to infection has started to interfere with the function of vital organs, such as the heart, kidneys, lungs or liver, while septic shock occurs in severe cases of sepsis, when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level, preventing your vital organs from receiving enough oxygenated blood. If it is not treated, sepsis can progress from uncomplicated sepsis to septic shock and can eventually lead to multiple organ failure and death. Severe sepsis and septic shock are considered medical emergencies and normally require admission to an intensive care unit, where the body’s organs can be supported while the infection is treated. Because of problems with vital organs, people with severe sepsis are likely to be very ill, and approximately 30-50per cent will die as a result of the condition. It is estimated that every year in the UK there are over 30,000 cases of severe sepsis, and the number seems to be rising.

'I have never been given money. The messages I have received have been lovely. I wasn’t expecting it.' During the attack, the thug knocked on Ms Taylor's door just after 2pm, before making 'pleasant' conversation about her pet cat. But when the pensioner's back was turned, he pushed her to the floor and repeatedly hit her on the head with a pottery doorstop. Appeal: This CCTV image has been released by police of a male suspect walking near Ms Taylor's home .

Plans to end criminal punishment for not paying the TV licence could cost the BBC £200million a year and lead to channels being axed, an executive said yesterday. Strategy chief James Purnell warned that viewers must be threatened with jail or they would simply stop paying the £145.50 annual charge. He was hitting back at Government plans to make evading the licence a civil matter, which means offenders would also avoid getting a criminal record. CBeebies, BBC Four and CBBC could all face the axe if plans to decriminalise TV licence evasion go ahead, the Corporation has warned . Popular shows like Ceebies' Justin's House (left) and Only Connect, presented by Victoria Coren on BBC Four, would be left without a home . Removing the threat of jail means . fines for not paying the fee – currently set at a maximum of £1,000 – . would be raised even higher, said Mr Purnell, a former Labour Culture . Secretary. In 2012, more . than 180,000 people, or around 3,500 a week, faced  the courts for not . paying their licence fee, accounting for one in nine cases before . magistrates. From January . 2011 to March 2013, some 107 people were sent to jail, the ultimate . punishment for not paying the fine imposed for evading the licence. But the heavy-handed tactics of the BBC’s army of collectors have sparked growing anger among viewers. The . corporation was also criticised for turning its viewers into criminals . by Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, He has tabled an amendment to change the law . which has the backing of 100-plus MPs. CBBC, which airs shows like Dick and Dom Go Wild, has a budget of almost £80million . ‘It . is diabolical that those who can’t afford to pay the licence fee are . being turned into criminals,’ he said. ‘These cases are clogging up the . criminal justice system. ‘Imagine if President Putin started charging a poll tax to fund a Russian state broadcaster and locked up people for not paying. ‘There . would be an outcry. There is a growing feeling within Parliament that . things have to stop. This issue is not going to go away.’ BBC executive James Purnell said if licence fee evasion rose to 5 per cent, it would cost the BBC £200million . Last . week, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling revealed proposals to make . non-payment a civil matter, as with gas and electricity bills, and Sky . subscriptions. But Mr . Purnell, speaking at the launch of the new BBC iPlayer, argued: ‘Say the . rate of evasion was to double from about five per cent now, that would . be £200million, that would be the equivalent of all of BBC4, all of . CBeebies, all of CBBC. ‘Doing . it very quickly would be a huge risk. The choice would mean either we . take some services off [air] or the Government would have to have a . higher licence fee.’ He denied that the court system was being clogged up as licence fee cases were looked at ‘in bulk’. Mr Purnell claimed that under a civil punishment, magistrates would not be able to match the fine to the non-payer’s income. ‘So . there is actually a danger we go over to a system in which we have . higher fines but with less success in collecting the licence fee,’ added . the BBC boss. Mr Purnell . also dismissed the idea of a subscription system, saying it would cost . roughly £500million to set up for 40million Freeview sets and cost more . than the licence fee system to run. Last month, director general Tony . Hall said the BBC wanted to extend the licence fee to the iPlayer, . meaning those who only watch catch-up TV online will have to pay just . like viewers who own television sets. Comedian Frankie Boyle has been given a new show on the BBC’s iPlayer website – putting him out of the reach  of watchdogs. The Scottish performer, 41, has a long history of offending viewers but Ofcom will be powerless as it only has power to act over complaints about terrestrial TV. He will appear in Frankie Boyle and Bob Mortimer’s Cookery Show in May in which the two comedians satirise the popularity of TV cooking programmes. Boyle was fired by Channel 4 in 2012 for making sick jokes about competitors in the Paralympics. His show is the latest in the BBC trend towards showing more content solely online where there is no watershed. This was criticised by Vivienne Pattison, director of Mediawatch-UK, who warned it would expose children to more adult material. The BBC said editorial rules will keep Boyle in line.","Making non-payment a civil matter could lead to a rise in evasion .

Labour demanded an inquiry last night into whether the £1million project helped train troops accused of shooting innocent protesters during the overthrow of the Ukrainian government last month. The revelation that money intended for the world’s poorest may have contributed to the violence came as David Cameron announced that asset freezes and travel bans will be slapped on allies of Vladimir Putin ‘within days’ over the conflict in Ukraine.

The Prime Minister said Russia should be excluded altogether from the G8 group of leading nations and that world leaders should set up a G7 meeting without the Russian president. And he warned that the EU will act as early as this week to punish those responsible for the invasion of the Crimea if Russia continues to refuse to talk to the government in Kiev. A hit list of Mr Putin’s henchmen who will have their money seized from Western bank accounts and face being banned from the EU will be drawn up today at a meeting in London involving officials from Britain, the US, Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Japan, Switzerland, Turkey and Canada. Last night it emerged that the RAF will fly surveillance aircraft through Polish and Romanian airspace to monitor the situation in Crimea. The AWACS planes will take off from bases in Lincolnshire and Germany to track Russian troop and flight movements across a 312,000 sq mile area.

If Russian jets were to enter Nato airspace they could be intercepted by US F-16s operating in Lithuania. The announcement was seen as a sign of a stiffening of resolve by Nato. The aid money sent to the Ukrainian government came from Britain’s £1billion-a-year contribution to EuropeAid, the EU’s overseas development programme. Britain’s aid budget is supposed to be spent on tackling poverty in the world’s most impoverished countries. But Brussels has spent £2billion in Ukraine since 1991 to prepare the country for joining the EU. A document detailing where the money went includes a £1.29million programme to ‘help improve the efficiency’ of interior ministry troops in riot control in the run-up to the Euro 2012 football tournament, held in Ukraine and Poland. Britain contributes around 14 per cent of the EU budget, meaning British taxpayers contributed around £167,000. Calls for an inquiry: Labour international development spokesman Jim Murphy said it is important to find out whether those who received the EU-funded training were responsible for the brutal attacks on civilians . Meanwhile it has emerged RAF AWACS will fly over Poland and Romania to monitor the Ukraine situation. A file picture of a NATO AWACS plane landing at the Northern Italian air base of Aviano. Some 240 Ukrainian soldiers were trained in ‘maintaining order in a soft manner’ and ‘techniques of restraining a person without beating’, according to a Brussels newsletter. Hundreds of such troops were deployed during clashes in Kiev last month in which dozens were killed. Labour international development spokesman Jim Murphy demanded an inquiry. ‘International aid money can be an important way of training overseas police and security forces so that they respect human rights and democracy,’ he said. ‘But we need to know if those that received it played any role in the brutal attacks on civilians carried out by government forces before the collapse of the Yanukovych regime.’ A European Commission spokesman defended the scheme, saying: ‘In the recent upheaval the vast majority of police officers did not resort to indiscriminate violence. With the full support of the UK, the EU provided funding to train Ukrainian police, not to beat people or abuse their rights.’ Red Star sentinel: A sailor guards a Russian navy ship in the Bay of Sevastopol .

The rise of the party, headed by Nigel Farage, has been attributed to voter dissatisfaction with the three main parties and immigration issues . UKIP could attract 30 per cent of the vote if it can get its act together, a major new study of the party claims today. The academic study, which analysed the views of more than 100,000 voters, says support for Ukip is driven not just by Euroscepticism, but also by ‘hostility’ to immigration and ‘intense dissatisfaction’ with the three main parties. It suggests that almost one-third of voters share at least two of these values and might be persuaded to vote for the party in future if it can succeed in getting its message across. The study also finds that Ukip’s potential support has increased since the start of the financial crisis, with public dissatisfaction growing about the way the main parties have handled immigration. The report’s co-author Dr Robert Ford, of the University of Manchester, said: ‘UKIP are currently winning over one voter in ten but their potential far exceeds their current support in the polls by a margin of three to one. This revolt has been a long time coming, but may have a long way to run.’ The new study also suggests that Ukip’s supporters have been ‘deeply misunderstood’, with the party now attracting growing support from working class voters. The findings are drawn from a new book on the party by Dr Ford and Matthew Goodwin, of the University of Nottingham. Dr Goodwin said: ‘Ukip are winning over the “Left Behind” groups in British society - old, working class, men, with very few educational qualifications. These are voters who hold a very different set of values to the professional, middle-class majority - they are far more nationalist, Eurosceptic, fiercely opposed to immigration and feel like they have no voice in politics. They look out at a country their neither recognise nor want to be a part of. The study also warns that the party faces a series of major challenges, including a demographic timebomb resulting from the fact it has 'little appeal to university graduates, the young or ethnic minorities' ‘Euroscepticism gets (Nigel) Farage through the door, but to close the deal he needs to also tap into voter concerns about immigration and their dissatisfaction with our mainstream politics.’ But the study warns that the party faces a series of major challenges, including a demographic timebomb resulting from the fact it has ‘little appeal to university graduates, the young or ethnic minorities’. The findings come as Ukip comes under pressure over its voting record and the eccentric - and sometimes extreme - views of some of its leading members. The senior Tory backbencher Robert Halfon last week described some Ukip supporters as being ‘literally akin to Nazis’. But the authors of the new report argue that political and media attacks on the eccentric views of some leading figures have little impact on its support. Ukip's London headquarters in Brook's Mews, Mayfair. One former employee yesterday described the atmosphere there as 'extraordinary' ‘The average Ukip voter thinks these attacks are all an establishment stitch-up,’ Dr Ford said. The new book says that David Cameron has proved to be a ‘significant recruiting sergeant’ for Ukip, with ‘dislike of Ed Miliband’ also a growing factor in the party’s popularity. Ukip leader Nigel Farage last night said the research contradicted popular stereotypes about the party’s supporters. In an article in the London Evening Standard he wrote: ‘The point is that the idea of Ukip fishing for votes predominantly from the Tory pond is plain wrong. 'To listen to received wisdom inside the Westminster bubble you would think the typical Ukip voter is a retired half-colonel living on the edge of Salisbury Plain. If there was ever anything in that stereotype there certainly isn’t any longer.’ * UKIP’S head office is a disorganised ‘freak show’, Nigel Farage’s wife has told friends. Reports yesterday claimed that Kirsten Farage has been taken aback by the eccentric atmosphere at the party’s London headquarters. Mrs Farage, who earns up to £30,000 from the public purse as one of her husband’s assistants, is said to have told colleagues that the party HQ is a ‘work environment that takes some getting used to’ and described it privately as a freak show. One senior adviser to Mr Farage sometimes brings her pet cat to work, others play juvenile games in the office and one official has been known to sit with an ‘Orgasmatron’ wire massage device on her head. One former employee yesterday described the atmosphere as ‘extraordinary’, adding: ‘Everybody has been out with everyone else. There are animals in the office, people taking their clothes off... there are no sanctions.’ But another insider said the reports were overblown. ‘We have fun while working,’ he said. ‘Someone brings a cat to work, people like to jape in the office. Big deal.’","Report says party could gain more of a foothold among electorate .

Police investigating a spate of teenagers throwing eggs at houses in Stoke-on-Trent have blamed singer Justin Bieber for sparking the craze . Police investigating a spate of teenagers throwing eggs at houses have blamed singer Justin Bieber for sparking the craze. Staffordshire Police have received dozens of complaints about youngsters pelting eggs at homes across Stoke-on-Trent. It comes just weeks after the 20-year-old heartthrob's LA mansion was raided by police following reports he had 'egged' his neighbours' property. The Canadian star is still facing possible felony charges of vandalism after allegedly throwing a dozen raw eggs at the home of Suzie and Jeffrey Schwartz on January 15. Now, police have asked headteachers in the area to remind their students not to emulate Bieber, who is also facing charges of assault in Canada and driving under the influence in Miami. Today, Police Constable Barry Joyson, of Staffordshire Police, said teenagers in the UK could face the same charges as the singer if they are caught throwing eggs at houses. 'Some of the children have told us this craze has been going around the schools and it was linked to Justin Bieber,' he said. 'We had lots of reported incidents of people finding eggs had been thrown at their houses. It was totally random, no-one was being targeted. 'Quite a lot of residents were getting annoyed because this was happening on a few occasions.' Police have already spoken to eight youngsters, aged between 10 and 16, who were caught pelting eggs at properties in the area. They have been forced to signed Acceptable Behaviour Contracts, which state they must stay out of trouble or risk facing further punishment. Attack: Staffordshire Police have received dozens of complaints about youngsters pelting eggs at homes in the area. It comes just weeks after Bieber allegedly 'egged' his neighbour's property. Above, a splattered egg is pictured outside Suzie and Jeffrey Schwartz's home following the 20-year-old star's alleged attack in January . During the spate of 'egging' incidents, houses were targeted in the Trent Vale, Penkhull, Hartshill and Joiners Square areas of the city. Today, victims spoke of their shock that teenagers would wish to emulate Bieber - with one deeming the craze 'juvenile' and 'pathetic'. Barry Blakemore, 55, whose house was egged, said: 'Why somebody would want to copy Bieber is beyond me. How much of an idiot do you have to be? Sprawling estate: An aerial view of Bieber's home (centre) and the surrounding properties in Calabasas . 'I understand people look up to pop stars but to emulate them by committing mindless acts of vandalism is just absurd. 'I donâ€™t know what the matter is with the youth of today. They want to copy Bieber's criminal acts. The world has gone mad.' Another victim Sallie Kimberley, added: 'This craze is juvenile and pathetic.' Bieber, who celebrated his 20th birthday with his family at the beginning of this month, has had several run-ins with his neighbours in the past.

Shoppers across Europe may soon have to pay for plastic bags under planned EU laws designed to reduce litter. Euro MPs voted in favour of strict targets that would force each country to halve its use of the lightweight disposable bags by 2017 and to cut it by 80 per cent by 2019. The 28 member states will be allowed to decide themselves how to meet the target – but MEPs suggest they will either have to introduce a charge for the single-use carrier bags, tax shops which give them out for free, or impose a complete ban. Britons could soon be banned from taking their shopping home in plastic bags after the MEPs approved EU targets . Parliament’s Environment Committee . yesterday backed a report by the European Commission that would require . each government to take some form of legislative action to curb free . handouts of plastic bags. The . average EU citizen uses 198 plastic bags a year, the vast majority of . which are single-use. Critics of plastic bags argue they waste . resources, contribute to litter, and represent a powerful symbol of the 'throwaway society', and last year the European Commission put forward . proposals to require member states to enact plastic bag bans, levies, or . other measures to reduce their use. MEPs . have now approved the plans, which aim to halve plastic bag hand-outs . over three years and then reduce use to 80 per cent of today’s levels by . the end of the decade. Every year each EU citizen uses, on average, 200 bags with 8billion of them ending up in seas and rivers . Under the new rules, which still have . to be voted on by the full European Parliament and backed by the . European Council, member states would have the option of introducing a . small levy on plastic bags, as has already been successfully enacted in . the Republic of Ireland, France, Norway and Spain. Alternatively, they . could introduce mandatory plastic bag reduction targets. The . legislation would also make it possible for governments to introduce an . outright ban on plastic bags, without contravening single market rules. Italy is currently facing legal action from the Commission, after . launching Europe’s first plastic bag ban in 2011. But that case could be . dropped if the new proposals get the green light. However, . despite the ENVI Committee’s overall support for the plan yesterday, . Conservative MEPs were strongly opposed to the idea. Writing on Twitter, . MEP Vicky Ford questioned if plastic bag use should be within the remit . of the EU. It now remains . to be seen whether the whole Parliament will now approve the plans in . April, when they are due to be discussed at a Plenary session. Green . MEP Margrete Auken had originally proposed a target to reduce plastic . bag use by 80 per cent over two years, but the Socialists, European . People’s Party and ALDE group reached a compromise agreement to deliver . on the target over five years, in the hope that it would be more likely . to gain majority backing in the plenary vote. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has already set a minimum 5p charge for plastic bags from 2015 in response to the Mail's Banish the Bags campaign . Chris . Davies, Liberal Democrat MEP and environment spokesman for the party in . Brussels, accused the Conservative Party of opposing action to tackle a . serious environmental problem. 'It is clear that we need an EU-wide . approach to prevent the enormous damage being done by plastic bag waste . to Europe’s seas and beaches,' he said. 'Plastic bags not only blight . our landscape, they pose a serious threat to marine wildlife. Three-quarters of seabirds and one third of fish in the English Channel . have been found to be contaminated by plastic waste, much of it from . plastic bags.

Immigrants have much better educational qualifications than people born in Britain, a new study yesterday found. It said that more than a third of people who were born abroad have a degree or qualifications of the same level - but only just over a quarter of British-born people. At the other end of the education scale, nearly one in four British-born people left school with no qualifications and have achieved none since. But fewer than a fifth of immigrants have no academic achievements at all to show. A study found that immigrants have much better educational qualifications than people born in Britain. Pictured, students at the University of East London . The high education levels of those born abroad provide fresh evidence to explain why employers are anxious to fill jobs with immigrants rather than native-born workers, and keen to keep migration doors open to maintain the supply of better-qualified labour. The study, by academics at the University of Manchester, suggested that immigrants have better qualifications because some have been gained abroad, because many arrive as students at British educational institutions, and because migrant groups have over a 20-year period overtaken native Britons in educational achievement. Researchers used information gathered by the national census in 1991, 2001 and 2011 to check the educational levels of people born in different countries and from different ethnic groups. Study author Kitty Lymperopoulou said: ‘Over the last twenty years, educational attainment has been increasing among ethnic groups as a result of an improvement in access to education overseas and the increasing proportion of ethnic minority people educated in Britain.’ The report said that people from Chinese, Indian and African background were ahead of white British people in educational achievement. File picture . The report said that people from Chinese, Indian and African background were ahead of white British people in educational achievement, and that Bangladeshis and Pakistanis who have long lagged behind are catching up. The only ethnic group left far behind are those classed as white gypsies or Irish travellers, among whom six out of 10 have no qualifications and fewer than one in 10 a degree or equivalent. It found a wide educational gap between people born in Britain, and those born abroad, who are counted by statisticians as immigrants. The differences were most marked among young people, who include those who came to Britain as students, and those who came as young children and pursued education in Britain. ‘The differences in educational attainment between younger and older groups are more pronounced for those born outside the UK,’ the study said. The only ethnic group left far behind are those classed as white gypsies or Irish travellers, among whom six out of 10 have no qualifications and fewer than one in 10 a degree or equivalent. File picture . ‘Across all ages, over a third of people born outside the UK had degree level qualifications compared with a quarter of people born in Britain. Similarly, the foreign born population were less likely to be without any qualifications than the UK born population.’ It said that young Bangladeshi and Pakistani immigrants under the age of 24 were four times less likely to be without qualifications than people born in those countries aged in their 50s and early 60s. More than four out of 10 young Indians have a degree, partly because of high numbers who study in Britain. Polish and Eastern European migrants are less likely to have degrees but many have other qualifications from their home countries, the report said. The study, by the Centre on Dynamics of Ethnicity at Manchester, said: ‘A comparison of the 1991, 2001 and 2011 censuses suggests that all ethnic groups experienced improvements in educational attainment over the last 20 years. ‘These improvement reflect, to a large extent, improved access to higher education, particularly among women.’","High achievement may explain why employers want immigrants .

The Lib Dem Business Secretary told his wife Rachel he had ‘done an awful thing’ by asking the Osborne’s to join them in the New Forest, but they were spared an awkward weekend when they guests never replied. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable told his wife Rachel he had done an 'awful thing', and invited George Osborne to visit . Mr Cable and his Tory rival clashed repeatedly during the 2010 general election, and failed to strike up the amicable working relationship other ministers enjoyed when the coalition was formed. Relations were so bad Mr Cable, who had been the Lib Dems’ shadow chancellor in opposition, was handed the Department for Business instead of moving to the Treasury as Mr Osborne’s deputy. When Mr Osborne’s austerity programme appeared to be choking off growth, Mr Cable called for a Plan B, and later a Plan V, to get the economy moving. But in the very early days of the coalition, while the government was enjoying its honeymoon period, Mr Cable tried to extend the hand of friendship – albeit reluctantly. Rachel Smith, Mr Cable’s wife, revealed in an interview attempts to broker a truce with the Osbornes with a trip to the family farm in the New Forest. She said: ‘I invited them because Vince said to me right at the beginning, during the Government’s honeymoon period: “I’ve done an awful thing…I asked, would the Osbornes like to come to the farm,” he said.’ At a recent event, Rachel Smith said she found George Osborne and wife Frances 'cool' and would not invite them to visit again .

Even the maximum limit advised by doctors is too much for expecting mothers, researchers claim (stock picture) Just three drinks a week in early pregnancy can double the chances of having a premature or unexpectedly small baby - with middle class mothers most at risk, warn researchers. Even two drinks a week - the maximum limit in official guidelines - increases the risk of preterm delivery or an unexpectedly small baby, says a new study. But it shows middle class mothers habitually drink more than this at a time when the growing baby is most likely to come to harm from alcohol. Researchers at Leeds University claim the only safe level of drinking in pregnancy - and when planning to have a baby - is none at all. Researcher Camilla Nykjaer, of the university’s nutritional epidemiology group, said ‘Our findings suggest that women should be advised to abstain from alcohol when planning to conceive and throughout pregnancy.’ The Department of Health recommends that women who are pregnant and trying to conceive should not drink alcohol, and never more than 1-2 units a week. In the latest study led by Professor Janet Cade, 1,264 women at low risk of birth complications in Leeds completed food frequency questionnaires before and during pregnancy. They were asked how often they drank alcohol, and what type it was, at four time points: in the four weeks before conception; and in each of the subsequent three months, or trimesters, throughout the pregnancy. Alcohol consumption was significantly higher before conception and in the first three months of pregnancy than subsequently. On average they had 11 drinks a week before getting pregnant, four during the first three months and just under two units a week later on. Around half of the women drank more than the recommended maximum two weekly units during the first trimester. Almost four out of 10 said they drank more than 10 units a week in the period leading up to conception. Those who drank more than two units a week tended to be older, educated to degree level, of white ethnicity, and more likely to live in affluent areas. Some 13 per cent of babies were born underweight after their mothers had exceeded the alcohol limit . Some 13 per cent of the babies born were underweight, 4.4 per cent were smaller than would be expected and 4.3 per cent were born prematurely. Drinking during the first three months of pregnancy was most strongly linked to these outcomes, says a report published online in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. Women who drank more than two weekly units were at double the risk of giving birth to an unexpectedly small or premature baby than women who drank no alcohol at all. But even women who didn’t exceed the maximum recommended alcohol intake at this time were still more likely to have a premature birth. Drinking in the month before conception was also linked to a higher risk of restricted fetal growth, indicating this may also be a critical period, it says. Dr Nykjaer said ‘We found the first trimester to be the period most sensitive to the effect of alcohol on the developing fetus. ‘Women adhering to guidelines in this period were still at increased risk of adverse birth outcomes. After the first three months, drinking alcohol has less effect on the growth of the baby . ‘Although the Department of Health . advises avoiding alcohol, the guidelines do give a bit of leeway and our . research supports abstinence’ she added. The issue of how much is safe to drink during pregnancy has caused controversy in recent years. In . 2007, the Department of Health published guidance saying pregnant women . should avoid drinking alcohol altogether, as should those trying to . conceive. Such women should never drink more than one or two units once or twice a week, it says. This replaced previous guidance which said it was safe for pregnant women to drink one to two units of alcohol per week. The Government said its update was not based on new research, but was to provide consistent advice to all women. Drinking in the month before conception was also found to restrict fetal growth . The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence also advises women to avoid alcohol in the first three months of pregnancy. Heavy drinking in pregnancy is linked to Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) in children, which can cause a range of physical, mental and behavioural problems. Dr Nykjaer stressed that pregnant women should not be scared by the findings. She said ‘We have found an effect in a population of women that helps reinforce guidelines but the effect in an individual woman would be quite small.’ She said women in the study may have under-reported their drinking because of the ‘taboo’ surrounding alcohol and pregnancy. As a result the effect on prematurity and growth may have come from larger intakes of alcohol than the study suggested, she said. Prof Andrew Whitelaw, Professor of Neonatal Medicine, University of Bristol, said ‘This is further evidence that even moderate amounts of alcohol are toxic to the growing fetus and direct toxicity is further worsened by the increased complications of premature birth. ‘As 38 per cent of the women admitted risky drinking (over 10 units/week) before pregnancy and pregnancy is sometimes discovered late, the advice has to be to avoid alcohol completely when trying to conceive.’ Dr Ron Gray, Senior Clinical Research Fellow, National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, said the study’s design made it difficult to draw any sound conclusions and the results could be due to chance or other factors. He said ‘Further research on whether there is any completely safe amount to drink during pregnancy remains necessary, but in the meantime pregnant women should follow the advice from the UK Chief Medical Officers to avoid alcohol during pregnancy.’","Leeds University study found abstinence to be only way for healthy growth .

Channel 4 News has removed a video from its website after it emerged that four of the five people it interviewed about police relations in Brixton were employed by the same marketing company. The clip, which was first broadcast on 6 March, appeared to show Brixton residents being interviewed at random during the Brixton Unite community event and asked for their views on police relations. It was deleted from the Channel 4 News website on Sunday after questions were raised over how representative the video could be when the majority of those interviewed were employed by youth marketing company Livity. Removed: The video was presented by Channel 4 News reporter Jordan Jarrett-Bryan, a former professional wheelchair basketball player who, it has been claimed, used to edit a youth magazine from the Livity office . Channel 4 News conducted the interview after it was revealed Scotland Yard had spied on the family of Stephen Lawrence after the teenager's murder in 1993. The plan was to speak with a number of local residents during the Brixton Unite community event - which was co-run by Lambeth council and the Metropolitan Police - about how their views on the police may have changed after the findings were made public. The report featured five interviews with apparently random members of the local community, all of whom were critical of relations between the public and the police. Only one of the four interviewees, youth development mentor Naomi Brown, was credited with having a connection with Livity, with the fifth person interviewed being Lee Jasper - the former chief race advisor to London Mayor Ken Livingstone. The video was presented by Channel 4 News reporter Jordan Jarrett-Bryan, a former professional wheelchair basketball player who was previously youth editor of the Livity-run publication Live Magazine. Taken down: The only person not employed by Livity in the clip was Lee Jasper - the former race advisor to London Mayor Ken Livingstone . Mr Jarrett-Bryan later defended his work on Twitter, arguing that the views he gathered were representative of local opinion. During the report, one of the Livity employees described how he had often been stopped and searched by police over the previous 15 years, while another said young people felt 'negative' towards officers. Two more spoke of a 'disconnect' and lack of trust between young people and police in Brixton. Concluding the report, Mr Jarrett-Bryan said: 'I found little hope of change here but a community still fighting for parity.' In a statement, Channel 4 said: ""This was a quick turnaround project, the journalist interviewed people who live, work or were born in Brixton â€“ who also worked for Livity. They all expressed their own individual view.' 'We accept we should have been clear they they all worked at the same place, we should have made further enquiries and we regret this oversight. The report was removed from the Channel 4 News website yesterday.' Conservative MP Rob Wilson condemned the broadcaster, saying: â€˜This is very disappointing from Channel 4 News. A distorted report could have been very unhelpful, indeed inflammatory, and I hope the people concerned have learnt an important lesson.â€™ . Livity, which describes itself as a youth-specialist communication agency, has previously worked with Channel 4 to promote gang drama Top Boy, and on The Stake - a Dragon's Den-inspired programme designed to encourage entrepreneurship among young people. A spokesperson for Livity told MailOnline: 'We feel only Channel 4 News can really comment on their own editorial policy, but from our perspective, it's pretty simple.' 'A reporter, who we know, contacted some people who work at Livity for their personal view on a topic, unrelated to the work of the company, but based on the fact they work or live in Brixton.' 'The news piece could and should have featured a broader spectrum of Brixton's community. However, we can confirm that Livity had no input on the commission, edit or influence of the piece.'","Local people were asked their views on public and police relations in Brixton .

A school pupil claims she was forced to work alone in a 'cupboard' after her mother sent her to school in the wrong shoes because she could not afford new ones. Charlotte Owen, a single parent of four on . benefits, claims she sent a note to school with her daughter Lauren, explaining she would be without the regulation shoes for a short time until . she was paid and could afford to buy a new pair. But Miss Owen said her daughter was put in 'isolation' - a room where children work in silence - for a . full day at the secondary school in Wrexham because she was wearing baseball boots. Isolation: Lauren Owen, 15, with her mother Charlotte. The girl was forced to work in a cupboard because she wore the wrong shoes for school . Then, when the 'isolation' room was full, she was forced to work alone in a storage cupboard for an hour, she said. Lauren said: 'The cupboard is about a metre by 1.5m and it’s got a little desk, a chair... and they had shelves.' Although she said the door was wide open, she said: 'I didn’t like it very much. It was very cramped and very lonely.' Miss Owen said she could not afford to replace the wrong shoes immediately because of cash flow issues. She said she was 'absolutely disgusted,' adding: 'You don’t put a child in a cupboard.' Miss Owen said she visited the school the following morning, saw the cupboard, and said the school was 'very apologetic'. Miss Owen, who is on benefits, claims she sent a note to her school - Ysgol Rhiwabon (pictured) in Wrexham - via her daughter, explaining the situation . However, . she said: 'The rules and regulations that they seem to have, they don’t . give much leeway at all, and I think it’s extremely unfair. 'Lauren’s . a good student. She’s in all the top sets. She attends school all the . time... and you’re doing this to her for a pair of shoes? What sort of . message is that going to send out?' She . added: 'Of course it’s not Lauren’s fault. Far from it. At the end of . the day they’re punishing children for something that’s totally out of . their hands.' In a . statement, the school said: 'This is a private matter between the school . and the parent and we feel we are unable to comment on individual . students. 'We are currently . awaiting a formal complaint from the parent, which if received, will be . dealt with in accordance with the school’s formal complaints’ procedure.' Miss Owen said her daughter was put in 'isolation' - a room where children work in silence - for a full day at the secondary school in Wrexham . Welsh Assembly Member Llyr Gruffydd said children should not be punished at school if families cannot afford the right clothes. The Welsh government said uniform policy was a matter for the school. Mr Gruffydd, Plaid Cymru AM for North Wales, has taken up the case of Charlotte Owen and her 15-year-old daughter Lauren, a pupil at Ysgol Rhiwabon in Wrexham. Mr Gruffydd said: 'There’s an issue here around basic human rights in terms of pupils finding themselves a victim for something that’s quite frankly beyond their control. 'There are genuine circumstances, at times, when they are not at fault.' Miss Owen said she visited the school the following morning, saw the cupboard, and said the school was 'very apologetic' He called for clarity 'about what guidance the Welsh government is giving education authorities about how to deal with situations - increasingly now of course - where families find it economically difficult maybe to meet some demands in terms of rules and school clothes etcetera and how they advise education authorities about how to deal with those situations. 'And then, obviously, how education authorities make sure that that’s reflected in the way that they operate.' Nobody from Wrexham council was available for comment. The Welsh government said in a statement: 'School uniform policy is ultimately a matter for the individual school and its governing body, but Welsh government guidance is clear that cost considerations should be a priority. 'No school uniform should be so expensive as to leave pupils or their families feeling unable to apply for admission or attend a particular school.'","Charlotte Owen claims she sent a note to school with her daughter Lauren .

The situation at Leeds United grows yet more toxic with managing director David Haigh severing contact with owners GFH Capital but staying at the helm at Elland Road. Troubled Leeds are in limbo while the Football League decide whether prospective buyer Massimo Cellino, who faces a fraud trial in Italy next week, passes their owners and directors test. So Haigh’s acrimonious split with the Dubai-based, Bahrain-owned GFH investment bank, who bought Leeds from Ken Bates in December 2012, will only add to the confusion around a club beaten 5-1 at home by Bolton on Saturday. Dejected: Leeds players including Luke Murphy (middle) look glum as they go down 5-1 at home to Bolton on Saturday . Waiting game: Italian Massimo Cellino is hoping to get Football League approval for a takeover of the Yorkshire club . Haigh has told friends he has been left high and dry by the GFH hierarchy while he has tried single-handedly to keep Leeds afloat by finding new loans and investors. This includes putting £1.5million into the club himself. The disintegration in relationships since GFH agreed a deal with Cagliari owner Cellino to take a 75 per cent stake has been quick. It was only five weeks ago that Haigh said: ‘I am grateful for the full and continuing support of GFH Capital.’ Still smiling: Leeds boss Brian McDermott has been forced to deal with a number of off-field issues this season . Steven Gerrard has revealed how he benefited from working with sports psychologist Steve Peters, who is going to Brazil with the England squad. And it will be a further bonus for manager Roy Hodgson that Liverpool believe Peters has contributed significantly to the prime form of Gerrard’s club and international colleagues Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling. .............................................................................................. Alan Myers' abrupt departure as Everton head of communications can now be explained with his arrival in the same role at Championship club Blackburn. Myers, who is understood to have found life difficult at Everton and did not enjoy personal attacks against him on Twitter, forged close links with Blackburn’s Indian owners Venky’s while working for Sky Sports. .............................................................................................. Nottingham Forest, neck and neck with Leeds to be the most dysfunctional club in the Championship, are understood to have parted company with head of recruitment Bobby Downes via voicemail. Downes found out he was leaving after listening to a message left by the financial department. As per usual, Forest’s ‘spokesman’ did not return calls. .............................................................................................. St George’s swerved . The FA’s St George’s Park training centre that cost £100m to build is only being occupied by the England team for four days during their three-week World Cup build-up. The FA say warm weather training in Portugal and Miami is crucial to Roy Hodgson’s plans meaning limited time at SGP in Staffordshire, especially as England travel to the Grove hotel near London the day before Wembley games. However, sensitivity around SGP usage by the England team can be gauged by the minutes of the last Club England board meeting, which stipulate the senior side will always spend time there in future international weeks. Staying away: Roy Hodgson's England squad, pictured here at St George's Park in October last year, will spend only four days at the national training centre in their three-week World Cup build-up . Peter Daire and Sean McAuliffe, two senior commercial executives who left the FA following re-structuring, have set up their own company Sport Collective to work across all commercial sports business. Their departure comes with the FA still a long way from finding a replacement for Budweiser, whose  £9m-a-year FA Cup sponsorship ends in May. BBC Sport, in their wisdom, believe Boat Race commentator Andrew Cotter’s radio experience will help him call the action for TV and audio audiences after the Beeb’s extraordinary ‘significant savings’ decision to use the TV feed for their radio coverage on April 5. Meanwhile, the Beeb’s feeble reasoning for interviewing journeymen footballers Robbie Savage and Joey Barton during the England v Wales 6 Nations game was that they would give a different take as professional sportsmen. Double use: The BBC's Andrew Cotter (right), pictured here interviewing European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley, will have his TV commentary of this year's Boat Race used for radio coverage too . FA Cup rules state that opposing teams must wear different coloured shorts, yet Hull City and Sunderland both wore black for their quarter-final.

"By . Sean Poulter . PUBLISHED: . 20:04 EST, 10 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:33 EST, 11 March 2014 . Advances: The new system will make it easier to move money around . Technology to allow direct payments between mobile phones was unveiled by the big banks yesterday. The system cuts out the need to remember sort codes and bank account details. Instead, you type on your phone the mobile number of the person or business you want to pay. The ‘Paym’ transfers, which will be password-protected, need your bank account to be linked to your own mobile number. Users will simply tap in the number of the recipient on their phone to authorise an electronic transfer from one account to another. The industry hopes the system will replace cheques, which are expensive to transport and process. At the same time it could provide a substitute for cash to make relatively small payments to tradesmen, window cleaners or gardeners. The idea is that millions of people will have their mobile phone number tied to their bank account – as a substitute for the normal account number and sort code. There is a security safeguard in that the name of the recipient will appear on the smartphone screen, once the number has been tapped in, so confirming the cash is going to the right person. Access to the Paym system will be covered by password or code protection in an attempt to avoid the risk of the phone being stolen and used to raid customers’ accounts. Paym has been devised by the finance industry’s Payments Council, which is the trade body responsible for running the electronic payments system on behalf of banks and building societies. The council’s chief executive, Adrian Kamellard, said: ‘We’re all used to the idea of a ‘mobile update’ to improve our apps - Paym is a mobile update for payments that means you can pay securely using just a mobile number. ‘Paym will make it easier to repay a friend for cinema tickets, split a restaurant bill or settle up for a colleague’s birthday collection.’ Changes: The system 'has the potential to link up every bank account in the country with a mobile number' He added: ‘Paym is a great example of industry-wide collaboration that delivers tangible benefits for customers. ‘The service has the potential to link up every bank account in the country with a mobile number. ‘Millions of people will be able to use it this year and we look forward to expanding Paym even further, so everyone can benefit from this easy, secure new way to pay.’ Paym will be integrated into customers’ existing mobile banking or payment apps as an additional way to pay, making it possible to send and receive payments using a mobile number. When it is launched in the spring, customers of nine bank and building society brands – Lloyds, HSBC, Barclays, Halifax, Santader, TSB, Bank of Scotland, Cumberland Building Society, and Danske Bank - will be able to use the new service. The nine launch brands will offer their customers the opportunity to register their mobile number and select the current account they want payments made into before the service goes live. This will immediately make the new system the most wide-ranging payment service capable of moving funds directly from account to account, without the need for sort codes or account numbers. Paym will expand later this year to include First Direct, NatWest, RBS, Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and Isle of Man Bank. The Nationwide building society is committed to joined in early 2015, while the Metro Bank and Ulster Bank are also finalising their participation.","New 'Paym' transfers were unveiled yesterday by major banks .

A mother who gave birth days after a rare nerve condition left her paralysed has made an incredible recovery. Kayla Bufton, 24, has now finally been able to pick up her daughter for the first time. She thought she had gone into early labour when she started feeling twinges in her back when she was 36 weeks pregnant. Kayla Bufton, 24, was paralysed just days before giving birth to baby Kelsey but she has now, a year on, made an amazing recovery and is able to hold her daughter with ease for the first time . But a week later, the mother-of-three was completely paralysed - unable to move her legs, arms, or facial muscles. Doctors believe she was struck down with Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare condition that affects the nervous system. Amazingly, she still managed to give birth to daughter Kelsey, despite not even being able to feel her own contractions. But after her daughter was born, Ms Bufton suffered a cardiac arrest and was put into an induced coma. Incredibly, after almost a year of gruelling rehab, the determined mother has taken her first steps and has finally been able to hold her daughter in her arms and give her a proper cuddle. And despite Ms Bufton still undergoing tests to determine her exact condition, she is now well on the road to recovery. Ms Bufton (pictured with Kelsey) started feeling twinges in her back when she was 36 weeks pregnant so she thought she was going into early labour but within a week she was unable to move her legs, arms or face . Ms Bufton (pictured with her partner, William, Kelsey, and their sons Kayden and McKauly) was diagnosed with suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome - a rare nerve condition which occurs when the immune system starts attacking the nervous system . Ms Bufton, from Blackburn, Lancashire, said: ‘I’m so grateful to be getting better and to have my family around me. ‘It feels amazing to be able to hold my little girl in my arms and do all the things I dreamed about while I was lying in hospital. ‘I was so scared when my body stopped working, and I couldn’t feel my baby kicking inside me any more. Guillain-Barre syndrome (pronounced Ghee-lan Bar-ray) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body's senses and movements. It affects about 1,500 people in the UK every year and is slightly more common in men than women. It causes the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) to attack these nerves, causing them to become inflamed. Symptoms include a tingly, numb sensation in the arms and legs which can result in a loss of feeling and movement. Most people who develop it have suffered from a viral or bacterial infection a few weeks before. Around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months, and do not have any further problems such as permanent nerve damage. ‘But it was the thought of holding her in my arms and playing with my two little boys that gave me the motivation I needed to keep going with my rehab, no matter how tough it got. ‘Doctors are still doing tests on me to establish exactly what happened, but I’m determined that whatever is wrong with me, I will beat it.’ Ms Bufton’s pregnancy had gone smoothly until she started getting tingling pains in her back at 36 weeks. This led her to believe she had gone into early labour, in April last year. But when the pain continued, she thought her baby was lying on a nerve. However, terrifyingly, she then lost the feeling in her legs and started tripping over. She said: ‘My left leg kept dropping, and I started tripping up, which I knew wasn’t normal, as I’d never had anything similar with my two other children, Kayden, two, and McKauly, six. ‘I was terrified about falling and hurting my baby, and my whole upper body was tingling and tight. ‘I couldn’t feel my arms properly, and I had no feeling in my belly. ‘My face dropped to one side, and I was rushed into hospital. The paramedics thought I had suffered a stroke and I was terrified. ‘At the hospital, the neurologist took one look at me and told me straight away he thought I had GBS. I had no idea what it was.’ Terrifyingly, as her condition spread, more muscles in Ms Bufton’s body became paralysed, and doctors at Preston Royal Infirmary were forced to attach her to a monitor as she wasn’t able to feel when she went into labour. She said: ‘I couldn’t even eat or drink, I just had to lie there. Ms Bufton had to give birth to Kelsey even though she could not feel her contractions and was unaware she had gone into labour until doctors told her. She is pictured with her son, Kayden . After Kelsey's birth, Ms Bufton suffered a cardiac arrest and had to be put in an induced coma . ‘A week after I’d gone into hospital I noticed my belly moving, and a team of doctors appeared round my bed. My contractions had begun and I couldn’t feel them. ‘When Kelsey was born, she was whisked away, and I started getting even worse. ‘I was taken to the intensive care unit, where I was intubated, and my lung collapsed. ‘Two days later, I suffered a cardiac arrest and was put into a coma for a week, but still couldn’t feel any part of my body when I came round.’ While Kelsey was allowed home with Ms Bufton’s partner, William, 24, she remained in intensive care. Ms Bufton was so ill that she was not able to see Kelsey again for another eight weeks . Ms Bufton (pictured with Kelsey and her partner, William) was so weak she was not even able to speak . It was eight weeks before she was stable enough for William and her mother, Carol, to bring Kelsey to see her. Ms Bufton said: ‘It was amazing. The nurses propped my bed up and surrounded me with cushions so they could lay Kelsey on my lap. ‘I couldn’t hold her like I wanted to, but I was so overwhelmed to finally meet my little girl. ‘I was worried my two boys would be scared to see me in hospital hooked up to machines and not able to speak to them, so I didn’t see them for nearly three months. It was heart-breaking. ‘I gradually regained some of my muscle use, and had to learn to speak all over again. It was so tough, but I was determined to be able to tell my kids I loved them. ‘Rehab was the most painful thing I have ever been through in my life, but I just knew I had to keep going for them. Ms Bufton had to have months of intensive rehabilitation while she learned to walk, talk and use her arms again. She said it was the thought of being able to hold and play with her children that got her through it . ‘I was desperate to be at home having night after night of broken sleep and changing nappies. ‘William would tell me how Kelsey had had a bad night’s sleep and in an weird way, I was jealous because I wanted to be the one at home comforting her and pacing the landing with her.’ After managing to regain feeling in her arms, Ms Bufton managed to stand up for the first time last August - five months after contracting the illness - and was moved to a rehab centre, where she had to relearn to use her upper body. She said: ‘Last week, I took my first couple of steps. It’s such a good feeling to know I’m slowly getting there. ‘But the best feeling was being able to hug my three children and their dad again. I thought I was going to burst with happiness. ‘I know I’ve still got a long way to go, but I’m determined to get there for my family. Ms Bufton said: 'I'm so grateful to be getting better and to have my family around me. It feels amazing to be able to hold my little girl in my arms and do all the things I dreamed about while I was lying in hospital' ‘I couldn’t have got where I am today without all the help and support of the staff at the Royal Preston Hospital and the Rakehead Rehab Centre in Burnley. They have been absolutely fantastic.’ A spokesperson for Guillain-Barré and Associated Inflammatory Neuropathies (GAIN) said: ‘Kayla was diagnosed in May 2013 initially with the acute disease Guillain-Barré syndrome, although medics are still carrying out further tests. ‘It affects around 1,200 to 1,500 people per year and is neither age or gender specific although slightly more common in the old and in men. ‘GBS is a clinical syndrome rather than a specific individual disease and is due to inflammation of the peripheral nerves which is probably caused because the immune cells start attacking the nerves in error instead of fighting the infection. Ms Bufton said: 'I couldn't have got where I am today without all the help and support of the staff at the Royal Preston Hospital and the Rakehead Rehab Centre in Burnley. They have been absolutely fantastic' Doctors are still trying to establish exactly what is wrong with Ms Bufton but she is making a good recovery. Image shows a scan of Kelsey six months into her mother's pregnancy . ‘It causes weakness and loss of sensation that usually recovers after a few weeks or months, although it is difficult to give exact timeframes the majority of people remain affected for between three and six months. ‘Kayla’s recovery is going well and she is receiving significant rehabilitation to help her in her recovery.’ The GAIN charity offers non-medical support and advice to those affected by the conditions.For more information, visit www.gaincharity.org.uk .","Kayla Bufton, 24, starting feeling pain in her back at 36 weeks pregnant .

Dottie Sandusky has spoken to the Today Show's Matt Lauer and though it will air in full on Wednesday, a teaser was released today. 'A friend had written to him and asked him what he missed, what did he take most for granted?' she said. Scroll down for video . Teary-eyed: Dottie Sandusky opens up about how prison has changed her husband, former assistant Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky . Behind bars: Sandusky, seen center in October, was found guilty on 45 of 48 counts of child abuse and will spend between 30 and 60 years behind bars- depending on how long he lives . 'He said family meals, the fun time with the grandkids playing ball, (and) doing special things with friends.' She broke down in tears in the middle of her sentence, pausing to compose herself before continuing. This will be the first time that Dottie has spoken on camera in support of her husband, but it is not the first time that she has made her defense of the former Penn State assistant football coach known. She testified in support of him during his trial, and she wrote a letter to an appeals judge on his behalf. Opening up: Dottie started to cry when she told how her husband of 46-years wrote to a friend saying that the things he missed most were his grandchildren and doing 'special things with friends' 'Jerry always put others before himself and always wanted to make each person feel special no matter who they were,' she wrote of her husband of 46-years according to NBC. 'Like all of us he has his faults, one is he cares so much for people always wanting them to reach their potential.' Jerry Sandusky was found guilty on 45 of 48 counts of child abuse. The 70-year-old former coach was sentenced to a minimum of at least 30 to 60 years behind bars, which the judge explained was set to insure that he will die in prison. He originally faced a maximum sentence of 442 years in prison. Support: Dottie stood by her husband and was at his side during his 2012 trial . The pages of graphic charging documents filed against Sandusky told how he preyed on young, underprivileged boys who he met through his charity, The Second Mile. His connections to the revered Penn State football program and their ensuing cover-up resulted in the firing of both legendary coach Joe Paterno and the head of the athletic program as well as the resignation of the university president. While Jerry Sandusky gave several unnerving and ill-advised interviews ahead of his trial, this is the first time that Dottie has spoken out to the media. She was mentioned at two memorable points in the trial, as two different victims told how she was allegedly within earshot when their respective abuse took place and chose not to stop it. One of the couple's six adopted children, Matt, was willing to testify for the state prosecutors about how he underwent seven years of abuse at the hands of his father. He spoke about the abuse, and whether or not his father's actions were an open secret in the football-loving community, in a documentary that premiered at Sundance Film Festival.","Jerry Sandusky's wife of 46-years has revealed that he did not list her among the things he misses most while behind bars .

Tiger Woods has taken refuge on board his yacht with his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn after a tough weekend on the golf course. Woods and Vonn were spotted boarding his boat, called Privacy, on Sunday night in Miami Beach after he played in the Cadillac Championship tournament. Vonn is no stranger to the yacht, and was spotted there before she officially announced that she was dating the professional golfer months after his infidelities were revealed. Getaway: Tiger Woods and Lindsey Vonn were seen taking a golf cart to his yacht Privacy on Sunday night in Miami . On board: Vonn, who couldn't participate in the Olympics because of her injured knee, is seen wearing a brace as she and Woods board his yacht . The yacht has been Woods' retreat of choice for years and he even spent his honeymoon with his ex wife Elin Nordegren on board. The $57million vessel was also reportedly her wedding gift, but it seems that she didn't get to keep it as part of the $100million divorce settlement she received after their 2010 split. His getaway with Vonn comes after she spent much of the weekend watching Woods play in both the Cadillac Classic and the Honda Classic before that. She was seen watching on the sidelines with Woods' 6-year-old daughter Sam. Turning in: Vonn and Woods are seen on the back of the golf cart as they were driven to the marina . Smiling: Woods inspects Vonn's injured leg as they share a light moment after his disappointing finish in the tournament . Keeping with its name: The couple is shielded by an umbrella at one point before boarding . Time off: The length of their boat stay is unknown but the yacht has been seen in Miami all week . 'Lindsey and Sam were seen laughing and joking around with one another,' an onlooker told E News. 'Lindsey and Sam at one point were holding hands and hugging. They were fooling around most of the time. They watched Tiger for three holes. They all seemed like a normal, happy family. They were all laughing and smiling, enjoying the day. 'Lindsey looked like she was having a great time and looked like a good mom, paying Sam lots of attention.' Settling in: Vonn and Woods were accompanied by a member of his entourage who was wearing a matching red shirt . Pricy: Woods bought the yacht for $57million as a wedding gift to his ex wife Elin in 2004 but it appears that he kept it in their 2010 divorce . Lindsey and Sam kept to the side but were luckier than two other onlookers. Woods accidentally hit two spectators with his golf ball on Sunday, leaving one of the men bleeding from the head. Cheerleader: Woods' daughter Sam was seen supporting her dad at the Honda Classic . Bonding time: Vonn cuddled up with Sam while they watched Tiger play and they seemed very comfortable . Woods went over and apologized to the men after each of the incidents, and gave them signed gloves in response. He ended the day with a six-over par 78, beating only two of the field's 68 players. When it came time to board the 155-foot yacht, Woods' children were nowhere to be seen. Ouch! The German tourist was enjoying the final round of the World Golf Championships at the Trump National in Doral, Florida, when the golfing legend's opening tee shot landed squarely on his head .","The couple was seen boarding his 155-foot yacht Sunday night in Miami .

A new app claims to be able to track the affect caffeine is having on your body. It can tell you exactly how much another cup will impact your sleep, and when to lay off the coffee or soft drinks. Jawbone's UP Coffee app can tell users when to lay off the caffeine . Developed by Jawbone Labs, a forum for Jawbone employees to explore and expand upon their ideas and prototypes, the standalone application helps you understand more about your caffeine choices by correlating caffeine intake and projected sleep time. Simply log a coffee, tea, energy drink or other caffeinated beverage in the UP Coffee app to see a visual display of where you fall on a spectrum from 'Wired' to 'Sleep Ready' at any given time. When linked with data from your UP or UP24 band, UP Coffee analyzes how your caffeine intake affects your sleep patterns. After tracking both caffeine intake and sleep for 10 days, UP Coffee can tell you things like the amount of sleep you lose on average for every 100mg of caffeine you ingest. The app can track caffeine intake over time and build personalised reports for users - telling them exactly how much another cup will affect their sleep . 'With billions of people around the world enjoying coffee, tea and other caffeinated drinks each day, the UP Coffee app delivers daily insights with new information on caffeine that’s relevant to you,' the firm says. It can tell you how much caffeine is in a cup of decaf coffee – nearly half as much as a can of caffeinated soda – and that drinking three to six cups of coffee per day may provide similar hydrating qualities as water.To coincide with National Sleep Week, Jawbone also revealed new data highlighting the links between UP wearers’ sleep and feelings of wellbeing. Jawbone also analyzed the data of more than 1,600 UP wearers and more than 5,000 nights of sleep to verify the relationship between our sleep and how we feel the next day. On average, members of the UP community who got at least seven hours of sleep were 30% more likely to report feeling rested the next day. Those UP wearers were also significantly more likely to report feeling optimistic, patient, focused, productive, and attractive the next day. In addition, the study found that Sound sleep – the moments of sleep when your body is particularly still – had a greater impact above and beyond total time spent sleeping. The study also revealed fascinating insights into the causes of sleeplessness, with a quarter of UP wearers in the study reporting difficulty falling asleep. Of those, nearly half attribute their sleep issues to stress, 20% to room temperature, and 18% to simply not feeling tired. Only 3% of those who reported difficulty falling asleep attribute their sleep issues to noisiness or to children. The data from Jawbone also showed the affects of lifestyle habits and gadgetry on our sleep, in particular Sound sleep. UP wearers who reported having a laptop in their bedroom logged 37 minutes less sound sleep per night on average, and UP wearers who slept with a mobile phone had 13 minutes less sound sleep on average. 'We're investing heavily in data, and as a result, we're learning a tremendous amount about behavior change and how to help people achieve their goals,' said Travis Bogard, vice president of product management and strategy at Jawbone. 'In a recent test with our Today I Will feature, we saw that those who were sent and opted into the commitment logged 23 more minutes of sleep than average and were 72% more likely to go to bed early enough to hit their sleep goal. 'By leveraging these insights within the UP system, we're beginning to help people achieve real change. 'Our latest data shows a strong connection between how much we sleep and how we feel the next day, and these are exactly the kinds of correlations that can be powerful motivators to people on a daily basis.'","Jawbone apps works with or without the firm's wristband .

American journalist Matthew Power has died in Uganda while working on an assignment for a men's magazine. The 39-year-old had been accompanying a British explorer who was trekking along the Nile, for a feature in Men's Journal, when he suddenly became ill and died on Monday. Power, who was spending the week walking with explorer Levinson Wood, is believed to have died from heat stroke and exhaustion. Inspiration: Journalist Matthew Power, who combined his love of adventure and writing, has died on assignment in Uganda . The New York-based travel writer, who regularly worked for Outside, GQ, Men's Journal and other publications, died a few hours after losing consciousness on Monday. The team he was with believe the death was caused by heat stroke, but the results of an autopsy have not yet been released. Temperatures in the area he was in had reached 88F this week. Wood, the British explorer currently on a year-long attempt to become the first person to walk the length of the Nile, said he was 'shocked and saddened' by the sudden death. The expedition had recently reached Murchinson Falls National Park, in what Wood had described on his Facebook page as a 'real test of endurance'. In a tribute to Power, Men's Journal described him as: 'A true adventurer and a principled, ethical journalist who never failed to put the accuracy of the story and the fairness in his depiction of a person, place, or situation above what worked for him as a writer'. Adventure: Matthew Power, pictured in catacombs below Paris, was writing a feature about a man walking the length of the Nile, when he died . Power, who grew up in Vermont, had always wanted to be a writer. He started a course at Columbia University, but gave it up to do an internship at Harper's and has never looked back. 'I wanted to live my life, rather than the life that I figured the world expected of me, and thus far itâ€™s worked,' he told the Brooklyn Paper in 2006. His friend and fellow writer Tom Bissell paid tribute to the adventurous reporter, whose work had included everything from a 5,000 mile motorbike trek through the Andes to detailing the dangers of conservationists. 'I suspect there was no place Matt wouldnâ€™t go, no kind of person he wouldnâ€™t want to meet,' Bissell wrote in a tribute on Long Read. 'Through his talent and bravery, he took . me and his thousands upon thousands of devoted readers around the . world, to some of its loveliest, and most luckless, places.' Shock: Levison Wood and the Walking the Nile team Power had been interviewing expressed their sadness at his death . Respect: Friends and fellow writers, including Seth Mnookin and David Grann, paid tribute to Power . In one of his last pieces, published in Outside, Power had traveled to Costa Rica to investigate the killing of Jairo Mora Sandoval, a 26-year-old conservationist murdered by poachers as he tried to protect leatherback turtles. The magazine later paid tribute to him, saying: 'Matt approached the story in his usual fashion: he heard the news and jumped on a plane.' As news of his unexpected death spread, friends and former colleagues tweeted favorite articles Power and written, and expressed sympathy to his wife, Jessica, and family. Harper's Magazine, where he had begun his writing career, tweeted: 'RIP Matthew Power: a former intern, a contributing editor, and one of our favorite human beings.' Writer Andy Kroll tweeted: 'Crushed to hear that @matthew_power has died. Loved his work. A talented guy who encouraged us up-and-comers.' Others remembered Power for his passion and dedication for journalism, and said he had been an inspiration and a mentor to many young journalists.","New York-based writer believed to have died from heat stroke .

A divorce lawyer from Seattle has been accused of bilking one of her clients out of more than $100,000 and is now facing felony theft charges. King County prosecutors claim Dana K. Fossedal made off with money that was awarded to her bus driver client, as part of a settlement. According to court papers, Mrs Fossedal, 41, raided a trust account that held the man's money and used it to pay personal expenses. Dana K. Fossedal, 41: She is a divorce attorney accused of making off with more than $100,000 owed to one of her clients. Fossedal now faces felony theft charges after raiding the account where the cash was being held . After being hired by Fossedal, the man was awarded $117,000 as part of the settlement. However, instead of receiving the money directly, though, the settlement payment ended up in a trust account held by Fossedal. Although Fossedal's bill for representing the man was less than $10,000, she cleaned out the entire account. According to Seattle PI, she is alleged to have done so without ever acknowledging the settlement had been paid. Steven Nels Fossedal: After Dana Fossedal's client sued her and and won a $162,000 judgment, only a small amount of that debt has been paid with the court seizing her husbands (pictured) pay as part of the settlement .

Fossedal even purports to be a great navigator during times of crisis on her website. ' I have a great deal of skill helping to guide my clients through these . confusing and overwhelming times with knowledgeable advice and . representation, coupled with respect, understanding, and compassion.

Another . client who used her to facilitate their divorce is even more damning in . their judgement saying that calls at emails were not returned.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 12:00 EST, 11 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:58 EST, 11 March 2014 . One of 13 University of Iowa football players who ended up in hospital after a high-intensity workout says his injuries were preventable but have caused lasting harm. Former Hawkeyes cornerback William Lowe, of Cleveland, alleges in a lawsuit filed that coaches and trainers failed to properly supervise him during the workout three years ago. He also says the school failed to offer medical care after he and others initially reported severe pain and symptoms, and that his injuries were aggravated because he was required to participate in additional workouts in the following days. Lawsuit: A former Iowa football player is suing the university for after an incident in 2011 that left him hospitalized after a high intensity workout . Pain: Former University of Iowa football player William Lowe has filed a lawsuit against the state stemming from an offseason workout in January 2011 that hospitalized 13 players with rhabdomyolysis . Lowe contends that the team was negligent in 'developing and implementing a dangerous improper training program' and should have to pay unspecified damages for his pain and suffering. Spokesmen for the athletics department and the university declined to comment about the lawsuit Tuesday. Lowe and 12 others were hospitalized following the workout at the start of winter training. They were diagnosed with exertional rhabdomyolysis, the result of muscles breaking down and releasing proteins into the bloodstream, which can cause kidney failure. The workout was only held about once every three years as a test of physical stamina, mental toughness and to see who 'wanted to be on the team,' according to an investigative committee report commissioned by the school. The most grueling part were the 100 back squats players were asked to do at 50 percent of their most recent personal best. A study by University of Iowa doctors published last year concluded that those back squats were 'significantly associated' with an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis â€” with the affected players more likely to think they could complete the untimed workout despite muscle failure. Lowe alleges in his lawsuit that he and others reported 'substantial leg pain and stiffness as well as abnormally dark urine' after that workout and fatigue that was atypical. Despite such reports, Lowe says he and the others were required to participate in a mandatory intensive workout the next day focusing on their upper body muscles. After taking the weekend off, players had another mandatory workout Jan. 24. Within hours, Lowe and others started showing up at the hospital and were diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. Lowe says he was released from the hospital Feb. 2, but he still suffered from weight loss, pain in his lower back and legs, headaches and high blood pressure over the next several months. The 24-year-old says he suffered mental and physical pain and anguish that has required ongoing expenses for medical care, therapy, drugs and other treatment. Claim: Lowe is seeking financial compensation for continued mental and physical pain, loss of earning capacity, loss of enjoyment of life and potential future medical expenses . Not alone: Lowe was one of 13 players hospitalized after a workout in 2011. He claims in a suit filed in Johnson County that the UIÂ¿s negligence caused him physical and mental harm . Lowe's injuries could have been avoided 'through safe and proper athletic training and supervision,' the lawsuit reads. The incident caused a public relations nightmare for coach Kirk Ferentz and prompted the university to form the investigative committee. It made 10 recommendations, most notably that the team should scrap that particular workout and develop mechanisms to better identify players who are suffering health complications during workouts and practices. The committee cleared the players, trainers and coaches of wrongdoing, determining that the injuries were unintentional and not the fault of those who designed the workout. Ferentz said in March 2011 at the start of spring practice that that all 13 players had been medically cleared to return. But Lowe, who played sparingly in three seasons at Iowa, never rejoined the team.

"By . Fiona Macrae . PUBLISHED: . 19:44 EST, 6 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 03:42 EST, 7 March 2014 . Scientists have developed a breath test to check for breast cancer. Research shows the kit is at least as accurate as breast X-rays routinely used in hospitals. It takes less than ten minutes to detect the disease and its makers say it may reduce the need for uncomfortable mammograms. By taking the embarrassment out of the procedure, it could also lead to more woman coming forward for testing, saving lives. Breakthrough: Scientists have developed a breath test for breast cancer (file picture) It would also mean that women aren’t exposed to radiation during testing. Breast cancer is Britain’s most common cancer, with almost 50,000 women diagnosed a year. It is the second biggest cancer killer among women after lung cancer, claiming almost 1,000 lives a month. However, the number of women who have three-yearly mammograms is falling, amid concerns that the breast X-rays cannot distinguish dangerous cancers from ones that grow too slowly to ever cause harm. The BreathLink kit is being developed by a US firm and is already on sale in Europe. It begins with a woman breathing for two minutes into a breathalyser. The air is fed into a machine which analyses the levels of chemicals. The results are crunched by a computer, which determines whether the chemical pattern is a sign of breast cancer. Research published in the journal PLoS ONE shows it to be at least as accurate as mammograms. Michael Phillips, a professor of medicine at New York Medical College, and the brains behind the breath test, said: ‘We know that if you get a negative result on the breast test, there is a better than 99.9 per cent chance that a woman doesn’t have breast cancer. Makers of the new test say it may reduce the need for uncomfortable mammograms . ‘That is the key thing, because in any screening programme, the overwhelming majority of women who come in off the street do not have breast cancer. ‘Eventually, the physician and the woman might decide that she doesn’t need to go on to have a mammogram.’ This means, the vast majority of women may not need to undergo the trauma of a mammogram. The accuracy for actually spotting the disease is lower and so women who have a positive breath test will still need a mammogram. The test, which is being developed by Dr Phillips’ firm Menssana Research, is already on sale in Europe. However, Dr Phillips stresses that bigger studies are needed before it becomes the first choice for breast cancer screening. He added: ‘I am optimistic that in years to come, people will start to look at a breath tests as a global test. ‘Something that can be used to screen for many different diseases – different cancers and different infections. ‘Eventually, breath testing will become as mainstream as blood tests and urine tests.’ British experts described the research as exciting but early days. Martin Ledwick, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘This is a small pilot study for an interesting idea. ‘But much more research is needed before we know if this test could be considered safe alongside breast screening. ‘Women should get to know their bodies, and if they notice any unusual changes they should have it checked out by their doctor.’","BreathLink is being developed by US firm and is already on sale in Europe .

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 11:03 EST, 6 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:11 EST, 6 March 2014 . A doctor who left a glove inside a patient has admitted she was using a surgical technique she learned by watching a DVD. An investigation was carried out by the Royal Derby Hospital after Sharon Birks found the glove inside her body three days after surgery to remove her womb. It emerged a member of the team involved in the operation decided to use the glove as part of the surgical procedure. Sharon Birks, 42, had a hysterectomy at the Royal Derby Hospital and three days later, when she went to the toilet, she discovered a surgical glove had been left inside her body . But the female registrar had only learned about the technique on a course she attended in India weeks earlier and from watching a DVD which had discussed it, a report said. The use of the latex surgical glove, which was supposed to have been removed before the end of the operation, was not an ‘accepted technique’ at the Royal Derby or one used routinely in the UK. And the report said the registrar, who has not been named, did not tell anyone else in the operating theatre what she had done, which meant the glove was not taken out. A horrified Mrs Birks, 42, later discovered the glove when she went to the toilet. Now, the mother-of-six, from Wirksworth, Derbyshire, is taking legal advice after seeing the investigation report compiled by the hospital trust. Mrs Birks said: ‘Reading the report was horrible because I can’t believe the registrar was able to do something like this and no-one knew. ‘It’s so hard to understand how this . could have happened. At first, I was just numb about the whole thing but . it made me very angry.’ Mrs Birks, a learning disability support worker, was admitted to the hospital last November for a hysterectomy. A registrar has now admitted she put the glove inside Mrs Birk while practicing a surgical technique she had learned from a DVD . The report said that during the surgery the surgeon leading the operation said his view inside her body was impaired because the air pumped inside her abdominal cavity had been lost. The report said the registrar decided to request clean gloves and insert one of them into her body. It said: ‘As part of the investigation, the registrar informed us that she had attended a training course in November 2013 at the World Laparoscopy Hospital, in Guragon, Delhi, and had used an online training DVD, both of which had discussed the use of the glove to maintain pneumoperitoneum – [gas or air in the abdominal cavity].’ It added: ‘[The glove was inserted] with no communication to any of the theatre team. However, the technique did work for this lady and pnuemoperitoneum was achieved.’ The report said telling colleagues when items had been inserted into the body was ‘part of basic theatre practice’ and if the registrar had told a colleague about the glove, it would have been ‘accounted for at the end of surgery’. It said: ‘The registrar recognises that she made a mistake with good intention and, through this, she has learned the importance of good communication.’ The investigation also found a letter put together for Mrs Birks’ GP after her surgery said she had undergone a ‘straightforward procedure’ with ‘no problems at discharge’. It said this letter had been dictated by a junior doctor not involved in Mrs Birks’ care and a further letter with full details was sent to the GP two weeks later.

But a spokeswoman for the trust said: ‘We are extremely sorry for the distress that was caused to Mrs Birks. ‘Clearly, this should not have happened and, as soon as managers were made aware, we launched a detailed investigation. ‘The findings of this investigation have been shared with Mrs Birks and her husband, who have had a meeting with the chief executive and senior medical and nursing executives. The hospital has apologised to Mrs Birk and her family and has carried out a full investigation (file picture) ‘Mrs Birks was given an opportunity to ask questions and she was given a full explanation and a further apology. ‘This is a confidential report which has been shared with Mrs Birks. We are not able to go into further detail. ‘At every stage, we have been frank and honest with Mrs Birks and we have repeated our unreserved apologies for the human error which led to this distressing and unpleasant experience. ‘We take patient safety extremely seriously and we have put measures in place to ensure that lessons are learned from this very unfortunate, but thankfully unique, incident.’","Sharon Birks, 42, had a hysterectomy at the Royal Derby Hospital .

The British Heart Foundation is urging men to encourage their wives and girlfriends to improve their lifestyles in a bid to cut the number of deaths from heart disease . Most men avoid the topic of their wife’s weight at all costs. But now, they are being urged to talk to the women in their lives about their unhealthy habits and waistlines. It is hoped this will reduce the number of women dying from heart disease. The British Heart Foundation (BHF) said too few women are aware that it is the biggest killer of women and more needs to be done to raise awareness that it is not just a man's disease. Heart and circulatory disease kills more than 80,000 women in the UK each year and 17.3 million women worldwide. In the UK, 3.5 million women are living with some form of heart or circulatory problem. The warning has been issued to mark International Women's Day today. Maureen Talbot, senior cardiac nurse at the BHF, said: ‘Too few women realise that heart and circulatory disease is their biggest killer. ‘I hope people will use International Women's Day as their prompt to have a straightforward conversation with the woman they love about her heart health. ‘Ignorance is fuelling women's heart risk. So while our ask is simple, the impact really could save lives. ‘On a day when women are thinking and talking about how to improve their lives, we also want them to include one, potentially life-saving, conversation with another woman they love about how they look after their heart. ‘Sadly, most women are oblivious to the fact that heart problems are the biggest killer of women in the UK. ‘If more women knew they were at risk, they could do something about it, whether that's losing a bit of weight, quitting smoking or just taking the dog out for longer walks.’ Heart disease kills about one in five men and one in eight women in the UK. Shaping up: The charity is worried that too many women see heart disease as a man's disease even though it is the UK's biggest killer of women . The condition causes chest pain, heart attacks and heart failure. It occurs when the heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances in the arteries. This can be caused by smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. The best prevention methods are healthy eating, being physically active, giving up smoking, and controlling sugar levels.","The British Heart Foundation wants to raise awareness of heart disease .

The mystery surrounding a whale graveyard found beside the Pan-American Highway in Chile has finally been solved. Scientists believe the remarkable fossil site, dating from between six and nine million years, is the first example of repeated mass strandings of marine creatures. Hidden in Atacama Desert for millions of years, the fossils came from four separate whale strandings, suggesting they were killed by a similar cause: toxic algae. Scroll down for video... Pictured is a graveyard of whales found beside the Pan-American Highway in Chile. Scientists now think they can explain how so many of the animals came to be preserved in one location millions of years ago . The find, made in 2010, has been described as the most extraordinary marine mammal fossil site on the planet. It included the remains of 10 kinds of marine vertebrates from the site, named Cerro Ballena which is Spanish for ‘whale hill.’ In addition to the skeletons of more than 40 baleen whales, the team found the remains of a species of sperm whale and a walrus-like whale, both of which are now extinct.  They also found skeletons of billfishes, seals and aquatic sloths. The team of Chilean and Smithsonian paleontologists made 3D digital models of the skeletal remains on sites and then removed the bones for further study in the lab. The skeletons are well preserved at four distinct levels. Most of the creatures were belly-up, suggesting death at sea or shortly after washing ashore . Researchers only had two weeks to analyse the fossils as the site was soon to be covered by the Pan-American Highway. A major solution came in the form of 3D technology. Professor Pyenson brought a team of Smithsonian 3D imaging experts to Chile, who spent a week scanning the entire dig site. Although all the fossils found from 2010 to 2013 have been moved to museums in the Chilean cities of Caldera and Santiago, the Smithsonian has archived the digital data, including the 3D scans, here. Anyone can download or interact with 3D models of the fossil whale skeletons, scan Google Earth maps of the excavation quarries, look at a vast collection of high-resolution field photos and videos or take 360-degree tours of the site. The enormous wealth of fossils that the team examined represents only a fraction of the potential at Cerro Ballena, which remains unexcavated. The scientists believe that the entire area preserves several hundred fossil marine mammal skeletons, awaiting discovery. What intrigued them most was how the skeletons were arranged and the fact that they were nearly all complete. Many had come to rest facing in the same direction and upside down, suggesting that they died from the same cause. The four different fossils levels indicated it was not one episode but four separate events that took place over a period of several thousand years. Scientists believe these animals were all poisoned by the toxins that can be created in some algal blooms. This is the main cause for repeated mass strandings in today's marine animals. ‘There are a few compelling modern examples that provide excellent analogues for the patterns we observed at Cerro Ballena, said  Nicholas Pyenson, paleontologist at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History and lead author of the research. ‘In particular, one case from the late 1980s when more than a dozen humpback whales washed ashore near Cape Cod, with no signs of trauma, but sickened by mackerel loaded with toxins from red tides.’ ‘Harmful algal blooms in the modern world can strike a variety of marine mammals and large predatory fish. The key for us was its repetitive nature at Cerro Ballena: no other plausible explanation in the modern world would be recurring, except for toxic algae, which can recur if the conditions are right.’ Paleontologists estimate that the skeletons are between 6 million and 9 million years old. Scientists think the mass strandings occurred over a period of more than 10,000 years . Algal blooms are common along the coasts of continents. They are fed by vital nutrients, such as iron, released during erosion and carried by rivers flowing into the ocean. Because the Andes of South America are iron-rich, the runoff that has occurred along the west coast of South America for more than 20 million years has long provided the ideal conditions for harmful algal blooms to form. From their research, the scientists believe that toxins generated by harmful algal blooms poisoned the creatures near Cerro Ballena five–11 million years ago, causing relatively rapid death at sea. Their carcasses then floated toward the coast, where they were washed into a tidal flat by waves. In this image, the whale fossils undergo 3D surface scanning in order to create a digital record of the arrangement of the skeletons . The fossils were uncovered in the Atacama Desert, next to the Pan-American Highway in Chile . Once stranded on the tidal flat, the dead or dying animals were protected from marine scavengers, and there were no large-land scavengers in South America at this time. ‘Cerro Ballena is the densest site for individual fossil whales and other extinct marine mammals in entire world, putting it on par with the La Brea Tar Pits or Dinosaur National Monument in the U.S.,’ Professor Pyenson said. ‘The site preserves marine predators that are familiar to modern eyes, like large whales and seals. 'However, it also preserves extinct and bizarre marine mammals, including walrus-like whales and aquatic sloths. ‘In this way, the site is an amazing and rare snapshot of ancient marine ecosystems along the coast of South America.’ Chilean and Smithsonian paleontologists are pictured studying several fossilized whale skeletons at Cerro Ballena, also known as 'Whale Hill'","Fossils found in Atacama Desert next to Chile's Pan-American Highway .

Scientists have modified genes in the blood cells of HIV patients to help them resist the AIDS virus. The American researchers say the treatment seems both safe and promising. The results give hope that this approach might one day free patients from their grueling daily drug regime. Scientists have found a way of modifying genes in the blood cells of HIV patients to help them resist the AIDS virus. Image shows HIV in human lymphatic tissue . As a result, the researchers say it could offer a form of cure. The news comes just the day after doctors in Boston announced they hope they have cured a baby born with HIV. The baby girl, who was born in Los Angeles last year, is the second to have been put into remission - and possibly cured - by very early treatment. She was treated four hours after her birth and, now, shows no signs of being infected. The girl's doctors say they are cautious about claiming she is cured but say they hope this is the case. The idea for the gene modification treatment came from an AIDS patient who appears to be cured after receiving a cell transplant seven years ago in Berlin. The treatment could free patients from a daily regime of taking antiretroviral drugs . The transplant came from a donor with natural immunity to HIV. Only about one per cent of people have two copies of the gene that gives this protection. So, researchers are seeking a more practical way to get similar results by using gene therapy to modify patients' own blood cells. A study of this in 12 patients was led by Dr Carl June at the University of Pennsylvania. HIV usually infects blood cells through a protein on their surface - a 'docking station' called CCR5. A Californian company, Sangamo BioSciences Inc., makes a treatment that can knock out a gene that makes CCR5. The 12 HIV patients involved in the study had their blood filtered to remove some of their cells. The Sangamo BioSciences Inc. gene-snipping compound was added in the lab, and the cells were infused back into the patients. Four weeks later, half of the patients were temporarily taken off AIDS medicines to see the gene therapy's effect. The virus returned in all but one of them, but the modified cells seemed to be protected from HIV infection and were more likely to survive than the cells that had not been treated. 'We knew that the virus was going to come back in most of the patients, but the hope is that the modified cells eventually will outnumber the rest and give the patient a way to control viral levels without medicines,' said Dr Pablo Tebas, one of the Penn researchers. That would be what doctors call a 'functional cure', because the virus would still be present but held in check without treatment. The lone patient whose HIV did not return turned out to have one copy of the protective gene, so 'nature had done half of the job already,' Dr Tebas said. Experts say the treatment could offer a 'functional cure' as HIV would still be present in the patient but no further treatment would be required to keep it under control . The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases sponsored the work with Sangamo and Penn. 'The ultimate goal is to create an immune system in the body that's been edited genetically so the cells are not capable of being infected with HIV,' said institute director Dr. Anthony Fauci. 'But we are a long way from there at this point.' Jay Johnson, 53, who works for Action AIDS, an advocacy and service organisation in Philadelphia, had the treatment more than three years ago during an earlier study. Although the virus rebounded when he temporarily went off HIV medicines, tests show his modified blood cells are still multiplying. 'Hopefully one day I'll be able to say I'm HIV negative again,' he said.","Scientists modified genes in cells of patients to help them resist the virus .

Soaring numbers of patients in England are carrying bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics, hospitals are reporting. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases of a strain of gut bacteria that can destroy antibiotics has risen from just five in 2006, to more than 600 in 2013. Health officials have said that the increase in cases has shown the ‘urgent need’ for hospitals to implement plans and procedures to stem the spread of antibiotic resistance. Public Health England (PHE) has launched a new toolkit for hospitals to help them control antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). This is the name given to some strains of gut bacteria that can be resistant to carbapenem antibiotics. Carbapenems are considered to be ‘last resort’ antibiotics which medics use to treat difficult infections when other antibiotics would or have failed, PHE said. While infections caused by CPE can still be treated with other antibiotics, treatment may be more difficult, a spokesman said. He added that in the last decade there has been a ‘sustained’ increase in the number of CPE cases. About two thirds of trusts in England have had between one and 20 patients identified with CPE carriage or infection over the past five years. This includes two trusts in Manchester that have had more than 100 patients identified with CPE. PHE’s medical director Dr Paul Cosford said: ‘In order to minimise the wide spread of these multi-drug resistant infections across England it is essential that all trusts are aware of this toolkit. 'They must also develop plans for detecting and managing patients with infections caused by CPE and other antibiotic-resistant bacteria. ‘These infections are already causing national concern due to the observed increasing trends in the number of infections, outbreaks and clusters across England. ‘We now have a window of opportunity, if we act quickly and decisively, to address this very real public health threat and prevent widespread problems by minimising the negative impact of these organisms.’ In England in 2006 there were five cases of a gut bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics. Last year there were more than 600 cases of the same bacterial infection . England’s chief medical officer Professor Dame Sally Davies said: ‘Antibiotic resistance poses a real threat to our ability to treat diseases. ‘Although there has been an increase in this strain of bacteria, the new toolkit will ensure that hospitals are well placed to detect, manage and control any cases. Systems of monitoring for resistant bacteria are essential in safeguarding the effect of our antibiotics.’ Health experts have previously warned of the ‘catastrophic threat’ of people becoming resistant to antibiotics, saying that in just 20 years’ time routine operations could become deadly if we lose the ability to fight infection. Last year, Dame Sally said that resistance to antibiotics is one of the greatest threats to modern health. She said many of the drugs are being used unnecessarily for mild infections or illnesses which should not be treated with antibiotics - helping to create resistance.","Number of cases of a gut bacteria that can destroy antibiotics has soared .

Study of excavations at the LaCotte de St Brelade site (pictured) has cleared Neanderthals of calculated murders . Did Neanderthal hunters drive mammoth herds over cliffs in brutal mass killings? It’s a question that has been puzzling archaeologists since the 1960s following the discovery of heaped mammoth bones in Jersey. But a new study of excavations at the La Cotte de St Brelade site now appears to have cleared Neanderthals of these calculated murders or mass hunts. Researchers at the British Museum have found that the land that ends at the cliff edge was so rocky that mammoths would never have gone up there, according to a report in the Guardian. Successfully driving animals over the cliff would first require that they be present upon an elevated, rocky plateau,’ the researchers write in the journal Antiquity. ‘If such a herd was present, driving them over the cliff would then require forcing them over these natural barriers and up onto a fairly restricted space on the headland. Pictured is a simplified geological map of Jersey, showing the position of the main sites studied. The land, now under water, would have been an ideal vantage point for Neanderthal hunters as it included ravines, gullies and valleys . Heaps of mammoth bones found piled up at the foot of a cliff were initially thought to be the results of Neanderthals driving the creatures over the edge . ‘This landscape would divide a herd and actively direct them away from the supposed death trap.’ The site was home to Neanderthals for around 200,000 years, but it is thought it was abandoned at time when the climate cooled, forcing Neanderthals into warmer areas. To recreate the landscape that the Neanderthals lived, researchers looked at a survey of the seabed that stretches away from the cliff. The land, now under water, would have been an ideal vantage point for Neanderthal hunters as it included ravines, gullies and valleys. Even if the creatures had clambered so high, the Neanderthals would have had to move them through a dip at Jersey's La Cotte de St Brelade site. The dip is in the top image. The bottom image shows the site as it is today . Jersey is believed to be one of the last places the Neanderthals lived after teeth were discovered on its Cotte de St Brelade cave in 1910 . ‘It offered Neanderthals a landscape in which large mammals could be both effectively controlled and ambushed,’ the researchers write. Older sediments at the site have large amounts of burnt bone and charcoal, suggesting that the bones collected and used as fuel. The research team believes the Neanderthals could also have carried the bones there after hunts and used them for building shelters and food. Jersey is believed to be one of the last places the Neanderthals lived after teeth were discovered on its Cotte de St Brelade cave in 1910. The cave has so far produced more Neanderthal stone tools than the rest of the British Isles put together. Findings bring the collections of stone tools, animal bone and Neanderthal remains under renewed study . Evidence has been uncovered that Jersey may have been home to one of the last Neanderthals. British archaeologists have now found that a large portion of Cotte de St Brelade contains sediment dating to the last Ice Age, preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence. ‘In terms of the volume of sediment, archaeological richness and depth of time, there is nothing else like it known in the British Isles,’ said Dr Matt Pope of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, who helped lead the research. ‘Given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers, finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site.’ The team dated sediments at the site using a technique called Optically Stimulated Luminesce, which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight. The results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old, indicating that Neanderthal teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought. According to the researchers, they probably belonged to one of the last Neanderthals to live in the region. ‘The discovery that these deposits still exist and can be related to previously excavated deposits opens up a range of exciting possibilities,’ said Dr Martin Bates, University of Trinity St Davids, who is leading current fieldwork at the site.","The land was so rocky that mammoths would never have reached cliff top .

Climate change will cause ‘irreversible damage’ to the Great Barrier Reef by 2030 unless immediate action is taken, marine scientists have warned. Australia’s iconic heritage site is at a turning point, and coral will be destroyed ‘for hundreds if not thousands of years’ by hikes in carbon dioxide and the average global temperature, states a report published today. Experts are calling for an ‘increase in commitment’ to lower carbon emissions to help protect the reef, which has already lost about half its coral coverage since the 1980s, with climate change fast becoming its main threat. At risk: Scientists are warning that the Great Barrier Reef will be 'irreversibly damaged' by 2030 . Unless the average global temperature is kept below the internationally agreed limit of 2C warming on pre-industrial levels, ‘it is highly unlikely that coral reefs will survive’, according to University of Queensland reef researcher Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, co-author of the Lights Out For the Reef report. He said current climate trends and a 'business as usual' temperature increase of 4C would mean ‘game over’ for the Great Barrier Reef. ‘Even under the best-case scenario of 2C, corals disappear,’ Hoegh-Guldberg told Guardian Australia. ‘But with business as usual, it’s game over. You look in the tank and the corals have died, bacteria have taken over, the sand has dissolved. ‘It’s a very, very poor place. If you were to replicate that on the Great Barrier Reef, it would hardly be worthy of the word “great”. It simply won’t be a coral reef.’ And he called coral bleaching, which . occurs when sea water temperatures becomes too warm and results in coral . dying faster – a process unknown on the Great Barrier Reef before 1979 – . a ‘serious threat’. Dead coral: Rising sea water temperatures cause coral to bleach and die faster . ‘If we . don't increase our commitment to solve the burgeoning stress from local . and global sources, the reef will disappear,’ he wrote in the foreword . to the report, compiled by WWF as part of its Earth Hour campaign. ‘This is not a hunch or alarmist rhetoric by green activists. It is the conclusion of the world's most qualified coral reef experts.’ Hoegh-Guldberg said the Great Barrier Reef, which generates $6billion a year from tourism and supports 63,000 jobs, was at a turning point. ‘It is highly unlikely that coral . reefs will survive more than a two degree increase in average global . temperature relative to pre-industrial levels,’ he said. ‘But . if the current trajectory of carbon pollution levels continues . unchecked, the world is on track for at least three degrees of warming. If we don't act now, the climate change damage caused to our Great . Barrier Reef by 2030 will be irreversible.’ Dr . Selina Ward, co-author of the report, told the Sydney Morning Herald: . ‘One of the most important functions of the reef is as a wave barrier. That protection will be lost. Huge draw: The Great Barrier Reef generates $6billion in revenue from tourists every year . ‘Without the reef, a lot of islands will be swamped.’ The Great Barrier Reef, one of the most biodiverse places on earth, teems with marine life and will be the focus of Australia's Earth Hour - a global campaign which encourages people and organisations to switch off their lights for one hour on March 29 for climate change. The report comes as the reef, considered one of the most vulnerable places in the world to the impacts of climate change, is at risk of having its status downgraded by the UN cultural organisation UNESCO to ‘world heritage in danger’. Despite threats of a downgrade without action on rampant coastal development and water quality, Australia in December approved a massive coal port expansion in the region and associated dumping of dredged waste within the marine park's boundaries.","Australia's iconic reef is at a 'tipping point' marine scientists have warned .

The co-founders of popular instant messaging service Whatsapp have become a last-minute addition to this year's list of global billionaires. Jan Koum and Brian Acton made Forbes' annual rich list in February after Facebook offered a total of $19 billion to buy their company. The deal gives Koum a fortune of $6.8 billion, while partner Acton is said to be worth at least $3 billion according to Forbes. Late addition: Whastsapp founders Brian Acton, left, and Jan Koum, right, made this year's list of global billionaires following an acquisition offer from Facebook in February. Facebook offered the pair $19 billion for the service, but the founders are set to get a total of $9.8 billion between them . However, neither made the top twenty list, which was topped by Microsoft founder Bill Gates with his $76 million fortune. This year's list had the largest number of female billionaires ever, including: . Sheryl Sandberg . is arguably the most famous of the 34 women who are new to the list . this year, and she just made the cut with $1.05billion after Facebook's . share price increased dramatically. Nigerian fashion head turned oil magnate Folorunsho Alakija who is worth $2.5billion. Denise Coates from the United Kingdom who made her $1.6billion in online gambling and developed the site Bet365.com. Estee Lauder's granddaughters Aerin Lauder Zinterhofer and Jane Lauder have been added to the list. Sandra Ortega Mera, the daughter of Zara owner Amancio Ortega, made the list after inheriting her mother's wealth following her death in August. Other new faces on the 28th annual list: . Jan Koum from WhatsApp, $6.8billion . Brian Acton from WhatsApp, $3billion . Evan Williams from Twitter, $3billion . Kenneth Feld of Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, $1.8billion . Alexandre Grendene Bartelle owns the Brazilian shoe company that produces Havaianas flip flops, $1.5billion . Drew Houston, the CEO of tech company DropBox, $1.2billion . Vince McMahon from WWE, $1.2billion . Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg made the most money in the world over the past 12 months, according to the Forbes report, and his net worth nearly doubled, going from 2013's . estimate of $15.2billion to $28.5billion as a result of the social . network's increasing share price. Koum . and Acton are among a list of 26 newcomers to the annual list, alongside Twitter's Evan Williams who has a fortune of $3billion. Drew Houston, the CEO of tech company DropBox who made $1.2billion, and Alexandre Grendene Bartelle who amassed a fortune of $1.5 billion with his Brazilian shoe company that makes Havaianas flip flops also made the cut for the first time. Gates held the title of 'richest man in the world' for 15 out of the past 20 years, but he was succeeded- briefly- by Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim Helu for the past four years. Gates, who now spends most of his time in philanthropy, earned his spot back as his net worth increased by $9billion to $76billion after Microsoft's stock had a promising year, putting him ahead of Slim Helu who came in at $72billion. Zara owner Amancio Ortega held onto the third place spot for the second year in a row and was followed by investor Warren Buffett and Oracle head Larry Ellison came in fifth place. The rest of the top ten show the power of American family connections, as sixth and seventh place went to Charles and David Koch respectively. Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson came in . eighth place, followed by Walmart heirs - with Christy Walton and family . coming in ninth and her brother-in-law Jim Walton came in 10th. Their relatives Alice and S. Robson Walton also got their own spots on the list, meaning that the Walton family was responsible for four of the top 15 billionaires in the world. Christy . Walton's high placement means that she holds onto the title as the . richest woman in the world, but that doesn't mean there wasn't a . great deal of change for women on this year's list. Back at the top: Bill Gates was the 'richest man in the world' for 15 out of the past 20 years but was dethroned briefly by Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim up until now .

More women than ever were included this year, with 172 female billionaires on the list of 1,645. That jump marks a 24 per cent increase from last year, as only 138 women were on the list in 2013. One . of the new female faces was that of Sheryl Sandberg who is one of the . youngest self-made billionaires with a net worth of $1.05billion. Like Zuckerberg, she was helped dramatically by the fact that the Facebook share price is now up 130 per cent. Though . the new wave of wealthy technology leaders made their presence known on . this year's list, neither of the Facebook faces were in the top 20 with . Zuckerberg just narrowly missing the cut off. Titans of tech: Google co-founders Larry Page, . left, and Sergey Brin, right, came in 17th and 19th with $32.3billion . and $31.8billion respectively . Earning her spot: Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, 44, is one of the youngest self-made billionaire women and a new entry onto this year's list . Gates clearly led the way with Ellison . not far behind, younger iterations like Google's Larry Page and Sergey . Brin came in 17th and 19th place respectively. They were interrupted along the way by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, who came in 18th place with $32billion. Aside from Sandberg, another first time mention was given to designer . Michael Kors, whose fortune breached the billion dollar mark after he . took his eponymous company public in 2011. Though he is near the bottom of the list, retail giants were represented well in the top 20. Between .

A sexist note left in a plane for a female pilot by a passenger has caused outrage, after it suggested the cockpit 'is no place for a woman'. The letter, scrawled in pen on the back of a napkin, was found addressed to WestJet captain Carey Smith Steacy after she completed a flight from Calgary to Victoria in Canada. The passenger has been identified only as 'David' from seat 12E, who reportedly also told flight attendants safety was important to him, and asked whether the pilot had enough hours to be the captain. Sexist letter: The note written by 'David' was left in seat 12E on the WestJet flight . Carey, a mother-of-two from Surrey, British Columbia, who has been a pilot for 17 years, posted the note on her Facebook page, and it made its way to online chatrooms and Reddit. It read: 'Dear Capt/ WestJet. The cockpit of airliner is no place for a woman. A woman being a mother is the most honor [sic], not as ""captain"". We're short mothers, not pilots WestJet.' He then references Chapter 31 from the Book of Proverbs, which includes a description of what makes a virtuous woman. The letter continues: '(Sorry, not PC) PS: I wish WestJet could tell me a fair lady is at the helm so I can book another flight!' High flyer: Captain Carey Smith Steacy on board a WestJet plane .

'Now, back to my most important role, being a mother.' She told Metro News: 'I just couldn’t believe there are still people in this country that think like that.' WestJet said it has 1,118 male pilots and 58 female pilots, adding: 'We have captains and first officers among our female pilots and always have since we launched in 1996.'

Riath Al-Samarrai . PUBLISHED: . 06:50 EST, 1 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:26 EST, 2 January 2014 . Is Cardiff the right move for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer? Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is set to be confirmed as the new manager of Cardiff City on Thursday afternoon. He was spotted at the Emirates Stadium before Cardiff's game against Arsenal and in the directors' box watching the 2-0 defeat after flying into London on owner Vincent Tan's private plane. It is hoped Solskjaer will officially be Malky Mackay's replacement before the FA Cup tie against Newcastle at the weekend. Here's looking at you: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Vincent Tan share a glance in the directors' box at the Emirates Stadium during Cardiff's match against Arsenal . Taking his seat: Solskjaer (second left) in the directors' box at the Emirates as Cardiff owner Tan (bottom right) makes his way up . In position: Solskjaer and Tan stand side by side before Cardiff's game at Arsenal . Entrance: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (right) and Vincent Tan arrive at the Emirates ahead of Cardiff's game against Arsenal . New wave: Tan sheepishly acknowledges the camera as he and Solskjaer walk into the Emirates . Man Utd reserves - 2008-2010 . Molde - November 2010-present . Honours . Norwegian Premier League: 2011, 2012 . Norwegian Cup: 2013 . League record . Sir Alex Ferguson, Solskjaer's former manager at Manchester United, reportedly told him to steer clear of the club and Tan after three months of chaos finally led to the departure of Mackay last Friday. But Sportsmail understands Cardiff chairman Mehmet Dalman held further talks with the Molde manager’s representatives and it seems that has convinced him to move to South Wales, despite the former United striker's reservations. Solskjaer is a patron of the Manchester United Supporters' Trust, who led the stand against Glazer regime. On the pitch, the 40-year-old has led Molde to the Norwegian title twice, in 2011 and 2012, and to the Norwegian Cup last year. Dalman has also been authorised by Tan to . offer a hefty January transfer budget that will extend to ‘whatever it . takes to secure survival’, according to one source close to Tan. Reports in Norway say Solskjaer, who has a contract until July has not committed to leaving Molde. Thumbs up: Cardiff owner Vincent Tan has managed to bag his first choice, Solskjaer, as boss . Time's up: Malky Mackay was sacked last Friday after a chaotic last three months in charge at Cardiff . Only one Norwegian has managed in the Premier League and that did not have a happy ending. Egil Olsen took charge of Wimbledon in 1999 but lasted for less than a season as the Dons were relegated from the Premiership (table below is all competitions) Two more Norwegians have managed in England, although both were in the Championship. Henning Berg was in charge of Blackburn for just 57 days, registering one win, three draws and six defeats in his time there and famously storming out of the club's Christmas party after he was made to go on stage and wear a stocking on his head, and a Michael Jackson wig, and dance on stage. Stale Solbakken was a disaster at Wolves in the first half of last season, beginning a campaign which was to end in relegation to League One. The club's CEO . Tarje Nordstrand Jacobsen told Romsdals Budstikke: 'Ole Gunnar did not . leave us a message about it one way or the other. He is still our . manager, at least until the summer.' He . would not comment on the information that Solskjaer will be heading to . England and that he can be presented as new Cardiff boss already. 'It's . nothing new to say about this situation from the club side. We still . speak regularly with Ole Gunnar and both parties know well how we have . each other.' Former Norway striker Jan Aage . Fjortoft, now a pundit, tweeted: 'Will try to keep you updated! Can't . still believe Solskjær is going to Cardiff. Against everything he has . said/stand for.' This a staggering volte face if . Fjortoft is to be believed, as he went on talkSPORT earlier in the week . and said: 'It won't happen. I understand that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer won't . pick a club, he will pick a owner so Cardiff won't happen. 'Ole . Gunnar Solskjaer did an interview some weeks ago and said if he goes to . England he will be very aware of what owner he's going to work with. Based on what I know there's no chance he'll go to Cardiff City.' Paul Ince and Dan Petrescu have been lined up as insurance options in case Solskjaer turns down the job. Assistant manager David Kerslake and first-team coach Joe McBride are taking charge of the New Year's Day game at Arsenal. Until the Norwegian is confirmed, it remains business as usual for Kerslake and McBride. After the 2-0 defeat by Arsenal on New Year's Day, Kerslake said: 'Although Joe and myself and the rest of the staff know it is only temporary, the last thing I said to the players that they made me feel immensely proud of the performance they put in. 'I am really unsure whether they knew or not (that Solskjaer was at the stadium). Breaking the deadlock: Nicklas Bendtner netted Arsenal's first of two goals just two minutes before time . 'There was no talk of it on the team bus and the hotel and in the dressing-room, so I would not totally unsure about that.' Kerslake added: 'Whoever comes in, obviously there is an important month coming up, so if he can add to it, make the squad better, then all well and good, but I believe the team are good enough to stay in the Premier League.' There have been no indications as to whether any of Mackay's former backroom staff would be kept on once a new manager has been appointed. 'No, (I have heard) nothing at all,' said Kerslake. Taking charge: David Kerslake took charge of Cardiff for their draw with Sunderland and defeat to Arsenal . 'I am contracted to the club until the owner or chairman tell me different. 'I will be in work tomorrow as usual. 'Coaches and managers in football know that it's a precarious job and we just get on with it. There is no problem there, it is business as usual.' PS Malky's back and smiling at Celtic . Malky Mackay, the man Solskjaer seems set to replace at Cardiff, was pictured at Parkhead ahead of Celtic's Scottish Premiership match against Partick Thistle. Mackay, who played for Celtic, was greeted by Lison Lion Bertie Auld and it seemed to take his mind off the acrimony surrounding his sacking by Vincent Tan.

Dave Martin, a longtime Associated Press photographer based in Montgomery, Alabama, died after collapsing on the Georgia Dome field after the Chick-fil-A Bowl on Tuesday night. Martin, 59, ran onto the field immediately following Texas A&M's 52-48 win over Duke and took photos of Aggies coach Kevin Sumlin being doused with a water bucket by his players. Martin continued to take celebration shots before collapsing. Martin suffered an apparent heart attack and was administered CPR on the field, according to a statement from the Georgia Dome. He was placed on a stretcher and taken to Emory Hospital Midtown where he died early Wednesday morning. AP photographer Dave Martin, second from right, works during the first half of an NFL football game at an earlier date. He collapsed and died while covering a game on New Year's Eve . 'Dave Martin was an excellent photojournalist, a consummate and dedicated professional and a wonderful person,' said AP Vice President and Director of Photography Santiago Lyon. 'Wherever his work took him he made many friends and will be deeply missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing him.' Mr Martin was described as a 'dedicated professional and wonderful person' Martin began his photographic career at the Lakeland Ledger in Lakeland, Fla., in 1982 before joining the AP as a staff photographer in Montgomery in 1983. In 2004, Martin was named the AP's regional photo editor for the South. Martin was at nearly every major news event in the South over the past 30 years, taking memorable images during Hurricane Katrina, the Gulf oil spill and the tornadoes that sliced through Alabama in 2011. He also traveled around the world for the AP, covering Super Bowls, Olympics, Ryder Cups and other sporting events, as well as political conventions, and conflicts in Afghanistan, Haiti and Iraq. Known as 'Mullet' to his many friends and colleagues, Martin built strong working relationships with AP member photographers and editors around the region, particularly those in Alabama. 'He was so driven to tell stories through pictures that he'd do most anything it took to be in the right spot to get the best photo, whether it was standing on a beach during a hurricane or wading into polluted waters during an oil spill,' said Jay Reeves, AP's Birmingham correspondent and a colleague of Martin for decades. 'He covered wars and a revolution, sports and tornadoes, the Alabama Legislature and presidents, and he typically had the best picture no matter what the event.' On their last assignment together, Reeves watched as Martin took time to get the perfect photo of sunlight streaming through a glass of beer. 'He came away with a beautiful photo because he wasn't willing to settle for the ordinary.' AP Sports Writer Paul Newberry said he would remember Martin as a colleague never approached work or life halfway. 'He . lived life to the fullest. We should all be so lucky to get out of our . time on this planet what he did in 59 short years,' Newberry said. 'He . is simply irreplaceable.'

Twins Amelia and Allison Tucker look like any other toddlers their age as they laugh, play - and do their best to keep their parents on their toes. But a little over a year ago, the scene could not look more different - as the girls were born conjoined at the chest and abdomen and anxiously awaiting a complicated separation surgery. Now nearly 14 months since the twins - who will turn two in March - were successfully separated, their parents have revealed that they are happy, healthy and active toddlers. 'Seeing the girls and seeing them . climb and get in to things - as aggravated as I get I can't help but . laugh because they're an absolute miracle,' their mother Shellie told Good Morning America. Scroll down for video . Growing girls: Amelia and Allison Tucker are thriving, right, after being separated 14 months ago.

'As . he was telling me, I could literally feel the girls kicking in my belly . and I knew that that wasnâ€™t something possible,' Shellie said. The . Tuckers, who already had a young son, sought a second opinion at Childrenâ€™s . Hospital of Philadelphia, where doctors said that the girls could be . separated when they were born.

Proud: Their parents, Shellie and Greg, called the girls 'a miracle' and said they love watching them grow . An incredible . X-ray showed the daunting task doctors had ahead of them, with the girls . joined at a significant portion of their fronts. They shared a chest wall, diaphragm, . pericardium and liver. Then . on November 7 last year, a team of 40 doctors and nurses successfully . carried out the seven-hour surgery to separate Allison and Amelia. After the separation, Shellie wrote on her blog: . 'Greg and I are thrilled that our daughters have been given this . remarkable gift by the amazing team from The Childrenâ€™s Hospital of . Philadelphia. 'We are so . grateful for the support and encouragement that the medical team, our . families and our friends have given us during this long journey.'

'Seeing them for the first time as two separate girls was really the most amazing feeling,' Greg Tucker told GMA. Footage of the girls now shows them as two very individual personalities as they push each other in strollers, play with a mini basketball hoop or share snacks together. 'I'm thankful for every single day,' their mother added. 'I can't describe it.' The surgery was the 21st separation . of conjoined twins performed at the hospital. The procedure involved . about 40 medical staff members. Conjoined twins occur once in every . 50,000 to 60,000 births, and most are stillborn. About three-quarters of . such twins are female and are joined at least partially in the chest, . sharing organs. Challenge: Around 40 medical staff worked for seven hours to separate the girls - after practicing on dolls . Success! The girls had a good prognosis as they did not share any major organs; they have now recovered . Family: The Tuckers, including their son Owen, are pictured together following the life-changing surgery . Chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs, the hospital said.

When Australia last led an Ashes series 4-0  Sir Ian Botham was sitting alongside Sir Richard Branson in Sydney when the tycoon proposed that the original urn should stay Down Under with the victors. Seven years later, Sky Sports pundit Botham still believes that should be the case, despite  having tipped England to win this series 5-0. But Botham accepts that the original artefact is now too fragile to leave its home in the Lord’s museum, having last been in Australia on an exhibition tour in 2006-07 when England were whitewashed. Acknowledgment: Sir Ian Botham (right) accepts that the Ashes urn should stay at Lord's . Master publicist Branson taking the attention before the Sydney Test had a lot to do with his Virgin airline having been the official carrier for the Ashes urn tour of Australia. Botham and Branson, who have had no cricket dealings since, had discussed the urn staying while on the same boat in Sydney harbour on New Year’s Eve. The MCC, who were repeatedly called the MMC by Branson, regard the urn as always having been a museum piece rather than a cricket trophy. Plea: Sir Richard Branson (centre), pictured in 2007 with Botham (right) and Allan Border, once called for the Ashes urn to remain with the country of the victorious team . England team director Andy Flower promised a fresh intensity in preparations for the Sydney Test after four defeats in a row. But the squad’s shambolic appearance on Wednesday gave no hint of a new dawn as England declined net practice at the SCG, preferring just a fielding stint instead. How much yet another net session would benefit the squad at this stage of a dismal tour is debatable. But with new players coming into the team for the last Test, one would think every available opportunity to practise batting and bowling would be taken up — even if it meant arriving at the SCG at 8.30am on New Year’s Day rather than an hour later. Practice: England's Andy Flower speaks to his players during a nets session at the Sydney Cricket Ground . It was also noticeable that Paul Downton, the new managing director of England cricket, was not at the SCG on Wednesday despite being in Sydney. Downton, who has the ultimate responsibility for England team issues, is due to sit down in the next week with England team director Andy Flower to discuss the way forward for a national side humiliated in Australia. Chat: Andy Flower is due to sit down for a discussion with managing director of England cricket Paul Downton . So it would surely have been beneficial for Downton to be present at the SCG to gauge the mood in the camp and training intensity, or lack of it, after four losses on the bounce. At least the new England national selector James Whitaker was watching. Whitaker holds the dubious honour of having been BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew’s fag at Uppingham School, according to Aggers’ wife Emma in her daily tour blog. Brian Moore, the BBC’s useless rugby co-commentator and writer of an unreadable newspaper sports column, has made great play of lambasting Sports Agenda’s admittedly amateurish video review of a day’s play during the fourth Test at Melbourne, done at the last minute to help out a colleague. This is the same Brian Moore whose Twitter dialogue yesterday included a post that read: ‘Oh, F*** off, you p**** .’  Also, Moore informed me at a William Hill Sports Book of the Year function — following some mild criticism of him — that the only reason he wasn’t going to punch my lights out was because of concern I might call the police. Cook’s a good sport . Alastair Cook’s captaincy is under huge scrutiny with his England team in danger of an Ashes whitewash.

Britain's property-owning democracy is  collapsing and half the country will be in rented accommodation in a generation unless urgent action is taken, according to the head of a government housing review. Owner-occupiers make up 65 per cent of householders, down from a peak of 71 per cent a decade ago. But housing expert Natalie Elphicke said on current trends, just 55 per cent were likely to own their homes by 2033, falling to 49 per cent by 2041. To let: Half the country will be in rented accommodation in a generation unless urgent action is taken, according to the head of a government housing review . Margaret Thatcher’s housing revolution is being reversed as property prices spiral, with the number in private rented accommodation up from  2.2million in 2002-03 to nearly 3.9million last year. Mrs Elphicke said the explosion in the buy-to-let market and the growth in demand because of a rising population had created ‘generation rent’ as more people had to turn to private landlords. But without reform, ‘generation rent’ would become ‘nation rent’ as the dream of a property-owning democracy was shattered, she said. The founder of the charity Million Homes, Million Lives, which wants a million extra properties to be built, Mrs Elphicke said more than three quarters of those in private rented housing and nearly half in social rented housing wanted to buy their own homes. Rise: The number of householders in private rented accommodation is up from 2.2million in 2002-03 to nearly 3.9million last year . Just . 3 per cent of people choose long-term renting as their first choice. The trend towards private renting is blamed for undermining communities, . with more transient families who do not stay long enough to put down . roots. Many families with children now pay half or more of their income in rent and have little or nothing left at the end of the month to save for a deposit. In a report next week, Mrs Elphicke is to call for a revolution in the financing of housebuilding that would encourage City investors, insurers and pension funds to bankroll affordable developments. Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles have appointed Mrs Elphicke and Keith House, the Liberal Democrat leader of Eastleigh Council, to lead an independent review into the issue. Mrs Elphicke said: ‘It needs to be possible for people to buy their homes as their circumstances allow. It would be wrong to allow the current trends to continue.’ More than a third of England’s 14.3million homeowners are aged 65 and over. Just 1.4million homeowners are aged between 25 and 34, the age group most likely to be raising families.","Expert says half the country will be in rented accommodation by 2041 .

A Swedish artist has won the bid to create the three memorials for the victims of the 2011 Utøya tragedy in Norway. The July 22 terror attacks killed eight in a bombing at the government headquarters in Oslo and 69 people, mostly teenagers, were murdered by Anders Breivik in a shooting spree at a youth camp organised by Norway’s social-democratic Arbeiderpartiet. Artist Jonas Dahlberg's Memory Wound will be a 3.5metre (11ft 6in) channel cut in the mainland facing Utøya, creating a 'physical wound' in the landscape. In memoriam: Swedish artist Jonas Dahlberg's winning bid for the memorials honouring the victims of the July 22 attacks include a 11ft6in cut in the mainland facing Utøya, a 'physical wound' in the landscape . The excavation will represent the physical experience of something being taken and 'reflect the abrupt and permanent loss of those who died on Utøya'. The 3.5metre wide gap will have the names of all 77 victims, both Oslo and Utøya, engraved on its sides. The material cut from the site at Sørbråten opposite Utøya island will be transported to Oslo to be used to build a memorial at the site of the bombings. It will also be used to create a temporary memorial pathway in Oslo’s government quarter to connect the two memorial sites. All three memorials will cost the Norwegian government £27million NOK, approximately £2.7m. Never forget: The memorial on Sørbråten peninsula opposite the island will have the names of all 77 victims, both Oslo and Utøya, engraved on its sides . Honour: Visitors will not be able to touch the names engraved on the opposite wall of Memory Wound . The memorials will remember the victims of the July 22 terror attacks which saw eight die in a bombing at the government headquarters in Oslo and 69 people, mostly teenagers, were murdered by Anders Breivik at a political youth camp on Utøya island . A permanent memorial in Oslo will . feature an amphitheater using trees taken from Sørbråten to maintain the . relationship between the memorials on both sites, and the connection . between the victims. Murderer: Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people on July 22, 2011 . The . jury, comprising representatives from victim support groups, the . government and AUF - the Norwegian Labour Party Youth League made an . unanimous decision. ‘Jonas Dahlberg’s proposal takes the emptiness and traces of the tragic events of 22 July as its starting point,’ the jury said in a statement. ‘It is capable of conveying and confronting the trauma and loss that the 22 July events resulted in in a daring way. ‘The proposal is radical and brave, and evokes the tragic events in a physical and direct manner.’ White supremacist Anders Behring Breivik is serving a 21-year prison sentence for the terrorist attacks on Utøya  and in Oslo . His sentence can be extended for as long as he's considered dangerous. Just last month, Norwegian police rejected a complaint by Breivik that the he is being held under illegal conditions, which saw him threaten to go on hungerstrike unless he got a better Playstation and a larger gym. He also complained about being kept in isolation and demanded access to better video games and a sofa.","Memorials for 2011 tragedy in Norway will feature 'physical wound'

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 14:34 EST, 20 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 15:26 EST, 20 February 2014 . New battle lines are being drawn in the fight between gun-control advocates in Washington and Second Amendment advocacy groups, over a proposal that would mandate the 'personalization' of every new gun sold in the United States. Sen. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, is behind a bill that would prohibit the sale of run-of-the-mill guns, requiring biometric technologies such as fingerprint recognition or a paired device – such as a wristwatch – that would authorize a gun to fire if it is nearby. The gun rights lobby appears to be gearing up for a fight. 'The gun prohibition lobby wants it mandated so that they can control the freedom of choice of every gun owner and gun on the market,' Second Amendment Foundation founder Alan Gottlieb told MailOnline. The man with the golden handprint: The most recent James Bond flick, 'Skyfall,' included a gun that only 007 could shoot . A large gun shop in California is selling the Armatix iP1, which requires a wireless link to a special wristwatch in order to fire . Firearms like this Glock model 17 could soon be required to feature a fingerprint sensor in order to operate -- but just try using it with gloves on . Gottlieb's objections are practical as well as philosophical. 'The problem with ""smart guns"" is that they are dumb when they really need to be used in self-defense by multiple family members,' he said, 'or for that matter by police partners at a crime in progress when one officer needs to use the other officer's gun.' 'If the police won't use them,' Gottlieb asked, 'why should I?' The National Rifle Association, through its lobbying-arm Institute for Legislative Action, strongly opposes 'government mandates that require the use of expensive, unreliable features, such as grips that would read your fingerprints before the gun will fire.' The NRA also says on its website that it 'recognizes that the ""smart guns"" issue clearly has the potential to mesh with the anti-gunner's agenda, opening the door to a ban on all guns that do not possess the government-required technology.' '""Safety"" in the gun control lexicon means ""restriction"",' NRAnews.com radio host Cam Edwards said during his show on Wednesday. Just squeeze: Another approach is this Beretta pistol equipped with sensors that can determine whether the gun's owner is holding it, based on the tightness of the grip at several locations along the handle . NRAnews host Cam Edwards is among the gun-rights leaders who believes a government requirement of new gun technologies could pave the way for the confiscation of older weapons . Next up: personalizing your ammo -- One proposal under consideration would require a gun's firing pin to imprint a unique identifying mark on brass shell casings when guns are fired -- an indented ID of sorts that would connect the gun with the spent cartridge . These concerns are shared by many in the gun industry, even though new technologies would come with a markup that could be lucrative, and a slowing of secondhand sales might create a short-term sales bonanza. Industry executives told MailOnline that Markey's bill would require them to sell tools that have glaring shortcomings, and might create new legal liabilities. 'What happens when a criminal wrestles away your handgun, points it at your chest and pulls the trigger?' asked one who declined to be named, citing legal concerns. 'If you're wearing a smart watch connected to the gun, it's still going to fire.' 'And what happens when the watch battery runs out?' Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, a reliable progessive, wants every new gun sold in America to come with a system that would limit its use to the person it belongs to . Gun makers, he said, are getting legal advice about the future pitfalls that will come with selling weapons that can only be used by a single person. 'A gun is property. It's not a license in and of itself, like a Super Bowl ticket,' he explained. 'If you've bought it, you should be able to loan it to whomever you want, as long as that person is responsible with the firearm and has been trained in how to use it.' 'The first time an intruder rapes a woman because she couldn't fire her husband's revolver, someone in this industry is going to get sued.' But a few intrepid gun retailers, including one near Los Angeles, are making these cutting-edge guns available.' 'It could revolutionize the gun industry,' Oak Tree Gun Club owner James Mitchell told The Washington Post. Sen. Markey hopes it also revolutionizes the tension between the Second Amendment and the government's obligation to keep ordinary Americans safe. 'In the 21st century, we should use advances in technology to our own advantage and save lives,' he said in a statement and the Handgun Trigger Safety Act  will help ensure that only authorized users can operate handguns.' 'This is the type of gun safety legislation that everyone – regardless of political party or affiliation – should be able to support.'","Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey's bill would require safety devices on every new gun to prohibit anyone but the owner from firing .
Gun right activists say the technology is dangerous since it can stop gun owners' family members from defending themselves against attackers .
Police forces don't use the technologies, which include biometric finger sensors and paired watches that must be near a gun to make it shoot .
Watch batteries go dead, industry experts caution, gun owners wearing gloves have no fingerprints, and companies would be open to lawsuits ."

Harvey Weinstein has revealed that he is planning a movie starring Meryl Streep that he hopes will bring down the gun industry. The mega-producer let the yet-unannounced plan slip during an interview with radio host Howard Stern. 'I shouldn’t say this, but I’ll tell it to you, Howard. I’m going to make a movie with Meryl Streep, and we’re going to take this head-on,' he said on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . In cahoots: Harvey Weinstein said that he and Meryl Streep, his frequent star, will be working on a movie that lampoons the NRA and the gun industry . 'They’re going to wish they weren’t alive after I’m done with them,' he said of the gun industry. He said that it will not be a documentary but a 'big movie like a ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington,""' he said without giving away any plot details. Weinstein, 61, made it clear that his motive is political as he is openly against the use of guns. 'I don’t think we need guns in this country. And I hate it. I think the NRA is a disaster area,' he said. He said that his intention is to make the movie such a condemnation of the use of guns in America that the ammunition industry would take a noticeable hit afterwards. Weinstein said that people will be leaving the movie theater thinking 'Gun stocks — I don’t want to be involved in that stuff'. Democrat: Weinstein- seen in 2006 with President Obama, the late Senator Frank Lautenberg, and Senator chuck Schumer- held a fundraiser for President Obama in 2012 . 'It’s going to be like crash and burn.' The topic came up when Stern asked about his plans to direct a film based on a book about the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto during the Holocaust, but used it as a basis to explain his feelings on guns. 'It's not a Holocaust story as much as it is Jews with guns. It's my whole philosophy. It's the idea that when injustice is that great you can't just march into the camps,' he said. 'I never want to have a gun... This is when you're marching a half a million people into Auschwitz. I'd find a gun if that was happening to my people.' Less obvious: Meryl Streep has not been politically active like Weinstein, but was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Obama in 2010 . The Miramax founder has never been shy about his left-leaning political allegiances as he hosted a $2.5million fundraiser for President Obama at his Westport, Connecticut home in August 2012. He also spoke about gun control that summer in the led up to the 2012 election, telling the Huffington Post: ‘If we don’t get gun-control laws in this country, we are full of beans. To have the National Rifle Association rule the United States of America is pathetic.’ Though Meryl Streep has kept her political beliefs much more closely guarded, she has not remained as tight-lipped in her adoration of Mr Weinstein. During her 2012 Golden Globes acceptance speech for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher, Streep jokingly called Weinstein ‘God, the punisher’.","Mega-producer revealed his plans to make a film to help battle the gun industry and the NRA .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 15:27 EST, 7 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:04 EST, 7 January 2014 . A federal court ruled Monday that Chicago's ban on private gun ownership, one of the nation's toughest, violates the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of individuals' rights to bear arms. The decision was the fourth major court ruling in recent years to go against the Windy City, in a trend that has Second Amendment supporters trouncing gun-control advocates even in the face of widely publicized school massacres and other public shootings. The city 'has not demonstrated that . allowing gun sales and transfers within city limits creates such genuine . and serious risks to public safety that flatly prohibiting them is . justified,' read the 35-page decision of Judge Edmond E. Chang in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. President Barack Obama named Chang to the federal bench in 2010. The judge put a hold on his own decision so the city can appeal to a higher court. He also said that a less restrictive law might pass judicial muster. Scenes from a future Chicago? The federal court ruling means individual Chicagoans could soon be allowed to purchase and keep handguns for their own protection . Not happy: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel wants to see his city's crime rate to continue its downward slide, and doesn't believe an armed citizenry will help . Self-protection: Gun-rights crusaders say Americans, especially those living in urban areas, should be allowed to arm themselves and learn how to use guns in self-defense . Chicago's gun ban, intended to improve public safety, included a zoning ordinance that prohibited licensed gun dealers, banned individuals from selling guns, and barred Chicagoans from giving firearms to family members. Data published in December show, Chicago's murder rate is at a 35-year low. But despite the tough restrictions, said Roderick Drew, a spokesman for Chicago’s law department, 'every year Chicago police recover more illegal guns than officers in any city in the country.' Drew attributed that statistic to 'lax federal laws' and 'lax laws in Illinois and surrounding states related to straw purchasing and the transfer of guns.' But 'certain fundamental rights are protected by the Constitution [and] put outside government’s reach,' wrote Judge Chang, 'including the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense under the Second Amendment.' While that constitutional right has its limits – felons and the mentally ill can't buy guns, for instance – Chang insisted that 'Chicago’s ordinance goes too far in outright banning legal buyers and legal dealers from engaging in lawful acquisitions and lawful sales of firearms, and at the same time the evidence does not support that the complete ban sufficiently furthers the purposes that the ordinance tries to serve.' Pioneer: Dick Heller sued the District of Columbia after it rejected his application to keep a handgun at his home for protection, and the Supreme Court ruled in his favor -- setting the stage for the 'McDonald' ruling that forces state and local governments to observe the Second Amendment . Not likely to become legal: If Chicago is forced to allow gun sales within its borders, it will likely limit them to handguns and exclude so-called 'assault rifles' like this AR-15 . National Rifle Association lobbyist Todd Vandermyde told the Associated Press that the court decision 'shows how out of step and outrageous Chicago’s ordinances really are.' City with the big recoil: Guns like this Glock .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol could go on sale in Chicago if the city loses what it a near-certain appeal . Second Amendment Foundation Vice President Alan Gottlieb told MailOnline that 'once again it has taken a federal court ruling to convince city government that Chicago is not a city-state in the middle of the United States, but part of a nation that is bound by the Constitution and must honor all of its provisions, including the right to keep and bear arms..' Gotlieb's statement had the ring of a victory lap: It was his organization that pushed the landmark Supreme Court case that determined states, not just the federal government, must observe citizens' Second Amendment rights. That case, McDonald v. City of Chicago, was decided in 2010. It 'paved the way' for Monday's ruling, Gottlieb said. The NRA has complained that the city of Chicago has ignored that ruling from the high court for more than three years. 'Chicago's continued refusal to follow the U.S. Supreme Court's clear directive in its landmark ruling ... is unacceptable, Chris W. Cox, Executive Director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement. 'The NRA will continue to challenge the city until it fully respects the right of its law-abiding residents to keep and bear arms.'","Windy City has defied 2010 Supreme Court ruling that forced state and local governments to observe Second Amendment 'right to bear arms'
New ruling says Chicago can't issue a blanket ban on all gun sales that would be legal in other cities .
Existing law bans licensed dealers from setting up shop, and forbids citizens from giving guns to family members .
City government worries about public safety while the gun lobby hopes to arm more law-abiding Chicagoans – and see fewer violent crime victims .

Teen bodybuilder Daveon Hill is so dedicated to his sport he scoffs 5,000 calories a day and wakes at 4am to hit the gym. The 18-year-old, from St Louis, has given his life to his passion, competing against - and beating - men twice his age. Bulky Daveon, who can effortlessly lift his own bodyweight, consumes a whopping 5,000 calories in strict muscle building diet. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . In shape: Daveon Hill competing at the World Championships in 2013 in Greece, aged 17 (left), and pictured at Natural Olympia 2012 in St Peters, Missouri (right) And despite turning the heads of girls his own age with his hulking physique, the teen says he is too busy for romance. Daveon said: ‘When you love something so much, it doesn't matter how hard it gets - you have to do it. ‘I want to achieve my dream of winning a fourth Natural Olympia title, and I'll do whatever it takes to get there.’ Meat the parents: Daveon and his father Troy Hill and mother Latasha pose with one month's worth of food, used as part of the teen's training diet . Powerful parents: Daveon's mom and dad are also very muscly, having been bodybuilding competitors themselves . Latasha Hill and Troy at their last bodybuilding competition in 2005 in St Peters, Missouri, where they were seen competing by Daveon for the first time . Daveon's parents, Troy, 44, and Latasha, 42 spend more than £460 each month on extra food for their son. Latasha prepares his meals days in advance, and he carries food with him wherever he goes to eat every three hours. Each morning Daveon wolfs down 10 egg whites and two packs of oatmeal and then eats eight ounces of steak and sweet potato before noon. For lunch he eats eight ounces of chicken with a cup of brown rice followed by ten ounces of fish for dinner. And though some find it hard to believe his ripped physique is the result of hard work alone, Daveon says he would never consider using steroids. In it to win it: Daveon winning the Gold Medal at the INBA Natural Olympia 2011 in St Peters, Missouri (left), and with a medal at the World Championships in Greece in 2013 (right) His obsession with bodybuilding began at 10 years old after he watched his bodybuilding parents compete in a show. At age 12 he began lifting weights under the watchful eye of personal trainer and nutritionist Troy. By age 15 he entered his first competition. Now Daveon can bench press almost 300lbs and recently won three gold medals for the USA at the world championships in Greece. Troy said: ‘Daveon gained 40 pounds lean muscle in two years - that's unheard of. Heavy duty: Daveon training at his local gym as his father looks on . Up in arms: Daveon's progress is checked by his father at their home gym in St Peters . ‘I know a lot of professional athletes - grown men - and Daveon has surpassed quite a few of them. ‘He is the youngest person ever to get his pro card at the IFPA Gateway in Missouri aged just 18.’ Despite his tender years Daveon has won six gold medals in the Natural Olympia show and world championships, including first place in the overall category competing against adults. He said: ‘To know I've won an overall at age 15 is incredible. Dedicated: Daveon rises at 4am to go to the gym . Weight to go: Daveon is watched by his mother Latasha in the gym . ‘It really meant a lot that I achieved something that some people are still working to achieve at a very young age.’ Two years ago Daveon and his mother competed together in the St Louis Naturals mixed pairs competition, and took first place. Troy said: ‘The family that prays together stays together, and a family that trains together stays healthy together.’ While some worry Daveon's obsession is preventing him from enjoying his youth, Daveon isn't worried. He said: ‘Because I am so focused, I don't really have time for serious relationships - but they'll be waiting in the future.’ Daveon is currently in training for the Natural Olympia competition in November where he hopes to win his fourth Natural Olympia title. Troy said: ‘Daveon doesn't walk around with his chest stuck out, there's no bragging to him at all - he just loves to compete and he's very good at what he does.’","Daveon Hill eats 10 egg whites and two packs of oatmeal just for breakfast .

The Nazi war criminal, who died aged 100 last week, has spoken from beyond the grave in a video released posthumously by his lawyer. Former SS captain Eric Priebke was serving a life sentence in Rome for his part in the 1944 massacre of the Ardeatine Caves. Nazi officers rounded up and shot more than 300 Italian men and boys in a reprisal attack for the killing of German soldiers by resistance fighters. It is considered the worst atrocity of World War II on Italian soil. Spoken from the grave: Eric Priebke the Nazi war criminal, who died aged 100 last week, has spoken from beyond the grave in a video released posthumously by his lawyer . The tape will bring little solace to the relatives of those who died. In the footage, recorded before he died, Priebke continues to show no remorse, claiming instead that if he had refused to follow the orders he would have been executed alongside his victims. Incredibly, Priebke even attempts to solicit pity, by describing the reality of having to carry out the execution style murders as a ‘terrible’ experience, for him more so than others who had more experience with death. He said: ‘Like for anyone else it was terrible to have to do such a thing. Captain Schultz the organiser, had fought in Russia against the Red Army, so he was more used to death, but for others like me and my colleagues it was a terrible thing.’ It would have been unthinkable to refuse the direct order from the Fuhrer, Priebke claimed. ‘Naturally it was impossible to refuse. Schultz said it was an order from Hitler and we had to carry it out. He said if anyone didn’t want to do it they may as well line up with those who were to be executed. There was no other way.’ The coffin of Priebke was taken to a military airport near Rome after the funeral was halted . Transferred: The van with Erich Priebke's coffin  leaves from the town for the airport . Refusing to make any apology for his crimes, Priebke instead blamed the resistance fighters, for provoking the attack. The partisans were fully aware of the consequences, he said. ‘What happened in Via Rasella was that the CAP the communists attacked a troop of German police. They did this knowing there would be a reprisal. 'The commander when he arrived in Rome had put on the wall warnings that any attack against Germans would meet with a reprisal. They knew that and they did it anyway.’ The tape was released, as an extract of much more extensive footage, by lawyer Paolo Ghiachini as a battle raged over Priebke's final burial place. Violent protests by Jewish and anti-fascist groups had disrupted his funeral in Italy. And Priebke’s birth town of Hennigsdorf in South Germany had claimed they only offered burial to residents. Undecided: The Pratica di Mare military airport, near Rome, where the coffin of the German war criminal Erich Priebke has been taken . Anger: People protest as the car with the body of Erich Priebke arrives at the church of Lefebvriani . Violence: Locals and anti-fascist protesters show their disgust as the car with the body of Erich Priebke arrives at the church in Albano Laziale, Italy . Anger: Hundreds of people shouted 'murderer' and 'executioner' jeered the coffin of Priebke as it arrived for a funeral Mass in the Roman suburb . Argentina’s foreign minister said accepting the body would be ‘an affront to human dignity’ Priebke’s coffin was on Friday awaiting a decision at the a military airport in Rome. Ghiachini said that it was ‘possible’ that the corpse would be buried in Germany. The former Nazi was casually dressed for the interview at his home in an open necked blue shirt and black waistcoat. Priebke who speaks in fluent Italian appears lucid and articulate. It is not clear when the tape was recorded. Text that flashed onto the screen at the beginning says the subject of the interview is his autobiography Vae Victis (Woe to the Vanquished) which was published in 2003. Justice served: The former SS captain at his 1996 conviction . A row has raged for days over the officer's last burial place after because authorities fear the grave could become a site of pilgrimage for his neo-Nazi fanbase . Fascist followers: Italian King Victor Emanuel III, (right) Adolf Hitler (centre) and Benito Mussolini (left) Priebke started his career as a teenage waiter working all over Europe including the Italian Riviera and a happy stint between 1933 and 1935 at the Savoy. He later told friends of the exhilaration of watching the Silver Jubilee of George V. He joined the Gestapo as a translator where he was swiftly promoted and posted to Rome. At the end of the war he was captured by Allied troops but escaped from a British POW camp on New Year’s Eve 1947. He fled to Argentina where he ran a delicatessen and lived openly until tracked down and interviewed by an American journalist. In 1995 he was deported to Italy and given a life sentence. Because of his age he was allowed to serve his time under house arrest at the home of his lawyer.","Eric Priebke was serving a life sentence 1944 massacre of Ardeatine Caves .

Inez Sanchez and Pedro Quezada, from Passaic, New Jersey, got back together on Valentine's Day and are now moving back in together, Quezada's attorney told The North Jersey Record. Sanchez, who has a child and ran a grocery store with Quezada, dropped the suit last week after filing it in November after they broke up. She had claimed that they had agreed to share any lottery winnings. But Quezada's attorney Paul Fernandez argued they had never been married and so she was not legally entitled to the money. At the time, Quezada became depressed that he had lost his family. Back together: Powerball winner Pedro Quezada, pictured right after he emerged as the winner a year ago, has reconciled with his girlfriend Inez Sanchez, left, and she has moved back in with him . 'He went from having all of this family . and no money to having all of this money and no family,' Fernandez said. 'I said, ""Listen, love trumps all. Talk to her."" He called me on Valentine’s Day - . ecstatic - to tell me they were moving back in together.' At a hearing on Friday, Superior Court Chancery Division Judge Margaret Mary McVeigh passed on her best wished to the couple. 'I wish the parties good luck and a wonderful future,' she said. 'I hope this works out for you. Good luck, be happy and find what is most important in life.' It has been far from plain sailing for Quezada since he won the massive payout. The grandfather, who was in arrears with . child support to the tune of $30,000 when he won, enjoyed positive . national headlines when a friend claimed he'd stump up a month’s rent . for his neighbors on his small hard scabble street block - but . afterwards, neighbors revealed he never paid up. Happy again: His lawyer told a depressed Quezada to put everything aside to reunite his family . Return: Sanchez, pictured after the win, had filed a lawsuit for a cut of the money last year . According to Ms Sanchez's attorney earlier this year, a large chunk of the money has already disappeared including $57million that has been sent to Quezada's native Dominican Republic, $300,000 spent on the home in Clifton, and $20 million that can't be located. Quezada also allegedly left his landlord high and dry after making hollow promises he'd pay rent for all of the tenants of 12 School Street, a dead-end block behind a high school where families live in brick walk up tenement style apartments. 'He got lucky and it would have been a good act to pay the rent,' Serafim Ariza, 19, told MailOnline. 'He promised the whole street but he never followed through.' At Big Apple Deli on 8th Street, the bodega Quezada used to manage, he hasn’t won many friends by allegedly forsaking his former customers. 'He didn't come back here,' George Cruz told MailOnline. 'He didn’t remember where he came from. He forgot.' Former life: Quezada promised to pay everyone's rent in his old street - but reportedly never did . Cruz claimed Quesada relied on girlfriend Ines Sanchez to cover the cost of his deli’s inventory. 'She helped him with $15,000 to put into that grocery store,' Cruz said. 'She paid for the stuff.' 'With that kind of money you still got to take care of the wife and kid. Goddamn, look out for her. Don't be a hardball. With that kind of money you have to buy her a house.' Superior Court Chancery Judge McVeigh decided not to throw out Ms Sanchez's lawsuit in November, but she did deny Ms Sanchez's request to freeze Quezada's lottery money. The judge explained that while she acknowledged the long term relationship as well as Sanchez's contributions to the household, but she legally she could not restrain Quezada's assets. 'That’s what money does to people: It changes positive relationships into bad ones,' McVeigh said. 'It doesn’t always enhance a relationship, or bring out people’s better qualities.

Busted: GiAnni Henderson faces a litany of charges after police say her toddler fell out of her car while she was driving . A Missouri mother faces multiple charges after police say her toddler fell out of her moving car Sunday as she drove up a highway entrance ramp. GiAnni Henderson, 30, of Kansas City, may have been drunk and high Sunday night when she was trying to merge onto a highway just outside the city when her one-year-old baby somehow tumbled out of the car. Even more surprisingly, the child was saved by a passing motorist. The good samaritan tended to the child until paramedics arrived and was taken to a local hospital with only minor injuries, KMBC reported. Witnesses told police Henderson was making a turn just before 6:00 p.m. when the child fell out of the carâ€™s back seat. Another child was in the car but managed to stay inside, sources said.

Swollen rivers and impassable roads left hundreds of people cut off in rural areas of Montana yesterday, while in neighboring Wyoming, members of the National Guard joined the fight to protect two towns threatened by high water. Authorities warned the flooding could get worse with more rain and snow expected early today. Montana Governor Steve Bullock declared a flood emergency late yesterday after forecasters put 30 of the state's 56 counties under some type of high water warning. Musselshell County in central Montana . appeared to be hardest hit. Dirt roads in rural areas turned to mud, . some bridges were blocked by high water and the Musselshell River . threatened to overcome protective dikes in Roundup. Scroll down for video . Inundated: Residents in Livingston, Montana began sandbagging their properties on Thursday after melting snow flooded creeks and ditches and sent water running down city streets . Bad weather: This NOAA satellite image taken yesterday shows a low pressure/cold front with rain and snow affecting the Pacific Northwest, northern California, Idaho, and western Montana . Warm weather over the past week unleashed massive amounts of water from record snowfalls that have blanketed the region. That pushed many streams and rivers over their banks, authorities said. Impassable roads cut off about 350 people south and east of Roundup, Musselshell County disaster coordinator Jeff Gates said. Officials advised residents to stay in place if possible, and were crafting plans to ensure sufficient food and medical supplies were available to any stranded residents. Hundreds more in the Dean Creek subdivision southwest of Roundup also were cut off for a time until the situation improved yesterday evening. But officials advised residents to remain ready to leave if necessary. Temperatures were forecast to drop below freezing overnight as the rain turns to snow. 'If it freezes and we get snow the roads will freeze and it will help us,' Gates said. Dangerous: A state of emergency has been declared in the city of Livingston, Montana, making some roads impossible to pass through . In Wyoming, Guard members stacked up sand bags in Manderson and Greybull. The National Weather Service says sandbags were used to divert water around the Manderson school and water treatment plant. No evacuations were reported. Seven homes were damaged in Greybull over the weekend but the extent of damage wasn't immediately clear, said Wyoming Office of Homeland Security spokeswoman Kelly Ruiz. Video posted by the homeland security office showed the river full of ice chunks yesterday and a home protected by sand bags surrounded by water. Mountain snowpack across both states already is well above average, setting the stage for more high water when the spring runoff arrives. That's expected in May or early June, said National Weather Service forecaster Chauncy Schultz. Officials were keeping a wary eye on ice-jams along the Musselshell River west of Roundup, which has about 1,900 people. Ice jams also were reported on the Yellowstone, Big Horn and other rivers in Montana and Wyoming. If the ice jams break free, water levels downstream could rise and more people in low-lying areas evacuated on short notice, Gates said. A makeshift dike in Roundup built after flooding three years ago was successfully holding back the water. Crisis management: Emergency workers are trying to  remove sediment from the Livingston Ditch as flooding water flows in from the alley between North Seventh and Eighth streets Thursday . Flooded: Recent heavy snowfall and warm temperatures in Montana have caused rapid snow melt and flooding . Economic cost: In the town of Manhattan (pictured), Mayor Dave Rowell said flooding in the downtown area late last week caused at least a million dollars in damages . By late yesterday, the Musselshell had risen to levels not seen since severe flooding damaged hundreds of homes in 2011. More than two dozen houses near the Musselshell River were evacuated. Schools in Roundup were canceled for today in anticipation that many teachers and students would not be able to make it. The National Weather Service said a powerful Pacific storm system moving into the region would bring rain and wet snow through early today. More than an inch of precipitation was forecast in some areas. Bullock's emergency declaration allows the Democrat to mobilize state resources - including the National Guard if necessary - to help local authorities. 'We're quite concerned about the moisture that's going to drop in the Little Belt Mountains and the Snowy Mountains. That could add more issues along the Musselshell River and in Roundup,' said Steve Knecht, chief of operations for Montana Disaster and Emergency Services. Missoula's Rattlesnake Valley, Montana: A February 28 avalanche destroyed a house, but three people were found alive amid the snow and wreckage . Missoula's Rattlesnake Valley, Montana: Rescuers dug frantically while searching for a boy trapped under an avalanche on February 28 . In Yellowstone County, high waters that flooded the basements of many homes were starting to dissipate, said county emergency services director Duane Winslow. Five homes south of Laurel remained evacuated. A boil water order was in effect in Clyde Park north of Livingston, the Billings Gazette reported. In the town of Manhattan, about 19 miles northwest of Bozeman, Mayor Dave Rowell said flooding in the downtown area late last week caused at least a million dollars in damages, television station KTVM reported. Meanwhile, on February 28, a human-triggered avalanche swept down Mount Jumbo in Missoula's Rattlesnake Valley, destroying a home inside the city limits and burying three people.

In his latest jab at the Palin family, Levi Johnston has announced he will take on Todd Palin in next year's Iron Dog snowmobile race. Johnston, who had a child with former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's daughter Bristol in 2008, told TMZ that it's been his lifelong dream to enter the three-day, 2000-mile race through the Alaskan wilderness. But his main goal in entering 'the world's logesnt, roughest snowmobile race' is taking down Todd Palin, Sarah's husband and his son Tripp's grandfather. Watch your back Todd! Levi Johnston (left), former fiance of Sarah Palin's daughter Bristol, plans to take on Todd Palin (right) in the Iron Dog snowmobile race next year . Power couple: Todd Palin pictured with wife Sarah at a celebration for Christian evangelical Billy Graham's 95th birthday last November . Champion: Todd Palin has won the Iron Dog race four times, but had to pull out of this year's race after just 100 miles due to mechanical problems. Pictured above in 2009 . While Todd has won the race four times in the past, Johnston may have an advantage since Todd hasn't won since 2007 and had to pull out of this year's race after just 100 miles due to mechanical problems. And Johnston has all year to prepare since the next race is 348 days away. Johnston became semi-famous during the 2008 presidential election when it was revealed that Bristol was pregnant with his child. Bristol's pregnancy caused controversy since the two were unmarried and still in high school, but that was semi-quelled when Sarah announced the two were getting hitched. Teen mom: Johnston and Bristol caused controversy on Sarah Palin's 2008 campaign trail when it was revealed the unmarried teen couple were expecting a baby . Some said Sarah forced the marriage on her daughter, a claim Johnston has consistently denied. 'We were planning on getting married a long time ago with or without the kid. This was the plan from the start,' Johnston said. Bristol and Johnston's son Tripp Easton Mitchell Johnston was born in December 2008, but the two broke off their engagement the following March. After their break-up, Johnston became outspoken against the Palin family, saying in a September 2009 Vanity Fair article that Sarah initially wanted to keep Bristol's pregnancy a secret. Happier times: Bristol and Johnston had son Tripp in December 2008. After two failed engagements, Johnston has since married another woman . Johnston said Sarah offered to adopt and raise their child as her own, but that they declined. In response, Sarah issued a statement saying Johnston's statements were 'untrue, malicious, and appalling'. The young couple briefly reunited in July 2010, with Johnston issuing a public apology to the Palin family for statements he made that 'were not completely' true. But the couple broke off their second engagement just three weeks later, and Johnston said he regretted making the public apology to the Palin family. He said the statement 'kind of makes me sound like a liar. I've never lied about anything'. Johnston is currently married to Sunny Oglesby and the two have a one-year-old daughter named Breeze. He published a tell-all memoir of his life with the Palins in September 2011 titled 'Deer in the Headlights: My Life in Sarah Palin's Crosshairs'.","Johnston has a son with Sarah and Todd Palin's daughter Bristol, but the couple are now estranged .

A secretive group of Government art experts is to announce the fate of the painting Beaching A Boat, Brighton, owned by Tate Britain, in the next few weeks.

Neither the Tate nor Government officials would yesterday name the art work in question – nor who is making the ownership claim. But The Mail on Sunday has established it is Constable’s Beaching A Boat, Brighton. It was owned by a French collector in 1908 – but turned up in a Cotswolds gallery in the 1960s where it appears to have been bought by a British woman called Mrs Rainsford who gave it to the Tate. The arcanely titled Government-run Spoliation Advisory Panel is to rule on whether the Tate must give up the 1824 oil painting.

A spokesman for RAF Tern Hill said: 'There is an on-going police investigation. We have nothing further to say.' Base: The barracks opened in 1916 and is currently home to 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment . History: The barracks hit the headlines on February 20, 1989 after a pair of IRA terrorists activated two bombs within the accommodation block . The dead soldier is from the same battalion deployed only last month to help flood-stricken communities in Worcestershire, after record amounts of rain fell across the UK. Members of the unit met Prime Minister David Cameron when he toured some of the county's flood defences at Upton-upon-Severn on February 17. During that visit, Mr Cameron praised the soldiers' efforts in using their troop carriers to set up a shuttle bus service to get people from one side of the flooded river to the other, while residents also expressed their delight at the military's presence. The unit returned to its Shropshire barracks after the floodwater receded. Although it can trace its origins back to 1688, the Royal Irish Regiment formed in 1992 when the Royal Irish Rangers was merged with the Ulster Defence Regiment. The 1st Battalion, based at Ternhill, Shropshire, is a light role battalion, rotating with two other line infantry/rifles battalions in the air assault role as part of 16 Air Assault Brigade. The Regiment recruits from all sections of the Northern Irish community, on both sides of the sectarian divide. In September 2008 the battalion completed . a tour in Afghanistan and it became the first unit in the Army to . receive three Conspicuous Gallantry Crosses (CGC) in a single operation . Recently troops from the battalion deployed to Mali in support of the EU training mission and the most recent battalion size operational deployment was in 2011 as part of Operation HERRICK 13 in Afghanistan. Clive Barracks opened in 1916 and has been home to 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment since 2007 when the battalion moved from Fort George, Inverness.

The wife of the late William Clay Ford is set to take over his controlling interest in the Detroit Lions after the longtime owner's death at the weekend. The Lions announced on Monday that Ford's interest in the team will pass to Martha Ford, 79, pursuant to ‘long-established succession plans.’ Ford married the former Martha Parke Firestone, an heiress to the Akron, Ohio, rubber and tires fortune in 1947. Her grandfather, Harvey Firestone, was a close friend of Henry Ford. Scroll down for video . The Detroit Lions have announced that Martha Ford, the widow of William Clay Ford who died on Sunday, has taken over her late husband's controlling interest in the success-starved franchise . One of the great passions of William Clay Ford's life was the Detroit Lions who he purchased in the early 1960s . William Clay Ford, the last surviving grandchild of automotive pioneer Henry Ford,died on Sunday at age 88. The couple had three daughters, a son, 14 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Funeral services will be private. Their son, William Clay Ford Jr., will remains in his role as vice chairman of the Lions. Ford Motor Co. said in a statement on Sunday that Ford died of pneumonia at his home in Grosse Pointe, Mich. Ford helped steer the family business for more than five decades. He bought one of his own, the NFL franchise in the Motor City, a half-century ago. He served as an employee and board member of the automaker for more than half of its 100-year history. William Clay Ford Jr., sitting with his mother, will remains in his existing role as vice chairman of the Lions . William Clay Ford Sr. the owner of the Detroit Lions, has died at the age of 88 today . 'My father was a great business leader and humanitarian who dedicated his life to the company and the community,' William Clay Ford Jr., executive chairman of Ford Motor Co. and Lions vice chairman, said in a statement. 'He also was a wonderful family man, a loving husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather. He will be greatly missed by everyone who knew him, yet he will continue to inspire us all.' Ford was regarded as a dignified man by the select few who seemed to know him well. To the masses in Detroit, he was simply the owner of the Lions who struggled to achieve success on the field despite showing his passion for winning by spending money on free agents, coaches, executives and facilities. Ford's first full season leading the Lions was in 1964, seven years after the franchise won the NFL title.

The lone playoff victory he enjoyed was in 1992. The Lions are the only team to go 0-16 in a season, hitting rock bottom in 2008. After an 11-year drought, the Lions improved enough to make the playoffs in 2011 only to lose a combined 21 games over the next two seasons. 'No owner loved his team more than Mr. Ford loved the Lions,' Lions President Tom Lewand said in a statement released by the team. 'Those of us who had the opportunity to work for Mr. Ford knew of his unyielding passion for his family, the Lions and the city of Detroit. His leadership, integrity, kindness, humility and good humor were matched only by his desire to bring a Super Bowl championship to the Lions and to our community. 'Each of us in the organization will continue to relentlessly pursue that goal in his honor.' Detroit Lions owner and chairman William Clay Ford, pictured here along the sidelines of a football game, was loved by all who knew him . Born into an automotive fortune in 1925 bearing what was already a household name, Ford was 23 when he joined the Ford Motor Co. board of directors in 1948, one year after the death of his grandfather, Henry Ford. He maintained as low a profile as his name would allow, serving on various executive committees and spearheading the design, development and introduction of the Continental Mark II in 1956. He was elected a Ford vice chairman in 1980 and retired with that title in 1989. Ford remained a company director until 2005, later taking the title of director emeritus. 'Mr. Ford had a profound impact on Ford Motor Company,' Ford CEO Alan Mulally said in a statement. 'The company extends its deepest sympathies to the many members of the extended Ford family at this difficult time. While we mourn Mr. Ford's death, we also are grateful for his many contributions to the company and the auto industry.' He helped institutionalize the practice of professional management atop the company that began with the naming of Philip Caldwell as Ford CEO in 1979 and as Ford chairman in March 1980, without relinquishing the Ford family's control. William Clay Ford and his bride, the former Martha Firestone, dance after their wedding ceremony in Akron, Ohio,  June 21, 1947 . William Clay Ford Sr. was the last surviving grandson of Henry Ford, founder of Ford Motors . As a board member, Ford helped bring the company back under his family's control in 2001, when the directors ousted former CEO Jacques Nasser in favor of William Clay Ford Jr. The youngest of Edsel B. Ford's four children, Ford Sr. was first elected to the Ford Motor Co. board in June 1948. He rarely spoke publicly but was reflective during the company's centennial year in 2003. At the annual meeting, he told stories about his grandfather teaching him to drive at age 10, and of being taken for his first airplane ride in a Ford Tri-Motor by Charles Lindbergh. 'I just want you to know that we have tremendous pride in the Ford name,' he told the shareholders more than a decade ago. 'We have a spirit of working together, and we have a passion for cars. And we also have a great desire to see the Ford name in the forefront of world transportation.' Ford always kept the Lions close to his heart. He knew how much the team meant to people who lived in or grew up in Michigan. 'I think sports are a wonderful diversion,' Ford told The Detroit News in 1980. 'People can relate to sports very easily. It's a quick study.' But while each of the Motor City's other three professional franchises - the Red Wings, Pistons and Tigers - won at least one championship, the Lions were synonymous with losing under Ford. Martha Ford's grandfather, Harvey Firestone, left, was a close friend of William Ford's grandfather Henry, right . 'No owner loved his team more than Mr. Ford loved the Lions,' Lions President Tom Lewand said in a statement released by the team . He seemed to lead the Lions with a light touch, leaving most decisions up to administrators such as Russ Thomas, Chuck Schmidt, Matt Millen and current general manager Martin Mayhew. Even though the franchise rarely produced a successful product, the stands are usually filled with fans desperate to witness a winner. 'Detroit, and I'm not blowing smoke at anybody, is probably the greatest fan sports town in the country,' Ford told The News in 1980, the year after a 2-14 team set a franchise attendance record. 'They'll support anything.' Ford moved the club from Tiger Stadium in Detroit to the Pontiac Silverdome in 1975 before bringing his team back downtown. Ford Field - a spectacular 65,000-seat, $315 million indoor stadium - opened in 2002 that, coupled with a state-of-the-art team headquarters in nearby Allen Park, gave the Lions the best facilities money could buy. But a blueprint for consistently winning was elusive. From Ford's first season as team owner to his last, the Lions won 310 games, lost 441 and tied 13.","The Detroit Lions have announced that Martha Ford, 79, the widow of William Clay Ford, will assume control following her husband's death .

A therapist has been sent to prison after pleading guilty to having sex with his teenage patient. Scott Andrew Peterson has begun serving his sentence of between one and 15 years in the Utah State Prison. Peterson, 36, had a sexual relationship with a female patient who was 14-years-old at the time of their affair. Cutting a deal: Scott Andrew Peterson, seen in court on Monday, will spend between 1 and 15 years in prison . They began having sexual contact in March 2013, and it continued until August. The Salt Lake Tribune reports that the inappropriate relationship only ended when his business closed. Judge John Morris called the licensed social worker's behavior 'utterly reprehensible'. 'You can't un-ring the bell,' Judge Morris said on Monday. His Mormon victim and her family were in the Farmington courtroom on Monday but they did not make any statements. The police investigation was launched after the girl, whose name has not been released due to the nature of the crimes, told her bishop about the alleged abuse. Accepting fault: Peterson was arrested in November and has stayed in custody since because he wanted to start paying his price as soon as possible . The legal department for the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-day Saints then told police who arrested Peterson in November. The charging documents noted that Peterson 'occupied a position of special trust' with the girl and exposed himself. He was stripped of his clinical license in November as well, and his lawyer said that he was hoping to avoid prison time on account of the fact that he admitted his guilt and opted to remain in police custody since his arrest. Caught: The abuse started in March 2013 and ended when his business closed in August of that year . 'There were a lot of positive things that Mr Peterson did that I was hoping would persuade (the judge) not to impose prison time,' his lawyer Tara Isaacson said to The Salt Lake Tribune. 'He obviously felt incredibly guilty and wanted to start the punishment process.' Public records list him as being married to Andrea Harrison Peterson, who is also 36. As part of the plea deal, his charge was lessened from the original first degree felony sodomy, three counts of second-degree felony forcible sexual abuse and one count of misdemeanor lewdness. He plead guilty to one count of forcible sex abuse, and has been ordered to pay an unidentified amount of restitution to the girl and her family.","Scott Peterson has plead guilty of forcible sex abuse .

A Tennessee pastor seeking to encourage better behavior in after-church diners has created a website where restaurant servers can vent about the 'rude, impatient and lousy tippers' who are the bane of their every Sunday. The site, called Sundays are the Worst, launched on March 2 and will run until Easter Sunday. Chad Roberts, pastor at Preaching Christ Church in Downtown Kingsport began the campaign after hearing about St Louis Applebees server who waited on pastor Alois Bell and received, instead of a tip, a note that read 'I give God ten per cent, why do you get 18?' Unholy: Servers have inundated the site with horror stories about the behavior of Christians who dine out on Sundays after church . 'We started seeing these terrible comments people were writing - ""this is why I don't go to church,"" ""this is why I hate christians,"" ""this is what Christians are like"" Roberts told ABC 19. He decided he wanted to do something about the 'church crowd' and help change the attitudes of both servers and church-goers. 'The two goals we have with this are number one, that Christians would begin to realize that their attitude really matters when they go to eat,' Roberts said. 'The second goal is that particularly unchurched servers would understand that not all Christians are rude, impatient, lousy tippers. That’s what we want to communicate.' Since its launch, Sundays Are The Worst has already been inundated with missives from servers whose experiences with Christians are nothing short of unholy. Christians are, on the whole, cheap, arrogant and rude, according to the servers' experiences chronicled on the site. Common experiences include being left fake money which actually turns out to be a religious tract instead of a tip, being abused for working on a holy day, and being gypped on the tip. Campaign: Pastor Chad Roberts wants Christians to change their behavior towards servers . 'You people are the rudest, nastiest, most unappreciative people we as restaurant workers, have EVER waited on. You ask any restaurant worker, Sunday’s are the worst! From the comments, “You shouldn’t be open!” to “Your going to hell for not being in church!” It’s funny though, for if we were not working… you people wouldn’t EAT! (sic)' fumed one. '... It is not only after church that Christians are viewed as poor customers. It is well known among servers that the more “Christian” a customer appeared to be, the more likely it would be that they would be rude and tip badly. If a table started praying before the meal we knew not to expect to be tipped well, if at all,' wrote another. 'The single thread that flows through all of this behavior is the arrogance. The idea that leaving a tract (i.e. pushing your religious views down someones throat while they are trying to work) is acceptable period, let alone a reasonable substitute for paying for a service you receive,' wrote another server. Stingy: Tennessee servers say Sundays are their busiest yet least profitable day . Arrogant: This waitperson was treated badly by a group of women who then 'gave her tip to Jesus' 'The quote many servers have heard “I give God 10% so why should I give you 15%?”, as though tithing makes someone too good to pay for services they receive. (Please note that they always say 15%, despite the fact that 15% has not been an acceptable level of tipping for the past two decades. 15% is what you are supposed to give for poor service.) (sic)' Roberts and his team are responding with a personal written apology to each hospitality worker who leaves a story on the site. Each week during the campaign, one server who has shared their story will receive a Food City gift card that can be redeemed for groceries or gas. 'It’s a way for our church to tell the serving community that we’re sorry for what you have to go through on Sundays and that we really do appreciate you and what you do for our community,' Roberts said. The pastor has asked his congregation to double the tip amount if they dine out at a restaurant on Easter Sunday, when the campaign will end. Roberts intends to start is up again at the same time next year.","Tennessee pastor Chad Roberts created 'Sundays are the Worst' where servers could vent about after-church customers .

Taylor Swift has walked into trouble in the exclusive beachside community where she bought an $18million vacation home this summer - building an enormous sea wall that has left local residents furious. After the 24-year-old singer purchased the largest and most lavish property in Watch Hill, Rhode Island - a neighborhood filled with large and lavish properties – she began rebuilding a seawall on the beach in front of the mansion. The construction project, which began with no public notice, has made some neighbors and longtime residents of the area furious because it restricts access to a public beach and interferes with fishermen and surfers who have been using the stretch of sand for generations. ‘I don’t know how the hell they let her . do this without approval or nothing,’ a furious Richard Bishop, 76, told . MailOnline as he climbed atop the wall to survey the development. Scroll down for video . Controversial construction: This is the seawall being built at her exclusive Rhode Island mansion that has left her neighbors seriously unimpressed . Protection: The diggers are working to rip up the coastline around the exclusive and historic Water Hill mansion in Rhode Island . Workers are filling in the sand behind a seawall that is a popular hangout for the community and piling large boulders in front of the wall. Mr Bishop has been fishing on the Watch Hill beach since he moved to the neighborhood in 1961. The new boulders piled in front of the wall, he says, will block him – or anyone else – from getting around the seawall and cross the public beach. Pete Silva, 31, who was born and raised in the nearby town of Westerly, Rhode Island, said that the construction covers up years of history. The seawall has been a popular spot for teenagers to hangout for longer than he’s been alive. It’s also become a makeshift memorial of sorts of for his friend Trevor Johnson, who drowned there in 2004. I can't believe it: Richard Bishop expresses his disbelief at the huge construction work going on behind him at Taylor Swift's Rhode Island home . Rage: Richard Bishop walks past Taylor Swift's seawall at her Rhode Island home which is on a historic part of the New England coast . Too high: Mr. Bishop explained that the wall was constructed without necessary approval and has become an eyesore . The construction work has covered over the memorial. And Swift's security guards have begun chasing residents off the sea wall - even though the previous owners allowed locals to use it for decades, Mr Silva said. ‘There’s a lot of meaning in that wall. Now nobody will be able to use it,’ he said. Other residents say that the new construction on the seawall is an eyesore. It is the only structure jutting out in a long stretch of idyllic New England beach. A publicist for Swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The construction has caught residents off guard. Swift did not have to acquire building permits from the town and only had to obtain permission from the state Coastal Resources Management Council – an environmental organization that held no hearings before granting her permission to undertake the construction – estimated at more than a million dollars. ‘I just can’t believe she didn’t need permits for it,’ 48-year-old James Tuscano said. Guard: Construction outside a property owned by Taylor Swift's is getting attention from locals of Westerley Rhode Island for changes to the shoreline at a public beach where many swim, surf and fish . Lavish: Taylor Swift's new ritzy $17m beach front Rhode Island home. According to US reports, the pop superstar paid just over $17m in cash to secure this 5 bedroomed, 11,000 square foot, beach front property in Rhode Island's upmarket Water Hill . Laura Dwyer, a spokeswoman for the Coastal Resources Management Council, said the seawall itself predates Swift's purchase of the 1930 home - and possibly dates back to the 1938 hurricane the savaged the coast. Swift is merely bringing it back up to standard after decades of disrepair, she told MailOnline. Residents were happy when Swift purchased the 11,000-square-foot Harkness House this summer. She reportedly bought it outright with a single $17.75million wire transfer. Watch Hill has long been a playground for the extremely wealthy – the Harkness House itself was built by a Standard Oil heiress. But Swift brought a fame to the wealthy community that it hasn’t seen in decades. Then, just days after the purchase, a fan, Lucas H. Vorsteveld, 22, of Chicago, was arrested trying to enter the property.

Swift responded by ringing the property with a six foot fence and posting security guard on the premises 24 hours a day – even when she isn’t there. On Monday as Mr Bishop examined the seawall, two guards peered down from the cliff above – watching him.  Minutes later, a Westerly police cruiser arrived in the driveway of the home. 'I'm sure she's a perfectly nice lady, she just doesn't know what this is all doing to us here,' Mr Silva said. Residents say Swift spent little time at the property last summer. It was mostly used by her parents Scott and Andrea. 'One who the guys who lives on the other side of her, he is p****d because she put up that six-foot fence all along his property line,' Mr Bishop, the fisherman, said.

Police say the boy was knocked down by a volleyball thrown at his head last month at Parma Senior High School. One student then allegedly kicked the victim and another dragged him around by his feet. Scene: The incident occurred inside the Parma High School gym (pictured, but the students involved are not shown) during class and the teacher knew it was happening . Police say 49-year-old substitute teacher Gregg Mellinger continued class in another part of the gym as the victim remained on the floor. Mellinger, of North Ridgeville, was charged last week with child endangerment. He didn't immediately return a phone call Monday. Three students face juvenile charges of assault and two students are charged with disorderly conduct. Authorities say the boy wasn't seriously injured. School officials called the conduct unacceptable. 'This is something that we've been taking seriously for a very long time,' superintendent Jeff Graham told The Cleveland Plain Dealer. He released a statement stressing the action that was taken as soon as school officials were notified, making clear that the substitute teacher was not a full time employee and was hired through an outside agency. Unacceptable: The teacher now faces criminal charges, three students face juvenile charges of assault and two students are charged with disorderly conduct . 'Upon learning of the incident, school officials immediately notified the Parma Police Department and fully cooperated with their investigation,' Graham wrote in the statement. 'In addition to any potential legal consequences from the Police Department, the District is conducting its own school investigation and will take any necessary steps consistent with district policy.' The staffing agency who hired Mellinger was identified as The Renhill Group, and they have already spoken out against his actions. 'We're deeply troubled by the allegations; the safety of the students of Ohio is our top priority,' the company's risk manager, Tami Stansley, said.","The victim and students involved have not been identified but the 49-year-old substitute teacher has been named as Gregg Mellinger .

"UK warns that it is prepared to use force to stop Iran blocking the Strait of Hormuz . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 01:54 EST, 6 January 2012 . The U.S. and Israel are planning a massive military exercise in the Persian Gulf in an attempt to face down Iran over its sabre-rattling in the region. But the Islamic Republic is also preparing war games in the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic oil route which the country has threatened to block off in a move which could seriously restrict energy supplies. Britain's Defence Secretary yesterday said that the UK would take military action to prevent Iran - which is believed to be developing secret nuclear weapons - from cutting off the strait. Under threat: U.S. warships carrying 17,000 personnel enter the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz . Iran announced last night that an annual naval exercise known as 'The Great Prophet' would take place in the strait next month. Admiral Ali Fadavi, naval commander of the country's Revolutionary Guards, said the drill would be 'different' to previous years, but did not specify how. The move could clash with a plan by Israel’s military to gear up with U.S. forces in staging major missile defence exercises in the region. The . drills, called Austere Challenge 12, are designed to improve defence . systems and co-operation between the forces and would be the largest . ever held by the two countries. Thousands . of U.S. and Israeli soldiers will take part as they test multiple air . defence systems against incoming missiles and rockets. Israel has deployed the Arrow system, . jointly developed and funded with the U.S., which is designed to . intercept Iranian missiles in the stratosphere, far from the country. A . statement from the Israeli military said: ‘U.S. European Command . routinely works with partner nations to ensure their capacity to provide . for their own security and, in the case of Israel, their qualitative . military edge.’ Threat: Iranian television broadcast this video of a missile being launched from an unknown location on Sunday . Philip Hammond, the UK's Defence Secretary, warned the regime in Tehran that Britain will not tolerate the ‘very significant consequences’ if it fulfils a threat to block the Strait of Hormuz. He signalled that such action would be blocked by force of arms.Mr Hammond used a speech in Washington to warn Iran that any move to close the key Gulf trade route would be opposed by the Royal Navy. ‘Any attempt by Iran to do this would be illegal and unsuccessful,’ he said in a speech at the Atlantic Council. Then in a television interview, Mr . Hammond said he wanted to send a ‘very clear message to Iran’ that the . UK would not allow the Strait of Hormuz to be closed. The Royal Navy operates mine clearance vessels in the Gulf as part of a joint taskforce based in Bahrain. He said: ‘We are an integrated part . of the naval taskforce in the Gulf and one of the missions of that . taskforce is to ensure that those shipping lanes remain open. 'Any . attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz would be illegal and we need to . send a very clear message to Iran that we are determined that the Strait . should remain open.’ More than 15million barrels of oil pass through the narrow stretch of water between Iran and the United Arab Emirates every day. Iran has threatened to block the 34-mile wide strait in retaliation for a planned EU trade embargo on Iranian oil. The planned embargo is an attempt to persuade Iran to abandon plans to develop a nuclear weapon. Base: The 'mothership' is most likely to be located in the Persian Gulf, pictured . Mr . Hammond said: ‘Very clearly the Strait of Hormuz is one of the great . commercial arteries of the world – it must remain open and flowing, or . there would be very significant consequences for the economies of the . region and indeed of the world. 'We’ve . heard these kinds of threats from Iran before, but there should be no . miscalculation by the Iranians about the importance that the . international community attaches to keeping the Strait of Hormuz open.’ Mr Hammond was in Washington for his first meeting with his U.S. counterpart, Leon Panetta. They held talks at the Pentagon yesterday on Afghanistan, Iran and other military matters. In his speech, Mr Hammond also pointed to the economic crisis as the most serious threat to national and international security. He spoke out as President Obama yesterday rolled out a new defence strategy that will shrink the U.S. armed forces, but pledged to maintain the country’s position as the world’s dominant military power. He has already earmarked budget cuts of $489billion (£315billion) over ten years as the pace of spending slows more than a decade after the September 11, 2001, attacks. Mr Hammond said countries would have to work together more to reduce the ‘astronomical’ costs of modern warfare. ‘Without strong economies and stable public finances it is impossible to build and sustain, in the long-term, the military capability required to project power and maintain defence,’ he said. ‘That is why today the debt crisis should be considered the greatest strategic threat to the future security of our nations.’ Last month, the head of the British armed forces said the biggest strategic risk facing the UK was economic rather than military. General Sir David Richards, the Chief of the Defence Staff, said ‘no country can defend itself if bankrupt’.",UK warns that it is prepared to use force to stop Iran blocking the Strait of Hormuz .
"By . Candace Sutton . PUBLISHED: . 02:10 EST, 10 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 10:40 EST, 10 March 2014 . A man has used a a four-engined helicopter drone in an attempt to fly drugs and a mobile phone into a maximum-security prison in Melbourne, police allege. It is believed to be the first time an unmanned small aircraft has been used in an attempt to smuggle drugs into an Australian jail. In what is a hi-tech version of throwing drugs over prison walls, drones have been used to smuggle contraband into US and Canadian prisons, as the devices have become relatively cheap on the market. A man has used a four-engined helicopter drone, similar to the device pictured (above) to attempt to fly a package with drugs and a mobile phone over the wall of a prison in western Melbourne . Victoria Police spokeswoman Belinda Batty said police and and its helicopter unit, Air Wing, were called to the Metropolitan Remand Centre in Ravenhall, in western Melbourne, about 4.30pm yesterday. Corrections staff are believed to have seen or heard the drone hovering over the facility during the last visits session at the prison, which houses 700 male inmates. A 28-year-old man was allegedly operating the drone from a vehicle he was parked in with a woman near the facility. He was trying to deliver the drugs and the phone over one of the jail's perimeter walls to an inmate. Police arrested and charged the man, after which Corrections Victoria prison officers reportedly searched the prison and interviewed an inmate. On Sunday afternoon during the last visits session for the 700 maximum security male inmates at the Metropolitan Remand Centre (above) in the outer western suburb of Ravenwell, prison officers were alerted to a helicopter drone buzzing in the air nearby and police were called in to arrest a man who was sitting in a vehicle on the street allegedly operating the device . Victorian Police have yet to say what charges the man has been bailed to face in court. Small remotely piloted aircraft cost as little as $300, are readily available from television and computer retailers and can easily be operated using a smart phone. Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) told the MailOnline currently 70 commercial operators were licensed to use drones, but permission was not needed to operate a craft for recreational use. 'The restrictions are you keep them at least 30 metres away from property or people and that they fly under a maximum height of 400 feet (120m) so as to not interfere with aircraft,' CASA spokesman, Peter Gibson said. Under proposed legislation yet to be put to the aviation and other industries, hundreds of small commercially operated drones could take to Australian skies in the next few years under a new weight class system which would free up restrictions on craft weighing two kilograms or less.","Man uses toy helicopter to fly drugs over wall of Australian prison .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 01:51 EST, 10 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 10:15 EST, 10 March 2014 . A former handyman serving life in prison for the 1993 murder of seven people at a suburban Chicago restaurant has been awarded nearly a half-million dollars in a civil lawsuit in which he alleged a jail guard punched him in the face. Victims' relatives Sunday criticized jurors' decision for James Degorski, who, with an accomplice, shot and stabbed two restaurant owners and five workers at Brown's Chicken and Pasta during a botched robbery. Their bodies were found in a walk-in cooler and freezer. Degorski, now 41, accused a Cook County Jail guard of punching him and breaking his cheekbone and eye socket in 2002 - just after Degorski's arrest in what had been one of the most notorious, unsolved murder cases in Illinois history. Convicted: James Degorski was convicted of killing seven people in a botched restaurant robbery and is serving life in prison . 'If broken bones are worth a half-million, then how much are seven lives worth? This just doesn't feel right,' said Ann Ehlenfeldt, a sister of Richard Ehlenfeldt, one of the owners who was killed. But Degorski's attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, hailed the jury's decision, which came Friday after a three-day trial. 'I think it's a beautiful day for civil rights when a jury can put aside emotions and say we are all entitled to our civil rights,' she said. 'It's about protecting the constitutional rights of the least among us.' Despite the $451,000 award, it's not clear whether Degorski will ever see any of the money. Prison officials could seek to seize it to cover costs of imprisoning Degorski at the Menard Correctional Center, southeast of St. Louis, Bonjean said. The cost of keeping a defendant at that prison is around $20,000 a year, according to data from the Illinois Department of Corrections. And even if the money technically becomes his, Degorski would face strict limits on how much he could spend. Typically, inmates at state prisons are barred from spending more than a few hundred dollars a month at prison commissaries. The guard accused of beating Degorski, former Cook County sheriff's deputy Thomas Wilson, may file an appeal, his attorney, John Winters Jr., said. Winters said he may look for other legal means to ensure Degorski never gets the money. Grisly scene: Police found the bodies in a walk-in refrigerator at the Chicago restaurant . 'I will try to get every dime back out of Mr. Degorski,' he said. Winters said he thought U.S. District Judge Robert Dow, who presided over the civil trial, was wrong to rule jurors could not be told any details of the restaurant killings. Prosecutors have said Degorski and his high school friend, Juan Luna, committed the murders during a robbery that netted them less than $2,000. Luna has also been sentenced to life in prison. 'We were only allowed to say he (Degorski) was convicted of murder. ... It wasn't explained to them how vicious this guy was,' Winters said about jurors in the civil case. That was relevant, he added, because his client did know during the 2002 incident about the chilling allegations against Degorski and believed he needed to be aggressive in subduing him. 'Officer Wilson knew who this guy was,' Winters said. 'So when he was attacked, he was going to respond in kind. We believe this was a case of self-defense.' The jury said Degorski should get $225,000 in compensatory damages, which is the amount Cook County must pay, attorneys said; $226,000 in punitive damages would have to be paid by Wilson. 'The system effectively took the shackles on Mr. Degorski and hid what he really is, and put the shackles on my client,' Winters said.","A man convicted of murdering seven people has been awarded almost $500,000 in a civil lawsuit .

A federal judge Wednesday dismissed charges against a diplomat whose New York arrest and strip search spurred an international flap. A ruling filed today said Devyani Khobragade, India's former deputy consul-general, had diplomatic immunity when she was indicted on charges of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her housekeeper and lying about the maid's pay January 9. But the ruling leaves open the possibility prosecutors could bring a new indictment against her. The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan hasn't commented on its plans. Cleared: A federal judge dismissed charges against Devyani Khobragade, 39, saying she had diplomatic immunity when she was indicted on charges of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her housekeeper . Khobragade's attorney, Daniel Arshack, said she feels the rule of law prevailed. ‘The law requires that any prosecution brought against an individual with diplomatic immunity must be dismissed, Arshack said. After . being indicted, she complied with a Department of State order to leave . the U.S. in January. The Indian government then asked Washington to . withdraw a diplomat from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. The U.S. complied. Prosecutors accused Khobragade of making Sangeeta Richard, her housekeeper and nanny, work 100-hour weeks at a salary of just over $1 an hour, far below the legal minimum U.S. wage of $7.25 an hour. They argued that the indictment should stand because Khobragade did not have diplomatic immunity either when she was arrested, or now given that she has left the country. New life: Khobragade's attorney said the mother of two is now working for India's foreign affairs ministry in Delhi . U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin said, however, Khobragade had that immunity on January 9 when the indictment was issued, having the day before been named a counselor to India's mission to the United Nations. ‘Even if Khobragade had no immunity at the time of her arrest and has none now, her acquisition of immunity during the pendency of proceedings mandates dismissal.’ she wrote. ‘The government may not proceed on an indictment obtained when Khobragade was immune from the jurisdiction of the court.’ She also lifted Khobragade's bail and said open arrest warrants based on the indictment must be thrown out. Khobragade is now working for India's foreign affairs ministry in Delhi, said her U.S. lawyer.Federal prosecutors have not said whether they will seek a new indictment. Back home: Devyani Khobragade is pictured with her father, left, as she arrives back in Delhi in January . ‘As the court indicated in its . decision, and as Devyani Khobragade has conceded, there is currently no . bar to a new indictment against her for her alleged criminal conduct, . and we intend to proceed accordingly,’ said James Margolin, a spokesman . for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan. In . January, Khobragade, 39, told an Indian newspaper about her ‘immense . stress’ at leaving behind her daughters - aged seven and four - in New . York along with her husband, who is a U.S. citizen and works as an . academic. ‘I wonder if I will be able to ever reunite with my family, my husband, my little kids. I miss them,’ she told The Sunday Express at the time. Khobragade was charged by a federal grand jury in Manhattan earlier this year with visa fraud and making false statements in a case that has triggered an outcry in India. She was accused of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her New York City housekeeper. The indictment said Khobragade had made multiple false representations to U.S. authorities, or caused them to be made, to obtain a visa for a personal domestic worker. Khobragade, 39, was accused of exploiting her . Indian-born housekeeper and nanny by paying her well under the U.S. minimum wage . Philip Richard, the husband of housekeeper . Sangeeta Richard (pictured), filed a court petition in New Delhi saying . that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat . Devyani Khobragade . She planned to bring the worker to the . United States in September 2012 when she worked at the Consulate General . of India in New York, according to the indictment. Khobragade, . 39, India's deputy consul general in New York, has maintained her . innocence to accusations that she claimed to pay her Indian maid $4,500 . per month but actually gave her far less than the U.S. minimum wage. Her . arrest sparked outrage in India after revelations that she . was strip-searched and thrown in a cell with other criminal defendants . before being released on $250,000 bail. In . a letter to the judge, prosecutors said there was no need for an . arraignment because Khobragade had 'very recently' been given diplomatic . immunity status to leave the United States.

Emirates sponsors both clubs . By . Pete Jenson . PUBLISHED: . 04:51 EST, 1 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 08:54 EST, 1 January 2014 . Cristiano Ronaldo - the man who scored more goals than anyone in 2013 - will take on the player who scored the second most, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, in Real Madrid’s first game of the year on Thursday. Gareth Bale will not travel to Doha for the friendly to be played in the Khalifa International Stadium at 14.45 UK time but a 50,000 sell-out will get to see Ronaldo v Zlatan the rematch. Ronaldo resumes hostilities with Ibrahimovic having got the better of him in the World Cup play-off between Portugal and Sweden in November and across the calendar month. Ready to go: Real Madrid players gather round at training ahead of the friendly with PSG in Doha . The big one: It could all be about two men, star forwards Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Zlatan Ibrahimovic (right) Cristiano Ronaldo: Games 59 Goals 69 . Zlatan Ibrahimovic: Games 58 Goals 47 . He scored 69 goals in 59 games in 2013 with Ibrahimovic trailing in second with 47 goals in 58 games. The meeting of two big European sides on Qatari soil might be a glimpse of the future for Premier League clubs, if they ever get the mid-winter break. The French champions are spending a week at Doha’s Aspire Academy for winter training and for Carlo Ancelotti’s players there is also the chance to turn up the temperature. They were put through their paces in the seven-degree cold of the Spanish capital on Tuesday in the traditional open training session in front of supporters who watched for free. But the 22-degree heat of Qatar awaits them after their seven hour flight on New Year’s day via the Dubai airline Emirates that sponsors both Real and PSG. Bale, who sustained a calf knock in training which kept him out of Madrid’s last game of 2013, worked in the gym in the Tuesday training session and he will stay behind to focus on being fit for Monday’s first league game of the year at home to Celta Vigo. Ready for take-off: Pepe, Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo step on to the plane to take the Real squad to Doha . Taking a seat: The duo had a fantastic 2013, with Ibrahimovic leading his side to Ligue 1 glory while Ronaldo is tipped for the Ballon d'Or . Star coaching team: Zinedine Zidane (left) shows off his skills while Carlo Ancelotti (right) chats to his assistant . The lucrative mid-winter friendly has been a feature of Spanish sides’ December and January programmes in recent years. Barcelona earned an estimated £3.3million for a game in Kuwait in December 2009 and this game forms part of the payment for coach Ancelotti who switched from PSG to Real Madrid in the summer. PSG are owned by Qatar Sports Investment Authority and factored two Doha friendlies into the 4m euro compensation package for Ancelotti. The game has sold out the 50,000 capacity Khalifa International Stadium and the Qataris believe a second Madrid friendly, not necessarily against PSG, will do likewise when played either in the post-World Cup pre-season or next January. As Ronaldo and Ibrahimovic battle to score their first goals of 2014, Bale is hoping to continue his run of nine goals and six assists in 15 matches played if he gets back on the pitch against Celta on Monday. Supporters hope his start to 2014 can be as explosive for Real Madrid as it was in 2013 for Tottenham when he scored 14 goals in the first 20 games of the year.

Accused: Dr Hal Hill, 52, is said to have put the toxic heavy metal into his wife's morning coffee . A respected Tennessee doctor who was nominated for a national award has been accused of poisoning his wife for at least five months by putting Barium into her morning cup of coffee without her knowledge. Dr Hal Hill, 52, is said to have put the toxic heavy metal into wife Liesa’s beverage which he brought her in bed every morning in what seemed to be a tender, loving gesture. In fact each drink was causing her to have stomach problems and feel lethargic, court documents allege. Mrs Hill’s torture came to an end when she supposedly saw him doing it and secretly took a sample which she gave to police. She was shocked when tests showed it contained a high level of Barium - which is used in mouse poison and can be fatal. When Mrs Hill stopped drinking her morning coffee her condition mysteriously improved, and police told her her previous symptoms were consistent with Barium poisoning. She has now filed an emergency order of petition against her husband and won temporary custody of their two children, aged 12 and 11. The astonishing case suggests that behind the couple’s apparently happy marriage of 14 years and Dr Hill’s good standing in the community lay a dark desire to harm his wife. Scroll down for video . Secret: Each drink caused Liesa to have stomach problems and feel lethargic, court documents allege . Dr Hill is a respected expert in infectious diseases in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and works at Memorial Hospital in Hutcheson and another medical centre nearby. He has no record of disciplinary action against him and in March was nominated by the Hamilton . County Medical Society as a top local physician for National Doctor's Day. His wife first noticed she was ill last year and according to the Times Free Press actually turned to her husband for treatment on what could be the problem. But in the court petition she said that everything changed in March this year when ‘I found my husband putting an unidentified substance in my coffee, as he usually prepared my morning coffee for me’. Mrs Hill's attorney Chrissy Mincy said that in the following months she lived a horrific ‘game of chess’ in which she inspected every piece of food or drink in the house before trying it. Evidence: Mrs Hill's torture came to an end when she supposedly saw him doing it and secretly took a sample which she gave to police . Devastating: Barium is used in mouse poison and can be fatal or lead to paralysis . Each day she would take a sample of the coffee and secretly gave it to officers who carried out more tests. She also had to live with the fear she was being paranoid - or that her husband had actually be poisoning her. Ms Mincy said: ‘She followed her instincts. I'm so glad she's able to be in the house by herself now. Because she went through hell. Barium is a radioactive chemical with the symbol Ba and the atomic number 56. The heavy metal occurs naturally in the environment and is silvery white in appearance. Its most well known use is as Barium Sulfate in a contrasting agent in X-rays - the patient swallows a liquid containing a low dose and it shows up on the scan. It is also used in mouse poison, as an alloy for spark plugs, steel deoxidisers and rubber products. Some light bulb coatings contain barium oxide. Barium cannot be digested by the body so will cause poisoning if ingested, especially as it reacts when it comes into contact with water. Those who work with the chemical are advised to wear flame resistant rubber clothes and a gas mask. If somebody is poisoned with Barium they are advised to force themselves to throw up to get it out of their system, and go immediately to the emergency room. Symptoms can include stomach problems, brain swelling, weak muscles and damage to the liver and kidneys. It can also cause cancer and the effects of ingestion can last for a year. ‘This weekend she finally got a good night's sleep for the first time in months.’ She added that it ‘doesn’t seem like much of a coincidence’ that Mrs Hill’s condition improved the day she started drinking her coffee. ‘Before the results, everything was so incredible. Because it is hard to believe, it really is’. Barium is normally used in the medical or chemical industry and is put into fireworks and matches. It is also used in stomach X-rays as a contrasting agent. Some kinds are absorbed into the body but it can be fatal if too much is consumed. It also affects the nervous system . and cause heart problems and paralysis, but is hard to come by and the . poisoner may have got it from a nuclear pharmacy, which is not open to . the public.

Utah took its fight against gay marriage to the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday, asking the high court to suspend same-sex unions that became legal when a judge struck down the state's voter-approved ban. The heavily Mormon state wants the marriages to stop while it appeals a judge's decision, which said banning gay couples from marrying violates their right to equal treatment under the law. In papers filed Tuesday, the state asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor to overturn a decision that has led to more than 900 gay marriages in Utah. Sotomayor handles emergency requests from Utah and other Rocky Mountain states. More than 900 same-sex couples have gotten married since a federal judge overturned Utah's gay marriage ban on December 20 . Sotomayor responded by setting a deadline of by noon Friday for legal briefs from same-sex couples. She can act by herself or get the rest of the court involved. 'Numerous same-sex marriages are now occurring every day in Utah,' Utah lawyers complain in the filing. 'Each one is an affront not only to the interests of the state and its citizens in being able to define marriage through ordinary democratic channels, but also to this court's unique role as final arbiter.' Also Tuesday, the Utah Attorney General's Office advertised a formal bid request to outside law firms for help preparing the appeals. State officials have said it could cost $2 million, bringing criticism from a lawyer for couples who sued to overturn the ban and say Utah should give up the fight. 'We are disappointed that Utah will spend millions of dollars in taxpayer's money, to attempt to reinstate laws which deny due process and equal protection to all of Utah's citizens,' the lawyer, James Magleby, said Tuesday. The state of Utah is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to for a temporary injunction to halt the wedding until the court can review the lower court ruling . Utah insists that states have the authority to define marriage as between a man and woman. ""That states have a powerful interest in controlling the definition of marriage within their borders is indisputable,"" Utah said in the filing. U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby's decision on December 20 came as a shock to many in the state, which approved the ban on same-sex marriage in 2004. Shelby and the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals have already refused to halt weddings while the state appeals what it calls a 'rush to marry.' Magleby argued that because so many couples have already married, 'there is no emergency need for a stay.' Shelby's decision came late on a Friday afternoon and sent people rushing to a county clerk's office in Salt Lake City - about 3 miles from the headquarters of the Mormon church - for marriage licenses. The following Monday, 353 more gay and lesbian couples grabbed a license, some camping out overnight to get in line early the next morning. Couples rushed to get marriage certificates after the gay marriage ban was struck down . After the 10th Circuit Court refused to halt the ruling, the few county clerks who had refused to issue licenses changed course. Officials say things have slowed down after a run on marriage licenses that started hours after Shelby's decision. Since then, Gov. Gary Herbert has directed state agencies to comply with Shelby's order, meaning gay couples are eligible for food stamps and welfare, among other benefits. The state Tax Commission said it was looking at changing tax returns to allow same-sex couples to file jointly, although it didn't immediately give assurances that will happen. Nearly two-thirds of Utah's 2.8 million residents are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Mormons dominate the state's legal and political circles. The Mormon church was one of the leading forces behind California's short-lived ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8. The church says it stands by its support for 'traditional marriage' and hopes a higher court validates its belief that marriage is between a man and woman. In the papers filed Tuesday, Utah argues that children are best raised by a mother and father in a good relationship. 'On average children navigate developmental stages more easily, perform better academically, have fewer emotional disorders and become better functioning adults when reared in that environment,' it says.","900 same-sex marriages have taken place since U.S. District Court judge overturned Utah's ban on December 20 .

Stephanie Ross (left) was loved by her teachers and her fellow students . The New York Daily News reports that Ross was a popular student who majored in mechanical engineering and played for her college's softball team. She was a stand-out student in both high school and college. 'Stephanie was an outstanding young woman who exemplified the values we have for students at Upper St. Clair in terms of academics, extra-curricular activities and community involvement. At USC, Stephanie was a National Merit Scholar, softball player, and volunteer,' said her High School's Superintendent Patrick O'Toole in a statement to WTAE. Ross was just as loved at her college as she was at her high school. Facebook shows numerous photos of her and her sorority sisters having fun at parties and college events. Ross was a charitable girl and her last post on facebook announced that she planned to donate eight inches of her hair to a charity that provides wigs to children with cancer.

'It's a disease caused by overcrowding,' he said. 'It spreads anywhere there are people such as in dormitories, cafeterias, and prisons.' He also emphasized the dangers of the disease and called it, 'rapidly spreading and highly fatal.' He said most college students are required to be vaccinated before arriving on campus and if students opt out of the meningitis vaccination then they must sign a waiver.

Bill Clinton is wading into a hotly contested primary battle in Philadelphia to raise money for his daughter’s mother-in-law. Marjorie Margolies is Marc Mezvinsky’s  mother and a former Congresswoman who is now running for the position two decades after she lost it. Clinton, who is widely seen as the national Democratic Party's most potent fundraising force, will headline an April 10 fundraiser for Margolies in a restaurant at Philadelphia’s Warwick Hotel in Philadelphia. Heading out onto the trail: Former President Bill Clinton will headline a fundraiser for his daughter's mother-in-law next month because she is running in a very competitive Congressional seat . Eying her old spot: Marjorie Margolies used to represent the Pennsylvania district that she is running to win now but she was voted out of office in 1995 . It will cost supporters $1,000 to attend and $5,000 for a VIP reception. Margolies officially became a member of the extended Clinton clan when her son married Chelsea in 2010 but the families have been connected for decades before that . 'The vote': Back in 1993, Marjorie Margolies was one of the deciding votes that passed then-President Clinton's budget plan that increased taxes for the wealthy, and that caused her to be voted out . Margolies is trying to recapture the U.S. House seat that she lost in the 1994 election after casting a vote for then-President Clinton's budget proposal that increased taxes on the wealthy. Margolies represented Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district from 1993 to 1995. The incumbent, Democrat Allyson Schwartz, is running for governor and is not seeking re-election, leaving the seat open in 2015. Three others have filed to run in the primary, including state senator Daylin Leach, state representative Brandon Boyle and Montgomery County physician Valerie Arkoosh, an obstetric anesthesiologist who had been a prominent advocate for President Barack Obama's signature 2010 health care law. Margolies trailed in fundraising on December 31, the last deadline for candidates to report their campaign finances to the state. The former NBC news reporter is now the president of Women's Campaign International, which she founded, and teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. Her payouts form the charity came under careful scrutiny earlier in the campaign as she reported a six-figure salary from the gig. As the charity has grown over the past decade, so has her salary as The Huffington Post reports it has steadily increased from $54,962 in 2002 to the highest point in 2011 when she took home $164,159. Staying close: Margolies is the head of the Womens Campaign and presented an award to Chelsea in November 2013 . Political family: Chelsea and Marc are seen with her mother Hillary Clinton at a White House function in 2013 . Embarrassment of the in-laws: Edward Mezvinsky went to prison in 2003 after he plead guilty to 31 out of 69 counts of bank, mail and wire fraud where he defrauded investors of $10million . Her salary dipped last year- to $109,678 in 2012- and she did not take a salary in 2013. Instead, . the former Congresswoman, who served one term before being voted out in . 1995, has turned her attention back to the political arena as she is . now actively campaigning in her own tight race against three other . Democrats. That isn't to say . that she has cut ties to the charity, as she regularly posts updates on . her Twitter account, publicizing events that they are holding. One . such recent evening came in November when she honored her famous . daughter-in-law at the 15th anniversary bash for the charity. She first ran for Congress in 1992, when she was known as Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and was married to former U.S. Rep. Edward Mezvinsky, an Iowa Democrat who went on to become the party's state chairman in Pennsylvania. They divorced in 2007. Edward Mezvinsky pleaded guilty in 2002 to bilking investors of more than $10million after he lost millions to African con artists pitching pyramid-type schemes. Federal prosecutors said he boasted of his close relationship with Bill and Hillary Clinton and his son's then-friendship with Chelsea at Stanford University.","The former President will attend a fundraiser for Marjorie Margolies, the mother of his son-in-law Marc Mezvinsky .

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer ended months of speculation about her political future on Wednesday when she announced that she will not seek a third term in office. The Arizona Constitution limits governors to two terms, but the Republican governor and her advisers have kept alive a scenario in which she might mount a long-shot legal challenge to seek another four years in office. Brewer completed the term of former Governor Janet Napolitano when she took a job in President  Obama's administration in 2009. Brewer then won a full term in 2010. She has said in the past that there's 'ambiguity' in the constitution because she hasn't served two full terms. Scroll down for video . Arizona Governor Jan Brewer announces that she will not seek a third term and will retire at the end of her current term today in Glendale . But she put that to rest Wednesday in suburban Phoenix as she declared 'there does come a time to pass the torch of leadership'. 'So, after completing this term in office, I will be doing just that,' she said. Brewer has been in the national spotlight on several occasions in her five years in office. She signed the immigration crackdown law known as Senate Bill 1070 in 2010 and sparred with the Obama administration over health care. Last month, Brewer vetoed legislation that opponents said would have allowed businesses to discriminate against gays and that the business community rallied against. Brewer also engaged Obama in a testy exchange while greeting him alongside Air Force One in Arizona in 2012, famously wagging her index finger in the president's face amid a dispute over border security. Brewer made her announcement at the same Glendale school where her children attended and where she received her first taste of politics. She attended a school board meeting in the cafeteria and was inspired to become active in politics, later getting elected to the state House of Representatives, the Maricopa Board of Supervisors and Secretary of State before becoming governor. Brewer completed the term of former Gov. Janet Napolitano when she took a job in the Obama administration in 2009, then won a full term in 2010 . She boasted of her accomplishments as . governor on issues such as the economy and education and ticked off a . list of her remaining priorities, including an overhaul of the state's . troubled child welfare system, pushing her budget proposal through the . Legislature and getting it to enact more of her economic recovery . proposals. 'My job as governor is far from over,' Brewer said. 'Both my pen and my veto stamp have plenty of ink.' Brewer . is known for her conservative views but has also riled her more . hard-line base. She surprised many by embracing a key part of Obama's . health care overhaul law â€” an expansion of Medicaid. After a battle with . Republicans who control the Legislature, she cobbled together a . coalition of Democrats and a handful of Republicans and got the measure . adopted. About 300,000 more Arizonans are now eligible to sign up for . the free health insurance plan.

The world's most important astronomical authority has slapped down a bid to hawk the names of Mars' craters, saying the red planet is not up for sale. The move came after Colorado-based crowdsourcing site Uwingu said the public could name craters on its map of Mars for a fee. 'Such initiatives go against the spirit of free and equal access to space, as well as against internationally recognised standards,' said Paris-based International Astronomical Union (IAU). The world's most important astronomical authority has slapped down a bid to hawk the names of Mars' craters, saying the red planet is not up for sale . 'Hence no purchased names can ever be used on official maps and globes.' Founded in 1919, the IAU holds the official mission of naming all planets, satellites, comets and asteroids in the Solar System. The topographical features of Mars, named after the Roman god of war, for instance, carry Latin names like 'mons' for mountain and 'planitia' for plain. In half a century, the union has named only a thousand of the estimated half-a-million craters on Mars -- each decided in a cautious vetting process. The move came after U.S crowdsourcing website Uwingu said the public could name craters on its map of Mars for a fee . Craters less than 62 miles (100km) in diameter are named after towns on Earth with fewer than 100,000 people. Craters . wider than this are named after late planetary scientists. Using that . scheme, a large crater might someday be named after Carl Sagan or Eugene . Shoemaker. One, for . instance, has been named after Hal Masursky, a geologist who spent his . career at Nasa studying lunar and planetary surfaces and the best places . for landing. Large craters wider than 37.5 miles (60km) have been named after deceased scientists, explorers and writers who have added to Martian lore. Smaller ones carry the names of Earthly cities with populations of fewer than 100,000. Uwingu said the money generated through its scheme, launched two weeks ago, will be used as 'grants for space researchers, educators, and entrepreneurs in this time of government cutbacks'. Prices start from $5 to (£3) with cost increasing based on the size of the crater. Those who purchase a name will have it listed on Uwingu's database, which also includes monickers already given by the IAU. The purchase only gives rights to the entry in the database, not to the crater itself. The IAU said the public can get involved in naming of craters when a space agency or the discoverer of a new feature or object asks for ideas. 'Once you've completed the checkout process, your name is accepted,' says the website. 'And unless it's later found to be profane, pejorative, or otherwise offensive (in which case it?ll be removed), it'll remain approved.' In an article posted Monday on the specialist website The Space Review, Uwingu's founders -- planetary scientists Alan Stern and Mark Sykes -- said 7,000 craters had been named by people in 78 countries in 10 days. The IAU said the public can get involved in naming when a space agency or the discoverer of a new feature or object asks for ideas. 'This was the case for Nasa's's Magellan Venus mapping mission launched in 1989: the public was invited to offer names of women who had made outstanding or fundamental contributions to their fields, for the names of Venusian craters,' it said. 'A more recent example was the naming of the two most recently discovered satellites of Pluto in 2013, which was the result of a public vote.' The moons were named after a many-headed guard dog, Kerberos, and an underworld goddess, Styx, in Greek mythology.

Brandan Kalenda of Louisiana found the giant rock on March 6 after searching for only 20 minutes in the Fugits Bank area of the park's search area. Not only does Kalenda plan to keep his sparkly prize, he has also named it 'The Jax Diamond' after his baby son Jaxson. Brandon named the diamond Jax after his infant son Jaxson .

It's also the fourth found since mid-February that weighs over a carat. The Mail Online contacted the Crater of . Diamonds State park and spoke with Waymon Cox who said that the park is . not certified to assign monetary value to any of the stones. Also, the variety of stones make pricing one rather different. 'No two diamonds in the rough are alike,' said Jenks to Fox. Jenks describes The Jax Diamond as being triangular with a metallic appearance. It's about the size of an English pea. 'We encourage park visitors to look for pockets or layers on the surface of gravel and search there,' said Jenks. Brandon Kalenda's diamond is triangular-shaped with a metallic appearance and is about the size of an English pea . Kalenda decided to visit the park after the cast of TLC's '19 Kids and Counting' made a visit to the Crater of Diamonds Sate Park. Jenks told Fox that now is the perfect time for diamond hunting because the recent rainfall and plowed fields make the diamonds easier to find. 'Diamonds are a bit heavy for their size, and they lack static electricity, so rainfall slides the dirt off diamonds that are on the surface of the search field leaving them exposed,' she said. 'When the sun comes out, theyâ€™ll shine and be noticeable.' Cox told the Mail Online that the park is very crowded now during spring break, especially after newsof the recent discovery. 'A lot of people have come out,' he said.

The Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday it approved a nerve-stimulating headband as the first medical device to prevent migraine headaches. Agency officials said the device, priced at $249.99 at Costco, provides a new option for patients who cannot tolerate migraine medications. The Cefaly device is a battery-powered plastic band worn across the forehead. A headband delivering electrical nerve stimulation can prevent onset of migraine headache . The device is battery-powered and worn around the head, with the actual TENS stimulator centered on the forehead just above the eye . Using an adhesive electrode, the band emits a low electrical current to stimulate nerves associated with migraine pain. Users may feel a tingling sensation on the skin where the electrode is applied. The device is designed to be used no more than 20 minutes a day by patients 18 years and older. A 67-person study reviewed by the FDA showed patients using the device experienced fewer migraines per month than patients using a placebo device. The Cefaly headband did not completely eliminate migraine headaches or reduce the intensity of migraines that occurred. According to the FDA a migraine is defined as 'intense pulsing or throbbing pain in one area of the head, accompanied by nausea or vomiting and sensitivity to light or sound.' About 53 percent of 2,313 patients in a separate study said they were satisfied with the device and were willing to purchase it for future use. No serious adverse events were connected with the device. The most common complaint was not wanting to use the device because users 'didn't like the feeling.' Some people reported feeling sleepy during the treatment and some had a headache after. Cephaly is manufactured by Cephaly Technology of Belgium.

Accused: Naeem Williams allegedly whipped his daughter with a belt and made her eat her feces . A former soldier accused of killing his five-year-old daughter kicked her so hard that he left a boot imprint on her chest, prosecutors have said at the opening of his murder trial. Naeem Williams, 34, appeared in court in Honolulu, Hawaii, near to where he was based at Wheeler Army Air Force Base, for the first day of the trial on Tuesday morning. He is accused of inflicting seven months of abuse on his daughter Talia - including making her eat her own feces and tying her to a bed before beating her with a belt - before killing her in 2005. On Tuesday, federal prosecutors said Talia died after the blow to the chest forced her to smack her head on the floor of her father's home. Federal prosecutor Darren W.K. Ching told jurors that the kick to her chest was so hard that it left an imprint and caused her left shoulder to separate, the Hawaii Star Advertiser reported. Defense lawyer John Phillipsborn said Williams admits to beating his daughter on the day she died, but argued that her previous injuries were suffered at the hands of her stepmother Delilah Williams. Delilah Williams pleaded guilty in a deal . with prosecutors to testify against her former partner in exchange for a . 20-year sentence. Ching said she will provide a 'firsthand . account of abuse'. If he is found guilty, Naeem Williams faces the death penalty . even though Hawaii abolished capital punishment in the 1950s. Scroll down for video . Victim: Talia Williams, 5, was kicked so hard in the stomach that there was a boot print on her chest . Helpless: The little girl had been living with her father and stepmother in Hawaii for seven months . But because Williams was in the Army at the time of the death and because it occurred in military housing, it is being prosecuted by the federal government, so the death penalty could be given. On Tuesday, Ching spent about an . hour telling jurors disturbing details of the alleged abuse, including a . neighbor overhearing Williams commanding his daughter to eat her feces. Williams . also allegedly whipped Talia with a belt while she was duct-taped to a . bedpost and allegedly hit her so hard with a plastic ruler nicknamed . 'Mr. Paddle' that it broke. She died in July 2005 after she was brought to a hospital unresponsive, vomiting and covered in bruises, and a criminal complaint afterwards said Williams beat her for urinating on herself. Federal investigators saod that military . law enforcement agents found blood splatters on the walls of the apartment from when the little girl was whipped by her father's belt. 'Killers': Williams, left, said he did beat his daughter but blamed the little girl's previous injuries on his wife, Delilah Williams, right. She pleaded guilty in exchange for 20 years and will testify in her husband's case . An autopsy reported that she died from an inflicted head injury due to battered-child syndrome. Defense attorney John Philipsborn showed jurors a grainy, . black-and-white photograph that was taken several months before Talia's death and . soon after the birth of her half-sister. 'This photograph is a photograph of a tragedy in progress,' he said. Other expected witnesses in the trial will include Talia's former teacher at Wheeler Elementary School, the family's former neighbors and the medical examiner. Naeem Williams also will take the stand, Philipsborn told the jury. Philipsborn said Williams was ill-equipped to care for a child, let alone a child with special needs who had bowel- and bladder-control problems. Scene: Cops reported seeing blood on the walls at Williams' home at Wheeler Army Air Force Base, pictured . Court: The case is being held at the U.S. District Court in Honolulu and Williams faces the death penalty . He added that Naeem Williams was married to a controlling, angry and volatile woman. 'You will understand from Naeem Williams he had both strengths and limitations,' Philipsborn said. Talia's biological mother, Tarshia Williams, is also expected to testify. Ching said Tarshia Williams and Talia's . father weren't married but share the same last name because they are . distant relatives. She filed a civil lawsuit against the government over Talia's death but it has been put on hold until after the criminal trial. It claims that the military failed to report that Talia's father and stepmother 'abused and tortured' her even after childcare professionals reported alleged abuse. Delilah Williams also allegedly told co-workers it was 'okay to whip a child, just don't leave any marks' and in June 2005, military police failed to tell social workers that Talia was found 'naked and mute, standing near faeces on the floor' with marks covering her body and scratches on her face.","Naeem Williams 'abused his daughter Talia for 7 months while she lived with him and his wife in Hawaii, eventually killing her'

A taxi industry trade newspaper has threatened to out five 'secretly gay' Chicago City Council officials unless they ban smartphone ride-sharing services which it says are threatening drivers' jobs. Publisher of The Chicago Dispatcher, George Lutfallah, said the industry was under siege and, in an editorial in his latest issue, set out a list of 10 demands. Mr Lutfallah said his trade publication 'has learned . that five of the city’s 50 aldermen are closeted homosexuals. In the . next issue of this newspaper, set to be published early next month, we . will disclose their names unless our demands are met'. A Chicago taxi industry official has threatened to out council bosses if his demands are not met . 'The . city is moving forward and will steamroll our industry if we don’t act . in earnest,' he said. 'They did it to my grandfather more than 100 years ago . when they destroyed his horse-drawn-carriage business by allowing . horseless machines to carry people around the city. 'The five aldermen we will expose next . month will only include those who have concealed their gay lifestyle to . their constituents. 'They are public servants who have a duty to . truthfully disclose their sexuality to the voters. They are living a . lie.' Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's moves to change the city's taxi industry are proving unpopular . He added that if the city does allow ride-sharing - when fares are booked using apps such as Uber, Lyft and SideCar - cars would require GPS . tracking 'so that our . informant can keep telling us when Aldermen are taken from their homes . and dropped off in Boys Town'. Bizarrely, Mr Lutfallah also urged the city to ban the internet and rename the landmark Willis Tower the Sears Tower, prompting suspicion his threat may not be serious, according to CBS Chicago. He said ride-share drivers should be . required to get annual chest X-rays, 'like the city-endorsed doctor had . me do to renew my chauffeur’s license last month. The riding public has . no idea if ride-share drivers have tuberculosis'. Also on Mr Lutfallah's hitlist were female ride-share taxi drivers, who he said should not be allowed behind the wheel. 'One company boasts that 40 percent of . its drivers are women. Taxi driving is a male-dominated profession and . it should remain that way,' he said. 'The last place for a woman is behind the . wheel. If a woman needs a ride somewhere, she will only feel safe if the . driver is a man.' George Lutfallah wants to change the name of the city's Willis Tower (left) to The Sears Tower . The controversial editorial comes as aldermen . consider a move by Mayor Rahm Emanuel to impose new regulations on ride-sharing companies including insisting they have insurance, pay a . $25,000-a-year fee and pay a $3.50-per-day-per-vehicle tax. Regular cab . companies argue those fees are insignificant compared to the $350,000 cost of simply getting a licence.

Her body was found in a creek inside a Jersey Shore park after he failed to return the girl to her mother following a trip to see a movie about dancing penguins. An autopsy determined that the child was alive when she hit the water. Morgan fled to California following the child's death. He was found by a fugitive recovery task force. Prosecutors say Morgan had asked the girl's mother if he could take Tierra to see the movie Happy Feet Two.

Tragic: The toddler was still strapped in her car seat when she was found partially submerged in a creek at Shark River Park (pictured) in New Jersey . When he did not return her after a few hours, the mother called police. A warrant charging Morgan with child endangerment was issued before the girl's body was found.

The . creek, about 20 miles north of where she lived, is up to 7ft deep in the . area where the body was found, near an overpass 15ft above the creek.

Upon his arrival, a worker first suggested a hoodie for Mrs. Obama, but the president said that isn't the first lady's thing.

Tool of the devil: Pastor Kevin Swanson denounced Disney's Frozen on Wednesday as Satan's tool for indoctrinating young children into homosexuality in a radio show he hosts . 'Friends, this is evil, just evil,' said Swanson. 'I wonder if people are thinking, ""You know, I think this cute little movie is going to indoctrinate my 5-year-old to be a lesbian or treat homosexuality or bestiality in a light sort of way.""' Swanson didn't cite specific examples from the film that he says promote the 'gay agenda,' but he did take aim at Disney Corp in general, which he calls 'one of the most pro-homosexual organizations in the country.' He also thinks Satan himself could be calling the shots from the boardroom. 'If I was the Devil, what would I do to . really foul up an entire social system and do something really, really, . really evil to 5- and 6- and 7-year-olds in Christian families around .

It was that year when investors helped Disney Corp narrowly escape a hostile takeover by corporate raider Saul Steinberg.

Denial:  Chimerix CEO Kevin Moch will now supply 7-year-old cancer sufferer Josh Hardy with the life-saving anti-viral drug he needs . The CEO of the drug company that had been refusing to supply lifesaving medication to a seven-year-old cancer survivor from Virginia has caved into public pressure and said the boy will now get it. Chimerix chief Kenneth Moch announced on Tuesday night that his firm will begin a pilot trial for the drug on Wednesday - with Josh Hardy the program's first patient. The stunning reversal comes after Moch faced huge criticism for denying the Fredericksburg boy the medication brincidofovir to fight off an infection he developed after a bone marrow transplant. Indeed at one point, Moch was accused of hanging up the phone to a charity that offered up the $50,000 needed to buy it for the child. In a statement, Moch said that after much careful consideration Chimerix would offer Josh the medicine. 'This 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix's mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need -- for everyone,' Moch said according to Fox News. 'Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. 'It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections.' Scroll down for video . Courageous: Josh has already battled cancer four times in his seven years . Earlier on Tuesday it was reported that Moch put down the phone on Richard Plotkin, vice chair of the Max Cure Foundation after he offered to pay the $50,000 needed to secure the Brincidofovir. 'I spoke to Mr. Moch yesterday by phone.  I told him that we had the $50,000 that I thought he was claiming he needed to supply the drug,' Richard Plotkin, vice chair of the Max Cure Foundation, said on Tuesday morning's Fox and Friends. 'He then told me it isn’t about money.  He told me it’s all about ethics.  I said, ‘Fine, tell me why you will not give it to this little boy. 'If he does not get the drug, he will die this week, I’m told.  He said he cannot make an exception.' Plotkin asked Moch what he would do if Josh was his child or grandchild, but Plotkin said Moch refused to answer this question and then hung up the phone. 'As a result, it appears the final plea is to the board of directors at Chimerix…I ask the board to close their eyes, and as you close your eyes, assume there’s a little boy lying in a hospital bed who says to his father, ‘Daddy, am I going to die? And if I’m going to die, who will take care of me in heaven?’' Plotkin said to Fox and Friends. Fighter: Seven-year-old Josh Hardy has survived four bouts of kidney cancer, heart failure and a bone marrow transplant . 'And then I want you to assume that this little boy is your child or grandchild. And members of the board of directors, I have no doubt how you would respond to that.' The drug that will save Josh's life has not been approved by the FDA, but has previously been administered to hundreds of other patients under a prior 'compassionate use' allowance. 'As we progressed to larger and more complex safety trials, we made the decision two years ago to stop the program and focus resources on earning FDA approval,' Moch said yesterday. Previously Moch said that saying yes to Josh would mean saying yes to many more patients, draining the company's resources and delaying the time it will take for the drug to progress through the formal studies required before it can be given FDA approval and help many more future patients. However, the company received $72 million in federal funding to develop Brincidofovir. Before the good news, Josh Hardy's mother, Aimee Hardy, said the situation was devastating, especially for a boy who has fought so hard to live. 'There’s no good excuse for us,' she said. 'There’s nothing they can say that will really keep us from asking. We’re begging them to give it to us.' Mother: Aimee Hardy appeared on Fox and Friends, saying she was infuriated that she was not sitting by her son's side and holding his hand, but had to campaign so that he could get the medicine he needs . Family first: Aimee Hardy (with her children - son Josh is second from left) successfully campaigned for her son to get the medicine he needs . Josh Hardy was diagnosed with cancer of the kidneys in 2007. Since then, he has battled the disease four times. He had been in remission for two years when a bone scan in November of 2013 revealed he had developed a bone marrow disorder due to earlier cancer treatments. In January of this year he had a bone marrow transplant and endured another round of chemotherapy at St Jude's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Following the successful surgery he  developed adenovirus, an infection that can be deadly in people with weakened immune systems. 'Normally, Josh’s immune system would be able to handle the adenovirus if his immune system was set free,' Hardy wrote on her son’s CaringBridge page. 'The challenge is his immune system can’t be set free yet because his body is still trying to adapt to the new bone marrow cells. So to keep the body from killing the new cells, they have to suppress the immune system, thus creating ideal conditions for adenovirus to advance. Catch 22.' Brincidofovir has been shown to clear up adenovirus in children in two weeks, reports Fox and Friends. Deadly virus: Josh is in hospital battling a virus that could claim his life, but will now get the life-saving drug he needs . In his hands: Kenneth Moch, CEO of Chimerex, previously claimed the company no longer had a 'compassionate use' program . Josh's doctors also contacted Chimerex requesting their patient be allowed to have the drug. 'I feel that it’s just an excuse and we need them to totally change their stance, not only for us but for hundreds or even thousands of people that need [this drug],' Hardy told Fox and Friends before Tuesdays good news.. '…To me, [it’s] almost a crime to not make it available to everyone who needs it.' Aimee Hardy has launched a campaign to save her son, and says she will not stop until Josh gets the medicine, even though the fight is stealing precious moments she could be spending with her son. 'I want to be by his bedside, holding his hand, telling him, 'It’s going to be okay,' but because of this unwillingness to release this drug, I have to leave him and come talk to you and it infuriates me,' Hardy told Fox and Friends. Prior to his change of heart Kenneth Moch said that even a visit to see Josh at St. Jude would not change his mind about letting the child have the medicine. Aimee Hardy told Fox and Friends what Moch would see if he visited Josh's bedside. Curable: Josh is suffering from a curable virus that's preying on him because of his compromised immune system . A chance to live: The little boy has been in and out of hospital for much of his short life, never having a chance to do the things other little boys get to . 'He would see a frail little boy who has a very weak voice and has a hard time staying awake because he’s in so much pain,' she said. 'It’s horrible for us as parents to see, because he’s a vibrant, strong little boy, and even though he is frail, he has a very strong will about him. But things just keep stacking against him, and we just want to do everything we can to give him the opportunity to make a full recovery.' Moch had told Fox and Friends that seeing Josh in this state would not change his mind. 'We have have great compassion for this family,' Moch says. 'But this is not just about a single boy.'","Chimerix chief Kenneth Moch says they will now offer Josh Hardy the anti-viral treatment he needs .

The California drought may force members of the state and federal government to move more than 15 million salmon to the safety of the ocean using giant tanker trucks. The drought, which is thought to be California's worst dry spell of the last century, has caused many rivers to dry up, meaning that young salmon are unable to migrate to the ocean. Officials from state and federal wildlife authorities have concocted a plan to move the millions of young fish from the Coleman Fish Hatchery near Redding closer to the ocean. At risk: The millions of salmon being potentially moved in California come from fisheries and reservoirs, and the drought has meant that the young fish will not be able to swim the river to the ocean to conduct their growth cycle . John McManus of the Golden Gate Salmon Association told NBC Los Angeles: 'The juvenile fish this year represent the adult fish that will support our fishery in 2016. 'They'll put them in tanker trucks and move them down to the Delta or the Bay and unload them in acclamation pens. 'If we get fish moved by truck, survival rate goes way up, and giving the juvenile fish a lift will help keep the salmon fishery afloat.' Before: In 2011, the Californian dam was almost full, sitting at a capacity of 97 percent . After: The capacity of Folsom Lake in January was just 17 percent, a whopping 80 percent lower than what it was 2.5 years ago . Record drought: These satellite images show the . parched California landscape this year compared to a normal year with . plenty of foliage and snow coverage last year . California's drought continues to worsen, with ten rural communities identified as having fewer than 60 days' supply of water . The plan does come with a significant amount of risk to the fish, as the young salmon will not have made the journey from river to ocean, and so might not be able to find their way back to spawn. However, federal officials believe the severity of the drought brings even higher risk to the fish, as dry rivers blocks natural migration, putting both the Californian species, and an entire industry of salmon fisheries, to risk. If drought conditions remain as severe as they have been, the salmon transportation could begin in April. President Barack Obama tours a local farm that has been affected by drought on February 14, 2014, with Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown (left), Joe Del Bosque, Empresas Del Bosque, Inc. (right) and Maria Gloria Del Bosque, Empresas Del Bosque, Inc. The drought has severely damaged a lot of the landscape, with many agricultural sectors unable to provide water to growing crops . The drought in California has been so bad that in January Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency due to increasing arid conditions, asking for a 20 per cent reduction in water use. The rain in California has been 20 per cent less that usual, and the 'snow pack' in the area (snow from the winter that melts as it gets warmer, filling up reserviors) has also been drastically low. So far the drought has caused reservoirs and rivers to dry up, putting household water usage at risk. Folsom Lake is so dry that truck tires and other debris from the bottom of the dam can be seen . Parched: A warning buoy sits on the dry, cracked bed of Lake Mendocino . near Ukiah, Calif. Despite recent spot rains The reservoir is currently . only about 37 percent full . A sign is posted near an almond farm in Turlock, California . Rows of uprooted almond trees lay on the ground before being shredded at Baker Farming on February 25, 2014 in Firebaugh . Increasingly arid conditions have hit almost every agricultural industry in California, from avocado growth, to the wine trade . In some parts of California, around 225,000 homes and businesses are not charged for how much water they use, and are instead charged a flat rate, meaning that some use up to 100 gallons of water a day. Due to the drought, some town authorities have ordered citizens to drop their water usage by around 25 per cent. A dead almond crop is seen in California's Westland Water District in Fresno, one of the many agricultural industries to be hit badly . The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation officials announced they will not be providing Central Valley farmers with any water from the federally run system of reservoirs and canals fed by mountain runoff . A San Francisco Bay area town was the first to ration their water back in January, ordering a 25 per cent mandatory water cut, in the wake of state authorities warning that California could run out of water in 100 days if the drought continued. Some towns in California are taking much more severe measures, with St. Helena instituting fines of $1000 for those who go over a 65 gallon-a-day limit. On the edge: The drought has been putting the salmon fishery industry, and the California fishmongers, at risk . Businesses have also come under restraint, with restaurants being told not to serve water to diners unless specifically asked. However, the drought may hit the agriculture sector in California the hardest, with 80 per cent of the water used in California going towards the industry. Many people have called the drought 'the worst dry spell in a century', comparing it to the droughts of the 1970s, where people were forced to severely ration water. In addition, the dry conditions of the drought combined with the weather warming up dramatically increases the risk of wildfires across California, which are incredibly hard to fight with a mandatory restriction on water usage, and can ravage landscapes and destroy communities. Risk of forest fires and wildfires has increased dramatically because of the drought, as a lack of water dries out trees, and hot weather increases the risk of spontaneous fires . A local NBC News station told MailOnline: 'We had a damn good batch of rain a week ago. 'This meant the worry died down a little, but the drought is still prevalent, except now we might lose federal help. 'The past year's drought has been really bad, and the recent rain fall has only stopped the story from being huge, but the drought is still there.'","Drought worst in last 100 years, causing mandatory cut in water use .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:22 EST, 11 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 20:34 EST, 11 March 2014 . An Iowa teenager who pleaded guilty to shooting his grandparents with his grandfather's rifle will spend the rest of his life behind bars. On Tuesday, a judge described Isaiah Sweet, 19, as a cold-blooded killer who should never get another chance at freedom before handing down the maximum sentence of life in prison without parole. Sweet has been charged with the May 2012 slayings of Janet and Richard Sweet at their home in Manchester. Heartless killer: Isaiah Sweet, pictured left in a mugshot in 2012 and right in court Tuesday, was sentenced to life in prison without parole for his grandparents' murders . Public enemy: A judge described the 19-year-old as a dangerous man and a threat to society . ‘He may be young, but he has shown the world who he is,’ Judge Michael Shubatt said, reading a written ruling in a Delaware County courtroom in Manchester in front of several of the victims' friends and relatives. ‘He is extremely dangerous. He is now and will continue to be a threat to society.’ Sweet had pleaded guilty last year to two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of the couple, his legal guardians. He was a 17-year-old high school dropout when he shot them in the head on a Friday evening. Their bodies were found on a sofa in their home two days later on Mother's Day, when relatives came over for a gathering. A day after the killings, Sweet drove 75 miles south to the college town of Iowa City to party with friends. He was briefly held on a traffic charge and released to a counselor. He was eventually arrested in connection with the slayings one day after the bodies were found, following an intense manhunt in which he ran from police on foot in a wooded area of Cedar Rapids. First-degree murder convictions normally carry automatic prison sentences of life without parole in Iowa. Murdered: He shot dead Richard and Janet Sweet, . pictured, on their couch in May 2012. He said he had first considered . poisoning his grandfather's beer and then beating him with a baseball . bat . But because Sweet was 17, he qualified for a possible shorter sentence under recent rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court and the Iowa Supreme Court that require judges to consider whether teenage offenders can be rehabilitated. Those rulings say that, at a minimum, judges must conduct hearings to consider each defendant's situation rather than giving them harsh, automatic sentences. Sweet's defense asked for a chance for parole after 25 years, citing an expert who claimed he might have a 75 per cent chance of rehabilitating. Emotional: Amanda Sweerin, granddaughter of Richard and Janet Sweet, is weeping during the sentencing of Isaiah Sweet at the Delaware County Courthouse Tuesday . Shubatt said he believed that was overly optimistic, and that Sweet was the rare juvenile offender who deserved life behind bars. Sweet shot two unsuspecting victims simply because he did not like the control they exercised over him, Shubatt said. He planned the killings by consulting with others and then sold off his grandparents' belongings afterward, even showing a friend a television a few feet from their bodies, Shubatt said. Assistant Attorney General Denise Timmins, who prosecuted the case, said she believed the sentence marked the first time since a 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that a juvenile offender in Iowa has received life without parole. ‘If it's warranted in any case, this is the one,’ she told reporters, calling the crime premeditated and heinous. ‘He took two people's lives without a thought about it.’ Sweet didn't show any emotion after the ruling, leaving the courtroom with his attorneys. They are expected to appeal the sentencing. Angie Camlin, a daughter of the Sweets, told reporters that she did not believe Isaiah Sweet could be rehabilitated, noting that one doctor called him ‘a psychopath with no empathy.’ ‘This cannot be healed with medicine and you cannot teach a person how to feel. He was raised by grandparents who showed him love and cared for him deeply,’ she said. Beyond help: Angie Camlin, daughter of Janet Sweet, told reporters that she did not believe Isaiah Sweet could be rehabilitated . A friend of Sweet, 21-year-old Brandon Ahlers, was sentenced last year to 18 years in prison after admitting to being an accessory. Investigators say Sweet and Ahlers discussed different ways the couple might be killed, with Ahlers advising him on how to use the rifle. After the couple was dead, Ahlers broke into the home so he could steal Richard Sweet's vehicle and other items. Sweet also gave the rifle to Ahlers, who sold it. Camlin praised Shubatt for giving Sweet the maximum, saying it makes her feel safer. ‘I won't feel that I have to look over my shoulder in 20 or 30 years,’ she said, ‘or have my grandchildren on the same street as someone who cannot be helped.’ Smile of a killer: Isaiah Sweet, 18, grins as he is escorted by sheriff officers after pleading guilty to shooting dead his grandparents in court in Dubuque, Iowa on Monday . Sweet's guilty plea last October came after the prosecution played a two-hour video of Sweet's interview . with investigators after he was arrested on May 14, 2012, the Dubuque Times Herald reported. He explained that he had decided to kill his parents after his grandfather constantly put him down, told him he should kill himself and made the teen's life 'a living hell'. '[I] walked . up the stairs... had the earmuffs on and everything, stepped up until I . saw my grandpa's head, boom, pulled the trigger,' Sweet said in the interview. 'Pulled . the bolt back, shot my grandma twice in the head. 'I went up to . them, and I broke down and started crying. I told them how much I loved . them,' he said, adding that he kissed them both. 'I don’t know what's wrong with me.' In court: He said he understood that he faces a sentence of life in prison as he pleaded guilty on Monday . Anger: Sweet said that he killed his grandparents as his grandfather had made his life a 'living hell' He sobbed: 'I want to go back so bad.' Both were found slumped dead on their couch with wounds to the head. He then jumped in his grandfather's truck from their home in Manchester to Iowa City where he went to parties so he didn't think of the killings. Sweet told investigators he had tried to kill himself before murdering his grandparents and after their deaths, he tried to commit suicide every night by choking himself until he was caught. He was arrested three days later after a police chase. In the interview, he told investigators that he wanted police to shoot him when they found him. He said he had first considered poisoning his grandfather's beer and then beating him with a baseball bat. Testimony: Investigator Scott Regert gestures how Sweet described pointing and shooting the rifle. After the killings, the teen fled in his grandfather's truck but was found three days later . 'They didn’t deserve that,' Sweet said of the killings. 'If anyone in the house deserved that, I did.' Before pulling the trigger, he said he had considered other methods of how to kill his guardians. The teen thought about . poisoning his grandfather's beer. He decided to kill him with a bat but . couldn't go through with the swing because he didn't want his . grandparents to feel any pain. He eventually opted to use his grandfather's rifle.","Isaiah Sweet, 19, admitted killing Richard Sweet, 55, and Janet Sweet, 62, as they sat on their couch in Manchester, Iowa in May 2012 .

"PUBLISHED: . 10:03 EST, 12 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:00 EST, 12 March 2014 . A north Florida mayor who is in jail on drug charges has resigned from office. Hampton Mayor, Barry Layne Moore, was suspended from office in November and is being held in the Bradford County Jail on allegations of selling oxycodone. Moore was suspended from office in November and submitted his resignation on Tuesday. He has not posted $4,500 bail. Scroll down for video... Resigned: The city's mayor Barry Layne Moore was arrested for allegedly trying to sell an oxycodone tablet to an undercover officer around Thanksgiving. He remains in jail unable to cover the $4,500 bond . Uncertain future: The tiny town of Hampton in northern Florida could be wiped off the map after an audit showed city officials have mishandled town funds to a comical degree . Officials say Moore asked city councilman Bill Goodge, who is a sergeant at the jail, to help him with the resignation. Goodge says Moore didn't want to 'embarrass' the city any more. The . decision allows the city to move forward with an election. Acting Mayor . Myrtice McCullough has been running the city since November. Moore's arrest came just weeks after he was elected. The city has 500 residents. 'I ride a bicycle around town. I had . my lights cut off twice last year. If I am a dope dealer, why are my . lights getting cut off,' Moore asked CNN in an interview from jail. 'I'm a good guy that got caught up in a bunch of nonsense that was bigger than me.' Moore has been in jail since around Thanksgiving because he can't afford the $4,500 bond. Florida Gov. Rick Scott immediately suspended Moore after his arrest, but the mayor submitted his official letter of resignation on Tuesday, . His letter was short, and to the point. 'I, Barry Layne Moore, being of sound mind and body, ask that you would please accept this letter as notification that I am leaving my position with the city of Hampton, effective immediately.' Moore's arrest, which came just weeks after he had taken office, isn't the only thing that has drawn attention to Hampton, a 1-square-mile city of less than 500 people in Bradford County. Low hanging fruit: There aren't many people in sleepy Hampton, but its location along a busy highway made it the perfect speed trap town . A state . audit found 31 violations of the city's charter, and violations of . federal codes and laws and a shocking misuse of funds in the tiny town. $132,000 was spent at  the BP convenience store next door to City Hall. 'What's . wrong with that picture?' Jim Mitzel, mayor from 2000 to 2008, asked . CNN. 'That's a lot of cigarettes and beer and what-have-you. That's . corrupt as heck.' They also found that city employees . had racked up $27,000 in charges on the city's credit card for 'no . public purpose' and that the city police cars weren't even insured. Though, there were plenty of them. The . city keeps a bloated police force in order to continue pursuing what . many say is its sole purpose: ticketing drivers as they drive through . town. The town has even . extended its city limits 1,260 feet down the width of a busy highway in . order to lay claim to any and all traffic violations--end their . accompanying ticket fines--that occur there. The . sight of Hampton Police sitting alongside U.S. 301 on lawn chairs and . pointing their radar gun at passersby bas become the norm on the . outskirts of town. They . became infamous for ticketing anyone and everyone they possibly could . for even the tiniest of infractions and between 2010 and 2012 raked in . an unbelievable $616,960 in fines. Beginning of the end: The town became infamous for all the speeding tickets it issued an between 2010 and 2012, the city collected over $600,000 in fines. But the state would soon want to know where all the money went . The money allowed them to upgrade their police cars to SUVs and check drivers' speed while wearing pricey riot gear. One such police officer became known . by the nickname Rambo because of his swagger and the AR-15 rifle he wore . while greeting vacationing speeders during traffic stops. 'It . became 'serve and collect' instead of 'serve and protect.' Cash . register justice,' local Sheriff Gordon Smith told CNN. 'Do y'all . remember the old Dukes of Hazzard? Boss Hogg? They make Boss Hogg look . like a Sunday school teacher.' To save themselves further . headache, state officials--including State Senator Rob Bradley, whose . district includes Hampton--say they just want the town erased from the . map. 'It’s like something out of a Southern Gothic novel,' Bradley told Time. That's a lot of cigarettes: Pictured is the Hampton town hall. Not pictured is the BP convenience store next door where city officials managed to rack up a  $132,000 tab . Bradley . said the support to wipe away the mistakes of Hampton's past is strong . with area Floridians as well as in the legislature. 'This . town exists apparently just to write speeding tickets,' Bradley said. 'Most people don’t understand why it exists in the first place.'

Police in shiny new cruisers toting top-of-the-line guns and combat gear purchased with ticket money would often hide behind this Dumpster. Only, some of those cars weren't even insured . Hampton, Florida has been a town for 89 years, but its notoriety as a ruthless speed trap may soon be its undoing.

It's not often that Buffalo, New York state's 'Queen City', claims the top spot on a national scale. But it has been ranked as the most affordable city in America, according to Forbes, which used data that included income, housing prices and everyday expenses to put together a top 21. The cost of house prices was the most crucial in the study, with the magazine using an index from the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo to measure how far residents' money could go toward buying a place to live. New York City and Honolulu were found to be the most overpriced cities in the country. Number one: Forbes magazine has named Buffalo as the most affordable city to live in America . With a median family income of $63,500 and a median home sales price of $100,000, home ownership in Buffalo is attainable for 88.5 percent of the local population, according to Forbes . 'With a median family income of $63,500 and a median home sales price of $100,000, home ownership (in Buffalo) is attainable for 88.5 percent of the local population,' Forbes writer Erin Carlyle noted. Median indicates half of the homes sold for more, and half sold for less than that amount. The same applies to income: Half earned more than that amount, and half earned less. After Buffalo, rounding out the top five were Memphis, Cincinnati, Dayton and Knoxville. Forbes defined city as having a population greater than 600,000, so anywhere less than that was not looked at for the list. The south was well-represented on the list, with six southern cities making the cut . However Forbes said that the Midwest dominates when it comes to affordability, with 11 metro areas making the list, including five in the state of Ohio alone: Cincinnati (No. 3), Dayton (No. 4), Akron (No. 6), Toledo (No. 11), and Columbus (No. 20). Number two: Memphis, Tenn. with a population of 1.3 million . Cincinnati, Ohio, with a population of 2.13 million people, came in at number three on the Forbes list . Number four was Dayotn, Ohio. The 2014 America¿s Most Affordable Cities list ranks cities based on median family income, housing affordability and cost-of-living expenses . Michigan landed three cities on the ranks: Grand Rapids, Detroit, and Warren. The northeast offers a few highly affordable cities — including the number one winner, Buffalo, N.Y. Interestingly, the west has no representatives on the list at all: while California’s cities are obviously relatively expensive, it would have been reasonable to expect somewhere in Arizona or New Mexico at least to make the cut.1.

The mother of a 16-year-old Arizona schoolgirl shot dead by a 15-year-old school friend on Friday has hit out at her daughter's school, saying it should have kept her safe. Anastasia Greer was shot dead by Matthew Bolton in the street outside her friend's home last Thursday. But contrary to previous reports the two had not recently ended a relationship, and Anasatasia was trying to protect Bolton's unnamed ex-girlfriend, with whom she was friends, when she was shot. Anastasia's mother Diannah Dinsmore spoke out as it emerged Bolton had made a series of threats against his ex-girlfriend, and Anastasia had gone the unnamed girl's house to protect her. When Bolton arrived at the home, Anastasia went out to confront him and was shot dead before he killed himself. Police say Anastasia had reported Bolton to school administrators on Thursday, saying he had threatened to beat up his former girlfriend. Protective: Diannah Dinsmoor, pictured with her daughter Anastasia, says the school should have kept her safe . Tragic: Anastasia, pictured with Bolton in February, had not dated the teenager, her mother said . Officials at Sandra Day O'Connor High School contacted the parents of the girl Bolton is said to have threatened but because he was off school on Thursday and Friday, they were unable to speak to him. The following day, Anastasia and the girl, who used to date Bolton, returned to school and after class Anastasia met Bolton to confront him about the threats. The school said Anastasia had not been a target of Bolton's threats, and the school's police officer had tried to get in touch with the student on Friday. Police have said in the hours leading up to the shooting, one of Anastasia's friends had been so concerned for her safety that he gave her a small knife, and had asked Bolton if he was armed. Bolton had said he didn't have a gun, but . a few moments later the same friend saw him chasing Anastasia, before . hearing gunshots and later seeing Bolton take his own life. 'We don't know what transpired when the . two went outside as far as any type of discussion, other than to say a . witness saw Matthew chasing Ana and heard gunshots,' Sergeant Tommy Thompson said. 'About that time the . friend that lived in the residence came outside to discover Ana had been . shot, he then witnessed Matthew shoot himself.' Grief: Diannah, left, says when she rushed to the house after hearing about a shooting she could tell from the look on the faces of her daughter's school friends that Anastasia was dead . Attack: Matthew Bolton took a gun from his brother's room and shot Anastasia after she confronted him about threats he had supposedly made . Anastasia's mother however, has hit out at the school for not doing more to respond to reports of Bolton making threats. 'I . trusted the school to do what they were supposed to do, that's what . they were entrusted for. I put my daughter in their care for her to be . safe,' she told My Fox Phoenix. Mrs . Dinsmoore also denied claims that her daughter had been romantically . involved with Bolton, saying the pair hadn't spoken for months. Too young: Friends remembered Anastasia, pictured here with a gift from Bolton, as kind and outgoing . She admitted Bolton had bought her daughter a teddy bear last month, but said her daughter had not been allowed to date. Police say the gun used to kill Anastasia was taken from Bolton's brother, who kept it locked in his bedroom. Bolton is believed to have broken a window to get inside the room and get the gun. Mrs Dinsmoore told AZ Central she found out her daughter had been killed after asking the girl's friends where she was. After hearing about the shooting, Mrs Dinsmoore went to the house where Anastasia had been shot to look for her daughter. 'I was like, ""Iâ€™m looking for my daughter. Whereâ€™s Ana?"" All their faces drop, and [they] point around the corner, and then I saw an officer ... I already knew what they were going to tell me,' she said. Officers responded to a 911 call of a . shooting around noon and found the two teenagers dead in the home's . front yard from gunshot wounds. A neighbor, Jim Friel, told The Arizona Republic that he heard a scream and then gunshots and went across the street to the home to see what happened. He found the girl lying on the ground with gunshot wounds to her chest and the boy with a gunshot wound to his face. Crime scene: Neighbors reported hearing a girl screaming before gunshots were fired . Grieving friends described Anastasia as a kind and outgoing girl who was active in her school's ROTC program. Classmate Caleb Fleck told the station KPHO that Bolton, who was in his ROTC class, was well-behaved and was never known to be a troublemaker. On his Facebook page, Matthew posted on Valentine's Day a photo of him and Anastasia smiling and holding a red 'I love you' teddy bear with a heart-shaped nose.

A disabled tax clerk is suing her boss who she claimed treated her 'in the manner in which Adolf Hitler treated the disabled and the Jews during the Holocaust.' Michelle Ruppert, 45, has filed a discrimination lawsuit against New Jersey's Borough of Point Pleasant's Office of the Tax Collector alleging she was verbally abused and harassed during her three year stint with the business. Ruppert claimed that on her first day of work in 2011, her boss, 69-year-old Bernadine Pearce, showed her a 'Wall of Shame' with a fake funerary urn filled with the 'ashes of problem employees' who'd been 'exterminated'. Ashes: Michelle Ruppert, 45, claims her boss  Bernadine Pearce acted like Adolf Hitler and kept a fake urn of 'problem employees' (reportedly like this one) who had been exterminated or fired . Asbury Park Press reported the wall was posted on a cabinet in the main tax collector’s office for at least two years of Ruppert’s employment. Pearce allegedly 'opined that all . personnel of her office should be 'perfect humans', as she believed she . was', according to the five-count civil lawsuit filed last week. The suit claims Pearce threw papers at Ruppert, called her a 'waste of a human being', encouraged Pearce’s daughter and co-worker to give her the middle finger and called her a 'mess up' who should just 'quit her job'. 'No reasonable person would find . despicable conduct such as that acceptable,' Ruppert’s attorney, . Rosemarie Arnold, told ABC News. 'That should not be allowed . in a workplace.' Ruppert also accused Pearce, who has worked at the borough for 39 years, of making 'outrageous comments' that are 'too numerous to list', including, 'To people like you, 2+4 must equal 8'. Office: Michelle Ruppert claimed she has been abused and harassed during her three-year stint at New Jersey's Borough of Point Pleasant's Office of the Tax Collector (pictured) Involved: Ruppert is also suing Borough Administrator David Maffei (pictured) who she claims failed to investigate her complaints against Pearce . Ruppert claimed her boss intended to . 'shame and harass' her, calling her a 'waste as a human being', and . slamming her fists in front of her. Pearce 'engaged in a severe and . pervasive pattern of mentally abusive and offensive behavior directed at . plaintiff, who suffered from a disability, which conduct was designed . to, among other things, punish plaintiff for being disabled and cause . plaintiff severe emotional distress,' the lawsuit stated. Ruppert, from Lacey, alleged . she took sick leave for psychiatric treatment as a result of workplace . bullying and and upon returning, found her workspace had been relocated . so that she would face the Wall of Shame, which had her name below it. APP reported Ruppert is also suing Borough Administrator David Maffei, claiming he should have investigated Ruppert’s complaints against Pearce to take steps to prevent a hostile working environment and discrimination. The suit claimed Maffei 'intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly and/or negligently' failed to take action because Pearce was 'his close personal friend'. Maffei and Pearce declined to comment to ABC News, citing the pending litigation. Ruppert is suing the borough, Maffei and Pearce for unspecified damages claiming emotional distress, humiliation and psychological harm. Although Ruppert is still reportedly employed at the tax office, the Borough of Mount Pleasant has advertised on its Facebook page for a part-time temporary tax clerk. It is not clear if this is Ruppert's position.

Kitty Genovese's screams for help couldn't save her on the night she was murdered outside her apartment in 1964. Fifty years later, those screams still echo, a symbol of urban breakdown and city dwellers' seeming callousness toward their neighbors. The case 'caught the spirit of the time,' said Thomas Reppetto, a police historian. 'It seemed to symbolize that society no longer cared about other people.' Mythic murder: Kitty . Genovese, 28, was stabbed to death March 13, 1964, in a random attack, which captivated New York City after The New . York Times reported that 38 people witnessed the murder and did not help her . Genovese's random stabbing by Winston . Moseley on March 13, 1964, became a sensation when The New York Times . reported that '38 respectable, law-abiding citizens' in Queens watched . the attack unfold over more than half an hour and didn't call police . during the assault.' While more recent reporting — some of it by the Times itself — found that the number of people who actually saw the murder was greatly exaggerated and that some neighbors did try to help, the Genovese case left its mark on public policy and psychology. Monster: Winston Moseley was convicted of murdering Genovese and sentenced to death, a punishment later reduced to life n prison . It has been credited with spurring adoption of the 911 system in 1968 as well as 'Good Samaritan' laws that give legal protection to people who help those in trouble. The case also gave rise to research into the 'bystander effect' — the phenomenon in which a group of onlookers fails to help someone in distress — and is often featured in psychology textbooks. At least five books about Genovese's killing have come out recently or will be published this year, a testament to the enduring fascination with the case. 'Many people were murdered that year, over 600, but she haunts us because she could have been helped and nobody did,' said Peter Hellman, a journalist and author of the e-book 'Fifty Years After Kitty Genovese, Inside the Case That Rocked Our Faith in Each Other.' According to police reports and trial testimony, Genovese was a 28-year-old bar manager living in the seemingly safe, well-kept neighborhood of Kew Gardens when she was attacked while returning home from work after 3am. Moseley later told police he had been driving around looking for a woman to kill. He spotted Genovese, chased her and stabbed her in the back. Genovese screamed, and a neighbor yelled from his window, 'Leave that girl alone!' Moseley retreated to his car but returned minutes later and found Genovese in a hallway at the back of her building, where she had collapsed. He stabbed her several more times and raped her as she lay dying. Crime scene revisited: A pedestrian uses . the stairway leading past the entrance to 82-70 Austin Street in Queens, where Genovese was viciously attacked a half-century ago . Gruesome details: Genovese was initially stabbed in the back and collapsed at the back of her building, where her attacker later found her, stabbed her again multiple times and raped her as she lay dying . The story was not widely reported until A.M. Rosenthal, then metro editor of the Times, had lunch with Police Commissioner Michael Murphy, who told him about the 38 witnesses. Rosenthal assigned a reporter to write a story about the neighbors' apathy. 'I didn't want to get involved,' one neighbor was quoted as saying. The story seemed to show that New York was an urban hell where no one would lift a finger to help a neighbor. 'It fit some people's anti-New York perspective,' said Philip Zimbardo, a retired professor of psychology at Stanford University. Some later accounts of Genovese's murder challenged the Times' version. Kevin Cook, author of 'Kitty Genovese: The Murder, the Bystanders, the Crime That Changed America,' argues that only a few neighbors saw enough of the attack to understand much of what was going on, and some of them tried to help. The Times revisited the case in 2004 on the 40th anniversary. A former prosecutor told the paper then that while far fewer than 38 saw the murder, many others heard the screams. Killer's grin: Escaped killer Winston Moseley, laughingly tells newsmen he regrets only being caught after his capture in a suburban Grand Island apartment house . Catherine Pelonero argues in her book 'Kitty Genovese: A True Account of a Public Murder and its Private Consequences' that the reporting from 1964 was fundamentally correct: 'Many people heard the screams and had very good reasonable cause to believe that a crime was taking place.' 'The most chilling part is that once she reached the back of the building, she was lying down there for several minutes calling for help,' Pelonero added. 'She was saying, ""It's Kitty! I'm stabbed! Help me!""' Moseley was convicted of murder and sentenced to death, a punishment later reduced to life in prison. He escaped during a transfer to a hospital in Buffalo in 1968, took five people hostage and raped a woman in front of her husband before surrendering to police. Now 79, Moseley is one of the longest-serving inmates in the New York state prison system. In reaction to the case, Fordham University Professor Harold Takooshian began studying bystander behavior as a graduate student in 1978. Working under the social psychologist Stanley Milgram, Takooshian conducted experiments that involved pretending to commit crimes to observe bystanders' reaction. Pretreated: Moseley escaped during a transfer to a hospital in Buffalo in 1968, took five people hostage and raped a woman in front of her husband before surrendering to police . 'The field emerged entirely because of her, and now it's a very large field,' Takooshian said. Genovese emerges in the new books as a compelling figure in her own right, a high-spirited young woman known as the class cut-up in high school. The oldest in an Italian-American family of five children, Genovese grew up in Brooklyn and stayed in New York when the rest of her family moved to New Canaan, Connecticut., in the mid-1950s. At the time of her death, she had been living with a partner, Mary Ann Zielonko, for about a year. 'She was a daughter and a sister and a lover and a colleague,' said James Solomon, a filmmaker who is working with Genovese's younger brother on a documentary about Genovese called 'The Witness.' ''She wasn't just a victim.'","Genovese, 28, was stabbed multiple times by Winston Moseley and raped as she lay bleeding to death March 13, 1964, in Queens, New York .

David Hockney’s ex-lover has escaped drugs charges in relation to the death of a 23-year-old studio assistant at the artist’s seaside mansion. John Fitzherbert, 48, was involved in a 24-hour drink and drugs binge with studio assistant Dominic Elliott before he was rushed to hospital and died from swallowing toxic toilet cleaner. An inquest heard how both men ‘partied’ through the night, taking cocaine, Ecstasy and smoking cannabis, before falling asleep in each other’s arms, down the corridor from where Mr Hockney was asleep. David Hockney's ex-lover John Fitzherbert, right, has escaped drugs charges following the death of a 23-year-old studio assistant . Shortly after Mr Elliott died, Mr Fitzherbert phoned another employee sharing the artist’s house and told him to clear his bedroom of evidence of drug use to avoid ‘adverse publicity’. Details of the apparent ‘cover up’ were revealed at the inquest last August but police decided not to pursue the matter. However, it emerged that Mr Fitzherbert and a 23-year-old man, who has not been identified, were arrested in connection with ‘drugs offences’ surrounding the tragedy. They were released on bail pending further inquiries by Humberside Police, but the investigation has now ended without anyone being charged. A police spokesman said: ‘The two men arrested on suspicion of drug offences have been unconditionally released.’ Police refused to reveal whether or not a file was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service. Ex-lovers: The multimillionaire artist David Hockney (left) was a in a relationship with John Fitzherbert (right) for 24 years before they split. They shared a house in Bridlington, Yorkshire before Mr Hockney relocated to Los Angeles . The decision - revealed almost a year after Mr Elliott’s shocking death last March - means there will be no legal repercussions from the tragedy, despite revelations of drug-taking and admissions of a ‘cover-up’ to hide evidence. Mr Hockney has left his home in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, and has moved back to his base in Los Angeles. Tragic: Dominic Elliott, who died following a drugs binge at the artist's home in Brighton . His spokesman said yesterday that he did not wish to comment. Mr Fitzherbert could not be contacted for a comment. Mr Fitzherbert previously had a 24-year relationship with the multimillionaire artist. They remained friends despite splitting up five years ago and Mr Fitzherbert continued to live in and run the five-bedroom house in Bridlington. He then developed a relationship with Mr Elliott, who became an assistant to the artist after dropping out of university. Mr Fitzherbert said that Mr Elliott came to see him on the night before his death. He was upset about his exclusion from a Vanity Fair photo shoot of Mr Hockney and his team by the leading photographer Annie Leibovitz. The two men spent the night alone together in Mr Hockney’s house drinking and taking drugs, with Mr Elliott snorting cocaine. The following day they were in bed when they heard Mr Hockney leave the house. Mr Fitzherbert said Mr Elliott was ‘laughing hysterically’ and leapt out of bed before throwing himself off an internal balcony. Mr Elliott could not explain his behaviour but Mr Fitzherbert said he was ‘prone to random behaviour’ when drunk.

Fulfilling his dreams: Jake Stoneking, 19, from West linn, Oregon, drew up a 17-strong bucket list after diagnosed with medulloblastoma in 2009 . A terminally-ill teenager has named visiting a strip club as the number one priority on his bucket list. Jake Stoneking, 19, from West Linn, Oregon, drew up the document of things he wishes to do before he dies after being diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer in 2009. It includes hunting a wild bear, getting a tattoo and watching a UFC fight. But the number one thing Jake wanted to do was visit topless bar, Jiggles, in Tualatin. And luckily for him, the club is one of the few in America that do not serve alcohol and therefore, allow under-21s into the premises. Now, the teenager has checked the wish off his list - as well as four other items, including taking a ride in a helicopter and shooting a pistol. After Jake's visit, Jiggles general manager, Brian, told the New York Daily News: 'I am beyond flattered and I hope that he had an amazing time.' He added that he wished he had known about the teenager's plans beforehand so he could have planned something special. 'I would have definitely tried to make sure that his experience there for a bucket list was a step-up from a normal experience for a customer coming off the street.' Jake, who used to be a 140lb wrestler with 'six-pack abs', was diagnosed with medulloblastoma at the age of 14 after suffering from a number of agonising headaches. He underwent 12-hour surgery on the tumour in his cerebullum - the brain centre for balance and coordination - followed by months of radiation and chemotherapy. Scroll down for video . Wish: The teenager has put visiting strip club Jiggles (pictured) in Tualatin, Oregon, as top of his bucket list . Getting there: He has checked the wish off his list - as well as four other items, including shooting a pistol . During the treatment, his weight dropped to just 104lb and he had to relearn how to walk and eat. 'He had a tumour removed about the size of a golf ball,' his father, Todd Stoneking, told ABC News. 'It pretty much took him down to nothing.' Medulloblastoma is a type of brain tumour that mainly affects children. It develops in the cerebellum - the part of the brain that controls muscle coordination and balance - but may spread to other parts of the brain. Symptoms can include headaches, sickness, sight problems, slurred speech, neck stiffness and balance problems. The tumour is more common in boys than girls - and makes up about 20 per cent of all childhood brain tumours. Source: Macmillan . Following months of gruelling treatment, Jake and his family were told his tumour had gone - only for it to return last month. This time, the teenager was told his cancer was terminal - and he may have only three months left to live. 'We thought it was gone. They did scans every three months for a year to make sure it was gone,' said Mr Stoneking. We found out in February it was back.' He added that his son's tumour now stretches from his brain to the bottom of his spinal cord, where his nerves are 'matted' with cancer. But despite his fate, Jake has taken his illness in his stride - and is quickly checking off items on his bucket list with the help of friends, family and kind-hearted strangers. The 17-strong list includes laughing until he cries, getting 'Stoneking' tattooed on his back and holding a fundraising event. 'He put stuff on there that he knows can happen,' said Mr Stoneking. Treatment: Jake is pictured in hospital after underoing 12-hour surgery on the tumour in his cerebullum. He has now been told his cancer is terminal - and he may have only three months left to live . 'We know the time is coming. But he's doing pretty good and we can still do a lot of things.' He added: 'He is an awesome kid. And I'm not just saying that because he's mine - there is something about him, his infectious smile.' Jake is taking experimental chemotherapy drugs in a bid to buy himself an extra year while completing his bucket list.

"By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 07:23 EST, 12 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 08:45 EST, 12 March 2014 . BBC radio DJ Liz Kershaw has spoken out for the first time about claims she threatened a colleague who later killed himself. Ms Kershaw, 55, was accused of leaving a series of threatening phone messages for colleague Russell Joslin, 50, who worked for BBC Coventry and Warwickshire radio, and suffocated himself in hospital 18 months ago. An inquest into Mr Joslin's death heard he feared a complaint of sexual harassment he made against a colleague, later identified by Mr Joslin's father as Ms Kershaw, would spell the end of his career. But today Ms Kershaw, who worked at BBC . Coventry and Warwickshire between 2005 and 2011, gave her side of the . story, saying: 'I understand why a grieving family looks for someone . to blame.  But their troubled son's problems were not caused by . me.' 'I am not to blame': BBC radio DJ Liz Kershaw, 55, says she did not cause Russell Joslin's mental health problems . Now a DJ at the digital station BBC Radio 6 Music, the mother-of-two said she became friends with Mr Joslin, a reporter at the station, when he asked her for career advice.  She said he was upset about his job, fearing he was going nowhere at work, and saying he didn't get on with colleagues. Writing in her new book, The Bird and The Beeb, Ms Kershaw said she became friends with Mr Joslin and went out to lunch with him so often that colleagues joked about it. But she said her friendship with him became strained when she had to cope with personal problems of her own, particularly a return of the cervical cancer she had got rid of a decade before. In her book, serialised in the Mirror today, Ms Kershaw rebutted suggestions she might have sexually harrassed Mr Joslin, saying: 'I didn't have time or energy to deal with my colleague, never mind try to shag him as he claimed later.' And she said he frightened her by taking her to a 'dogging' hotspot, where couples have sex in cars, watched by others, one evening after telling her he had a good local story. Ms Kershaw said that Mr Joslin took her . to some woods and told her what dogging was, but said the pair fled when . a group of men walked towards their branded BBC car looking menacing. 'Troubled': BBC reporter Mr Joslin died after telling BBC bosses he had been sexually harassed by a colleague . As a result, she said, she asked him if he was wanting more than friendship from her, and said he replied rudely telling her if he was looking for a girlfriend, it would be one much younger than her. Ms Kershaw admits in her autobiography that she 'probably' did leave him voice messages, because she was angry and upset by his behaviour.  She said he called her 'menopausal' and 'old', upsetting her so much that she ended their relationship for good. But she insisted that she was not to blame for Mr Joslin's troubled state of mind or behaviour. After Mr Joslin's death his father, former Warwickshire police chief Peter Joslin, named Ms Kershaw as the woman who made threatening phone calls to his son. He said Russell Joslin was driven to his death after BBC bosses failed to take seriously allegations that he had been offended by a female colleague in 2007. Glory days: Liz Kershaw in 1989 when she worked at BBC Radio 1 with colleagues Anthea Turner and Bruno Brookes . And Mr Joslin senior said he his son had recordings of 'very unpleasant' messages left by Ms Kershaw on his son's phone, branding him a 'flake' and a 'loser'. The former police chief said shortly after his son's death: 'They were very unpleasant and she made it clear that she felt she was on a different level to him. 'A lot of things happened because he had to carry on working with her. He did not tell us everything but it badly affected him. Ms Kershaw, who worked for Radio 1 in the Eighties, claimed last year that there was a culture of sexual harassment of women at Radio 1, and said she had been groped while working there. Her claims about abuse at the BBC triggered a new Commons inquiry into the shelving of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse investigation. Born in Rochdale, Lancashire in 1958, Liz Kershaw - the sister of fellow broadcaster Andy Kershaw - began her media career in Leeds with a column in the Yorkshire Post. In 1984 she and her neighbour, Carol Vorderman, formed their own band, Dawn Chorus and the Bluetits, with another friend, Lindsay Forrest. Band: Liz Kershaw, centre, with Lindsay Forrest, left, and Carol Vorderman in their band, Dawn Chorus and the Bluetits in 1984 . The following year she began presenting a weekly rock show for BBC Radio Leeds, before moving to London the following year and devising her own show, Backchat, for BBC Radio 1 in 1987. Ms Kershaw then presented the Radio 1 Evening Show, Radio 1's Weekend Breakfast Show with Bruno Brookes, and the Radio 1 Roadshow from 1989 to 1992. In 1992 Ms Kershaw moved to BBC Radio 5, where she worked until 2000 when she moved into local radio. She joined BBC Coventry and Warwickshire in 2005, and worked there until 2011.  She now presents a regular show on digital station, BBC Radio 6 Music.","BBC Coventry and Warwickshire reporter Russell Joslin, 50, died in 2012 .

A couple claim they spotted a black panther on the loose in an Essex field, describing it as a ‘big scary cat’. Lynn Lacy and husband Michael were at home when they allegedly spotted the beast, which they claim was ‘jet black’ and ‘too big’ to be a dog or cat. Mrs Lacy, 56, took this photo of the unknown animal on her iPhone after she spotted it on the edge of Hatfield Forest yesterday. Lynn Lacy and husband Michael were at home in Great Hallingbury, Essex, when they allegedly spotted the beast, which they claim was 'jet black' and 'too big' to be a dog or cat . The support worker, from Great Hallingbury, Essex, said: ‘My husband spotted it first - he called me and said “Come and have a look at this”. Close-up: The 'jet black' animal is described by Lynn Lacy as having its 'head down and prowling' ‘I looked out and saw a black cat. It looked too big to be a dog or a cat, but too small to be a horse. ‘It had a long tail swishing from side to side. It was jet black, head down and prowling. ‘It was unfamiliar and walked in an unfamiliar way.’ She said the field, near Wall Wood, is normally home to horses and goats but claims there were none in sight when she spotted this animal. In the photo, the black animal can be seen in a field which is within walking distance to Howe Green House School, a private primary school. The photograph is not to dissimilar to that of the Essex lion – which sparked a huge search in Clacton August 2012 amidst fears there was a big cat in the wild. However, after a huge manhunt by police, it turned out the Essex lion was in fact a three-year-old domestic cat called Teddy Bear. Today, Essex Police confirmed no calls had been made to the force reporting any big cat sightings over the last few days. A huge manhunt was launched in Clacton, Essex, in August 2012 after this photograph of a 'big cat' was feared to be a lion on the loose.

An avalanche triggered deliberately at a Washington state ski resort caused $2 million in damage when it went out of control. Staff at Crystal Mountain had used explosives to shift snow that was becoming unstable, but the avalanche didn't quite go to plan. Several tons of snow took out the chairlift and about 100 trees, as the avalanche traveled 1,000ft down the slopes on Monday afternoon. Scroll down for video . Damage: A huge wall of snow packs around the chairlift on Crystal Mountain . Wipeout: A controlled avalanche went awry, causing up to $2 million damage at the resort . A ski lift tower that had been bolted to a concrete block was knocked down and part of the terminal was knocked about 20ft from its foundation. Fortunately no one was injured in the controlled avalanche, which was set off when 25lb of explosive was detonated on the popular Throne route, on a day the resort was closed. 'Once the freight train leaves it leaves a pathway of destruction,' Paul Baugher, the ski patrol director, told the Seattle Times. 'It was . a huge area, four or five football fields wide. Tons upon tons of snow, . in some places 30ft deep.' The massive wave of snow was estimated to have been a size four on the avalanche scale, where five is the most severe. Safety: Explosives were used to trigger snow that was becoming unstable and dangerous . Snowed in: The terminal that runs the chairlift was knocked about 20ft from its foundations . Despite its size, described as being capable of destroying a railway car, several buildings or 10 acres of forest, the avalanche moved quietly. 'One thing you do hear is the timber snapping like matchsticks,' Mr Baugher said. In a YouTube video filmed by the resort's owners, who had laid the explosives to trigger it, a cascade of snow can be seen tumbling down the mountain and snapping trees. 'Kim, it's huge,' resort owner Jim Kircher can be heard saying, as the couple watched the avalanche make its way down the mountain. Maintenance: Owners of the Crystal Mountain resort regularly clear away unstable snow to make conditions safer . Crisp: The avalanche was triggered on the Throne run, which is popular with experienced skiers . Upgrade: The resort will have to install new chairlifts on the run after the avalanche knocked the old one over . Kim Kircher told KUOW: 'It was just a thundering, ripping sound.

She said it was the largest avalanche she had witnessed in more than 25 years of patrolling the mountain.","Explosives set off on Crystal Mountain to clear unstable snow .

The 19-year-old gunman who shot dead two store workers in a Maryland mall before killing himself, timed his attack to start at the same time as the 1999 Columbine High School shooting, police said. Darion Aguilar had a fascination with the school shooting and is believed to have waited inside the mall for more than 40 minutes before beginning his January 25 attack. Police said on Wednesday that the teenager, who had made thousands of internet searches on mass murder, didn't know his victims and acted alone. Attack: Darion Aguilar pictured with a shotgun just weeks before the mall shooting . Mental health issues: A journal entry written by Darion Aguilar, who had complained to his doctor about hearing voices . Investigators have been scrutinizing the gunman's computers, cell phone and other records since he shot dead Brianna Benlolo, 21, and Tyler Johnson, 25, in Zumiez skateboarding store, before turning the gun on himself. The victims both worked in the store. Miss Benlolo was also the mother to a two-year-old son. Obsession: Darion Aguilar was fascinated by the Columbine attack, police say . Just before the shooting, Aguilar had posted a photo of himself on Tumblr in which he is dressed in a way that resembled what one . of the Columbine killers wore, Howard County Police Chief William J McMahon said. 'Police have confirmed Aguilar waited inside the mall for over 40 minutes after being dropped off by a cab, and believe he may have been waiting to begin his shooting at the same time that the Columbine massacre started, at 11.14am, according to a police statement. Aguilar told a doctor in April last year that he was hearing voices, McMahon said. The voices were 'nonviolent and nonspecific,' the police chief added. The doctor referred him to a psychiatrist, but police could not find that Aguilar ever met with one. A review of his Internet searches found visits to mental health sites, including ones where people considering suicide seek help. Aguilar had no criminal record before the shooting. But a search of his computer revealed thousands of searches for mass shootings at schools and malls. His Tumblr account also featured hundreds of pictures of shootings and other disturbing images, and the teenager had downloaded a game based on the Columbine shooting. In the months leading up to the attack, Aguilar also visited online suicide chat rooms and looked up mental health issues. Then, on December 10, the teenager legally bought a single-barrel shotgun that could be broken down into several pieces. Devoted mom: Store worker Brianna Benlolo had a two-year-old son . Victims: Brianna Benlolo and Tyler Johnson were shot dead by Aguilar on January 25 . Tracked: Security camera footage from an ATM shows Aguilar on the day of the shooting . Mall security camera footage shows the gunman heading to the food court about an hour before the shooting . He returned to the same store between December 10 and 24 to buy rounds of ammunition, and also bought ammunition at a Bass Pro store on December 28. Police say on January 25 he carried the gun into the mall inside his backpack, before piecing it together in the dressing room of the skate store moments before the shooting. Two homemade explosives were also in the bag, which he left in the dressing room. Just before he killed his two victims, Aguilar posted a final message on his Tumblr account, alongside a photo of him with the gun. The message read: 'I had to do this. Today is the day. On previous days I tried this I woke up with anxiety, regret and hope for a better future this day I didnâ€™t, I woke up felt no emotions no empathy no sympathy. I will have freedom or maybe not. I could care less.' Movement: Police have constructed a timeline of the teenager's actions in the hours leading up to his death . Arrival: Aguilar is seen being dropped off by a taxi at the Columbia Mall . The 19-year-old is seen walking towards the Zumiez store at 11.01am. The shooting occurred less than 15 minutes later . Police have released a timeline of his . moves on the day of the attack, along with surveillance footage showing . him buying rounds of ammunition in December, and walking around the . mall on the day of the killing. The teenager is seen making his way towards the skateboard store less than 15 minutes before the shooting. The store had no security cameras fitted, so no footage shows the attack taking place. A couple of hours after the shooting Aguilar's mother reported him missing. The search for him intensified after police were shown his journal, NBC News reported. An extract from the journal was released at a press conference on Wednesday. The teenager had said he was anxious and full of hatred. 'You are all pathetic pieces of s*** who deserve to die. Worthless, you are all f****** worthless,' he wrote. Another line read: 'Everything seems fake. I think I may already be dead.' Shooting: A disassembled shotgun. The teenager killed two people before turning a gun on himself . Explosive material from two homemade bombs was found in the gunman's bag . Aguilar was spotted on security camera footage buying ammunition at a Bass Pro store on December 28 . Just after the shootings, his mother described her troubled son as 'a gentle, sweet kid' who has never been interested in guns. 'If you were to go in his room you . would see what a gentle sweet kid he was,' she said, adding that he was a . vegetarian because he was concerned about animal welfare. 'I . don't know what happened, I really don't. It's so unusual, you can talk . to any of his friends and find out what a gentle person he was.

This is the incredible moment two elephants were reunited - more than 20 years after they performed in a circus together. Shirley and Jenny were filmed meeting for the first time since the late 1970s at an animal sanctuary in Hohenwald, Tennessee. And the results were amazing - with the pair seen locking trunks, hugging and playing with each other. Scroll down for video . Reunion: This is the moment elephants Shirley (left) and Jenny met for the first time in more than 20 years . Reaching out: The mammals were filmed being reunited The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, Tennessee . Wiping her eyes: They were pictured locking trunks, hugging and playing with each other. They could even be seen bending the bars between them in a bid to be as close as possible. Above, Jenny extends her trunk . Comforting each other: Carol Buckley, director of The Elephant Sanctuary, described the reunion as 'dramatic' They even managed to bend the metal bars between them in a bid to be as close as possible. Carol Buckley, former director of The Elephant Sanctuary, described the moment the elephants were reunited in 1999 as 'dramatic'. 'There was an immediate urgency in Jenny's behaviour. She wanted to get close to Shirley who was divided by two stalls,' she wrote on the sanctuary's website. 'She became agitated, banging on the gate and trying to climb through and over. Old friends: Shirley and Jenny had performed together with Carson and Barnes Circus during the late 1980s . 'Once Shirley was allowed into the adjacent stall the interaction between her and Jenny became quite intense.' The elephants had performed together in various locations across Texas during their time at Carson and Barnes Circus. At the time, Shirley was in her twenties and Jenny was just a calf. The saying that 'elephants never forget' may be true, according to a study by the University of Pennsylvania in 2011. Researchers found the mammals form lasting bonds with their friends - and are able to recognise them even if they have spent a lengthy time apart. They can also track their peers over . large distances by calling out and using their sense of smell. Study author Dr Shermin de Silva said: 'Our work shows that they are able recognize their friends and renew these bonds even after being apart for a long time.' Following their separation, they were sent to different zoos - and did not see each other for a staggering 22 years. During their reunion, broadcast by PBS, the elephants can be seen touching, nestling and exploring each other. Seconds later, the pair can be heard roaring loudly - as if expressing their emotion through touch is not enough. 'I have never experienced anything even close to this depth of emotion,' said Ms Buckley. 'This relationship is intense and resembles that of mother and daughter. We are so blessed.'

A distraught widow discovered a digger had driven over her husband's grave and churned it up into a muddy mess - when she went to visit the cemetery on his birthday.

There's tyre marks from the digger right the way across it' But when widow Sharon, 49, visited it on what would have been Ian’s birthday she found council groundsmen had driven a digger over the plot and left tyre tracks in the turf as they dug a hole for a neighbouring grave. Shocked Mrs White, of Sheerness, Kent, said: ‘They have moved his stuff so you can’t even see there’s a grave. ‘There’s tyre marks from the digger right the way across it. ‘They had put boards over the other graves nearby but not on his.
