Ever had that sinking feeling when you open the front door in the morning and wonder where you left the car? Did you leave it on the road, park it in the garage... or has somebody stolen it? The last thing you'd probably think of is that it might have been swallowed up by the ground . Scroll down for video . A family has been evacuated from their home after a sinkhole opened up in their driveway and swallowed their car . They woke up to discover their Volkswagen Lupo at the bottom of the 30ft hole which opened up on the driveway of their house in Walter's Ash, Buckinghamshire . The car was just identifiable through its muddy covering, lying at the bottom of the pit, which was 30ft deep and about 15ft across . But that's exactly what happened to 19-year-old Zoe Smith, whose Volkswagen Lupo fell down a 30ft-deep sinkhole in the night. Now . the car, which she relies on to get to work, is a write-off, lying at . the bottom of the pit, which stretches 15ft across the family's driveway . – to within inches of the house itself. Miss Smith's stepfather Phil Conran, said: 'We hadn't heard anything at all. There was no indication whatsoever. 'At 7am my daughter went out the front door and instead of her car being there, there was a huge hole. 'I was gobsmacked. The first thing I did was phone the police because we didn't know what to do. 'We weren't absolutely sure the car was in there but it seemed too much of a coincidence for it not to be.' The doomed VW Lupo at the bottom of the crevice belonged to teenager Zoe Smith (stock picture) The giant hole is about 15ft in diameter and 30ft deep and appeared in the drive just feet away from the wall of the house . The wet weather in December and January may have caused the hole, at the house by eroding earth used to fill in the old clay, stone and chalk pits . Mr . Conran, 59, an environmental consultant, said the police called . firefighters to the house in Walters Ash, Buckinghamshire, to secure the . area. Watch manager Stuart Grosse said: 'We get a few calls of this . nature, mainly in the south of the county. Historically, holes have . appeared in the area due to clay mining.' Writing . about mining in the area on a community website, a local historian . explained: 'Earlier inhabitants of Naphill and Walters Ash made a living . by digging on the Common and in the fields – digging for clay to make . bricks, for chalk to make agricultural lime and for stone to shape as . building and road making materials. 'The records show this going back from the 1950s to the early 1800s, and such activity may have started many years before that.' It is thought the recent wet weather may have caused the hole  to open up by eroding earth used to fill in the old pits. Now . local building inspectors are assessing whether the property is secure. Mr Conran hopes it will be because there was no structural damage to . the property which he believes was built on a concrete raft to safeguard . against sinkholes. Mr . Conran added: 'The real shock of all this is the horror of what might . have been had Zoe gone out and been inside it when it sank. It overtakes . all other concerns. 'All you can see is part of the side of the car and it's filled with mud.'","Sinkhole swallowed VW Lupo after opening suddenly in middle of night .

A benefits cheat who pocketed around £100,000 in disability allowances claiming she was 'virtually immobile' has been caught on film trampolining. Sonia Mellor, 33, falsely claimed a raft of benefits on the basis that she was a housebound single parent, exaggerating her condition in order to qualify for the higher rate of Disability Living Allowance. The mother-of-three also failed to notify the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) that her partner David Walker, who was working, had moved into her home - allowing her to pocket Income Support, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. High life: Benefits cheat Sonia Mellor is filmed . bouncing on a trampoline. She told authorities she was 'virtually . immobile' in order to claim a raft of benefits . She was caught following a three . month long surveillance operation of her home in Worsley, Greater . Manchester after an investigation was launched in July 2011. The . court was played surveillance footage filmed by investigators, which . showed Mellor walking her children to school and taking them shopping. When . police seized her laptop and phone following her arrest on January 5, . 2012, they were shocked to discover home videos which showed her trampolining at a . party in 2010. Earlier that year, Mellor had filled out a . self-assessment form claiming she would be in severe discomfort when . walking short distances and needed walking aids. She claimed she spent all day in bed and needed 24 hour care to help her with everyday tasks. Mellor, 34, walks free from court after being handed a suspended sentence . She was caught following a three . month long surveillance operation of her home in Worsley, Greater . Manchester after an investigation was launched in July 2011 . The . court was played surveillance footage filmed by investigators, which . showed Mellor walking her children to school and taking them shopping. Sentencing . Mellor at Manchester Crown Court, Judge Andrew Blake said: 'You do have . some serious disabilities which are long-standing, but you have . exaggerated them. 'You pretended that your worst days were every day. 'The . public will be outraged by the sorts of claims you have made and you . will be pursued relentlessly in the civil courts for repayments of that . money.' The court heard that Mellor, who suffers from epilepsy, arthritis, depression and anxiety, was entitled to some DLA but falsely claimed around £30,000 more than she would have qualified for, by exaggerating her condition. By failing to notify the department about a change in her circumstances when her partner moved in in May 2008, meaning she was no longer a single parent, Mellor was given around £75,000 in Income Support, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit which she wasn’t entitled to. David Potter, prosecuting, read out a number of text messages sent by Mellor to her partner in August 2010 which said: 'Thanks for putting the bins out. I shouldn’t be putting them out in case someone is watching.' Another read: 'I have grafted my a*** off today. Our bedroom is spotless, the kid’s bedroom is spotless and the bathrooms are.' Another said: 'Listen, I might have to buy a wheelchair and give you the money back. 'I have been reading about visitors and they can send a letter and come the following day. I need to start getting prepared. 'Just going to lay it on major thick.' Mellor, who was joined in court by members of her family, wept throughout the two-hour hearing. She was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for 18 months and given a 12-month supervision order plus a four-month curfew. Speaking after the trial, Roy Paul, DWP fraud manager in the North West, said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system. 'Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of. 'It is unfair that some people get support when they do not have a disability, while many people depend on the benefits system to provide a safety net. 'Deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime. 'Don’t wait for our fraud investigators to find you. Tell us of a change now.'","Single mother-of-three Sonia Mellor, 33, claimed a raft of benefits .

Two sisters of an Iowa state representative have been found dead of apparent gunshot wounds in the Pittsburgh home they shared, and police are investigating the case as a double homicide. The bodies of 44-year-old Susan Wolfe and 38-year-old Sarah Wolfe were found Friday afternoon in their basement after they didn't show up for work, authorities said. Police found Sarah Wolfe's car around 1:15 a.m. Saturday parked nearly a mile away. Sarah Wolfe was a psychiatrist for Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, and Susan Wolfe was a teacher's aide at Hillel Academy in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood. Crime scene: The Wolfe sisters were found shot to death on Friday afternoon in the basement of the home they shared (center) Pittsburgh police Lt. Daniel Herrmann said they don't have a motive for the killings, and there were no signs of forced entry. Family members, most of whom live in Iowa, said they're still trying to figure out what happened. A sister, Mary Wolfe, is an Iowa Democratic state representative. Her website says she is the oldest of eight children, six girls and two boys. On her Facebook page Saturday night, Rep. Wolfe thanked friends, neighbors and colleagues for their support. 'We are so grateful,' she wrote. 'Heartbroken, but grateful.' The medical examiner's office has not released causes of death, but police say it appears the women had been shot. 'They're complex cases,' Medical Examiner Karl Williams said Saturday. ""... Things change, . bruising patterns change, different things if you wait a little while. 'We . do it fairly routinely if we think we may be able to see other patterns . of injury develop after a period of time,' Dr. Williams told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. On Thursday, Susan went to work at the Hillel Academy at the normal time - about 7:25 a.m. - and left about 5 p.m., apologizing that she couldn't stay late because she had an appointment at 5:30. Pediatrics: Sarah Wolfe was an accomplished pediatric psychologist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center . '[Susan always went to work] eager to start the day, greeted the children at the door, read them . books while waiting for other children to arrive ... Her smile was . infectious. She approached every day with optimism,' Dori Oshlag, the director of the center, said. On Friday, when Susan didn't show up for work, Oshlag got nervous and began calling her house about 8:20 a.m. but got no answer. Text messages and emails also went unanswered. 'And by noon, myself and the staff and administration realized we had to . make a difficult call to ask for help. The rest is history,' she said. By noon, Oshlag and other friends who'd noticed the women were missing, started calling police. Authorities performed a wellness check just after 1 p.m. and found the bodies. Each sister was pronounced dead at 1:48 p.m. Friday. Devastated: Iowa state Representative Mary Wolfe (right) is devastated by the loss of her two sisters . On Saturday, authorities found Sarah Wolfe's vehicle parked on the street about a mile from the home she shared with her sister. Each of the sisters had an excellent reputation amongst those who knew them best. Sarah Wolfe's boyfriend, Matthew Bucholz, posted a note on Facebook describing his deceased girlfriend as a 'beautiful, brilliant funny woman who worked as a children's . psychiatrist and was an old school riot ""grrrl.""...This whole thing is . unimaginably sad.' Authorities say they are not looking at Bucholz as a suspect in the murders. Sarah Wolfe's former landlord described her as a dream tenant who often put her February rent in Valentines Day cards, and who baked cakes and brought them over to her house for no special reason. 'We were just so happy to have her,' former landlord Kelly Carter told the paper.. 'She turned out to be a model tenant and a model neighbor and friend.' In November, Wolfe left her rental property and purchased the house on Chislett Street - where she and her sister were both found dead. Shortly after moving in, Wolfe's house was burglarized, according to Carter, whom she asked for help fixing a broken window. Carter says she advised her to get a burglar alarm, although it's unclear whether she did. 'I . really hope they find who did this. I can't imagine [Wolfe] hanging out with . unsavory individuals. She's such a nice person that maybe someone got . through,' Carter said.","Sarah and Susan Wolfe were found shot to death in the basement of the home they shared in Pittsburgh .

America's self-proclaimed 'mom-in-chief' has some advice for the parents of perpetually troubled pop star Justin Bieber, who in the last month has been charged with multiple crimes in several different states as critics blast the child star as 'going off the rails.' Michele Obama - in an interview released Friday - says she would advise Bieber's parents to play a more active role in the young star's chaotic life. 'I would pull him close,” Obama said of the 19-year-old pop singer in an interview with Univision, when asked how she’d treat the troubled star if she were his mother. Troubled: Michele Obama isn't the only influential politico who has some advice for the troubled star . Mom-in-chief: Michele Obama says Bieber's mother should play a more active role in his life . 'I don’t know if it would be advice as much as action. I would be very present in his life right now. And I would be probably with him a good chunk of the time, just there to talk, to figure out what’s going on in his head, to figure out who’s in his life and who’s not, you know,' she continued. The first lady added that she's noticed with her own teen children that they 'just want you near, you know, they want that advice from a parent. They want to see you on a daily basis.' Obama added that because Bieber is 'still a kid, he's still growing,' that lesson still applies. The first lady isn't the only high-profile politico who's chimed in on Bieber's multiple brushes with the law - Florida Senator Marco Rubio also has weighed in on the troubled star, while noting that members of Congress have other, more pressing issues to be worrying about than the latest child star run amok. Pull him close: Obama says she'd advise Bieber's mother, Pattie Mallette, to 'pull him close' Dad: Bieber's father, Jeremy Bieber, has been criticized recently for contributing to his son's less-than-legal antics . 'I don’t know, man, we have got our hands full with things other than that. I hope he gets some help. That dude is in trouble,' Rubio told TMZ in a video posted last month. Despite lawmakers having other priorities, Rubio insisted that he hopes Bieber gets the help he needs. 'The last thing we need to be dealing with is some 19-year-old pop star, but just from the little bit I read and I heard, it sounds like he’s got a lot of problems,' Rubio said.'A lot of problems, personal. I hope he gets some help for it, or he is going to wind up in a bad, bad place,' the senator added. Stripper: This photo of Bieber and a pal getting very friendly with a stripper is one of the many PR headaches Bieber has caused his handlers . Trouble: Senator Marco Rubio said recently of Bieber, 'that dude's in trouble,' and that he would 'wind up in a bad, bad place' In the days following his arrest in Florida for allegedly drag-racing with a rented Lamborghini while high on marijuana and prescription medication, a petition was started to have the Baby singer - who is a citizen of Canada - deported back to the U.S.' neighbor to the North. Within days, the petition garnered more than 100,000 signatures.","Obama says Bieber's mom should 'pull him in close'

Large shards of ice continued to fall from One World Trade Center in lower Manhattan this weekend, yet authorities failed to close off nearby streets or the PATH station to protect passersby. Pedestrians and those using the train had to scurry for cover Saturday as daggers of ice slid off the nation's tallest building at an estimated 100 mph. Meanwhile, a new video has emerged showing the frightening ice splinters falling from the sky in March 2013 - proving the sloped Freedom Tower's design flaw was first spotted a year ago. On Friday, the tumbling ice forced the World Trade Center PATH station to grind to a halt at morning rush hour and officials cordoned off the area for half an hour. The north pool of the 9/11 Memorial was also closed for several hours. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Dangerous: A new video, pictured, has emerged showing the frightening ice splinters falling from the sky Friday . But the station was kept open over the weekend and people in the streets had to fend for themselves. 'We just saw ice falling down the building,' Austrian tourist Katharina Amann, 24, told the New York Daily News. 'It was scary. Then I heard it shatter.' There have been no reported injuries in the ice shower, but Port Authority officials said they were keeping a close eye on the situation. 'Each incident was fully investigated and proper protocols were followed,' spokesman Steve Coleman told the Daily News. 'Ice falling from buildings occurs in urban environments such as Manhattan, and we are taking all appropriate safety measures when the situation arises.' Street food vendor Mohammed Mohammed, 32, said four chunks of ice landed on his truck, which he parks across the street from 7 World Trade Center. Tallest in the land: Ice daggers plummeted onto the street and a train station below the 1,776-foot-tall Freedom Tower . 'There was a big bang,' he told the Daily News. 'It was worse than rocks. The ice is sharp like a knife. It was shattering like glass. If someone got hit with it, it would really hurt.' Columbia University physicist Professor Jeremy Dodd estimated the ice would be falling about 100 mph and told the Daily News it could cause 'pretty catastrophic damage' if the ice hit someone on the head. Design flaws on the sloped 1,776-foot-tall glass building have been blamed for the dangerous falling ice because the angle of the glass acts as a ski jump, witnesses told the New York Daily News. 'The ice just comes down the side and shoots off,' a PATH worker told the newspaper Friday. An initial video of the ice shows it falling from the very top of the building and raining down on the streets and station below. The Exchange Place PATH station, in Jersey City directly across the Hudson River from the World Trade Center, was also closed Friday morning for falling ice, according to WCBS. Closure: This picture shows Friday's transport chaos due to the falling ice below One World Trade Center . Nightmare commute: Thousands of people were forced through cramped hallways as the still-under-construction transit hub was shutdown . Frozen Friday: Commuters trying to head up a set of escalators on the right leading out of the PATH station were thwarted by falling ice raining down on streets just outside . The busy subway station's main entrance was shut just before 9 a.m., with the rest of the area shutdown a short time later.  All but a memorial pool were reopened by 9:30 a.m. The closure was chaotic because the doors were sealed shut but trains kept unloading thousands of passengers from Newark and Hoboken into the quickly filling platforms and concourses. Passengers were routed through an alternate exit to Brookfield Place, formerly the World Financial Center, away from most offices and all possible subway connections, according to Gothamist. Several people told the website that no announcements were being made over the PA system and that people were being herded in the complete opposite direction from the vast majority of them wanted to go. Many people were grumpy, but one Jersey City woman saw the bright side of the minor inconvenience. 'I don't really mind if it's for safety,' Maya Baramidze told the Wall Street Journal. Closed for safety: Pedestrians were barred from this atrium and the surrounding streets as ice came showering down from above . Memorial pools: One of two reflecting pools in the footprint of the original Twin Towers was closed to protect people from the falling ice . WATCH AS ICE FALLS FROM FREEDOM TOWER IN MARCH 2013 . It took almost half an hour for the Port Authority to suspend PATH service into the station, but the crowds were already overflowing and the damage had been done. 'PATH gets a zero for their performance today,' a man identified only as Jeff told Gothamist. 'Poor communication and poor handling of the situation.' This is not the first time falling ice has caused problems at the massive building. People were sent running for cover in March 2013 as shards of ice showered nearby Vescey Street. The PATH train is an underground subway that connects the New Jersey cities of Hoboken, Jersey City and Newark with midtown and Lower Manhattan. It is the seventh-busiest transit system in the country, according to a recent transit industry report.","Large shards of ice continued to fall from One World Trade Center in lower Manhattan this weekend, yet authorities failed to close off nearby streets or the PATH station .

'He wants to come here to see us, I just hope the Mexican authorities will allow him to. 'But even if they don't we are prepared to go to El Salvador to talk to him.'

Ezequiel . grew up with four brothers in the poor fishing village of El Fortin, . Chiapas, with his mother Rosella and his stepfather. Mr Alvarenga and Ezequiel set sail from the small fishing village of Costa Azul, also in the Chiapas, in late 2012. But strong northerly winds forced to the pair off course and they were left helplessly adrift at sea. After four months at sea Ezequiel sadly died while later Mr Alvarenga spent another 11 months in their small fishing boat before washing up on the Marshall Islands, in the Pacific Ocean, 6,000 miles from where he originally set sail. A contemplative Mr Cordoba added: 'What happened to both of them is horrible and truly remarkable. 'Jose told me he feels an obligation to our family to see us in person to explain everything. 'Of course I still have some questions about what happened but I am glad that Jose survived because this way I can find out the complete truth. 'If they both died I would never have known what happened and the unknown can be much harder to deal with.' Mr Alvarenga had been receiving medical treatment for severe dehydration in the Marshall Islands but was finally released from hospital on Saturday, however, doctors have said he is still not fit enough to travel. It is still unclear whether Mr Alvarenga, who lived between the poor fishing towns of Costa Azul and Paredon in Chiapas, which is the poorest state in Mexico, will be allowed to return to his adopted country.","Nicolas Cordoba, 47, shed light on his son Ezequiel Cordoba's last moments after he was contacted by a distraught Jose Salvador Alvarenga .

But Mr Alvarenga, who was distraught at losing his shipmate, was desperate to give the young sailor 'a proper burial' and hoped he would be rescued before the body decomposed .

The first picture has emerged of a castaway from El Salvador enjoying a decent meal after 13 months living off raw fish and turtle blood, as it is revealed that after his arduous journey, he's afraid of flying. Jose Salvador Alvarenga washed ashore late last month in the Marshall Islands after spending more than a year drifting across the Pacific Ocean living on what he could catch. In the photograph, the unkempt shark fisherman is seen happily indulging in some bread and a bowl of food last Monday in the cabin of a Marshall Islands Sea Patrol boat as he was being transferred from where he first reached land to Majuro, the capital. Yum! In this Monday, February 3, 2014 photo released by Willing Kajidrik of the Marshall Islands Sea Patrol, Jose Salvador Alvarenga, left, eats inside the cabin of a patrol boat while being transferred to Majuro, Marshall Islands . Rescuers: The picture was released by Willing Kajidrik, a sea patrol crew of the Marshall Islands Sea Patrol, who helped rescue Alvarenga . After surviving on the raw flesh of turtles, fish and seabirds caught with his bare hands and drinking their blood when there was no rain, and his own urine when there was no blood, Alvarenga no doubt relished the nourishment. The image, supplied by Willing Kajidrik of the Marshall Islands Sea Patrol today, comes as it's revealed that after surviving such an ordeal, the humble 37-year-old is scared to fly. 'He seemed really nervous about something so I asked him what the problem was,' the Deputy Head of Mission from Manila's Mexican Embassy, Christian Clay, told MailOnline. 'He asked me ""what do I have to do on the plane?"" This guy went through this incredible voyage and here he is nervous about being on a plane. I told him he doesn't have to do anything. ""Just sit there and they'll bring you food and drink."" He seemed pretty happy about that.' New look: Looking clean shaven Alvarenga spoke briefly in a low voice at a press conference last week, thanking the government and his friends for their help . Boat: Willing Kajidrik also released a photo of police checking the 7-meter fishing boat of Jose Salvador Alvarenga after it was pulled onto the shore following his rescue, on Marshall Islands . Alvarenga was released from hospital in Majuro on Friday but is too weak to travel and will remain in the island nation for a while to rest. Diego . Dalton, an official with El Salvador's embassy in Tokyo, said . Alvarenga's health was 'very frail' and that he would not return home . until he was able to make the journey. Dalton arrived in Majuro late Friday and met with Alvarenga and local officials. 'At this moment, there are no travel plans or definite itinerary,' Dalton told reporters Saturday. 'His return will depend of when his health allows the long journey back.' According to CNN, the castaway has been moved to an undisclosed location to avoid the crush of media that has descended on the small island nation. Security around Alvarenga has tightened since he came ashore last week and Friday night he was moved from the Marshall Islands Resort Hotel in Majuro, the sources told the network. They added that, to confuse the media, security guards have remained at the room where he was previously staying to give the impression he is still there.

He said his mental as well as physical health had improved. 'He . was a bit ""off,"" maybe it's due to him being in the open for so many . months and not talking to people, but I think he is finally getting it . back,' Briand said. Alvarenga's spritely appearance Monday . while greeting hundreds of well-wishers in Majuro had many questioning . his story. He earlier told officials he left Mexico in late 2012 with . another fisherman, who later died, for a day of shark fishing when a . storm threw them off course and they began drifting. But Alvarenga looked much weaker Thursday during a brief public appearance at the hotel, and had to be assisted into the room by two people while others stood by ready to help. Officials said then that Alvarenga needed to be taken back to the hospital for more medical checks and that it would likely be three or four days before he was fit enough to travel back to El Salvador.","In the photograph, Jose Salvador Alvarenga is seen happily indulging in some bread and a bowl of food .

A church clock maintained by a devoted doctor for almost thirty years stopped at the very same moment he passed away. Dr John Farrer climbed the narrow stone spiraled stairs of the St James' Church clock tower in Clapham, North Yorkshire, every week for three decades. He died at his home aged 92 surrounded by family on New Year's Day. The clock on the tower of St James' Church in Clapham, Yorkshire, stopped at the very moment, 8.15am, Dr John Farrer (pictured with his wife Joan, right) passed away . The doctor had maintained the clock  - winding and cleaning it - every week for thirty years . Dr John Farrer, pictured, emigrated from Australia in the 1950s after he inherited the Ingleborough estate - located close to the church . The man's son, also Dr John Farrer, glanced at his watch as his father slipped away - and later realised the church clock also stopped at the exact same time. Dr Farrer said: 'The clock stopped literally to the minute of dad's death. As a family doctor I'm used to looking at my watch because sometimes it can be critical for the death certificate. The doctor, pictured as a young man, continued working as a medic until he was 70 . 'It was just habit that I did it as we knew he was going to die. He was having palliative treatment, but I realised he had stopped breathing and I read the time on my watch as 8.15am. 'It was only later when I spoke to two different people in the village that we realised the clock had stopped at the same time.' Dr Farrer's death came just a few weeks after the 60th anniversary of his arrival in the village to take over the 10,000-acre Ingleborough family estate, which he had inherited. Although St James' Church is not part of the estate, it was rebuilt around 150 years ago using the Farrer's family money. 'Something strange was certainly going on,' said Dr Farrer. 'But it's quite a nice touch when we think of all the time my father devoted to it. 'He had maintained it for 30 years but it eventually became too much for him and he reluctantly had to hand over the responsibility. 'It's the focus of the village and because the village is small enough to hear the clock chime it's a real time keeper. It was very close to my dad's heart.' The clock was restarted following Dr Farrer's funeral, where he was remembered for his dedication for the village as well as his medical career. Dr Farrer with his  wife, Joan and children John Peter and Annie leaving Australia in 1953 . The late doctor's son, Dr Farrer pictured, said the clock stopping was 'a nice touch' as his father was so dedicated to it . Born in Sydney, Australia in 1921, his . family later moved to Melbourne and he was educated at Geelong Grammar, . one of Australia's oldest public schools. Later he went to medical . school and trained as a doctor. While at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, he met Joan, an operating theatre nurse and they were married in 1947. In the early 50s, a telegram arrived to say that his uncle Roland Farrer had died in England and the doctor was faced with the choice of taking over the Yorkshire estate that had been in the family since the 1700s. He and his family took up residence in November 1953 where he worked until he retired. The doctor became ill in November 2013 and after a period in hospital, returned to his home of 60 years when it became clear that he was not going to recover. There will be a celebration of Dr Farrar's life at St James' Church, Clapham, North Yorks on February 18, at 2pm.","Dr John Farrer maintained Church clock in Clapham, Yorkshire for 30 years .

When 77-year-old Ike Herrick had a heart attack nearly 30 years ago, he made a bold decision - to walk his way to good health. After doctors ordered the then 50-year-old to drastically change his life or lose it, Herrick began  walking every day and measuring the distance. The Texas man resolved to walk 21,477 miles - equivalent to crossing the world - over 27 years. He finally reached his goal on Thursday and believes having a heart attack saved his life. What a workout! Ike Herrick, 77, has achieved his goal of walking 21,477 miles - the equivalent of walking around the world - on a treadmill . Super fit: When Ike Herrick had a heart attack at age 50, he jumped on the treadmill in a bid to get healthy . 'In my case, my heart attack was the best thing that could’ve ever happened to me because it awakened me to the fact that something was wrong, and would eventually kill me,' Herrick told KXAN.com. 'You don’t have to kill yourself . exercising, but you gotta have cardio exercise to get your heart rate up . every day. It’ll allow you to live a lot longer than . you would otherwise.' For years before his heart attack in 1987, doctors warned Herrick to change his diet and exercise routine because he was overweight, had high cholesterol, and a family history of heart disease. His father died when he was just 51, while his brother and sister have both undergone bypass surgery. 'Being 50-years-old, I thought I was bullet proof,' Herrick told KHOU.com. Suffering: Herrick had a heart attack in 1987 when he was just 50-years-old and resolved to turn his life around . Lasting friendship: Dr George Rodgers, a cardiologist (left), treated Herrick (right) at Houston's Methodist Hospital and ordered him to begin exercising . When his heart stopped, Herrick was rushed to Houston’s Methodist Hospital where he met cardiologist George Rodgers, who was just beginning his fellowship. 'He . told me he had the ‘ah-ha’ moment,' Dr Rodgers told KHOU.com. 'He said, ‘I’m too . young to have a heart attack. I don’t want it to all end here'.' On the advice of Dr Rodgers and other doctors, Herrick turned his life around and began walking at least three miles a day. 'What really . struck me was when I when was in cardiac rehab, doctors really lectured . us and emphasized the importance of eating right and getting enough . exercise. One of the patients raised their hand and asked, ‘doctor, what . if we don’t do this?'' Herrick said. 'The doctor said, ‘you will die'.' Herrick . stopped eating fast food, eliminated greasy, fried foods and cut down on his red meat intake. In . the early 1990’s, Dr Rodgers moved to Austin to start his practice with . the Seton Heart Institute about the same time Herrick and his wife moved . to Lakeway. It was after walking 18,000 miles that Herrick decided to 'walk around the world'. He calculated from Austin’s 30 degree latitude and realized he was 3,477 miles away from the equivalent of walking around the globe. 'I said, 'That’s an achievable goal if I can live to the age of 77,'  he said. 'My achievable goal was three miles a day, 15 miles a week or 700 miles a year.' Herrick said it took two treadmills, two cardiologists and about 20 pairs of sneakers to attain his goal, with Dr Rodgers saying his patient's exercise regime has reduced his risk of dying from another heart attack by 25 percent. The sky's the limit: Herrick, 77, turned his life around after he had a heart attack at 50 .

We all know someone who's made disastrous love choices. The girlfriend who married a nice guy, had three great kids, then left to shack up with her nightmare ex, who everyone else hated. The bright, successful career girl who slays them in the boardroom but stays with a no-hoper boyfriend who's addicted to both drugs and other women. Celebrities aren't immune - Myleene Klass claims she'll never marry again after her ex did the dirty after just six months. 'Why did they choose them? Why don't they leave?' we think to ourselves. How women who are often intelligent, attractive and normal could end up in these situations really is beyond us. When people constantly go out with people who are bad for them, it's usually because they've developed a destructive relationship pattern. It's not rotten luck – they're subconsciously choosing people who treat them badly because of something which happened in the past. You've got bad love habits if you answer yes to more than six of these questions about past or current partners: . You love your partner, even though your head says you're incompatible. You put up with being treated badly and keep on loving in the face of abuse, neglect and little positive reward. You believe there's only one magic person out there who can make you truly happy. This is exceedingly dangerous - you'll put up with all sorts if you're convinced your partner is the only person who can make you happy. Not true. There are lots of people who will. You've tried to leave in the past but can't. You're miserable in relationships but unhappier without them. You've tried to leave in the past but can't. You're miserable in relationships but unhappier without them . They left you but you won't accept they're gone. You say things like, 'I know he's living with her but his heart's still with me'. Your relationships are bad but sex is usually fantastic. Destructive relationships stretch emotions to screaming point with one positive: sex feeds off danger, so sex is likely to be charged. Sadly, we spend the majority of time not having sex. Your friends and family rarely like the partners you choose. When you fall in love, other people suffer. You stop seeing people who are important to you because you know they'll see how unhappy you are and force you to leave. Your work and health take a dive because you become increasingly reliant on addictive substances. People constantly tell you that you deserve better. Sometimes, they'll come straight out and say 'Get out. Leave. This person is bad for you.' You return to the same partner over and over even though it never works out. Feeling a little uncomfortable because most points are ringing true? You put up with being treated badly and keep on loving in the face of abuse, neglect and little positive reward . Work out what your pattern is. Think past the surface and pinpoint what's happening below. What messages did your parents teach you about love? What were your early experiences? Get therapy if you need it (relate or bacp.cp.uk). Write down what your relationships were like in the past. Then how you'd like them to be in the future. Don't have sex too soon. You're subconsciously choosing a certain type of person who is bad for you. Don't take the relationship further until you know for sure you haven't made the same mistake again. When you fall in love, other people suffer. You stop seeing people who are important to you because you know they'll see how unhappy you are and force you to leave . Speak up the second you aren't happy. Calmly spell out exactly what you need. 'I'd appreciate a call when you get home from work'. 'I don't like it when you flirt with other women'. No second chances. One warning, then they're out. Listen to your instincts. They are there to protect you. Even if you can't put your finger on it, if it feels ominous or like you're back to old habits, walk away. Avoid drugs and alcohol. They skew your judgement. Introduce new partners to trusted friends early on, ask for honest feedback and act on what they tell you. Finally, always remember, it's not about whether you love them but whether they are worthy of your love.

A Connecticut woman was arrested - and her pet monkey confiscated - after authorities say the animal scratched the woman's 10-year-old daughter last week. Mariantonia Morales has been charged with risk of injury to a minor and owning an exotic pet after her pet marmoset monkey, Aladdin, accidentally scratched her daughter Samantha on the face. Authorities in Waterbury, Connecticut, say the 10-year-old girl was home from school on a snow day last week when she took Aladdin out of his cage to play with him. Aladdin: According to Connecticut authorities, it is illegal to keep a marmoset monkey like Aladdin as a pet . Therapy: Mariantonia Morales got the monkey to help her recover from a recent cancer diagnosis . The monkey, the girl says, was reaching for a hair clip she was wearing and accidentally scratched her on the forehead. When Samantha returned to school, someone asked her how she injured her forehead. When she told the injury was from her mother's monkey, the school alerted police and called the state's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to report that a monkey had injured a young girl. Morales, who says she brought the monkey from her home in South Carolina as she recovered from surgery and complications after being diagnosed with cancer, was forced to turn the monkey over to DEEP officials. 'I felt that I was being bullied,' Morales told NBC. 'I'm worried, and I'm . heartbroken because they don't care that he's a part of the family. They . just think it's just a monkey. But it's not just a monkey. For me, it's . not just a monkey.' Injury: Morales says that the injury her daughter suffered was an accident that occurred when the monkey was reaching for a hair clip . Connecticut has a troubled history with privately owned monkeys, which has led state lawmakers to outlaw owning primates that weigh more than 50 pounds. According to DEEP, owning marmoset monkeys like Aladdin is prohibited in Connecticut. Connecticut's monkey laws are the result of the brutal 2009 attack of Charla Nash by a chimpanzee called Travis. Travis had been on Connecticut authorities' radar since he led officers on a chase through Stamford in 2004. Five years later, Travis - who belonged to Nash's friend Sandra Herold - attacked Nash, mauling the 55-year-old woman's face and arms. By the end of the attack - described by hospital officials as 'horrendous' - Nash had lost her hands, nose, eyes, lips, mid-face bone structure, and received significant brain tissue injuries. Nash has since undergone facial transplant surgery, but the wounds from the attack are still very visible. Following the attack on Nash, Connecticut has put laws in place prohibiting exotic, in many cases dangerous pets. 'Horrific': Charla Nash suffered horrific injuries in Connecticut after she was attacked by a chimpanzee called Travis . Transplant: After she was attacked, Nash received a full facial transplant, one of the first of its kind at the time . 'Working with DEEP, we determined that it's illegal to have that type of . animal in the house,' Waterbury Deputy Police Chief Chris Corbett told the station. Authorities say that regardless of where Morales got the monkey, she is still required to abide by the laws of the state that she is in. 'Based on that, the mother was charged with risk of injury to a minor. One, because she shouldn't have had that animal in the house with the . child and two, because she didn't seek medical treatment for the child,' Corbett continued. However, NBC Connecticut says it has seen documentation from the hospital that lists the girl's injury as an 'abrasion,' not a bite. The station also says it has seen documentation proving that the monkey is currently up-to-date on all of its vaccines. Travis: 200-pound Travis was shot to death by police officers after his brutal attack on Nash that left her on the verge of death . 'I thought in my mind, as a mother, you get a scratch, what do you do? You put some Bacitracin on it and call it a day. She wasn't bit,' Morales says. Morales says she hopes the charges against her will be dropped and she will have her beloved monkey returned to her. 'I just want him home. I have a six-month lease here. In May, if this is . gonna be an outcome, I'm out, I can't be here,' she said. It seems unlikely Morales will be successful in her attempts to get Aladdin back - DEEP says the monkey has been taken to a zoo in Bridgeport. If the animal is healthy, he will be placed at another zoo or educational facility.","The monkey is a tiny marmoset monkey .

But the latest image from Nasa astronaut Rick Mastracchio reveals that it’s not just natural spectacles that can leave a poignant mark. Rick Mastracchio took this image of Ariane 5 rocket breaking free from Earth's atmosphere earlier this week . This image, shared with Mastracchio’s 39,000-strong Twitter army yesterday, shows the Ariane 5 rocket breaking free from the Earth’s atmosphere. It launched from the European Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, yesterday after a delay of over two hours due to poor weather. It was carrying a satellite called ABS-2 designed to provide services for cable television, data networks and telecommunications across four continents. Mastracchio's keen eyes were able to spot a second launch on Wednesday with this image of the Progress 54 cargo vehicle tweeted this morning . Rick Mastracchio is currently a flight engineer with Expedition 38. He is one of the astronauts repairing the malfunctioning main cooling system. The other passenger was Athena-Fidus, a French-Italian telecommunications satellite designed to improve public broadband internet technologies. And Mastracchio’s keen eyes were able to spot a second launch on Wednesday with an image tweeted this morning. ‘A progress launch out of Baikonur as seen from ISS,’ wrote the Mastracchio. ‘Six hours later it docked. I've seen two launches in two days now.’ The Progress 54 resupply spacecraft, loaded with 2.8 tonnes of cargo, automatically docked to the ISS on the same day as its launch. At the time of docking, the station was soaring about 260 miles over the Atlantic Ocean east of Florida. Mastracchio reported to mission control in Houston that he and his crewmates had ‘a pretty good view’ of the ascent of Progress up until its separation from the first stage of its booster. The ISS Progress 54 resupply spacecraft launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to begin a six-hour journey to the International Space Station .","Images shared with Mastracchio’s 39,000-strong Twitter army this week .

The jury in the trial of Michael Dunn, accused of gunning down a black teen for playing music too loud, was shown the victim's bullet-riddled SUV this week. Michael Dunn, 47, is accused of killing Jordan Davis, 17, he has pleaded not guilty but prosecutors showed the jury his SUV with nine bullet holes - his girlfriend previously testified he turned to her and said 'I hate that thug music' before she heard gun shots. Ronda Rouer told the court they had both been drinking before went inside a gas station for wine and potato chips and Dunn shot the SUV up - he claims the shooting was in self-defense. Scroll down for video . Riddled with bullets: Evidence markers on the shot up SUV show where nine bullets entered the vehicle . Too loud: Michael Dunn (left) is facing a first-degree murder charge for fatally shooting 17-year-old Jordan Davis (right) in an argument about speaker volume in November 2012 . Defense: He is also facing three charges for attempted first-degree murder for the other passengers in the car . The pair consumed a few rum and cokes at Dunn's son's wedding earlier in the night before they went to the gas station where the fateful shooting occurred. Dunn has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and three counts of attempted first-degree murder for the other passengers in the car. The man's defense attorney Cory Strolla says he was only trying to defend himself, after seeing Davis grab what looked to be either a shotgun or a lead pipe. But prosecutors say the four men in the vehicle weren't armed, and while they did disrespect him, they never threatened the man. Assistant State Attorney John Guy says the four men were out for a day of 'mall hopping and girl shopping' when they decided to stop at the gas station to get gum and cigarettes. Before coming over to tell the men to turn down their music, Dunn town his girlfriend 'I hate that thug music' as she walked over to the convenience store. Like this: Shawn Atkins, a witness for the prosecution, shows how he saw Dunn shoot that day. Atkins is currently in prison and tried to leverage for a lighter sentence in exchange for testifying . Dunn then went over and 'politely' asked the men to turn their music down - which was so loud it was rattling the windows. Davis responded rudely telling one of his friends 'f*** that n*****' and to turn the music back up. Guy says both Dunn and Davis exchanged the f-word in the ensuing argument, but that Davis never threatened the older man. However, defense attorneys say Dunn never cursed at Davis and that Davis got much more explicit in their fight. According to Dunn, Davis threatened: 'I'm going to f*****g kill you. You're dead, b***h. This is going down now.' Aftermath: Instead of turning himself in, Dunn and his girlfriend drove 40 miles south to a bed and breakfast and ordered pizza. Above, the couple's Volkswagen . They also say Davis reached for a weapon, which Dunn believed to be either a gun or a lead pipe, and seemed to be getting out of the car, prompting Dunn to take out his 9mm pistol and shoot three times at Davis' door. Dunn shot each of Jordan's legs and the third bullet tore through the teen's liver, lungs and aorta. Rouer said she heard a 'pop, pop, pop' while she was inside and that Dunn told her to get in the car when she came out - he then calmly walked over and put a gun in the car's glovebox. Dunn claims to have owned the gun for years but never used it before that occasion. But prosecutors say Davis couldn't have gotten out of the car since the child locks were on. The defense pointed out that friend Leland Brunson, who was in the car at the time, initially told police that Davis was getting out of the car, but changed his story four days later. Despite the driver of the SUV backing up to drive away, prosecutors say Dunn continued to barrage the car with gunfire. Another point of contention is what happened immediately after the shooting and whether or not the four teens had time to hide the weapon Dunn claims to have seen. Prosecutors say the teens had no time to hide a weapon since they never left the parking lot. A police search of their vehicle only turned up a basketball, basketball shoes, some clothing and cups on the floor but 'no weapons'. Murder: Protesters gathered outside the court to express their support for the prosecution . The defense on the other hand says the boys drove off to an adjacent parking lot first before returning to the gas station to call 911. Police didn't search the area around the gas station until several days later, giving the men 'ample time to get rid of a firearm or pipe'. Strolla points out that two witnesses initially reported that the teens seemed to be stashing something, and that two of the passengers in the SUV were unaccounted for a period after the shooting. As for Dunn, when his girlfriend Rhonda Rouer heard the shots, she left her food and change at the counter and ran out to their car. Instead of turning himself in, the couple drove 40 miles south to St Augustine where they had a reservation at a bed and breakfast. The two ordered pizza, took the dog for a walk and Dunn 'poured a big, tall drink - rum and Coke. 'They had cell phones, but they didn't call 911. He didn't drive to a police substation,' Guy said. 'That defendant put his head on his hotel pillow and went to sleep.' Hiding out? Dunn told interrogators the day after the shooting that he didn't turn himself in because he wanted to get things settled at home first . The next day they saw a news report on TV about a 17-year-old who had been fatally shot at a gas station in Jacksonville, and instead of calling police then, they drove 130 miles home to Satellite where police caught up with him . The defense attorney blames most of that strange behavior on Dunn's girlfriend, who ordered the pizza because she hadn't had much to eat all day and was hungry. They decided to go home the next day instead of turn Dunn in because Rouer was 'petrified' and 'didn't know the law of self-defense'. A day after the shooting, Dunn told interrogators he 'was waiting till we get around people we know' to turn himself in. He wanted to make sure his dog and 'everybody were where they needed to be. I did not want to being a s***storm down on them in Jacksonville'. The prosecution may have a problem in their case when it comes to witnesses. The witness who took down Dunn's license plate is currently in prison and tried to leverage a lighter sentence for agreeing to testify. And the teen driver of the SUV was on probation and violating curfew when the incident happened. In the end, the defense painted Dunn as a man who could have been a victim if he hadn't taken out his gun that day. 'God didn't make all men equal. Colt did. Colt is a firearm,' Strolla said. '(Dunn) had every right under the law to not be a victim, to be judged by 12 rather than carried by six.' Prosecutors say the teen was innocent, and did nothing to provoke a gun being fired. 'Jordan Davis was sitting in his car seat with the door closed with nothing in his hands,' Guy told the jury. The trial is expected to conclude as early as February 14.","Michael Dunn, 47, has plead not-guilty to first-degree murder for shooting dead 17-year-old Jordan Davis in November 2012 .

Plunge: Tracy Shelvey, 41, pictured in happier times on a ride at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in 2011, jumped to her death after Patrick Hall was cleared of raping her . A mother threw herself to her death because she was living in fear of a former soldier who had been cleared of raping her, her friend claimed today. Tracy Shelvey, 41, was forced to give evidence against Patrick Hall, 24, in the crown court twice after an initial case collapsed because the jury could not reach a verdict. She jumped to her death off a shopping centre roof in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, yesterday morning just three days after the soldier was found not guilty of carrying out the attack following a retrial. Today Miss Shelvey's friend of ten years Kathy McGowan, 45, said the mother felt she had been let down by the police and other authorities. Greater Manchester's Police and Crime . Commissioner Tony Lloyd has called for a 'root and branch review' of how . victims and witnesses are treated in the criminal justice system in the wake of the tragedy. Miss Shelvey was described by neighbours as an alcoholic who had been living in a run-down mid-terrace property in Heywood, Greater Manchester, without electricity or water. Miss McGowan, 45, said: 'She told me about the rape because she was really frightened. She was very angry and she would say ""I want him to go down"". 'But she felt like no one was helping her and that she was not getting help from anyone other than her friends. 'It seemed the authorities could have done better in helping her  - it was only her friends who were there for her. She was really scared about it all and she thought he would come after her if he got let off. She thought he would kill her. 'It had been really hard for her to testify and I think that's why she drank more because she was so scared. She became against all men - and she was very traumatised by it all. 'I just felt helpless because it seemed there was nothing I could do given what she had gone through. The authorities should have given her a lot more help and guidance.' Miss Shelvey went to police around three years ago to report the alleged sex attack. She told officers she had been walking to her home in Heywood when a car stopped and the driver offered her a lift home before attacking her inside the vehicle. Death: Tracy Shelvey, 41, died after falling from this shopping centre in Rochdale despite police efforts to talk her down . Mr Hall, also from Heywood, went on trial on April 2 last year at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court charged with raping seven women between 2006 and 2011. He was acquitted of three rapes and a judge directed the jury to find him not guilty on a fourth charge. At the original seven-week trial, 36 witnesses gave evidence. He . was then retried in Manchester on the three other rapes, with Miss . Shelvey once again testifying against him in court. But a jury returned . not guilty verdicts last Friday after three days of deliberations. Miss . McGowan added: 'Tracy was a really generous loving and caring woman . from a really nice working class family . But she had become really . angry about the rape and felt that nothing was getting done. 'She . let her house go really messy and didn't care about anything - not . herself or her life anymore. I felt Tracy was very vulnerable especially . towards the end and she was on her own. She was really scared that he . would come after her and beat her. 'She . told me that she knew him and he had called her into the car and was . going to give her a lift so she only got in the car because she knew . him. 'But she said he wouldn't let her out of the car and was raping her.'She . said it had been an ordeal for her and then he drove her home. I think . her family will feel let down because she was so brave to report it and . then she has been let down. 'After . the rape she was taking overdoses and was in and out of hospital. We . didn't know if she wanted to kill herself but it was after the rape that . she started overdosing. Tributes: Flowers left outside the shopping centre in Rochdale where Tracy Shelvey fell to her death yesterday . 'I . think she felt ashamed and she was trying to hide it that she was on . drugs. It was heartbreaking for me because I couldn't do anything. 'I . can probably guarantee that all the six other women were the same as . Tracy. She went to the police thinking that something was going to get . done. 'Everyone was telling . her to report it saying he will get locked up and she would be . protected but in the end she was not protected and she lost her life to . it. 'I think it was a . cry for help because she didn't want to be in that situation. She wanted . to make clean breast of things and get a job. 'Finding . out that he had been acquitted definitely must have tipped her over. Tracy was very angry about what happened to her and every time I saw her . she would mention it. 'She . was such a lovely woman, she loved helping people and was always nice . and happy but inside she was angry and she tried to put on a brave face. 'After . the rape she went downhill. I know she will be missed by a lot of . people. this could have been prevented and it has all been happened . because he was let off. She was very scared indeed.' In . a short statement released through the police today, Miss Shelvey's . parents said they were 'proud' that she had shown the courage to give . evidence in the two trials. They said: 'Tracy was a kind and caring person and comes from a loving family who she kept in regular contact with. Grief: Floral tributes left in Rochdale after Miss Shelvey died yesterday - despite police efforts to stop her from jumping . 'She . had a warm heart and was a loyal friend and will be deeply missed by . all. We are so proud of Tracy for standing up in court on the two . trials. 'She was a strong person with a lot of pride. We also want to thank Tracy’s friends for their support at this time.' Two . specially-trained Greater Manchester Police had visited Miss Shelvey on . Friday to tell her that Patrick Hall bad been cleared of rape. A spokesman said: ‘The woman appeared angry and upset at the news and she was offered support by the officers. ‘A referral was made to partner agencies who have previously provided support to the woman.’ Later that evening, Miss Shelvey, called police in an emotional and distressed state. Officers and ambulance staff visited her. The . police spokesman added: ‘The woman was in a much calmer state when the . officers attended, who again gave her advice and made a further referral . to partner agencies helping the woman.’ However, . at around 10.10am yesterday police were called to the Wheatsheaf car . park in Rochdale, Lancashire, less than two miles from Miss Shelvey’s . home, after she was seen on the roof. Although officers tried to speak to her, she jumped off the top of the multi-storey car park. Greater Manchester Police has referred its involvement with Miss Shelvey to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Greater Manchester's Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Lloyd today called for the case to be reviewed. 'We have to learn from this tragedy and others that have come before,' he said. 'What is abundantly clear is that victims and witnesses are not where they should be - at the heart of the criminal justice system.' Tragedy: Tracy Shelvey, 41, had lived in this property in Heywood, Greater Manchester, for a number of years, neighbours said . Tragedy: Frances Andrade took her own life after giving evidence against the choir director who sexually abused her while she was a music student at the Chetham's School of Music in Manchester . Ms Shelvey's death comes a year after . Frances Andrade took her own life after giving evidence against the . choir director who sexually abused her while she was a music student at . the Chetham's School of Music in Manchester in the 1970s and 1980s. Ms Andrade's family claimed she had not been offered enough support during and after the court process. Mr . Lloyd said: 'The court process is a brutal one, and the fact that we . have had at least two people in Greater Manchester alone who have taken . their lives after going through this ordeal is of grave concern. 'Many, many rape victims say that the court process is as traumatic as their original ordeal. 'This can't go on - a root and branch review of how victims and witnesses are treated is urgently needed. 'A chain of vulnerability exists from the moment someone reports an incident to police - and it can break at any point. We need to ensure that victims and witnesses are surrounded by support from when they report to police, throughout the investigation, the court process and - critically - after trial is over, whether the accused is found guilty or innocent. 'We need to ensure the right services are engaged, be they mental health or psychological counselling. And we all need to work much better together to ensure that victims and witnesses get the support they need, when they need it.' After joining the Army at 16, Mr Hall served with 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in Kuwait, Iraq, Canada and Germany. He was part of the armoured Strike Battle Group based at the British Army base at Basra airport in Iraq, but is now thought to have left the Forces.","Tracy Shelvey, 41, jumped to her death three days after Patrick Hall was cleared of raping her .

Australia's most notorious drug smuggler is set to be freed on parole after spending the last nine years languishing in an Indonesian prison. Schapelle Corby was convicted in 2005 of carrying 4.1kilos of marijuana into the holiday resort of Bali, hidden in her body board bag. She has always vehemently denied her guilt and claimed the drugs were planted on her by a criminal gang operating at an Australian airport, but she was jailed for 20 years. Now, Justice Minister Amir Syamsuddin said he has given his approval for her release. Jailed: Schapelle Corby is sentenced to 20 years in jail by Denpasar District Court in Bali in 2005 for smuggling 4.2 kilogrammes of marijuana into the resort island of Bali . He told a press conference in Jakarta . today: 'Corby has been approved to receive parole because (she) has . fulfilled the substantive and administrative requirements set by . ministry regulation number 21 of year 2013.' The 36-year-old, from the Australian tourist resort strip, the Gold Coast, will have to wait until next week when all the paper work can be completed before she is finally able to leaveBali's Kerobokan Prison, officials said. Bali's Kerobokan prison's govenor Farid Junaedi today liaised with Corby and her family and Australian Consulate officials to sort out the details of her release. 'We are still waiting. I am yet to know about the process in Jakarta. We are now just waiting. I haven't receive the letter as of now,' he told News.com.au. Freedom: Indonesian Justice Minister Amir Syamsuddin announces that he has granted parole to Schapelle Corby who has served nine years in Bali's Kerobokan Prison . This is the culmination of a long-running bid by Corby and her family to have released for a crime they insist she did not commit. In 2010, Corby asked for clemency, citing . her poor mental state. Two years later, Indonesia's president cut her . sentence by five years. Corby, who has been eligible for parole for the past 18-month, is said to be in 'good spirits' and 'hopeful' of being released. Her brother-in-law Wayan Widyartha said the former beauty therapist was healthy and happy and all the family was praying she is released soon. Corby's sister Mercedes smiled as she climbed on board a motorbike behind husband Wayan, Corby's parole guarantor. Release: Mercedes Corby leaves the Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia, today, after learning her sister could be freed as soon as next week . Schapelle Corby has spent nine years in Kerobokan Prison, pictured, Bali, Indonesia, after being caught with 4.2kilograms of marijuana she insists was planted on her . In October 8, 2004, Corby is arrested on arrival at Denpasar airport in Bali after heading there for a surfing trip. Her bodyboard case is packed with 4.1kg of marijuana. She repeatedly argued the drugs found by airport officials in her unlocked bag were not hers and that they were planted. Her lawyers insisted many people could have put the drugs into their client's bodyboard bag along the way from Brisbane to Bali, especially because it was not locked. Corby, from Australia's eastern Gold . Coast, changed planes in Sydney and her defence team said she was the . victim of a drug ring running narcotics from Brisbane to Sydney. For some reason, the drugs were not removed from her bag by the criminals in Sydney, the defence said. On April 28, 2005, Corby pleads with the court to consider her innocence in her final statement. 'I . would like to say to the prosecutors I cannot admit to a crime I did . not commit. And to the judges, my life at the moment is in your hands . but I would prefer if my life was in your hearts.' Handing . down a sentence of 20 years, Judge Linton Sirait said: 'The panel of . judges declares the defendant legally and convincingly guilty of the . crime of illegal importation of narcotics.' Corby's mother, Rosleigh Rose, shouted at the three judges on the panel: 'Liar, liar. Honey, we are going to take you home.' Corby had her sentence cut to 15 years in 2005, with it increased back to 20 years on appealCorby's final appeal was rejected in 2008, with the original ruling declared 'accurate and correct'. In 2010, in a last-ditch effort to reduce her sentence, Corby begs for clemency due to her mental illness. She claims her life is at risk. Two years later, her sentence is slashed by five years. This week, Indonesia's Justice Minister Amir Samsyuddin announces he will sign her parole papers and that she is likely to be freed next week. 'We don't know, we just can pray. We met Schapelle, she is healthy, she is happy. We only pray, pray and pray. Only God knows,' he told News.com.au. Despite being within days of freedom, a prison insider told News.com.au that Corby had yet to pack up her belongings. 'She hasn't packed yet. She doesn't want to get her expectations up and then be disappointed... Too many times in the past her hopes had been dashed.' the source said. Emotional: Australian beauty therapist Schapelle Corby, right, receives a kiss from her mother after she was found guilty of trying to smuggle 4.1kg (9 lb) of marijuana into Bali . Under her parole conditions Corby must remain in Bali until the expiration of her sentence in mid 2016 and then must stay an extra year under supervision. She will live with Mercedes and Wayan and their family in Kuta and will have to report monthly to parole authorities. Her case drew intense interest in Australia, whose media were focused on Indonesia following the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings and an attack on its embassy in Jakarta in 2004. Many people questioned the fairness of the trial and the length of her sentence compared to some of those convicted in relation to the Bali bombings. At least two other Australians are on death row in Indonesian drug smuggling cases, and several are serving long prison terms.","Schapelle Corby was convicted of taking marijuana into Indonesia in 2005 .

People who eat doughnuts for breakfast should pay for prescriptions if they develop diabetes, a Tory MP said yesterday. Phillip Lee, who is also a practising GP, warned the soaring cost of obesity and other lifestyle diseases will bankrupt the NHS unless people take more responsibility for their own health. Calling for charges to be brought in, the MP for Bracknell said: ‘If you want to have doughnuts for breakfast, fine, but there is a cost implication. We need to match actions to consequences – at the moment that does not happen.’ Tory MP Phillip Lee, a practising GP, said people who eat doughnuits for breakfast should be charged for their prescriptions if they later develop diabetes (file image) Tory MP and GP Phillip Lee said most patients these days were suffering from lifestyle-related illnesses that could bankrupt the NHS . Dr Lee also warned that members of the ‘baby boomer’ generation were less ‘stoical’ than their parents – with potentially disastrous consequences for the finances of the NHS. He said there a ‘stark difference’ between the way in which those in their eighties dealt with pain, compared to those in their late sixties and early seventies. Dr Lee said the majority of patients he saw were now suffering from illnesses caused by their lifestyles, or complaining of conditions that their forebears would have suffered in silence. He suggested ministers should study the system used in Denmark where individuals are allocated a ‘modest’ annual drugs budget, after which they are expected to pay for their own prescriptions. And he said charging people for the cost of their prescriptions would encourage them to take more responsibility for their own health. ‘If you want to have doughnuts for breakfast, fine, but there is a cost implication down the line,’ he said. ‘We need to match actions to consequences – at the moment that does not happen in this country.’ Dr Lee said people had to take more responsibility for their own health . Politicians have traditionally fought shy of telling people to take responsibility for their own health, because of fears of a public backlash. But, speaking at an event organised by the Institute for Economic Affairs think tank, Dr Lee warned that without major changes the NHS could face financial collapse.

He went on: ‘We have got to be bold here, we have got to be decided that the National Health Service in its current form is not sustainable. ‘It probably can limp on for the rest of this decade but the reality is the pressures coming from the baby boomer generation and their expectations of health care, their perceptions of pain and suffering is profoundly different to their stoic parents who survived the war."" ‘It's time we actually got quite realistic about this because if we don't we are going to lose what most people would want in this country which is access to care when you need it irrespective of your means. ‘In which case, if we don't start reforming now and actually accepting that the way Nye Bevan designed it in post-war stoic Britain has got to change then we are going to end up with collapse and the free for all and the pretty disgraceful situation you find in the US.’ Dr Lee said £400 million could be saved from the drugs budget by allowing GP surgeries to dispense medicines.

A 13-year-old girl was sold for sex at £20 a time by the teenage boss of a child sex ring, a court has heard. It was alleged that the girl, who has learning difficulties, was one of five underage girls abused by the gang, headed by 18-year-old Zdeno Mirga. She was also sexually abused by groups of boys at parties and at a . playground in a park near her home in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, . jurors at the Old Bailey heard. Trial: Zdino Mirga, Hassan Abdulla, Dusan Mirga and David Ziga, pictured left to right, as well as four teenagers, are accused of being part of a child sex ring which abused five underage girls . The court heard that the girl revealed the abuse to her social worker after being taken into care in December last year, and a police investigation led to the identification of another four victims, including the girl’s 14-year-old sister. Two 14-year-old boys are among the eight defendants, aged between 14 and 32, who are standing trial  on an indictment containing 57 counts, including rape, sexual assault, . causing or inciting child prostitution, assault by penetration, sexual . activity with a child and causing or inciting a child to engage in . sexual activity. All of the accused are of  Czech, Slovak and Kurdish origin. The two sisters are from a Czech and Slovak family while the other three victims are English. Opening the case, prosecutor Angela Rafferty, said: ‘Between April 2012 and December 2012 in Peterborough all these defendants engaged in sexual abuse of teenage girls. ‘Some of them were more heavily involved than others. Some organised and controlled the sexual activity. Some took a spur of the moment decision to become involved.’ Accused: The trial at the Old Bailey in London was told that Zdeno Mirga was paid £20 by a man aged around 50 so the girl would perform a sex act on him . Miss Rafferty warned jurors: ‘You will be hearing some very graphic descriptions of sexual matters.’ The court was told that all of the victims were aged between 12 and 14 when the alleged abuse took place, and that Mirga, known as Skinny, was said to be at the centre of the case. Miss Rafferty said: ‘It is the prosecution’s case that Zdeno Mirga is a forceful young man and can at times appear very charismatic and controlling.’ The main 13 year-old victim, who has learning difficulties, claims he forced her to have sex with other boys and men. ‘He wanted to receive money from the other males for her sexual services,’ said Miss Rafferty. The court heard, a man aged around 50 paid Mirga £20 so the girl would perform a sex act on him. ‘She refused but was effectively forced to do it,' Miss Rafferty added. It was alos alleged that Mirga told the girl that he wanted money for ‘weed and vodka'. He is standing trial alongside his brother Dusan Mirga, 20, of Peterborough, David Ziga, 19, of  Sheffield, Hassan Abdulla, 32, from, Peterborough, as well as two 14 year-old boys and two 17 year-old boys who cannot be identified because of their ages.

Speaking out: Vargas, pictured on The View, only told her husband (pictured behind) about her problem . Elizabeth added: 'This is silly! Barbara is a colleague and a friend.' The interview came a couple of weeks after Vargas went public about her battle with alcoholism. She had taken a leave of absence in October to seek treatment and returned to 20/20 in January. 'I . am an alcoholic,' Vargas told George Stephanopoulos as she returned. 'It took me a long time to admit that to myself. It took me a long time . to admit it to my family, but I am.' She told The View that, after her father went to Vietnam when she was six-years-old, she began suffering from daily panic attacks that have continued into her adult life.

Tyrannosaurus Rex might be one of the best known dinosaurs, but scientists are still not exactly sure how the prehistoric giant walked. And in a bid to find out, a group of researchers attached fake tails to chickens and analysed the way they walked. While the idea might look more like a school project than a serious experiment, the scientists chose chickens because modern birds descend from a group of dinosaurs that includes the T-Rex. Scroll down for video . Scientists made chickens prosthetic dinosaur tails to study how their gaits changed . The new study suggests that the fearsome dinosaur's walk was hip driven. T-Rex lived during the Late Cretaceous period - 66million years ago. While most people think the carnivorous dinosaur stood upright, it had a bird-like posture and kept its tail in the air and its head pitched forward. Its massive skull was balanced by its heavy tail, which was around 15 per cent of its body mass. The creature would have changed direction slowly because if its massive inertia but was agile enough to run. T-Rex had a top speed of 25mph (40kmp) which is a little slower than a horse. Scientists from the University of Chile, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Chicago created prosthetic tails to simulate how a seven tonne T-Rex, which measured over 40ft long, would have walked. The fearsome dinosaur roamed the earth in the Late Cretaceous, around 66million years ago. The dinosaur belonged to the theropod group of dinosaurs, which also included the foot-long Anchiornis huxleyi, all of which are very distantly related to birds today. They conducted the bizarre experiment to study the way the dinosaur’s descendent moves with the addition of a long and relatively heavy tail, which is actually a wooden stick with modelling clay that four chickens have worn from birth. Scientists from the University of Chile, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Chicago created the prosthetic tail to simulate how a seven tonne T.Rex (illustrated), which measured over 40ft long, would have walked . The scientists were careful to keep the tails at 15 per cent of the birds'  body weight, so they had to continuously replace them while they were growing, IBTimes reported. They chose the weight because they think the proportion is similar to the weight of a theropod dinosaur’s tail, compared to its body. The researchers discovered that the chickens raised with the tails walked in a different way to those without them. The birds with the prosthetic tails stood with their femurs – their upper leg bones – held more vertically and moved their knees differently when walking to the control birds, the study in the journal PLOS ONE revealed. The birds with the prosthetic tails stood with their femurs - the upper leg bones - held more vertically and moved their knees differently when walking to the control birds, the study said. The control birds' leg position is shown in grey and the chickens' wearing the tails in orange . The study found that while the control birds moved from the knee, the chickens wearing the tails displayed a more hip-driven movement . ‘These results indicate a shift from . the standard bird, knee-driven bipedal locomotion to a more hip-driven . locomotion, typical of crocodilians…mammals, and hypothetically, bipedal . non-avian dinosaurs,’ the scientists wrote. The . scientists also raised a small brood of chickens wearing weighted coats . to ensure that it wasn't just the extra weight that caused the birds’ change of posture and way of walking. But they found that the birds wearing the weighted coats close to the centre of their mass, walked similarly to the control chickens, indicating it was the tail that made the difference. The scientists said: ‘Our experimental approach, although not perfect, was effective in displacing the [chickens’ centre of mass] and recreating locomotor patterns expected in non-avian theropods. ‘We expect that careful...manipulation of extant birds can open new avenues of experimental investigation into unexplored facets of dinosaur locomotor mechanics and energetics, providing a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between form and function in dinosaur evolution,’ they added.","Scientists from the University of Chile, .

Poster appealing for information about nineteenth-century serial killer Jack The Ripper. He has now been identified as an Essex doctor . British serial killer Jack the Ripper has been identified as an Essex doctor called Stephen Herbert Appleford - by a Uruguayan mathematician who has never set foot in London. Eduardo Cuitiño says two years of painstaking research has uncovered what Scotland Yard has failed to do since 1888 - in naming the man who murdered at least five prostitutes that year in the capital's East End. The Professor of Statistics at the University ORT of Montevideo said Appleford was a surgeon working in the London Hospital of Whitechapel - the area where the victims died. He claims he was around 36-years-old, what he deemed 'the appropriate age of a psychopath', and had an IQ well above average, another trait common in that type of criminal. Appleford was from the Essex town of Coggeshall, where Cuitiño said residents were famed as being 'stupid', which may have turned him into a social outcast. Despite later marrying, he was at the time of the murders 'single, without children and living crammed into a house with his sisters'. He also had 'great physical strength' because at university he competed in rowing and swimming. According to Cuitiño, Appleford started to commit his crimes after the death of his mother, to whom he was very close, in 1881. A year later there was an attempted murder on a woman which the Uruguayan attributes to the Ripper, and therefore Appleford. She was found stabbed in the back, the surgeon was close by and, after being identified as a doctor, was called to help her. He later produced a report in which he claimed that he had injured herself. Appleford was also left-handed, according to Cuitiño, 'just like the killer, who cut throats from right to left'. This, he said, was concluded from analysis of the doctor's handwriting obtained from a digital census record signed in the early 20th century. The Professor of Statistics at the . University ORT of Montevideo said Appleford was a surgeon working in the . London Hospital of Whitechapel (pictured) the area where the victims died . A scene from the film 'From Hell' (2001) which tells the story of Jack the Ripper starring Johnny Depp . Cuitiño said he used Google Maps 'to develop a geometric theory' around the crimes, especially the two committed the night of September 30, 1888. The mathematician also pointed to an article the doctor published in the British Medical Journal British Medical Journal about a small case to carry medical knives which could be concealed about the body. ROBERT MANN: Historian . Mei Trow points the finger at mortuary attendant Robert Mann. He was . well educated in anatomy, lived locally and came from a poor background. The first two victims, Polly Nichols and Annie Chapman, are known to . have been delivered to his mortuary. PRINCE ALBERT VICTOR: He . killed the women after being driven insane by syphilis, according to an . article in The Criminologist in 1970 by Dr Thomas E A Stowell. MONTAGUE JOHN DRUITT: Druitt . was a barrister who came under suspicion because he committed suicide . just after the final murder. However, he lived in Kent – and most Ripper . experts believe the suspect was local to Whitechapel. DR THOMAS NEILL CREAM: Cream, . a doctor specialising in abortions, was hanged in 1892 for several . murders he committed in London and his last words were reportedly ‘I am . Jack…’. This, Cuitiño thinks, was a way of poking fun at the police, reports Spanish newspaper El Pais. Appleford died on August 31, the same date as the first crime, in 1940 when he was 88-years-old the year corresponding to 1888 - the year of the murders. Cuitiño added: 'He probably committed suicide, laughing at England and the English until his last sign of life.' Cuitiño . has admitted there may be a degree of speculation as to his claims, . published in an essay called Travelling through time to trap Jack the .

From Wyndham Lewis to L.S Lowry, the list of artists who have made it their business to offer a unique perspective on war is a long and distinguished one. But there's one painter who has never had the recognition she deserves and, apart from her name, practically nothing is known about her. Gladys E. Reed, a member of the WRNS during World War Two, spent her brief career documenting the work of her colleagues in a series of beautifully drawn sketches. Haunting: Gladys E Reed's work, Night Watch shows Wren on duty reading a book, circa 1943-44 . After the war, the images were given to the Royal Maritime Museum, and will go on display for the first time in 60 years in an exhibition that launches next week. But despite her obvious talent, Ms Reed remains a mystery - one that the museum hopes to solve with the help of visitors. 'She wrote to the National Maritime . Museum from Southsea in 1947, when she offered her drawings, but she . gave no indication of what she was doing at the time, and after that we . heard no more,' explains Dr Melanie Vandenbrouck, the museum's curator of art. So what do we know about the UK's most enigmatic war artist. First that like most WRNS, she was childless and unmarried when she signed up. Records show that she trained on HMS Cabbala with the 'Woolwich class' of January to July 1943 and that she served at shore base HMS Eaglet as a telegraph operator. Women at war: WRNS working as telegraph operators at HMS Eaglet in Liverpool circa 1944 . It is also known that it was while she serving in Liverpool that the 14 works held by the Royal Maritime Museum, their subjects ranging from telephonists to security details, were completed. 'The remarkable quality of her drawings suggests that she had an artistic training,' adds Dr Vandenbrouk. 'They are a rare eyewitness account of . life in the WRNS during the Second World War. There were depictions of . women’s wartime work, but these were usually commissioned by the . government. 'Gladys Reed’s drawings are unusual because she was a Wren . and shared the experiences of the women she depicted. 'As such, her . sketches have a different feel to them, quite unlike the works done by . official war artists, which would have been more staged, and used for . propaganda. Jobs for the girls: WRNS 'dhobeying' (doing laundry) and stripping and cleaning parts from depth charges . Delicate job: A Wren torpedo woman repairing the sound power phones on board of one of HM trawlers, c. 1944 . 'Reed did the drawings for herself and her fellow workers, in the . hope, she said, that ""they may reflect a little of that busy, happy . atmosphere that did exist in the Wrens"". They are more personal, and as . such they feel very real and touching too.' After the war, in May 1947, Reed, by then living on Eastern Villas Road in Southsea, began a correspondence with the . Royal Naval College and the National Maritime Museum, with a . view to presenting her wartime drawings. In . her letters to the National Maritime Museum’s director, Frank Carr, she . wrote that 'while serving in the WRNS during the war . as a WT operator, [she] attempted to keep, in [her] off-watch time, a . sketch record of some of the various interesting kinds of work being . done by Wrens'. War effort: A Wren torpedo woman servicing torpedo tubes, by Gladys E Reed, circa 1944 . For his part, Carr adored the 'delightful . drawings' which 'we feel that these form a most useful: and, if I may . say so, a most graceful record of the WRNS work in the war, so much more . telling than photographs. He added: 'We are trying to build a really good . record for future generations: and I am sure that your sketches would . interest and give pleasure to many in the years ahead.' 14 sketches duly arrived but more letters from Gladys did not. She simply disappeared, leaving only her drawings behind. 'We're in touch with the WRNS Association to see if . someone knows or remembers her,' adds Dr Vandenbrouk. 'I would love to hear from anyone who . might have clues as to what happened to her.' The work of Gladys E. Reed will appear in War Artists at Sea, from 15th February at The Queen's House, Greenwich .","Gladys E Reed served at shore base HMS Eaglet between 1943 and 1945 .

'Nexit': Dutch right-wing politician Geert Wilders is campaigning for the Netherlands to leave the EU and the monetary union . The Netherlands would be better off if it left the EU and the single currency, a new study claims. The figures have been put forward by Geert Wilders, the leader of the Dutch far-right Freedom Party as part of his campaign 'Nexit' ahead of the European parliamentary elections in May. The study claims each Dutch household would benefit by nearly £8,000 a year and national income will grow by over £1 trillion if Wilders's ‘Nexit’ – a play on the Netherlands and the word ‘exit’ - becomes reality. The Dutch government rejects Wilders' views, saying a pullout from the European Union would cause irreparable damage to trade relations in a country heavily reliant on trade, and a euro departure would lead to a new financial crisis. ‘I cannot explain to any voters in the Netherlands that we have to raise taxes, cut health care for the elderly, for example, but that we send billions of euros to the Southern European countries (for bailouts), or all the fees we pay to Brussels,’ Wilders said at a press conference outside Dutch parliament. At the press conference, Wilders presented a study that concluded there would be significant positive economic effects from leaving the EU. He commissioned the study from the London-based think-tank Capital Economics, founded by the Euroskeptic economist Roger Bootle. The study concluded that Dutch national income could increase by as much as £1.3 trillion (€1,500 billion) by 2035, bringing new wealth equivalent to between £8,134 per household each year. On a per-capita basis, the Dutch are among the highest net contributors to the EU. Second, leaving the euro would enable the Dutch central bank to tailor monetary policy to better suit the country, Capital Economics analyst Mark Pragnell said. ‘We think the Swiss option is viable for the Netherlands,’ Pragnell said, referring to Switzerland's good bilateral relations and trade with the European Union, even as it conducts its own monetary policy. It is not clear that the Netherlands would be able to negotiate the same deals Switzerland has. Many would find it difficult to imagine the European Union without the Netherlands, one of its founding members and traditionally a strong supporter of the union. The study by London-based think-tank Capital Economics, claims each Dutch household would benefit by nearly £8,000 a year and national income will grow by over £1 trillion . But Wilders called the report's result ‘the best news for the Netherlands in years.’ ‘It offers the Netherlands a way out of this crisis,’ he said. The report was met with scepticism, with the country’s finance minister and chairman of eurozone meetings, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, saying he would read the report but that leaving the EU and the euro would be ‘very unwise. ‘Netherlands is an economic powerhouse in Europe. We earn the bulk of our wealth in trade with EU countries so Netherlands has lots of interest in an internal market with easy trade,’ he said told the Telegraph. ‘There is also the single currency. This is very strong at present and the state of the eurozone looks a lot better than a few years ago. There is no reason to take us into new adventures. I would be very against.’ Dutch GDP has scarcely grown since the start of the 2008 financial crisis, due in part to a sharp fall in housing prices, though most economists forecast a modest return to growth in 2014. Unemployment is around 7 per cent and rising, and many Dutch are unhappy with the government's austerity policies, after years of painful spending cuts and tax hikes.","Study shows the Netherlands 'would be better off outside EU and euro'

Inmates at an Alabama women's . prison have been raped, sodomized and sexually abused by guards and in some . instances allegedly forced to perform sex acts to obtain basic sanitary . supplies, a U.S. Department of Justice report released on Wednesday revealed. The report was the . result of a year-long investigation into conditions at the Julia . Tutwiler Prison for Women, which is located in central Alabama and holds . more than 900 inmates. It is also home to the only death row for women . in the state. 'The women at Tutwiler universally fear for their . safety,' federal officials wrote in a 36-page letter to Alabama Governor . Robert Bentley. Scroll down for video . Julia Tutwiler prison for women in Wetumpka Alabama has widespread sexual abuse of female inmates, a new report has found, including guards having sex with prisoners, watching them shower and organizing strip shows . A horrifying catalog of abuse at Tutwiler prison  is outlined in the DOJ report, including: . 'They live . in a sexualized environment with repeated and open sexual behavior . including: abusive sexual contact between staff and prisoners, . sexualized activity, including a strip show condoned by staff,' the . report said. Around a third of employees at Tutwiler have had sex with female inmate, it was reported. The report found that allegations of sexual abuse are 'grossly under-reported' because of inmates' fear of retaliation. Dozens of inmates were interviewed as part of the investigation and 233 letters were received from women currently serving time at the prison. Roughly a quarter of the prison population reported abuse including sexual harassment, dehumanizing behavior, excessive use of force and inadequate medical care. Multiple women over several years made similar abuse allegations - which were backed up by some current and former staff. The Alabama Department of Corrections is failing to protect the . prison's inmates in violation of their constitutional rights, the . Justice Department said. 'We . conclude that the State of Alabama violates the Eighth Amendment of the . United States Constitution by failing to protect women prisoners at . Tutwiler from harm due to sexual abuse and harassment from correctional . staff,' the letter said. The DOJ added: 'The Alabama Department . of Corrections and Tutwiler have demonstrated a clear and deliberate . indifference to the harm and substantial risk of harm to women . prisoners. 'Officials . have been on notice for over eighteen years of the risks... and, for . over eighteen years have chosen to ignore them.' In 2007, a federal study found that Tutwiler was the women's prison with the highest rate of sexual assaults in the nation. Female inmates at Tutwiler prison (stock image). The prison has been investigated for systematic sexual abuse of inmates over several decades . Kim . Thomas, Alabama's corrections commissioner, said the state has been . working to improve conditions at the prison and outlined a 58-point . action plan he said he implemented last year. 'We are actively . combating and correcting issues of concern at Tutwiler,' he said. 'We . absolutely will not tolerate any inappropriate behavior.' Kim Thomas, Alabama's corrections commissioner, said the state has been working to improve conditions at the prison . The DOJ noted that the prison's new warden was not there 'when much of the alleged misconduct took place'. Under Alabama law, it is a Class C felony for 'any employee to engage in sexual conduct with a person who is in the custody of the Department of Corrections'. The report was delivered last week to Governor Bentley. In comments to local . media, he has said he was not surprised by the results of the . investigation and said the state had been aware of the problems at the . prison. Justice Department . officials said their report was based on interviews with dozens of . prisoners during a visit to the facility in April. Investigators also received more than 200 letters from prisoners, . roughly a quarter of Tutwiler's prison population at the time, detailing . a range of inmates' concerns about sexual abuse and harassment, . according to the report. 'These problems have been festering for . years and are well known to Alabama prison officials,' acting Assistant . Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels said in a statement. The Justice Department said it plans to expand its investigation to . examine allegations of excessive use of force, constitutionally . inadequate conditions of confinement and prisoner health care. Bryan Stevenson, executive director of Equal Justice Initiative, a . nonprofit legal firm in Montgomery, Alabama, said he hoped the report . would prod state officials to move more quickly to reform the prison. 'Too little has been done to correct the problems,' he said. Tutwiler prison opened in 1942 and was named after Julia Tutwiler, an advocate for improvement of prison conditions, whose nickname was 'Angel of the Stockades'.

But one driver was left 'seething' after being given a parking ticket for stopping at a bus stop while in a jam at a set of red lights. Victor Hankins, 50, was issued with a £70 fine by a mobile camera car in Bradford, West Yorks, in December last year. Victor Hawkins, 50, was left 'seething' after being photographed apparently stopping at a bus stop in December last year and issued with a £70 penalty notice by the local council . But Mr Hawkins was actually stuck in traffic at the time, which is allowed according to the Highway Code . Mr Hankins said: 'It was about 8pm and there was quite a bit of traffic on the road - it’s a main road and the traffic light was on red. 'I was about eight cars back from the traffic lights, and at the back of the bus stop - so there will be about three cars in front of me who received tickets too. 'The photograph showed my car in the bus stop - but it’s completely out of context, the photo doesn’t show that my car was in a long lane of traffic. 'I’d never park in a bus stop - on this road it would be stupid to do so, as it’s such a busy road and the traffic behind you would just be in chaos.' After being given the notice Mr Hankins consulted the Highway Code, which states that drivers must not stop 'at or near a bus stop... except where forced to do so by stationary traffic' before contacting the council. He added: 'They were as unhelpful as . unhelpful can be. They told me to put my appeal in writing. I did that . straight away, but after about eight or nine days I still hadn’t heard . back, so I rung up again. 'It was then they told me they could send me the footage, so when I eventually saw it, I realised what had happened. 'I’m annoyed that it has taken so long. It’s just a money-making scam by the council. 'I . was absolutely seething about what happened. It’s an absolute joke. The . fact that the officer in the mobile car had given me a fine in the . first place is ridiculous. Mr Hawkins complained to the council, who asked for his appeal in writing, before admitting there had been 'a mistake' and withdrew the fine . Mr Hawkins branded the fine 'an absolute joke' and 'a money-making scam by the council' 'But there’s also the fact that two operators had viewed the footage and didn’t think it was worth mentioning that I wasn’t breaking the law.' After reviewing the decision, the council has now dropped the charge and apologised, admitting that the notice was 'a mistake'. In a statement, Bradford Council said: 'All images are checked before a Penalty Charge Notice is issued. In this case a mistake was made. 'When we find out that we have issued a penalty notice in error we cancel it and refund as appropriate. 'We continue to monitor and review performance regularly to ensure any errors are minimised.' The news comes on the same day that it was revealed a London council made £1.6million from issuing 40,000 parking fines in ten streets last year. Redbridge Council handed out 8,964 tickets in Cranbrook Road and raised £393,000 in fines, according to figures for last year released by the local authority. Their second most profitable street - Clements Road - earned the council £251,000 from 4,600 parking fines - despite the street being just 540 yards long.","Victor Hawkins, 50, was stuck in traffic in Bradford in December last year .

"By . Liz Hull . PUBLISHED: . 20:03 EST, 7 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 20:04 EST, 7 February 2014 . Ordeal: The woman thought she was going to be killed . A convicted criminal raped a female jogger at knife-point in a nine-hour ordeal just two days after he had been freed early from prison on licence. Peter Watton, 37, was freed despite having 26 convictions for more than 130 offences, including attempted kidnap of a young woman. Just 48 hours later he abducted the 44-year-old woman and subjected her to a sickening attack in which she thought she would die. After lying in wait in woodland close to the Duke of Westminster’s estate in Chester, he pounced on the attractive brunette in broad daylight, before threatening her with a knife, tying her up, and repeatedly raping her. She managed to escape at midnight after running in the pitch black to  a nearby house when he had his  trousers round his knees. Yesterday as heavily-tattooed Watton was jailed for 20 years, his victim told the Daily Mail that she felt ‘let down’ by the justice system that had freed him prematurely and given him the opportunity to attack. ‘No sentence he is given will ever change what’s happened to me,’ the receptionist, who is engaged to be married, said. ‘I feel very, very lucky to be alive. It was a terrifying, degrading experience. I battle with the memory of what  happened every day and nothing will ever be the same again. ‘A decision was made to release him and that needs to be questioned, he shouldn’t have been free. There should be measures put in place to stop  dangerous criminals being released automatically halfway through their sentence.’ She added: ‘My challenge is to cope with what’s happened and not let it ruin my life. If I let this dominate the next 40 years then I won’t have lived, it will be me that’s been imprisoned. ‘He is a dangerous man and all that matters is that he is no longer free to go on and do this to someone else.’ Dangerous: Peter Watton, pictured, was freed despite having 26 convictions included attempting to kidnap a woman . Chester Crown Court heard that  her ordeal began shortly after 3pm on June 14 last year when Watton attacked her while she was running with her spaniel dog along Duke’s Drive, a public footpath, which runs close to the River Dee. The 6ft 3ins convict shoved her into woodland and told her: ‘I’ve been watching you for two weeks. I know where you live. If you say anything to anyone I’ll hurt you and hurt your family.’ She said: ‘One minute I was running along the footpath, the next I was being taken off into the woods. He had his arm around my neck in a headlock and was much stronger than me. I was in shock, I felt like it wasn’t real, but it was.’ He tied her up then ordered her to strip naked and began a series of humiliating sexual attacks, which led to him being charged with eight counts of rape, two of assault, one of false imprisonment and possession of a knife. ‘I was terrified and just froze,’ the woman said. ‘I was pleading with him over and over, saying, “Don’t hurt me, don’t hurt me”. I just didn’t want to believe it was happening to me. I was petrified.’ The woman, who still suffers nightmares, said her ‘survival instincts’ took over. She kept telling Watton, who kept his face obscured with a scarf, that she couldn’t identify him in the hope that he would let her go, and left a trail of her clothes for police to find should she not make it out alive. She said: ‘I thought to myself “Is this how my life ends?”.’ She eventually escaped and told police her attacker had a tattoo ‘Pete’ on his knuckles. He was caught five days later. He claimed the sex was consensual after a ‘brief passionate encounter’ but the jury dismissed his ‘ludicrous’ account and found him guilty after a four-day trial last month. Judge Elgan Edwards handed Watton, who refused to enter the dock to hear his fate, an extended sentence, which means he must serve two thirds of his 20-year term before being eligible for release. He will spend his first four years of freedom on a strict licence. ‘This is the worst case of rape I’ve ever had the misfortune to come across,’ the judge said. ‘I’ve not a shadow of a doubt that Peter Watton is a very dangerous man.’ The court heard Watton had been freed on licence from HMP Risley, in Warrington, two days before the attack after serving three years of a six-year sentence for kidnap and robbery. Under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, anyone serving a sentence of 12 months or more is automatically released on licence mid-way through. His previous convictions –including one from 2000, when he was jailed for six years for attempted kidnap of a young woman – was not deemed  serious or relevant enough to keep him inside.","Peter Watton, 37, attacked the woman at knife-point in nine-hour ordeal .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:34 EST, 25 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:02 EST, 26 December 2013 . In a good year, when the sun shines on the summer fete and the congregation digs deep, one parish church can hope to collect up to £40,000. But as the Reverend and his flock rejoiced in the birth of Christ yesterday, they were also celebrating coming into almost three times that in one fell swoop. A bin bag containing £100,000 was found on the doorstep of a former vicarage owned by the St Thomas with St Maurice Church in York in August. Blessed gift: The Parish Church of St Thomas with St Maurice, in York, has been awarded £100,000 which was found outside one of its properties earlier this year . Four months later, a court has decided the sum should be given to the church, which plans to spend it on charitable causes. The . current occupier of the old vicarage building  found the bag on bin . collection day and did the honest thing by immediately handing it into . police. Officers launched an investigation into how the money came to be . dumped there and whether the bank notes were linked to criminal . activity. However, after . being unable to find any evidence of criminality, officers ruled that . the cash couldn’t be claimed as proceeds of crime. A . hearing was held at York Magistrates’ Court  to decide what should . happen to it and its ruling has been announced just in time for . Christmas. Eleanor Course, . the church diocese spokesman, said there was no dispute over who should . be awarded the funds and the person who found the cash didn’t contest . the church receiving it. She added: ‘It was just a matter of waiting for . the magistrates to decide.’ The award was officially made to the church . council of St Thomas with St Maurice under section one of the 1897 . Police Property Act. The . Act gives the public a route by which they can seek the return of . property and allows for the disposal of unclaimed property. Under the . law, if the owner of the property can’t be established, the magistrates . must decide what to do with it. Christmas bonus: The money is two-and-a-half times the £40,000 that St Thomas with St Maurice Church usually raises in income each year . Miss Course confirmed that the church was chosen by the court because it owns the property where the bag was left. Yesterday, . the church’s vicar, the Rev Philip Moore, declined to comment on the . good news and referred inquiries to the York diocese, which has promised . to make sure the funds are used to benefit the local community. Miss Course said detailed plans  have yet to be drawn up. She . said: ‘No decisions have been taken as to how the money will be spent. We don’t know if it will go on a single project or not but it will be . used for the church’s work in the community. Clearly it’s great news for . the church.’ Finders, keepers: After York police could find no criminal activity linked to the money, a court awarded it to the local church . And the local residents’ association has already begun discussing which local charities could benefit from the windfall. Martin . Crosby, chairman of The Groves association, said two worthy causes . include York Arc Light Project, which provides accommodation and support . for the homeless; and Door 84, a youth club which caters for eight to . 17-year-olds and also doubles as a broader community centre. The church hosts children’s play groups and has a vibrant student membership as it is close to York St John University. A . spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: ‘An investigation was . carried out to see if the money was linked to crime. No definite link to . crime has been established and there is insufficient evidence for the . money to be forfeited under the Proceeds of Crime Act.’ Earlier . this year a woman who forgot she left a bag containing £5,000 cash in a . church had it returned after six years. A parishioner found the bag on a . peg at the church in Brixham, Devon, and handed it into police. It was . then returned to owner Karen Griggs, 47.","A bin-bag with £100,000 in cash was left outside a church property .

A white Muslim convert threatened to kill Prince Harry just a day after the shocking murder of a soldier in Woolwich. Ashraf Islam, 30, formerly known as Mark Townley, confessed to police that he wanted to kill the third in line to the throne, who has served in high profile tours of Afghanistan. Islam walked into a police station in Hounslow on May 23 and told detectives that he wanted to murder the prince hours after soldier Lee Rigby, 25, was killed. Confession: Ashraf Islam, formerly known as Mark Townley, left, admitted threatening to kill Prince Harry, right, a day after the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich last month . He was charged under Section 16 of the Offences against the Person Act, which carries a possible jail term of up to 10 years, following an investigation by the Metropolitan Police's Counter terrorism Command unit. According to the Daily Star detectives found a laptop belonging to Islam which showed internet searches for 'guns', 'vans' and 'kidnapping'. He is also said to have visited terrorist websites. Islam, who is believed to have become a Muslim during a recent spell in prison, is currently behind bars after pleading guilty to the offence at Uxbridge Magistrates Court last Saturday. Murdered: Drummer Lee Rigby was killed in Woolwich on May 22 . He will be sentenced at a later date. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said last night that no date has been fixed for Islam's sentencing. A review of Prince Harry's security was launched in the wake of Drummer Rigby's murder, according to the Sunday Mirror. It is feared that Harry, 28, might be a prime target for the Taliban after touring Afghanistan twice with the Household Cavalry in 2008 and the Army Air Corps last year. The Taliban said while the Prince was at Camp bastion last year that they were doing everything in their power 'to get rid of him'. His comments in an interview that revealed that he had killed Taliban insurgents while on active duty are likely to have made him even more of a target. He is also a high profile supporter of military causes including the Help for Heroes charity - he opened a Help for Heroes funded facility for injured service personnel with Prince William days before Drummer Rigby's murder. Drummer Rigby was reportedly wearing one of the charity's T shirts when he was killed. A royal source told the Sunday Mirror: 'Prince Harry's security is constantly reviewed and has been massively stepped up in the last 10 days. 'This case and the horrific case of Lee Rigby show that there is constant danger. 'Harry's security team cannot be complacent.' The prince is said to have been given extra SAS protection. Supporter: Prince Harry is pictured opening the Help for Heroes Recovery Centre at Tedworth House, Wiltshire with his brother Prince William two days before Lee Rigby's murder . Target: Harry is thought to be a high profile Taliban target because of his service in Afghanistan and an interview he gave where he said he had killed Taliban insurgents in active duty . According to the Star, Northern Ireland Islam was given a suspended jail term and banned from England and Wales for two years under his former name Mark Townley for conning ex-soldiers. He is said to have become 'ingratiated' with a Muslim group in 2010 and faced fraud and theft charges after he returned to Northern ireland after a spell in the Middle East. He is said to have changed his name around the same time as he served a prison sentence in 2011. Islam reportedly worked in the adult film industry and told a newspaper that he was a 'part time' Muslim. He is believed to be in custody at Wormwood Scrubs prison in London.","Ashraf Islam, 30, handed himself into Hounslow police station on May 23 .

Liam Fox is being tipped as the next Secretary General of Nato more than two years after he quit the Cabinet. Senior Tories say the former Defence Secretary's name is 'on the table' in Downing Street as a leading candidate for the role. The current Nato boss, Denmark's Anders Fogh Rasmussen, is due to stand down after the Nato summit in Wales this September. Liam Fox (left) is being tipped as the next Secretary General of Nato more than two years after he quit the Cabinet. The current Nato boss, Denmark's Anders Fogh Rasmussen (right) is due to stand down after the Nato summit in Wales this September . Supporters say the role, which comes with a tax-free salary of around £180,000, would be perfect for Dr Fox since he already knows the main players throughout Europe from his time running the Ministry of Defence. He is widely expected to make a return to frontline politics this spring. In a sign of his close links to Tory high command, Cabinet ministers George Osborne, Iain Duncan Smith and Eric Pickles all attended Dr Fox's new year party at the Carlton Club on Wednesday evening. David Cameron has not yet decided who Britain will back for the role when discussions on the post are held in July. But senior Tories close to Downing Street say that Dr Fox, a firm supporter of the Atlantic Alliance, would be a strong contender. 'Liam knows the key people already,' said one source. 'He's probably Nato's biggest supporter in the Commons and he has another big job in him.' Others suggest that handing the role to Dr Fox would allow Mr Cameron to reward his loyalty since his resignation and remove him from frontline British politics where his calls for more robust action in the EU are seen as potentially awkward for the Prime Minister. David Cameron (with Fogh Rasmussen in 2010) has not yet decided who Britain will back for the role when discussions on the post are held in July . Dr Fox would be expected to take a peerage and resign his seat - North Somerset - where the Tories have a comfortable majority of nearly 8,000 over the Lib Dems. There is a relatively recent precedent for a former British Defence Secretary taking on the post. Labour's George Robertson quit Tony Blair's Cabinet after helping to preside over the war in Kosovo. Dr Fox does not come without baggage after he quit the Cabinet in October 2011 following revelations that his friend Adam Werritty accompanied him on official visits. Allies of Dr Fox say he would be interested in the role, though some of his friends want him to return to the Cabinet after the European elections in May instead to bolster Mr Cameron's top team. They want him to replace Ken Clarke as Minister Without Portfolio, acting as a 'Cabinet enforcer' across Government. A court case he is bringing against American businessman Harvey Boulter, who Dr Fox accused of 'gravely injuring' his reputation during the events leading up to his resignation, is expected to conclude shortly. Mr Fogh Rasmussen is being touted as a replacement for Herman Van Rompuy, the President of the European Council in Brussels. A No 10 source said: 'No decisions have been taken.'","Current Nato boss Anders Fogh Rasmussen stands down in September .

Internet pioneer Sir Tim Berners-Lee has said his . invention of the world wide web should be safeguarded - and has accused . Western nations of hypocrisy over web spying. The computer scientist's words of . warning came as he and five other colleagues were recognised by the Queen for . their pioneering working in helping to create the internet and the web. The British inventor said his creation of the internet should be protected from being . controlled by governments or large corporations. 'Insidious': British inventor Tim Berners-Lee has criticised Western governments for web spying . Asked to comment on the claims made by . fugitive American whistle-blower Edward Snowden that his invention is . being used by governments to access communications between individuals, . Sir Tim said: . 'The original design of the web of 24 years ago was for a . universal space, we didn't have a particular computer in mind or . browser, or language. 'When you make something universal...it can be used for good things or . nasty things...we just have to make sure it's not undercut by any large . companies or governments trying to use it and get total control.' It has been claimed Snowden exposed alleged mass . surveillance activities of the US and British governments. They are accused of using classified intelligence programmes, PRISM and Tempora, to spy on citizens. Controversy: Sir Tim's comments come in the wake of revelations that British intelligence agency GCHQ has allegedly been spying on web and phone usage . Snowden – a former CIA employee - has fled to Hong Kong after claiming that the US National Security Agency has had access . to data held by nine of the world’s top internet companies, including . Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Skype. He is now believed to have escaped to Moscow after being charged with treason by the US authorities. Sir Tim went on to criticise . security services in the US and Britain for employing data surveillance . tactics and questioned whether they are capable of keeping such . sensitive information safe. 'In the Middle East, people have been . given access to the internet but they have been snooped on and then . they have been jailed,' he told The Times newspaper. 'Obviously, it can be easy for people . in the West to say ""Oh those nasty governments should not be allowed . access to spy"". But it's clear that developed nations are seriously . spying on the internet.' He added that such practices . would put people off using the internet in the future. He said many use . the internet in 'intimate' ways and that they would not continue to do . so if 'people feel that there's somebody looking over their shoulder.' Row: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, left, has claimed that British and US intelligence agencies circumvent the law to spy on citizens but William Hague, right, said the allegations are 'baseless' William Hague has defended the collaboration . between Britain’s GCHQ agency and the National Security Agency in . America as a ‘cornerstone’ of national security that had protected . London. He said intelligence obtained from the secret US eavesdropping operation helped prevent terror attacks at the 2012 Olympics. The . Foreign Secretary dismissed as ‘baseless’ claims that British spy . chiefs have used the American espionage programme Prism to circumvent UK . law and snoop on emails and phone calls. Sir Tim . has previously voiced oppistion to the Government's proposed Draft . Communications Bill, dubbed by opponents as a 'snooper's charter'. He . described the legislation as 'draconian' and said it would diminish . Britain's reputation as one of the countries which makes best use of the . internet.

Five bodies have now been pulled from the charred remains of an eastern Quebec seniors' home after a horrific blaze tore through the building Thursday morning, and firefighters are still searching for another 30 people feared dead. A fire broke out around 12:30 a.m. and raged through the retirement village, trapping residents, many of whom were dependent on wheelchairs and walkers. Canada's prime minister said there is little doubt the death toll will be high in the tragic blaze. Officials said firefighters saw and heard people in the building that they were unable to save. 'People tried to do whatever they could, but the fire was so intense that there wasn't much that could be done,' said Pascal Fillion, who lives nearby and ran outside to find a group of locals and firefighters already at the scene, trying everything to save the panicked people inside. 'I saw people crying, I saw people collapse because they were watching those people burn.' Scroll down for video . Frozen: Firefighters continued to douse the rubble where fire destroyed a a seniors residence leaving five people dead and 30 unaccounted for in L'Isle-Verte, Quebec, Thursday . Trapped: The fire trapped terrified residents, most of them dependent on wheelchairs and walkers . Many of those unaccounted for were confined to wheelchairs and walkers and only five residents in the center were fully autonomous, said Ginette Caron, acting mayor of the small town of L'Isle-Verte, about 140 miles northeast of Quebec City. She said some had Alzheimer's disease. The massive fire in the three-story building broke out around 12:30 a.m. and raged through the night. Firefighters arrived within eight minutes of getting the alarm and several fire departments in the region were called in to help. But they were unable to carry out a complete evacuation because of the intensity of the fire. About 20 residents were transported to safety. 'It was a total fire,' L'Iles-Verte fire chief Yvan Charron said. Fillion said, for the most part, rescuers felt helpless against a fast-moving blaze with smoke so thick it was nearly impossible to approach the building. Blaze from the sky: An aerial handout photo shows the aftermath of the fire at the seniors home in L'Isle-Verte, Quebec . Hard job: A police investigator looks over the frozen rubble for survivors or, more likely, bodies . Investigation: Investigator and firefighters survey the damage after the fatal fire . The fire broke out in -4F temperatures, causing equipment to freeze, Charron said. As morning dawned and the fire was brought under control, the burned section of the facility resembled a macabre ice palace, with sheets of ice and thick icicles covering the structure. The search for the missing was still hampered Thursday night by the cold and thick ice and the fact that the building has collapsed, said Quebec Provincial police Lt. Guy Lapointe. Lapointe said late Thursday that the search for those missing will regroup at daylight. 'We can keep some hope for those unaccounted for, but there's very little doubt that the loss of life is considerable,' Prime Minister Stephen Harper said. Retired police officer Pierre Filion, who had a cousin and an aunt living in the residence and who lives nearby, said the tragedy had shaken the tightly knit community of 1,500 people. 'It's going to take a long time to start living normally,' said Filion whose missing relatives are both in their 70s. Outside the building, Jacques Berube, . 70, was getting ready to hear the worst about his 99-year-old mother, . who is blind but still mobile. Icy conditions: The search for the missing was still hampered Thursday night by the cold and thick ice and the fact that the building has collapsed, said Quebec Provincial police Lt. Guy Lapointe . Smoke: Smoke rises from the smouldering remains of a fire at the seniors residence in L'Isle-Verte, Thursday . 'I went near the building; the corner where her room was is burned,' he said. 'I'll just have to wait and see. I don't like it. But I don't have any choice. It's just reality.' Parts of the Residence du Havre, which opened in 1997, had sprinklers, while others didn't. Charron chief said sprinklers did go off, triggering the fire alarm and allowing firefighters to gain access to about one-third of the building. Mario Michaud, who lives across the street from the building, said he witnessed the unfolding drama shortly after midnight. 'The fire had started on the second floor. I woke up my girlfriend and called 911. I saw the firefighters and they got to work. A woman on the second floor was shouting and she went out on to the balcony. 'Her son went to get a ladder but he couldn't get to her. She burned to death,' Michaud told local newspaper Info Dimanche. At least three people survived the blaze with injuries, though the extent of these was unclear. The building was home to more than 50 people and also housed a social agency, a pharmacy and a hair salon. Tragic: Five are dead and more than 30 missing as a result of the raging fire . 'A night in hell': A local fire chief called the combination of raging flames and bitter cold hellish . A Quebec Health Department document updated last July said the building, with one elevator, was constructed entirely of wood. Most . residents were older than 75 and 37 of them were older than 85. The . building included both single rooms and apartment-style dwellings. The . document also indicates the building was only partially fitted with a . sprinkler system but did have a fire alarm. There were smoke detectors . in every room and in the building itself. The . fire comes just six months after 47 people were killed in Lac-Megantic, . Quebec, when a train with 72 oil tankers derailed and exploded in the . small community. A further . 20 people were rescued from the inferno that saw flames shooting several . stories into the air as firefighters battled extreme temperatures . dropping below zero. Earlier, Fire Chief Yvan Charron described the evening as 'a night of hell' to Dimanche. Authorities spoke Thursday of the grim reality now facing the tiny town of just over 1,500 people. 'These are elderly, some of which are . very limited mobility,' Mr Charron added. 'Others were afraid and they . hid under blankets.' 'Her boy, he broke down,' Mario Michaud added to the Globe and Mail. 'It wasn't pretty.' Engulfed: The nursing homes west wing was completely engulfed in flames and burned to the ground . Killer inferno: The fire is confirmed to have taken five lives . Haunting: A neighbor told media he watched a man try in vain to save his mother's life, he instead watched her burn to death . Volunteer fire fighters from at least . 20 separate barracks responded to the blaze, according to Dimanche. They had to battle both the towering flames and temperatures plunging . well below zero. Their efforts were not able to keep the complex from completely burning to the ground. 'Some . are still looking for their parents but we're certain that our mother . has died,' another local told the Globe and Mail. 'She was on the . balcony and there was too much smoke … the building has collapsed so . she's still in the rubble.' Authorities have said it will take several hours to sift through the charred building for victims. Another woman was found wracked with guilt outside the blaze – she had recently placed her parents in the facility. 'I . didn't send my parents to see them burn there,' Marielle Marquis, the . president of a local seniors club, recalled to the Globe and Mail. The 20 residents rescued from the . raging fire lived in the complex’s newer east wing, the Globe and Mail . reported. It had a firewall that blocked the flames from reaching them. The . building's older wing touts an automatic sprinkler system on its . website, but official filings show it has only partial sprinklers, . according to the Globe and Mail. The facility was first opened in 1997, according to the Montreal Gazette. No escape: Many of the more than 30 residents missing or unaccounted for were infirm and unable to move without a wheelchair or walker, a local official said . Terrifying: Another local said he watched as a woman's balcony caved in - the collapse dragged her from safety and back into the out of control fire . The cause of the blaze has not yet been determined. Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a statement on the tragedy. 'On behalf of the entire country, I offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends of those who passed away following the fire at a seniors' residence in eastern Quebec,' he said. 'My thoughts and prayers are also with those who remain unaccounted for and all those who have been injured.' Quebec Premier Pauline Marois offered her condolences from Davos, Switzerland. 'I want to extend my condolences to all the families affected by this terrible fire,' she said. 'I have been in touch with my office and we are doing everything we can to support the community and families. 'It's a private center but we're talking about human beings, so we'll do whatever we can. I am deeply saddened by this event.' The fire comes just six months after 47 people were killed in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, when a train with 72 oil tankers derailed and exploded in the small community.

'Tragic accident': Plumber Sam Hill, 22, was killed after falling two metres from his hotel balcony while suffering from tinnitus . A young man was killed after falling just two metres from a hotel balcony, having lost his balance because he was suffering from tinnitus, an inquest heard. Plumber Sam Hill, 22, had been on a night out with a friend in Magaluf on September 11 last year when he fell from the emergency escape balcony at the Hostal Villa de Sol. At an inquest in Bradford, West Yorks, Coroner Sam Cariss gave a verdict of accidental death caused by head injuries - and attributed the fall to a combination of Mr Hill’s tinnitus and the alcohol he’d consumed with his friend. The coroner said: 'What we can assume happened is that Sam, due to his tinnitus, had overbalanced on the balcony and fell.' Referring to his relatively short plunge, he added: 'His skull was thinner than most people’s.' He added to Mr Hill’s family, who sat in court: 'He would have had to overbalance over the balcony. This is just a tragic accident.' The court heard that Mr Hill’s sense of balance was skewed due to his condition, which he had seen a GP over just days before his holiday. Sam was prescribed antibiotics, which the coroner acknowledged may have reacted badly with the alcohol he and his friend drank during their holiday. The inquest heard that Mr Hill, of Riddlesden, West Yorks., had been on a night out with his friend Roland Sands when they lost each other. He walked back to his hotel alone - but . ten minutes later was found dead by Alexander Campbell, a British . national on holiday who was listening to music in the next room and . heard someone fall, the court heard. Location: Mr Hill fell from the emergency escape balcony of the Hostal Villa de Sol in Magaluf, Spain . Gareth Elms, a British policeman also on holiday, had seen Mr Hill with his head on the grass. The inquest heard that Mr Elms moved Mr Hill to the first floor hallway and carried out CPR, before calling for an ambulance - but there was no sign of a pulse. When paramedics arrived, they pronounced Sam dead - as his friend arrived back at the hotel.The young plumber had been due to fly home later that day. Mr Cariss added that this had been 'a loss of life too early.' Holiday: Mr Hill died after a night out  with a friend in the Spanish resort of Magaluf in September last year . 'I can only try to imagine how difficult this has been for you,' he said to Sam’s parents Vanessa and Steve, brother Tom and girlfriend Jodie Corbett. 'I wish you well as you treasure memories of happier times.' Mr Hill's father Steve said after the inquest: 'He was just a lovely man with a great life ahead of him, sadly cut short. 'He will be greatly missed.'","Plumber Sam Hill, 22, died after night out in Magaluf in September last year .

New York City's angrier version of famous clairvoyant groundhog Punxsatawny Phil made his opinion of Bill de Blasio quite clear when he leaped from the mayor's arms and tried to flee a Staten Island event on Sunday. Staten Island Chuck, as he's called, wriggled out of the mayor's grip after predicting six more miserable weeks of winter this morning just like his country cousin. But unlike Phil, Chuck has a rather nasty reputation. Scroll down for video... Six more weeks of WHOA!

Making amends: 'Now Chuck, what about this winter thing, Chuck? We can work something out, can¿t we?' de Blasio joked . Chuck didn't bite the new mayor, but he wasn't doling out his forecast without exacting at least a little payment. As de Blasio slowly began to hold up the furball for a photo-op, he never quite got a grip.

Punxsutawney Phil has spoken - and it is not good news. Pennsylvania's famed groundhog emerged from his lair in front of thousands of fans around daybreak Sunday forecasting six more weeks of what already has felt like a brutally long and cold winter. Legend has it that if the furry rodent sees his shadow on February 2 winter will last another month-and-a-half. If he doesn't see it, spring will come early.

Early morning: Punxsutawney Phil is held by Ron Ploucha after emerging from his burrow on Gobblers Knob in Punxsutawney, Pa., to see his shadow and forecast six more weeks of winter weather on Sunday . In reality, Phil's prediction is decided ahead of time by a group called the Inner Circle, whose members don top hats and tuxedos for the annual Groundhog Day ceremony on Gobbler's Knob, the tiny hill in the town for which he's named about 65 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. The prediction this year fell on the same day as Super Bowl Sunday. The closest the game previously came to coinciding with Groundhog Day was in 2009, when the just-down-the-road Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Arizona Cardinals 27-23 in the Super Bowl, the night before Phil's forecast. The annual event, made world famous by the 1993 Bill Murray comedy 'Groundhog Day' draws thousands of tourists from as far afield as Australia and Russia. A version of Punxsutawney Phil has been making weather predictions since 1887 - but since the release of the popular movie crowds of up to 30,000 have made their way to Pennsylvania to witness the ceremony.

Legend has it that if the furry rodent sees his shadow on February 2, winter will last another month-and-a-half. If he doesn't see it, spring will come early . The game this year featuring the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., will be the Super Bowl's 48th installment, while Phil has been predicting the weather since 1886. This year's Groundhog Day celebration marks a winter that has brought extreme cold to stretches of the country wholly unaccustomed to it, as well as a snow and ice storm that paralyzed Atlanta and other Southern cities. According to the legend, if it is cloudy when Phil emerges the groundhog will leave his burrow, which means that winter will soon end. If Phil appears frightened and sees his own shadow - he will retreat back into his burrow - meaning that winter will continue for six more weeks. However, most weather analysis of Phil's predictions have proved that he is on average, inaccurate. 'The groundhog has shown no talent for predicting the arrival of spring, especially in recent years,' according to the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina. 'Phil's competitor groundhogs across the nation fared no better.' Professional predictions: This map reveals when Accuweather believes that the winter will end across the nation . The center found that from 1988 to 2012, the groundhog was right 10 times and wrong 15 times about winter continuing for more than six weeks after February 2. Indeed, last year, Phil did not see his shadow, which meant an early spring. What in face occurred was a slightly warmer than average February but a chillier March. Since 1887, Phil has seen his shadow 100 times and has not seen it 17 times - predicting an early spring. Not everyone finds the tradition to be fair on Phil though. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals characterizes the handling of Punxsutawney Phil as inhumane, as the animal is on constant display and not able to hibernate for the winter. Much loved film: The 1993 comedy starring Bill Murray has become recognized as being one of the actor's finest roles .

The group has asked that Phil be retired. 'We think that using a cyber shadow-detector is a great alternative to yanking a frightened groundhog out of a fake burrow every February and waving him around in front of a boisterous crowd as cameras flash in his eyes,' PETA noted. 'Groundhogs avoid human contact and spend their days digging and burrowing. In February, they should be midway through their winter hibernation, not dodging the paparazzi.' In their defense, the Inner Circle says Phil is a very special groundhog and he gets his longevity from drinking a secret punch. He drinks it every year, at a summer picnic, and it is said that one sip gives him seven more years of life. Inner Circle member John Prushnok (R) takes a picture of a group of visitors with a statue of Punxsutawney Phil the groundhog on the eve of groundhog day during the Groundhog Day celebration in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania .

Phil is the most famous of a small group of groundhogs said to forecast the weather, including Staten Island Chuck in New York and General Beauregard Lee in Atlanta. The National Climatic Data Center has put Phil's forecasts to the test and found them sorely lacking, declaring the groundhog has 'no predictive skill.' 'It really isn't a `bright' idea to take a measure such as a groundhog's shadow and use it as a predictive meteorological tool for the entire United States,' the data center says on its website, helpfully if somewhat obviously.","The Staten Island version of Punxsutawny Phil also famously bit Michael Bloomberg's finger in 2009 .

The first athletes to compete in the Winter Olympics took to the slopes today as the Russian government issued further assurances it is doing everything possible to ensure the Sochi Games are as safe as possible. The first competitions started more than 24 hours before the official Opening Ceremony on Friday to accommodate the 12 new men's and women's medal events added since the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. The men's snowboard slopestyle qualifying runs were the first to get underway this morning at the X-Treme Park in the mountains above Sochi - with athletes performing incredible stunts and jumps. They were followed by the women's qualifying runs and the women's moguls freestyle skiing this afternoon. The two events will be among the first medals to be awarded on Saturday.

But despite an action-packed day of sport, much focus still surrounded the terror threats leading up to the Games. The Russian government says it's doing everything possible to make sure the Sochi Games are as safe as possible. Dmitry Kozak, Russia's deputy prime minister, said: 'We can guarantee the safety of the people as well as any other government hosting a mass event (can).'

Ban's remarks came at a time when activists and protesters have stepped up their campaign against Russia's law restricting gay rights activities. Human Rights Watch posted a video this week on YouTube of gay people in Russia being bullied, chased and beaten, compiled from footage the group said was uploaded by perpetrators. 'Hatred of any kind must have no place in the 21st century,' Ban said. The U.N. chief noted that Principle 6 of the Olympic Charter enshrines the IOC's opposition to any form of discrimination.

For children of the 1970s and early 1980s, no Saturday afternoon was complete without watching Big Daddy and Giant Haystacks wrestle each other to the ground in front of a hysterical live audience. Adult wrestling was considered prime family entertainment, and girls and boys sat transfixed as the 26-stone, leotard-clad Big Daddy (real name: Shirley Crabtree) led the crowd with chants of 'Easy, easy' before demolishing his opponent with his trademark 'Splash', which involved felling them with his stomach in (often carefully choreographed) violent bouts. The frightening-looking Giant Haystacks was his arch rival, and at 48 stone, quite some opponent, and most children, as well as the Queen and Margaret Thatcher, who both declared themselves fans, knew whose side they were on.  The masked wrestler Kendo Nagasaki (aka Peter Thornley) was another household name who rose to such prominence that his 1977 unmasking ceremony was televised (though Big Daddy had managed the same feat two years earlier). The wrestling bouts were filmed in front of live audiences at venues around the country, and, as this collection of old posters which have just come to light show, lucky residents of towns around Britain chosen to host the bouts could buy a ticket for as little as £1 to see their heroes fight each other live. Clash of the super-heavyweights: Big Daddy pitting his 26-stone, leotard-clad body against 48-stone rival Giant Haystacks was top family entertainment in the 70s and 80s . Big Daddy became a household name known for his glitzy costumes (his wife, Eunice, made his first leotard out of their chintz sofa cover) and vast, rippling stomach . No holds barred: Big Daddy, pictured above left, usually played the good guy while Haystacks, pictured left and against Steve Earl, right, would often be jeered . Big draw: The wrestlers performed in front of live audiences and locals could buy ringside seats and join Big Daddy in chanting 'Easy, easy' as he took his rivals down . Essential weekend viewing: As this copy of the TV Times from June 1971 shows, wrestling was a regular one-hour slot on ITV's Saturday afternoon schedule . People would flock to venues around the country to watch live wrestling featuring stars such as Mick McManus, left, who was known as a villain who bent the rules . Wrestling posters such as these were a common sight in the 1970s and 1980s, and the sport's stars became huge stars - the Queen and Margaret were both fans . Political correctness was a long way off in the 1970s when a night out watching some of the most famous sportsmen of the day could cost as little as 75p . The wrestling stars built up characters for themselves with trademark costumes, catchphrases and moves - Big Daddy's was his notorious Big Splash jump . For more of the British wrestling superstars, bigger was better - those with particularly large stomachs were feared in the ring, but others concentrated on muscles . Women wrestlers, such as Klondyke Kate, left, were popular too, and the biggest stars filled the biggest arenas, with Big Daddy taking on Giant Haystacks at Wembley .","Old wrestling posters show huge popularity of the sport that kept Britain's families glued to their sofas at weekends .

A former Labour minister jailed for six months for fraudulently claiming £13,000 in parliamentary expenses today tweeted he is out after six weeks, thanking prosecutors for the 'fascinating' time behind bars. Disgraced former Labour minister Denis MacShane took a swipe at prosecutors for pursuing 'celebrity' cases,comparing himself with Coronation Street star Bill Roache as he was released from jail. Prison is 'the place' to go to to lose weight and get fit and is 'fascinating', the ex-MP added as he walked free just six weeks into his six month sentence for fraudulent expenses claims totalling nearly £13,000. MacShane lashed out at former director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer for being 'very keen' on celebrity prosecutions and linked himself to Roache, who was yesterday cleared of alleged sex offences. Former Labour minister Denis MacShane was jailed for fraudulently claiming nearly £13,000 in expenses. He tweeted today that he is out of jail after six weeks, after being sentenced to six months behind bars . Denis MacShane arrives at his West London home today after being released from prison . He told the Daily Mirror: 'It's been quite a week for the celebrity prosecution people Keir Starmer was very keen on - the DPP. 'But I'm not talking about what happened or the other MPs who made so much money and haven't been held to account. MacShane called the experience 'fascinating' and said he met some 'very good people' behind bars . 'That's for another time, another day, but I'm obviously glad to be out. 'I really met some very good people inside prison. 'I wouldn't say I'd recommend it to anybody, but certainly if you want to lose weight and get fit it's the place.' He added: 'Bill Roache yesterday, me today. It's Keir Starmer's little angels.' MacShane, 65, pleaded guilty to false accounting by filing 19 fake receipts for ""research and translation"" services and was jailed two days before Christmas. As he was released from HMP Brixton the former Europe minister told the Daily Mirror: 'It's been a fascinating six weeks. I was last in prison in Communist Poland. 'I've met very interesting people. I've met a lot of people who know the difference between right and wrong, between truth and mendacity and are really prepared to admit to mistakes they've made in the past. 'It's very different from the House of Commons in that regard. 'I've been well treated by the prisoners, I've learnt a lot. It's been a humbling, rewarding and enriching experience. 'I've lost weight, I'm fitter than I've been for the last 10 years and I'm glad now to get back and see my children, family and friends.' He added: 'I spent my time as I spent all my life, thinking, writing, talking to people, making notes. 'I've been keeping fit and for the first time certainly eating more healthily and not drinking anything.' The 65-year-old thanked prosecutors for the 'fascinating humbling' experience. The one-time BBC journalist added he would be giving no interviews about his time inside . MacShane also said he had given talks on politics while serving his sentence - and had made copious notes about the experience. He said: 'I've been keeping notes, just like a good journalist. I've interviewed tons of people and what's fascinating about prisons is that in 20 years I never thought about prisons in my life. 'No MP, no civil servant, no journalist has the faintest idea what it's like.' The one-time BBC journalist had admitted faking 19 invoices for ‘research and translation services’ amounting to £12,900 between 2005 and 2008. He submitted them through a company that he set up under a false identity and used nine different spellings of his name so officials would think the paperwork had been filled in by others. A minister for Europe under Tony Blair, MacShane used the money to fund trips to the Continent, including one to judge a literary competition in Paris. Jailing him, Mr Justice Sweeney said his ‘considerable and repeated’ dishonesty had ‘reduced confidence in our priceless democratic system’. ‘There was deliberate, oft repeated and prolonged dishonesty over a period of years – involving a flagrant breach of trust and consequent damage to Parliament,’ he said. ‘You were an MP – and a minister at the time of four of the claims – and knew that you were required to act with probity and transparency in the making of expenses claims. You deliberately created misleading and deceptive invoices and then used them in order to procure payments of public money.’ MacShane admitted faking invoices amounting to £12,900, using the money to pay for jaunts to Europe . Mr Justice Sweeney said the deception was calculated to avoid suspicion falling on his claims before adding: ‘You have no one to blame but yourself.’ Parliamentary authorities began looking at MacShane’s claims in 2009 when the expenses scandal engulfed Westminster. John Lyon, the Commons’ Standards Commissioner, raised concerns over claims for ‘translation services’ from the European Policy Institute – a think-tank that he founded. MacShane first admitted to officials that he had submitted invoices signed with what he called ‘a nom de plume’ and described the EPI as a ‘convenient vehicle’ to fund research trips to the continent. But a subsequent investigation by the Commons’ Standards and Privileges Committee described his actions as the ‘gravest case which has come to us for adjudication, rather than being dealt with under the criminal law’. It recommended that MacShane should be suspended as an MP for 12 months but he resigned as the member for Rotherham in November 2012 before the punishment could be imposed. Police, who had dropped an investigation in 2009, reopened their inquiry and MacShane was charged in May. He was the sixth MP to be prosecuted over expenses and admitted false accounting at the Old Bailey last month. Notably absent from court was his girlfriend, Vicky Pryce, 61, the ex-wife of Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne. She was released in May after serving two months for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after she took the blame for speeding points that should have been picked up by Huhne, the former energy secretary, who was also jailed. The invoices were signed by MacShane under the name of E.J. Matthews, the general manager of the company based at an address in Fulham, south-west London. The ex-wife of disgraced former Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne vowed to stand by her boyfriend Denis MacShane when he was jailed at the end of last year . The ex-wife of disgraced former Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne said she would stand by her boyfriend, Denis MacShane, after judges jailed him for fiddling his expenses. Vicky Pryce, who has been dating MacShane for around 18 months, said she hoped their romance would survive his prison sentence. Their relationship started shortly before Ms Pryce was herself jailed last March for perverting the course of justice after taking speeding points from her ex-husband to stop him losing his licence. Mr MacShane supported Ms Pryce, 61, during her two-month prison ordeal. The exposure of MacShane’s crime followed two reports in The Mail on Sunday in 2009, which revealed how he submitted false expense claims for ‘translation services’. MacShane has had a chequered love life. He lived with the late ITN newscaster Carol Barnes from 1975 to 1981, although the couple never married. In 1983, he married Polish-born Liliana Klaptoc, but they later divorced. In 1987, MacShane married Nathalie Pham, but the couple divorced in 2003. His relationship with feminist writer Joan Smith ended in 2010.","Former Labour minister Denis MacShane was jailed for six months for fraud .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . PUBLISHED: . 08:51 EST, 8 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:10 EST, 8 June 2013 . Pete Nelson is an architect with lofty ambitions. For the past 15 years he has made childhood dreams a reality with his unique treehouses. The 50-year-old from Seattle, sometimes known as the 'tree whisperer' is now branching out with his own reality TV show, Treehouse Masters, on Animal Planet. 'Treehouses are directly connected with nature,' Mr Nelson said. 'We are in the arms of these trees.' Hideout: Pete Nelson's treehouses feeature in an eight-part Animal Planet series . Since starting his Washington state business, Nelson Treehouse, the designer has constructed hundreds of hideaways in 26 states and nine countries. From a 800 square foot 'retreat' in Waco, Texas, complete with full bathroom and giant flatscreen TV, to the 'Spirit House Retreat in Rhinebeck, New York, built with guidance from a shaman, Mr Nelson is a master of making dreams come true. His work is being featured in an eight-part series on Animal Planet, which started last week. The show follows the architect and his team as they travel the U.S., climbing trees and working on plans for clients. 'The way people respond is remarkable. Treehouses bring together families, friends and even entire communities,' Mr Nelson told USA Today. This is certainly the case for Mr Nelson's family. His fascination with treehouses began when he was five-years-old and his father helped him build one. Teamwork: The series follows the  Treehouse team as they travel the U.S. to construct their amazing designs . Back to nature: Pete Nelson and his team build retreats for clients to escape the modern world . Now a father himself, Mr Nelson is helped in his business by his 21-year-old carpenter son Charlie, and 23-year-old daughter Emily. Although treehouses are considered a den for children, Mr Nelson admits many of his customers are adults who are looking for a retreat from the world. 'I get calls all the time for kids’ treehouses. But I think the adults who are placing the calls are hiding . the fact that the treehouse is for them,' he told The New York Times. 'Some people look at these . treehouse books and say, ""I want one of those"". Or they’re architecture . buffs. They don’t have the skills to create it, but they want it.' Whereas Mr Nelson's first treehouse that he built with his father was a simple affair, his designs today are spectacular. His portfolio includes luxury homes perched on branches, a tiny red 'brew house with peacock window and brewery inside, and a round treehouse made out of cork tiles, that has a grass roof and fireplace in the center. 'The difference in the treehouse is that it’s a place . where you are absolutely away from it all. Every one of these structures . is a place to unplug and unwind,' he said. Family project: Charlie Nelson, left, gets to build treehouses every day with his father, Pete . The most expensive treehouse Mr Nelson built was in Yelm, Washington, for more than $365,000. The biggest was built on seven oaks in San Diego, but it was destroyed in wildfires. 'The owner said that after the wildfire, you couldn’t fit the ashes in a bottle. It was that gone,' Mr Neson told the New York Times. An integral part of Mr Nelson's business is selecting the perfect tree or trees for his buildings. He says the Douglas fir and red cedar trees are the best, being both strong and beautiful. 'I think my greatest strength in this fun little biz is interpreting what they're giving us,' he said. However, the cottonwood is considered too dangerous to build in, Mr Nelson said, adding: 'On the most calm and beautiful days, there will be a gunshot sound, and a massive limb of a cottonwood tree will fall down.' Mr Nelson, who has produced coffee table books of his designs, added: 'The energy a tree emits is undeniable. It's the sort of energy that makes the hairs stand up on your neck a little bit.' While Mr Nelson may be in an expert in picking the right tree to build around, his company must also negotiate planning regulations. Patrick Fulton who wrote The Treehouse Guide, told USA Today: 'Some areas don't consider treehouses to be a building at all, whereas others specifically mention them with maximum-height and floor-size limits.' Mr Nelson's love for treehouses has also led him to open a unique bed and breakfast in a Washington forest. With his wife Judy, he runs Treehouse Point, a collection of amazing lodges high in the trees, where people can stay, or hold weddings and concerts. Hanging out: Pete Nelson and his son Charlie work on a treehouse at Treehouse Point, the family's holiday park . While Mr Nelson's design cost anywhere between $80,000 and $200,000 to create, his passion for treehouses is such that he encourages like-minded people to create their own. Websites such as Craigslist can be a great source of materials for a treehouse and, with a little help from the whole family, it shouldn't take long to create a retreat. 'Treehouses are priceless, especially the simple one that dad builds in the backyard,' Mr Nelson said.","Animal Planet series follows treehouse architect Pete Nelson .

Just 18 months after its maiden voyage, the Pal-V One flying car can finally be yours - if you have a spare $295,999 (£180,000) that is. Technically it's not a car - it's a three-wheeled motorcyle that transforms into a gyrocopter - but it is legal to drive, and fly, and switches between modes in just 10 minutes. The Dutch-built Pal-V One can reach speeds of up to 112mph and goes from 0 to 60 in under 8 seconds when driven on the road. Scroll down for video . The Pal-V One - a three-wheeled motorcyle that transforms into a gyrocopter at the flick of a switch - is now on sale for $295,000 (£180,000). It takes 10 minutes to switch between modes and can go from 0 to 60 in the air in under 8 seconds . The two-seater vehicle converts from a three-wheeled motorcycle to a gyrocopter in 10 minutes. It has 230hp, four-cylinder engine and reaches speeds of up 112 mph in the air or on the road. The helicycle goes from 0 to 60 mph in under eight seconds. The gyrocopter is designed to cruise at low altitudes (below 4,000ft) and it requires a 540ft runway for take-offs. For landing, the vehicle needs just 100 ft. The 27-gallon gas tank provides a 220-mile flight range (750 miles on the road). It is made from carbon fiber, titanium, and aluminum and weighs 1,499lbs. Owners must have a Sports Pilot Certificate to fly the vehicle. Owners will need a Sports Pilot Certificate to fly one. The two-seater vehicle is on sale in the 2013 Hammacher Schemmler catalogue under the name The Helicycle, yet its design and specifications are identical to the Pal-V One's. Like many flying car prototypes, including the TF-X from Austin-based Terrafugia, the Pal-V needs a 540ft runway in order to take-off. When in flight mode, the vehicle looks like a helicopter, however, it is known as a gyrocopter or autogyro because the main power comes . from the rotors at the rear of the vehicle. Its rotors spin considerably slower than a helicopter's blades, too, and can't stall. On . the ground, the machine handles somewhere between a motorbike and a . racing car - its chassis is built to lean into turns, and the two-seater . can reach speeds of up to 112mph. Unlike . most fictional flying cars, of course, it can't just extend its rotors . then hurtle skywards - the process takes about ten minutes. The Pal-V One, pictrured, needs a 540ft runway in order to take-off. When in flight mode, the vehicle looks like a helicopter, however, it is known as a gyrocopter or autogyro because the main power comes from the rotors at the rear of the vehicle . Once the engine stops, the propeller folds itself automatically into the driving position. Pushing a button then lowers the rotor mast into the horizontal position. Rotor blades and tail have to be stowed away by the driver. 'On the ground the vehicle drives like a sports car,' said Pal-V. 'Within minutes its rotor is unfolded and its tail is extended: then it is ready to take off thanks to the advanced gyrocopter technology.' The gyrocopter, pictured, is designed to cruise at low altitudes, below 4,000ft. Although it needs a 540ft runway for take-off, it only needs 100ft to land . The 27-gallon gas tank in the Pal-V One, pictured, provides a 220-mile flight range or 750 miles on the road. It is made from carbon fiber, titanium, and aluminum and weighs 1,499lbs . The Pal-V One is on sale from retailer Hammacher Schemmler under the name The Helicycle - but the specifications are the same. It can reach speeds of up to 112 mph and tilts like a motorcycle when turning corners, left.  The helicycle goes from 0 to 60 mph in under eight seconds on the road, as well . 'With these successful test results it is proven that it is not only possible to build a flying car but also that it can be done within existing international rules for both flying and driving.' The Pal-V One features a 230hp, four-cylinder engine powered by petrol. Its 27 gallon tank means pilots can fly for up to 220 miles at low altitudes - around 4,000ft - or drive for up 750 miles. It is made of carbon fiber, titanium, and aluminum and weighs 1,500lbs. The Pal-V One completed its maiden voyage just 18 months ago. It is available in red, pictured, or black .

It seems nowhere is safe from the prying eyes of the Russian state as it hosts the Sochi Winter Olympics. A government official has let slip that hotel guests are being monitored by covert surveillance cameras - even in the shower. Russia's Dmitry Kozak, deputy prime minister responsible for Olympic preparation, revealed that authorities have video from hotels showing that people leave the water on. You are being watched: Journalist Steve Politi tweets a picture of his makeshift shower curtain as a Russian official revealed covert cameras have been installed in the cubicles . 'We have surveillance video from the hotels that shows people turn on the shower, direct the nozzle at the wall and then leave the room for the whole day,' he said, according to the Wall Street Journal. The astonishing revelations came when . Mr Kozak was confronted by journalists about the poor state of . facilities around the Olympic Village. The . Sochi Games have been hit by complaints that accommodation blocks were . incomplete, the plumbing was malfunctioning, floors not laid, hotel . rooms left without door handles. The . list of bizarre and sometimes amusing faults has even spawned its own Twitter account called Sochi Problems which has been flooded with . examples of the unsatisfactory conditions. Mocking: A Twitter account called Sochi Problems has attracted nearly 200,000 followers by detailing the bizarre facilities for athletes and visitors .

Bizarre: Two female toilets sit side-by-side at the security screening facility outside the Main Press Center at the 2014 Winter Olympics, in Sochi . His . spokesman, Ilya Dzhus, has tried to quell the storm provoked by the . extraordinary claims, saying that 'no such thing was ever said'.

Like millions of schoolchildren, MPs couldn’t wait to start their six week summer holiday. But without the chance to watch a DVD or play Buckaroo on the green benches of the House of Commons hardly any politicians bothered turning up for the last day of the parliamentary term. Maybe MPs can be forgiven for needing a break – it has been a whole month since the last time the Commons had a recess. Early finish: At 4.19pm yesterday afternoon the green benches of the House of Commons were almost empty as MPs dashed off for their summer recess . At 5.20pm yesterday Commons John Bercow moved to adjourn the House of Commons until September 2. It means there will be no new legislation, no debates and no Prime Minister’s Questions for six long weeks. MPs argue they will spend the summer working in their constituencies. With . the general election now less than two years away, those with the . smallest majorities would be sensible to use the time to win over more . voters. However the chance to get away early proved too great for most. David Cameron lead the way after being spotted in the crowds watching the cricket at Lord's. 10.02am: On the last day of term yesterday just a few dozen MPs turned up in the Commons to grill Business Secretary Vince Cable . 1.37pm: By lunchtime they were struggling to get into double figures on the green benches . 5pm: With most people still hard at work in the country, just three MPs could be seen in the Commons chamber before it packed up for the summer . The Prime Minister donned sunglasses to make sure he did not miss any of the action during the second Ashes test. The visit to the cricket is just the . start of a long summer for Mr Cameron, who has previously been accused . of spending too long chillaxing. He is expected to return to Cornwall . for a holiday this summer, while reports also suggest he will take a . break in Scotland – in the middle of his campaign against independence. Mr Clegg will be away at the same time, leaving William Hague and Theresa May in charge of the country. The . PM and his deputy are to leave the country on holiday at the same time . this summer – despite having six weeks to ensure one of them stays in . charge of the country. Chilling: David Cameron was in the stands at Lord's for the second Ashes test as MPs began their six-week . Where's Dave? The Prime Minister was surrounded by ordinary fans as he watched England all out for 361 . As the Commons wound down yesterday it seemed most MPs have started their break early. Fewer than 50 of the 650 MPs turned out to see Business Secretary Vince Cable answer questions on the economy at 9.30am. By 1.30pm the numbers had dwindled to a couple of dozen for a debate on an EU-US Trade and Investment Agreement. As the clock ticked on to 4pm the number of MPs left for a general debate was struggling to get into double figures. And just three were left when Tory MP Bill Cash had a debate on HM Revenue and Customs. In 2012-13 the Commons sat just 145 times, the second lowest figure since 1945 for a year where there was not a general election. Some in Westminster predict it could be even lower this year. Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Any MP worth their salt will be busy in their constituency during the summer recess. ‘However, the long break means that ministers will get away without being scrutinised in Parliament for six whole weeks by the people we elect to hold them to account. ‘Week in, week out, we see debates on important legislation being curtailed as a result of strict timetable motions, which means Bills are getting passed by MPs without having been subject to detailed scrutiny. ‘This is bad for democracy and reducing the length of the recesses would make more time available for the Commons to properly debate new laws and hold the Government to account.’ Clash: Mr Cameron will be on holiday at the same time as his deputy Nick Clegg this summer, leaving William Hague and Theresa May in charge . Since January, MPs have only had a full five-day week in Westminster eight times. They usually spend Monday to Thursday in Parliament and then have Friday as a ‘constituency day’ to attend local events and meet voters. The Commons had a week off in February for half term. It then broke up for 19 days, returning once when Parliament was recalled for tributes to Baroness Thatcher. The Commons then sat for just eight days before breaking again on April 25, this time for prorogation to prepare for the Queen’s Speech on May 8. It meant a bonus 12 days off, before returning for the pomp and ceremony of the State Opening of Parliament. Despite setting out more than a dozen major bills, including legislation on reforming social care and pensions, there appears to be no urgency to start debating the laws. They then broke up for a week-long recess at the end of May and had another week off at the end of June. Earlier this year Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs Westminster’s spending watchdog, warned the public think politicians are lazy and provide poor value for money. 'We are living through the worst economic crisis in modern times. MPs have a lot to do and yet we are spending much of our time in recess,’ she said. 'Members of the public would be forgiven for thinking that it is MPs who are lazy and that it is Parliament that is failing to provide good value for money. 'We are not spending enough time in Westminster, and this creates a democratic vacuum.'","House of Commons almost empty for last debates before summer recess .

Microsoft unveiled its Kinect sensor as part of its Xbox One event in June. The sensor will be sold with the new console and both are available from 22 November. As well as the heartrate monitor, Microsoft's sensor has an increased 'field of view' that is now 60 per cent wider than the current Kinect. It can read up to six skeletons at once, compared to the current two, and its 'small object detection' is said to be two-and-a-half times better. This means it can identify small movements of the hand on a controller, for example. The second-generation Kinect sensor is also able to see faces, track eye movements and detect expressions, although the range of emotions is limited to happy, neutral and disinterested during the beta release. It is additionally said to be better at recognising features and body movements in the dark and dimly lit rooms because it uses what's called active infrared (IR). IR works in a similar way to thermal imaging and is used in night-vision goggles, for example.

A french businessman who realised his childhood dream to relocate to a desert island has been driven home by wild Indonesian creatures and unaffordable phone bills. Gauthier Toulemonde, 54, had been getting increasingly frustrated with his stagnant life commuting from Lille to Paris every day to his office job as a publicist. Last Christmas, the sorry sight of distinctly un-merry Parisians lugging presents through the station compelled him to finally take a leap. Deserted: Gauthier Toulemonde, 54, relocated his work as a publicist to one of Indonesia's 17,000 islands . Moving to one of Indonesia's 17,000 islands like Robinson Crusoe moved to Trinidad, Mr Toulemonde 'detoxed from modern life' by scavenging for food, being in touch with nature, and having little to no contact with other human beings. His only companion was Gecko, a dog borrowed from a Chinese woman, to scare off the wildlife. He told The Guardian he wanted to be the first 'Web Robinson' to persuade French people to abandon the tiring, demoralising commute and work remotely. He added: 'I found myself in Gare Saint Lazare in Paris just before Christmas watching the continuous stream of people passing by. Idyllic: He was bound by Indonesian law to keep the exact location of the 700x500-metre island a secret . 'Web Robinson': Toulemonde filmed his experiment testing if it was possible to work this far from the office . 'They had this sad look on their faces, even though they were carrying Christmas presents. It had long seemed to me absurd this travelling back and forth to offices. 'My idea of going away had been growing for a while, but it was on that day, I decided to leave.' It took him six months - and numerous run-ins with the Indonesian government - to find the perfect uninhabited island for a six-week trial run. Although he managed to persuade officials to let him go, he was ordered by law not to reveal the exact location of the hideaway, that is just 700-by-500 metres. Finally, in October he set off - with just a tent, four solar panels, a phone, a laptop, rice and pasta for supplies. Guard dog: Gecko, a dog he borrowed from a Chinese woman, helped scare off the wildlife . Isolated: Toulemonde was banned from stating the exact location of the uninhabited island in the Indian Ocean . Every day he woke at 5am and went to bed at midnight. He would scavenge for vegetables on the island and fish in the sea before simply reclining to 'detox from modern life'. 'Those days, for me it was like being in quarantine,' he told Le Figaro. 'I used the time as a detox from modern life.' He told Paris Match: 'What gave me most joy was living - stripped bare - in the closest possible contact with nature. Every day was magical.' However, it was not stress-free: his company had to publish two editions of Stamps Magazine. Snakes: Toulemonde was surrounded by Indonesia's wildlife ranging from small snakes to giant pythons . Rats: He said living on the island with pests such as rats for any more than 40 days would be too much to handle . Diary: He wrote a blog and made videos tracking his progress. He admitted he won't go out again . He allowed himself 20 euros a day for internet to email his employees - and abandoned extortionate phone calls early on. But after completing his trial, Mr Toulemonde has conceded that he cannot do it forever. Although he claims the 'telecommuting' experiment was a success, he told French broadcasters My TF1 News that the snakes and rats were intolerable - and fear of losing Internet connection was even worse. The biggest challenge was lack of human contact. He said: 'Telecommuting really works but doing everything virtually has its limits. Working from distance might be doable, but nothing can replace human contact.'","Gauthier Toulemonde, 54, moved to a 700x500-metre island for 40 days .

The elaborate joke was broadcast on a Japanese television special called Dokkiri Award (dokkiri means ‘being surprised’). If it is genuine and the 'victim' was not in on the trick, then it stands to be one of the most elaborate pranks in history. Scroll down for video . Best prank of the year: This prank saw Japanese comedian Toshiaki Kasuga flung 50 metres into the while he was sleeping .

Rude awakening: People are calling the 'Bungee Bed' prank the best prank of 2014 . In a radio interview after the event, comedian Toshiaki Kasuga, claimed he was told he had to be at the base of Mt. Fuji for work early the next morning. He arrived the night before and in order to keep warm in the freezing temperatures, headed out with the crew to get drunk. Kasuga apparently then slept very soundly, because he claims not to have woken while a crew attached bungee cords to his bed and strapped him in it. The next thing he knew, he said, fireworks were exploding under his bed and he was rocketed, bed and all, through the cabin’s roof 50 metres into the air. Sweet dreams: Kasuga said he was sleeping heavily after a big night out with the crew . The comedian was told he needed to be at Mt.

A woman and her lover who accused a man of rape, carved the word 'whatever' into his flesh then killed him were sentenced to life in prison. Jacqueline Cook, 30, confronted Mr Dance and inflicted the chilling wound on him, before her boyfriend Ian Gollop, 51, stabbed him to death. The guilty pair were described as 'pure evil' by Mr Dance's father, who called the sentences at Plymouth Crown Court 'the right result'. Killers: Jacqueline Cooke (left) and her boyfriend Ian Gollop (right) murdered Keith Dance after she accused him of rape . Mr Dance's beaten and throttled body was found with more than 70 stab wounds. Sentencing, . Mr Justice Burnett said the violence used was 'extreme' and a . 'calculated revenge attack' with a 'significant degree of planning and . premeditation'. Speaking . after the verdict, Mr Danceâ€™s stepfather, Ron Flower, said: 'Cooke and . Gollop are just pure evil. We have got the right result.' Mr Justice Burnett imposed a minimum term of 17 years and 6 months on Gollop and 15 years on Cooke. The . court heard that Cooke claimed that Mr Dance had raped her, but after . he shrugged off the accusation she stabbed him in the back of his head, . cut his chest and slashed his throat. Her boyfriend Ian Gollop then killed the alleged rapist by stamping on his head and throttling him. Cooke, 30, admitted stabbing the victim but denied involvement in his killing, pinning the blame on Gollop, 51. She claimed that Dance, 33, raped her at his flat in Plymouth and subsequently said he 'felt a lot of guilt about what had happened'. She confronted the alleged rapist, who was a friend and drinking companion, but said he replied: 'Whatever - why are you going on about it?' Dance was arrested and questioned by police after Cooke reported the alleged attack, but was released when he insisted the pair had had consensual sex. Cooke - who said she drank between nine and 12 litres of cider a day - was arrested after attacking Dance with a knife, leaving him with cuts and scratches to his face. Gruesome: Cooke apparently carved the word 'whatever' into her victim's chest . On March 10 last year, she and Gollop went to Dance's house, where she forced him to lift his shirt and carved the word 'whatever' into his chest in revenge for his dismissive words to her. Gollop then punched him in the face several times, throttled him with a rope and stamped on his head, leading to his death from asphyxiation and beating. Two days later, Cooke called 999 and told an operator she had killed Dance, saying she carried out the crime because 'she had been raped by him three weeks earlier'. She told the operator she had 'lost the plot' and had left his flat and dumped the knife down a drain. The killer added: 'I could not handle the fact that I had stabbed him. I am feeling really guilty and sick. It has been going over and over in my head and I am feeling so guilty for it now.' However, in a police interview she denied any involvement in the murder, blaming Gollop - who pleaded guilty before his girlfriend's trial - and claiming she tried to stop the killing.","Jacqueline Cooke accused Keith Dance of rape but he replied 'whatever'

Doctors were shocked when they X-rayed a woman’s knees and found they were full of gold needles. The 65-year-old South Korean woman had hundreds of tiny acupuncture needles in her knee tissue. It is thought they were left around her joint intentionally by an alternative medical practitioner who was treating her for knee pain. A 65-year-old South Korean woman was found to have hundreds of gold needles in her knees (pictured) after acupuncture treatment for her osteoarthritis. It's thought they were left there intentionally . The woman had been diagnosed with osteoarthritis, LiveScience reports. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis and is characterised by inflammation of the affected joint, damage to the cartilage of the joint and bony growths around the edge of the joints. Pain can result from the damage to the cartilage which lines the bones and allows the joints to move without friction. The woman was treated with painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs but they failed to relieve the pain and they caused her stomach discomfort. As a result, she turned to acupuncture for relief and is believed to have sought treatment at least once a week. The therapy involves using needles to stimulate different parts of the body or to relieve pain. Doctors say leaving the needles in the woman's knees was not necessarily a good idea as they could cause inflammation, infections and abscesses. They also make interpreting X-rays hard (file picture) In the South Korean woman’s case, it is thought the needles were left inside her knees to provide continued stimulation after the treatment had ended. However, many experts believe leaving foreign objects inside a person’s body is not a good idea. Dr Ali Guermazi, a professor of radiology at Boston University, who was not involved in the woman’s treatment, said they could cause swelling, abscesses and infections. He told LiveScience that leaving the needles in her knee could make it difficult for doctors to interpret X-rays. Additionally, he said it would mean she could not have an MRI scan if needed because the magnets in the scanner could cause the needles to move and damage an artery. The woman’s case was reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.","The South Korean woman, 65, turned to acupuncture for relief after painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs failed to reduce her pain .

NASA's Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescopes have spotted one of the most distant galaxies ever seen. The galaxy, known as Abell2744 Y1, harks back to a time when our universe was only about 650 million years old, compared to its current age of 13.8 billion years. It is about 30 times smaller than our Milky Way galaxy and is producing about 10 times more stars, as is typical for galaxies in our young universe. This image of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744 was obtained with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. The zoomed image shows the region around the galaxy Abell2744_Y1, one of the most distant galaxy candidates known, harkening back to a time when the universe was 650 million years old. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope helped to narrow in on the galaxy's great distance. The galaxy was found with the help of a gravitational lens: gravity from the mass in Abell 2744 acts to magnify the light of more distant galaxies behind it. These observations were part of NASA's Frontier Fields program, designed to push the limits of how far we can see into the early universe. The discovery comes from the Frontier Fields program, which combines Nasa'a space telescopes. Spitzer sees infrared light, Hubble sees visible and shorter-wavelength infrared light, and NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory sees X-rays. The telescopes are also getting a boost from natural lenses: they peer through clusters of galaxies, where gravity magnifies the light of more distant galaxies. The Frontier Fields program will image six galaxy clusters in total. Hubble images of the region are used to spot candidate distant galaxies, and then Spitzer is needed to determine if the galaxies are, in fact, as far as they seem. Spitzer data also help determine how many stars are in the galaxy. These early results from the program come from images of the Abell 2744 galaxy cluster. The distance to this galaxy, if confirmed, would make it one of the farthest known. Astronomers say it has a redshift of 8, which is a measure of the degree to which its light has been shifted to redder wavelengths due to the expansion of our universe. The discovery was made using the spitzer telescope: In this previous infrared image from it, hundreds of thousands of stars crowded into the swirling core of our spiral Milky Way galaxy. The farther a galaxy, the higher the redshift. The farthest confirmed galaxy has a redshift of more than 7. Other candidates have been identified with redshifts as high as 11. 'Just a handful of galaxies at these great distances are known,' said Jason Surace, of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. 'The Frontier Fields program is already working to find more of these distant, faint galaxies. 'This is a preview of what's to come.' The findings, led by astronomers from the Instituto de AstrofÃ­sica de Canarias and La Laguna University, set to be published in the the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics Letters.","The galaxy is about 30 times smaller than our Milky Way .

Some of the messages are amusing slogans but most are filled with a lonely despair only felt by a soldier experiencing the bloody horrors of war. These rather personal epigrams were engraved on to the side of the Zippo lighters of US soldiers, sailors and airmen during the Vietnam War. A collection of 282 lighters offering a rare insight into the mindset of military personnel fighting in the conflict was recently sold at auction for almost £22,000. Epigrams: A collection of Zippo lighters with the engravings of US servicemen who fought in Vietnam have been auctioned for almost £20,000 . Keepsakes: The lighters were all collected by Bradford Edwards from the streets of Ho Chi Minh during the 1990s . Poignant: While some of the lighters contain amusing one liners, the markings on others give a real insight into the loneliness of serving at war . The lighters were collected by American artist Bradford Edwards during the 1990s who bought them off the streets of Ho Chi Minh City. Among the inscriptions is a lighter that reads: 'When I die I'll go to heaven because I've spent my time in hell.' Another reads: 'When the power to love overcomes the love of power only then will there be a chance for true peace.' One simply reads: 'To mom, from a lonely paratrooper, Tony.' Collection: Bradford initially used the lighters to create unique works of art but says that the collection took on a life of its own . Big business: Because of a surge in interest in souvenirs from Vietnam, there is now a big market for fake lighters, says Bradford . Profound: Some of the messages carried by the lighters are more serious than others . Another says: 'A sucking chest wound is nature's way of telling you you've been ambushed.' Bradford initially used them to create various works of art, but says that his collection eventually took on a life of their own. He said: 'I'm fascinated with the lighters as . they are a window into the minds and experiences of the men experiencing . a certain place and time. 'I had used the lighters as inspiration and media in my art, but the collection itself has grown to be a statement of its own.' Over the years Bradford says he has handled thousands of genuine Vietnam Zippos. Enthusiast: Bradford says that he has handled hundreds of the lighters over the years . Kit: The lighters were often used as part of day to day combat with certain tasks becoming known as Zippo missions . Service: Many of the lighters include the years in which their owners served in Vietnam and their platoon . But an increasing demand from foreign tourists for mementos has led to a growing number of fake items entering the market. Bradford said: 'There are no real Zippos in Vietnam now. The scene is over. ' Used for lighting cigarettes, heating food, illuminating letters from home, or setting fire to huts of suspected Viet Cong, Zippos were used so frequently in search and destroy missions that GIs nicknamed them 'Zippo Missions' or 'Zippo Raids.' The Vietnam War, which ran from 1959 to 1975, was a bloody Cold War-era conflict that claimed millions of lives and left countless soldiers and natives traumatised by what they had endured. Bloody: Soldiers in action during the Vietnam War. The war raged from 1959 until 1975 . Brutal: U.S. estimates claim that between 200,000 and 250,000 South Vietnamese soldiers were killed and more than 58,000 U.S. soldiers died or were missing in action when the final troops pulled out . America's involvement in the region was triggered by one belief: that Communism was threatening to expand across the whole of South-East Asia. The Hanoi government estimate that in 20 years of fighting, four million civilians were killed across North and South Vietnam and a further 1.1million communist fighters died. U.S. estimates claim that between 200,000 and 250,000 South Vietnamese soldiers were killed and more than 58,000 U.S. soldiers died or were missing in action when the final troops pulled out. The war itself gathered heavy opposition in the States and soldiers have since recalled being told by superiors to remove their uniforms before landing back home to avoid being accosted by campaigners. Vietnam finally normalised relations with the U.S. in 1995.","The 282 lighters were recently sold at auction for almost £22,000 .

Mark Arthur, 50, said he had ‘tunnel vision’ and could hear his own heart  racing in the moments before he took a kitchen knife and killed his wife Heather in their home. The former British Airways manager, 51,  had just confessed that she was in love with another man and was leaving him. Mark Arthur, 50,  told the court he snapped after his wife Heather, left, told him she was having an affair with jazz saxophonist Paul Gowland, 44, right, and wanted to divorce him and sell their house, the court heard .

Newcastle Crown Court heard that in . the weeks before her death Mrs Arthur had planned to leave her husband . for jazz saxophonist Paul Gowland, 44, whom she had met in a local band. Yesterday Arthur wept . in the witness box as he recalled their argument following her . confession, how he stabbed her and then tried to perform CPR. He . was arrested after running to his GP surgery in his boxer shorts to get . medical help, saying he had hurt his wife, jurors were told. The . self-employed IT consultant said he felt as if his ‘whole world . collapsed’ as his wife accused him of being ‘manipulative and . controlling’. ‘I . remember my blood pressure went through the roof.

He added: ‘In the end I remember standing up and pushing forwards and that is when Heather got stabbed. ‘When I looked in Heather’s eyes I thought she was dead and I just spiralled into despair and my brain was shutting down. ‘I couldn’t believe what had just happened. I was not sure what was going on was real.’ Mrs Arthur was found by police with a knife in her chest at the couple's home in Gosforth, Newcastle, last April . Following . his arrest at the doctors’ surgery, Arthur struggled to remember in . police interviews what had happened, the court was told. But he denied that he had been controlling and domineering towards his ‘free-spirited’ wife. He . claimed that the GPS tracking system which jurors heard he had fitted . to her phone,  had simply been an application that he had removed when . she asked him to. Joanna Greenberg QC, defending, asked whether Arthur had ever ‘contemplated’ harming his wife. He replied: ‘No.’ Earlier . in the week the court heard the couple, who lived in Gosforth, . Newcastle, had been together for 30 years after meeting at university in . London but had been having marriage problems months before her death. The . jury heard how Mrs Arthur, who was raised on the Isle of Wight, had . planned a final family outing to the National Trust home, Wallington .

He . urged her to go somewhere with plenty of people around and sent her a . text message saying: ‘Please watch his every move, honey. You have to be . careful.’ She replied: ‘I promise I will keep in view of others.’ He told the jury: ‘I was concerned about what might happen, given the defendant’s history.’ When . he was asked to explain what he meant, he replied: ‘Just violent . exchanges and unpredictability. She said she walked on egg shells all . the time and was afraid. ‘She . had years of unhappiness, felt intimidated, felt threatened in some . way, didn’t have any freedom in her life, he was always tailing her, . interrogating her. He was unaffectionate towards her.’ He . also told the jury that Arthur would spend hours alone working at their . home while Mrs Arthur was outgoing and frequently went out with . friends.

Nasa is taking one small step to seeing if humans could live on the moon by planning an experiment to explore whether plants can be grown in the harsh lunar environment. The U.S. space agency plans on sowing its first seeds in specially designed canisters containing everything that is needed for the seedlings to thrive, that it will send to the moon in 2015. A group of scientists, students and volunteers - known as the Lunar Plant Growth Habitat team - are constructing a small unit to study the germination of plants when exposed to lunar gravity and radiation. The Lunar Plant Growth Habitat team is constructing a small technology demonstration unit (illustrated right) to study germination of plants (mock-up pictured left) in lunar gravity and radiation on the moon. The experiment will hint at whether humans could one day live there . Goal: To study the germination of plants in lunar gravity and radiation. When: The seeds will hitch a lift on the first Moon Express lander in 2015. The experiment: Scientists will develop a sealed growth chamber that can support germination over a 5-10 day period in a spacecraft on the Moon. Filter paper with dissolved nutrients inside the container will support around 100 seeds of Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant, and 10 seeds each of basil and turnips. Upon landing on the moon a trigger will release a small reservoir of water wetting the filter paper and initiating germination of the seeds. The air in the sealed container should be adequate to for more than 5 days of growth. The seedlings will be photographed at intervals to compare with those growth in Earth controls. They plan is to install small containers with seedlings and filter paper impregnated with the nutrients they need, then monitor their growth using sensors and cameras to send information about their progress to Earth. Seedlings can be as sensitive as humans to environmental conditions and sometimes even more so, according to Nasa, which explained their genetic material can be damaged like radiation. The space agency said: ‘They can test the lunar environment for us acting as a canary in a coal mine.’ Thriving plants need the same ingredients for life as humans – food, water and air – and also provide psychological comfort for people, demonstrated by the popular greenhouses in Antarctica and the International Space Station. ‘If we send plants and they thrive, then [humans] probably can,’ Nasa says on its website. Nasa plans on sending the seedlings to the moon by hitching a lift on a commercial spacecraft called the Moon Express lander, which is competing to win Google’s Lunar X-Prize in 2015. Scientists are currently constructing a . unit to study the germination of the plants, which will have a mass of . just one kilogram and will be deposited on the moon. Scientists will develop a sealed growth chamber that can support germination over a 5-10 day period in a spacecraft on the moon. Filter paper with dissolved nutrients inside the container will support around 100 seeds of Arabidopsis (pictured) and 10 seeds each of basil and turnips . Water will be added to the seeds in the module after landing and their growth will be monitored for five to 10 days and compared to Earth-based control seedlings. Seeds will include Arabidopsis, basil, and turnips and Nasa says the experiment will be the first of its kind on another world and ‘an important first step in the utilisation of plants for human life support’. Follow-up experiments will improve the technology in the growth module and allow for more extensive plant experiments, the organisation said. Survival for 14 days demonstrates plants . can sprout in the moon’s radiation environment but survival to 60 days . demonstrates that sexual reproduction (meiosis) can occur in a lunar . environment. Nasa plans on sending the seedlings to the moon by hitching a lift on a commercial spacecraft competing to win Google's Lunar X-Prize in 2015 - the Moon Express lander. Here, Russian cosmonaut Sergei Voltov checks on the progress of new plant growth aboard the International Space Station . Survival to 180 days shows effects of radiation on dominant and recessive genetic traits and afterwards, the experiment may run for months through multiple generations, increasing science return. There has been a lot of research on plant growth in microgravity, on space shuttles and in the International Space Station.

Hundreds of local residents marched on Wednesday night to remember the popular teen and protest at the senseless shooting. They chanted 'We need justice' as they questioned how the deputies could mistake a pellet gun for an assault rifle. Scroll down for video . Popular student: Andy Lopez, 13, was shot and killed by police officers for carrying a replica assault weapon in Santa Rosa, California, on Tuesday afternoon . Protesters walk towards the site where Andy Lopez was shot and killed as part of a march to voice the local community's anger at his death . According . to a police statement, Lopez was twice instructed to put down his . weapon and they only opened fire after he failed to comply. But Ethan Oliver, who lives across the street, told KTVU.com that the deputies continued to shoot at the boy, even after he had fallen to the ground. Oliver said he went outside after hearing two gun shots and by that time Lopez was already on the ground. ‘Then the cops went at it again and unloaded like six to seven shots,’ he said. When asked if he meant that the deputy shot Lopez while he was on the ground, Oliver said, ‘Yeah. Exactly what I saw.’ Authorities haven't responded to his claims, but it raises the possibility that Lopez was still alive when he hit the ground after the first two shots were fired. During a news conference on Wednesday authorities displayed a real assault weapon and the pellet gun - which . resembled an AK-47 with a black magazine and brown butt - to demonstrate . how difficult it is to tell them apart.

Federal law requires replica guns to have an orange tip, but Lopez's toy rifle didn't have one. Police also revealed that Lopez had his back to the deputies, so they didn't realize he was so young. He was wearing a hooded sweatshirt and shorts. They claim Lopez was about 20 to 30 feet from them when he turned with the barrel of the gun pointing toward them and they opened fire because they feared for their lives. ‘The deputy then fired several rounds . from his service weapon at the subject,’ said Santa Rosa Police Lt. Paul Henry, ‘striking . him at least one time. The subject immediately fell to the ground.’ 'The deputy's mindset was that he was fearful that he was going to be shot.' Hundreds of people marched through the Santa Rosa neighborhood where Lopez was killed on Wednesday night to protest and demand justice. 'We don't know the reason why they killed him,' Katia Ontiveros, 18, told the Press Democrat of Santa Rosa. She said her brother was Andy's friend. 'They should know if a gun is real.' At a news conference police displayed a real assault weapon and the pellet gun, left, to demonstrate how difficult it can be to tell them apart . The marchers went to the site at the . edge of a field where the boy was shot. Community members had left . candles, teddy bears and flowers there. Some community members wondered whether the deputies acted appropriately when they decided to fire on such a young person. ‘I'm sure you can tell he's a 13-year-old boy,’ Abrey Martin told KGO-TV. ‘He's not some maniac.’ One marcher told KTVU that the boy wasn't doing anything that a teen in any other part of the county wouldn't be doing. 'If . this is like anywhere else in rural Sonoma County and a kid with a . pellet gun, they wouldn't have done nothing to him,' said Greg Kestel. 'But this urban area they just blast the kid.' Andy, . an eighth-grade student who played trumpet in his school band, was . described as a bright and popular student, liked by many in his . community, including Lawrence Cook Middle School assistant principal . Linsey Gannon. ‘Andy . was a very loved student, a very popular, very handsome young man, very . smart and capable,’ Gannon said Wednesday. ‘Our community has been . rocked by his loss.’ Sujey Lopez and her husband Rodrigo Lopez, center, sit with their son Randy while praying at a vigil on the site where their 13-year-old son Andy Lopez was shot and killed . Lopez's heartbroken family say he was carrying just a toy while police have described it as a replica of an AK-47 style rifle . Even members of law enforcement expressed sympathy. The Santa Rosa and Petaluma police . departments will join with the District Attorney's office in the . investigation of the shooting while the two deputies are on . administrative leave. In . a statement, Sheriff Steve Freitas said the shooting was a ‘tragedy’ and that he would do everything he could to ensure the investigation was . thorough and transparent. 'The public expects that the investigation will be thorough and transparent. As sheriff, I will do all in my power to see that expectation is satisfied,' he said. 'My hope is that we can work with the community to help prevent a similar tragedy from happening in the future.' Some legislators have sought to impose restrictions on replica guns in an effort to make sure police don't mistake them for real ones. California law requires 'imitation weapons' to look like playthings by being brightly colored or transparent, but a state senator's proposal in 2011 to extend that requirement to air guns failed after manufacturers and retailers opposed it. According to police, two Sonoma County deputies were on patrol at 3 p.m. on Tuesday when they observed Lopez walking with what they believed to be a rifle . The boy's father, Rodrigo Lopez, had . identified the dead teen as his son Andy and said he had been carrying . ‘a toy gun’ belonging to a friend. According to police, two Sonoma County . deputies were on patrol at 3 p.m. when they observed the boy walking . with what they believed to be a rifle. The deputies called for backup and . repeatedly ordered the boy to drop the rifle, Sheriff's Lt. Dennis . O'Leary said in a news release. At some point after the deputies told Lopez to drop the rifle, they fired several rounds and hit him multiple times. After . ordering Lopez to move away from the rifle, deputies approached the . unresponsive teen as he lay on the ground and handcuffed him before . administering first aid and calling for medical assistance, O'Leary . said. Lopez was later pronounced dead at the scene, while neither deputy was injured. The Lopez family are devastated by the loss of their son, his grief-stricken mom Sujey Annel Cruz Cazarez has demanded to know why he was killed . After securing the scene, deputies . discovered the rifle was merely a replica. Deputies also found a plastic . handgun in the teen's waistband. Police are referring to the gun as a replica of an AK-47 style rifle, while the Lopez family have described it as a ‘toy.’ It isn’t clear if it was capable of firing BBs or other projectiles. Rodrigo Lopez told The Press Democrat that the last time he saw his son was on Tuesday morning as he was leaving for work. ‘I told him what I tell him every day,’ he said in Spanish. ‘Behave yourself.’ The boy’s grief-stricken mom, Sujey Annel Cruz Cazarez, said 'Why did they kill him? Why?' Sheriff's officials have not released the names of the deputies who have been placed on administrative leave.","Andy Lopez was spotted by cops in Sonoma County carrying what they believed was a rifle .

Two Pennsylvanian highways became parking lots Thursday after nasty winter weather snarled roadways across the state as part of holiday storm havoc that's robbed nearly a million homes of power in the U.S. and Canada. Traffic was backed up four miles on the Pennsylvania Turnpike west of Philadelphia thanks to a 35-vehicle pileup. In the very same county, 30 cars slipped and slid into one another on the state's I-78, halting traffic for five miles. While both roads were reopened by evening, the threat of continued power outrages and resulting frigid homes continued Friday as thousands of utility workers from the Great Plains to Eastern Canada fought to restore power knocked out by the fierce, wide-ranging storm. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Winter weather caused an unbelievable pileup on the Pennsylvania Turnpike outside Reading on Thursday. No deaths were reported despite the shocking jam but traffic was halted for four miles . Two pileups: In the same county as the Pennsylvania Turnpike snarl was a second massive pileup of some 25-30 cars, pictured, which stopped traffic for 5 miles . Zapped: Massive power outages have swept the US and Canada from the Great Plains to Maine thanks to ice weather. Utility workers, like Cory Bean in Michigan (pictured), fought against continued blustery conditions  to get power back on Thursday, though many can expect to go without until the weekend . Pennsylvania Turnpike officials say the 35 vehicle pile up, blocked westbound lanes and caused a 4-mile backup about 50 miles west of Philadelphia, between the Morgantown and Reading exits. Turnpike spokeswoman Renee Colborn says the highway reopened after 5 p.m. and about 10 people were taken to hospitals. Meanwhile, state police say 25 to 30 vehicles piled up on Interstate 78 and shut down about 5 miles of westbound lanes, also in Berks County. The lanes reopened after 3 p.m. Trooper David Beohm says 25 people were taken to hospitals and 44 were treated at the scene. Holiday havoc: The Pennsylvania Turnpike became a parking lot for hours on Thursday about 50 miles west of Philadelphia thanks to this pileup due to wintry weather . Close call: No deaths were reported in the Pennsylvania Turnpike pileup but startling pictures show how close motorists came to holiday disaster . No deaths were reported. However, there have been deaths due to weather this holiday season . The storm has been blamed for 17 deaths in the U.S. and 10 in Canada. Five people apparently died from carbon monoxide poisoning tied to using generators. Michigan bore the brunt of the storm as nearly 600,000 homes and businesses lost power, and as of Friday morning, about 64,000 customers remained in the dark. Maine reported almost 12,000 outages and in eastern Canada, nearly 62,000 still hadn't had their power restored, including 33,000 in Toronto. It could have been worse, said Paul Graham, a lineman supervisor from Massachusetts whose crew was helping out in Gardiner, Maine. Traffic on two highways was stopped for hours Thursday thanks to icy road accidents. Here, a car rests on its roof after an accident on Route 422 west in Reading . Traffic, traffic, everywhere: Slow moving traffic follows a snow plow along Route 183 near the St. Joseph Medical Center in Bern, Pennsylvania Thursday morning . Vehicles move slowly down Route 10 near the Brentwood trailhead as snow falls in Reading on Thursday morning in an area wracked with winter strom traffic jams over the holiday . Slow moving traffic makes it's way over a snow-covered hill on southbound Route 222 near the route 183 overpass in Bern, Pennsylvania on Thursday. The area took a wintery wallop over the holidays . 'If it was a little more ice, poles would have been broken,' Graham said. 'Things would be on the ground. ... If there was another quarter of an inch or a half-inch of ice, people would've been out for a long, long, long time. But I'm sure no one is thinking they're lucky, right?' Many families affected by the outages sought refuge with relatives or hunkered down with generator-powered space heaters and fireplaces to keep warm. Utility officials say it could be days before power is restored to everyone. The linemen face a dangerous and physical task, below-freezing temperatures aside. Ice can weigh down power lines so much that they break, or tree branches can fall and take the lines with them. So, the linemen must clear some debris, if needed, and then shimmy up slick utility poles to restring lines using belts and spiked boots. Karen Gibbs walks through a labyrinth of icy broken trees and downed power lines to her home on Maplehurst Drive in Belgrade, Maine on Thursday. Nearly a million were without power in the U.S. and Canada thanks to a holiday ice storm . Outages: Utility workers flocked to hard-hit areas such as Michigan to try to restore power to the the over 500,000 homes left without out it on Thursday. Continued blustery weather has hampered their efforts and some could be without through the weekend . Traffic moves past utility crews as they prepare to work on power lines Thursday in Litchfield, Maine, where many have been without electricity since Monday's ice storm . Utility crews struggled through nasty weather from the Great Plains to Maine to restore power as tens of thousands remained powerless Friday . 'You have to take your time. You have to watch what you're doing,' said Carone, who was working in Columbiaville on Thursday. 'It's not a good feeling, climbing up an icy pole.' A lineman fell Tuesday from a ladder in Lansing, suffering broken ribs and a shoulder injury. About 200,000 will not have power restored until the weekend after heavy snowfall hampered repair efforts. Eight were killed by carbon monoxide . poisoning after using generators to heat their homes after an ice storm . in Maine and Michigan cut power. The . cuts in supply over the festive period led many to turn to generators . to keep their families warm, but with deadly consequence. In Maine, where more than 24,500 have . been without power since Sunday, a 50-year-old man died as he refilled . his generator in an enclosed outhouse. Danger: Residents have been warned to be careful with generators after eight deaths from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning . Frozen over: A home in Clarence Center, New York, is surrounded by ice after the storms . Icy: The Clarence Highway department were trying to reopen road which flooded earlier in the week and was frozen over during the storm . 'He might as well had gone in there and . placed a masked over his nose and started to breathe pure carbon . monoxide, because that's basically what he did,' Mike Grant, of Maine Emergency Management Agency, told ABC News. 'The family checked on him 15 minutes later and he was already dead, so . it doesn't take very long,' he added. In . Michigan a family-of-four were overcome with poisonous fumes from their . generator, which was running in their garage on Christmas Eve. They were taken to hospital, where the 58-year-old father, who has not been named, died. 'People . feel that there is protective barrier within the garage, but the fact . is that the CO will work its way into the home,' Larry Jerue, of Clinton . County Sheriff's office, said. Dangerous: The storm pulled power lines down onto the roads below . Repairs: A workman clears a fallen tree from power lines in Maine on Thursday . Tough conditions: Ice and snow have slowed work to restore power in Maine where thousands have been cut off . Self-sufficient: With no power for four days Maine residents, such as Brad Marquis, pictured, have been heating their homes with generators . Natural freezer: With temperatures in Maine falling to 19F, and no electricity, residents such as Tom Henson, above, have been keeping food from the kitchen freezer on their decks . Survival: Ken Finnegan loads firewood into his truck in Litchfield, Maine. More snow is forecast, meaning power to homes may not be restored for a few more days . About 400 deaths each year are caused by accidental carbon monoxide poisoning, and in many cases the deaths could have been avoided, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 'Just opening a window or an open door . might not be enough because even then [carbon monoxide] could build . up in a nook or cranny of the room,' Mr Grant said. Warnings about the use of generators came as a further 3in to 7in of snow was predicted in parts of Maine. Despite round-the-clock repair work the extra snowfall and ice was weighing down power lines, and there was further risk from trees falling on cables. 'The system is pretty compromised out there. We expect we will have more outages,' Susan Faloon, of Bangor Hydro Electric in Maine, told CBS News. Frozen: Birch trees in Maine bend under the weight of ice from the storm on Monday . Chilly: Icicles cling to a bear statue in Maine, four days after an ice storm hit . Maintenance: Engineers were trying to repair power lines and get people reconnected around the country on Boxing Day . 'There was some concern expressed over . the last couple of days about that storm coming because obviously we . still have lot of stuff weighing down trees and lines.' In Michigan, where more snow is forecast, more than 100,000 customers were not expected to regain power until Saturday. At the height of the ice storm that hit on Sunday, half a million homes and businesses lost power. In Islesboro - a community of 600, where John Travolta has a home - a state ferry was commandeered to transport utility crews to to the Maine island for repair work. Conditions were better for those living around the east of Lake Ontario, where up to 17in of wind-whipped lake effect snow was expected to fall tomorrow, as nearly all of the 50,000 customers left without power have been reconnected. Road conditions were treacherous in several states, including Pennsylvania where ten people were taken to hospital on Thursday after a 35-vehicle pile up on a snowy section of the turnpike. At least 27 deaths have been attributed to the ice storm so far this week. Tricky: Driving conditions in Pennsylvania were tough on Thursday morning .

An extraordinary letter in which Admiral Lord Nelson launches a racist rant at his arch enemy, the French, has sold for 9,000 pounds. The four page letter was written in the aftermath of the 1799 Battle of the Nile, where the Royal Navy hero defeated Napoleon's fleet off Egypt. In his broadside, Nelson blasts the French as being a nation of 'thieves, murderers, oppressors and infidels' and admits to not liking any Frenchman. Rant: Lord Nelson describes the French as 'thieves, murderers, oppressors and infidels' before questioning 'what faith can we hold with these people?' He also attacks the French republican system as a 'many-headed monster' and said their problems would be resolved if they had a monarchy. The letter is signed 'Your obliged Bronte Nelson', a signature used by the sea lord after being made Duke of Bronte in Sicily in 1799. It has now sold at auction in London for a four figure sum. He also attacked the French republican system as a 'many-headed monster' and said their problems would be resolved if they had a monarchy . Auctioneer Richard Davie, of International Autograph Auctions, said: 'It is a fascinating letter revealing personal views of our greatest sea lord. 'There has always been a rivalry between Britain and France, but Nelson was writing at a time when relationships between the two countries were at rock bottom.' After the Battle of the Nile, Nelson sailed to Palermo, Italy, from where he wrote the letter.It is unclear who the letter was for, although it was addressed to 'My Dear Lord.' He states: 'I hate rebels, I hate traitors, I hate tyranny come from where it will. 'I have seen much of the world, and I have learnt from experience to hate and detest republics. 'There is nothing but tyranny & oppression, I have never known a good act done by a Republican, it is contrary to his character under the mask of Liberty. 'He is a tyrant, a many headed monster that devours your happiness and property. 'Nothing is free from this monster's grasp. A republic has no affection for its subjects. 'A King may be ill advised and act wrong, a Republic never acts right, for a knot of villains support each other, and together they do what no single person dare attempt. 'I pray God this war was over and a monarch placed on the throne of France, not that I like any Frenchman be he royalist or be he republican, but the French republicans have shown themselves such villains.

Their crimes were so awful that they were executed and their house – thought to be teeming with evil spirits – was abandoned and left to decay for centuries before being knocked down. But in the best traditions of horror movies, it seems the Edinburgh home of occultist Major Thomas Weir and his sister Jean is back from the dead. The Weirs were executed in 1670 after admitting to shocking crimes including bestiality, incest and necromancy. Gloomy: The Quaker Meeting house in Edinburgh's Victoria Terrace. It's designers incorporated the home of 'evil' occultist Major Thomas Weir into the building . According to folklore, their house, said to be the capital’s most haunted home, then stood empty before being demolished in the 19th century, this month's edition of the Fortean Times said. But researchers have discovered that the builders of a church, now the Quaker Meeting House in Victoria Terrace, actually incorporated the old dwelling into the structure . Historian Dr Jan Bondeson, of Cardiff University, said: ‘Major Weir’s house in the West Bow was recognised as the most haunted in Edinburgh. ‘Although no person dared live there, its windows were lit up at night, with weird shapes flitting past the dirty panes and strange music coming from inside. But  contrary to local belief, it still stands today.’ After the Major’s death, people spoke of hearing his coach and horses thundering down the road, while it was claimed his staff, which was burned with his body, was seen floating along the street searching for its master. History: The Weirs were executed in 1670 after admitting to shocking crimes including bestiality, incest and necromancy (left). Their house (right) was said to have been knocked down but was actually built into a church . The house was eventually bought in 1780 by an ex-soldier and his wife who were said to have fled on their first night after seeing the form of a calf appear at their bed. In his Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft, written in 1830, Sir Walter Scott, noted: ‘It is certain that no story of witchcraft or necromancy, so many of which occurred near and in Edinburgh, made such a lasting impression on the public as that of Major Weir. ‘The remains of the house in which he and his sister lived are still shown at the head of the West Bow, which has a gloomy aspect, well suited for a necromancer. ‘At the time I am writing, this last fortress of superstitious renown is in the course of being destroyed.’ The property has been used by the Quaker religious community for around 25 years. Anthony Buxton, manager of the Quaker Meeting House, said: ‘This was the first time I had been told Major Weir’s home was actually here. ‘I thought it had been demolished by people who didn’t want anything to do with it. ‘That said, one of my staff some years ago said he had seen Weir walk through the wall. If Dr Bondeson is right, Weir’s house is in our toilet, which seems appropriate.’","Home of 'evil' 17th Century occultist was thought to have been demolished .

A £100million plan to redirect train services in Devon and Cornwall could be revived after huge waves washed the line away. The government revealed said the army could be called in to help repair the track at Dawlish after huge waves demolished the sea wall on the south coast. But Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin today announced he has ordered a ‘rigorous review’ into alternatives, after the last Labour government rejected the need to reroute the line. Scroll down for video . Ministers have ordered an urgent review into alternative rail routes which could include reopening the South Railway or the Teign Valley lines which closed 50 years ago . Ferocious storms swept away sea walls and the rock on which the track lay, leaving nearby homes in danger . The incredible scene in Dawlish, Devon where a 50ft section of ground supporting a railway line has been completely washed away . MPs demanded to know why £50billion is being spent on the HS2 line linking London to the north of England while services in the south west are at the mercy of the weather. The destruction of Dawlish's railway line has effectively cut off rail links to Cornwall, with a 200ft stretch of tracks left mangled and hanging over the boiling seas. On the seafront huge granite blocks had . been ripped out by the force of the crashing waves and gales and 20 . homes had to be evacuated and people moved to a leisure centre. Network Rail has warned the line, built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and popular for its stunning view, could be out of action for weeks. Labour warned the closures are costing the area millions in lost revenue, with the West Country's crucial tourism industry threatened by the loss of a vital transport link. Mr McLoughlin last night held urgent talks with Network Rail and MPs from Devon and Cornwall. Troops could be called in to help Network Rail to repair the line to get services moving as soon as possible . Network Rail said both tracks has been severely damaged by the sea, washing away ballast and the foundations on which the track is built . In 2006 the Met Office said one day it would be necessary to replace or move key transport links like the Dawlish line . Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has offered the help of the Ministry of Defence to Network Rail to repair the line at Dawlish while Communities Secretary Eric Pickles hit out at the Environment Agency's attitude to local people . The Environment Agency faced fresh criticism today over its refusal to react to the demands of local people hit by the floods. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said questions would have to be asked about the ‘local accountability’ of quangos and the decision to stop dredging the rivers Tone and Parrett on the Somerset Levels. And he condemned agency chief executive Lord Smith, for suggesting there had to be a choice between protecting rural or urban areas. In the Commons today Mr Pickles hit back: ‘We will work to defend both town and country. For the record, and with respect, I have to say that I do not agree with the comments of Lord Smith, who implied that there was a choice between town and country.’ And raising the prospect of an overhaul of the Environment Agency’s powers, he added: ‘As the dark skies clear, there will be lessons to be learned, from the way in which we help local authorities to the role of quangos and the need for their local accountability, the influence of man-made policies on dredging, the effect of tree planting on our landscape and rivers, and the resilience of our nation as a whole throughout the 21st century.’ In the Commons today he revealed he has ordered a report into ‘the whole question of the resilience of the South West’. He . told MPs: ‘I am working with Network Rail to see that service is . restored as quickly as possible but also to have a more rigorous review . of some of the other alternatives which may be available.’ It raises the prospect of two lines closed half a century ago being reopened to carry trains away from the seafront. In 2006 Labour ministers ruled out the idea of re-routing. Then-transport minister Derek Twigg said: 'Network Rail recognises the importance of the line and continues to devote considerable resources to maintaining it to an appropriate standard. 'It does not believe that the railway sea defences in Dawlish are likely to fail in the foreseeable future, thanks to the work carried out and the ongoing maintenance and monitoring.' However at the time the Met Office said: ‘We are obviously going to have to think about one day replacing or moving key transport links like the Dawlish line.' Now the dramatic destruction of the line means the idea is set to be revisited. One option is to reopen a 15-mile stretch of the former Teign Valley line from Exeter to Newton Abbott which was closed in 1958, which would mean trains no longer stopped at Teignmouth or Dawlish. Another more costly plan would be to revive the Southern Railway line which links Exeter to Plymouth via the northern edge of Dartmoor. It would mean there would be no rail services to Dawlish, Teignmouth, Torbay, Totnes or Ivybridge and take trains on a new 50-mile route, adding to journey times. Both options would be hugely expensive and controversial for those areas which would lose services. But ministers faced cross-party calls in the Commons for radical action and investment to solve the problem. Andrew George, Lib Dem MP for St Ives in the far south of Cornwall, said: If we are to put proper investment into a resilient service down to Penzance we need to make sure that there is a comparable funding in terms of the kind of money which is being spent on HS2 and other services.’ Former Labour Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw,  MP for Exeter, demanded to know what Mr McLoughlin is ‘doing to ensure this vital mainline into the South West is reopened as quickly as possible and what he is going to do in the long-term to help ensure that the vulnerability of the line at Dawlish is dealt with’. Homes overlooking the Dawlish line have been left hanging after the land gave way . The fierce seas ripped a gaping hole in the coastal road, shattering tarmac and ripping holes in the the picturesque properties standing on the sea front, forcing residents to evacuate . The Government has found announced extra £30million to help councils deal with the damage caused by the severe weather outbreak. The money for this year is on top of £100million announced by David Cameron yesterday. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said 42 new flood defence schemes are also planned for 2014-15, as he hailed the Government's £3.1 billion capital investment commitment as the largest by any government. He told MPs: 'In the short-term, I can announce that the Government will provide an additional £130million for emergency repairs and maintenance, £30million in the current year and £100million next year. 'This will cover costs incurred during the current emergency response and recovery, as well as essential repairs to ensure that defences are maintained.' However, Ukip leader Nigel Farage called for Britain’s foreign aid budget worth . £11billion to be immediately suspended with the money diverted to . help areas in the UK devastated by flooding. The . Ukip leader insisted ‘charity begins at home’ and urged the government . to step up its response to the colossal damage to homes, businesses, . roads and railways. Mr McLoughlin insisted that he takes his responsibilities to Devon and Cornwall ‘incredibly seriously’. ‘I also would like certainly point out that over the next five years between 2014 and 2019 NR will be spending £38billion on the existing network. ‘There is not a shortage of understanding from this government as to the very important nature of rail services across the whole country.’ Anne Marie Morris, Tory MP  for the Newton Abbot seat which includes Dawlish, said the line ‘is a vital artery linking the South West to UK and a long term solution to coastal rail flooding must be found now’. Devon County Council leader John Hart also demanded Government help for the South West following the latest storms. He said: 'Once again we are cut off from the rest of the country by rail. Now following the storm damage at Dawlish, the rest of the peninsula is also cut off and we don't know when the line will be restored. The region deserves more help. We've been told we just had the wettest January in memory. But that followed the wettest January in memory last year. 'The time has come for the Government to take more action to make sure that Devon and Cornwall don't get cut off for weeks every winter. We need urgently to look at how our rail links can be better protected.’ Network Rail has called in a specialist concrete spraying machine to shore up the damaged section of seafront, with warnings the line could be out of action for up to six weeks. Patrick Hallgate, head of the Western route, said: 'We absolutely understand the importance of the railway to the south west and will do everything we can to rebuild the railway at Dawlish as quickly and safely as we can. 'After a quieter night’s weather, we have been able to begin delivering machinery to our site compound with a view to protecting the exposed section of railway and the land behind it. We need to make sure we limit any further damage this weekend so that the significant repairs that are needed do not become greater still. 'We will continue working with the Government, Environment Agency, local authorities and other partners to explore ways of improving the railway’s resilience to extreme weather. The disruption to rail services in the south-west highlights the importance of that work and the need for all forms of transport to ensure that they are fit for the future.' Labour;s shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: 'Freak weather is rapidly becoming the new normal in our country, and I understand the difficulties you have in giving a timescale for the Dawlish repairs, given further bad weather is forecast for Saturday. 'But every week that this line is closed costs the regional economy tens of millions of pounds.'","Transport Secretary orders 'rigorous review' of alternatives to coastal line .

Rita Cleary, dressed in black, wore a pained expression as she watched magistrates remand her son Ryan, 19, in custody to allow police to quiz him about attacks on the  CIA and U.S. Senate. But Mrs Cleary, 45, fears her son, who was described by a ‘vulnerable young man, would attempt to kill himself if he was not granted bail soon. In the dock: Cleary listened to proceedings at Westminister Magistrates Court as his mother Rita watches . Sullen: Ryan Cleary, looking pale and sporting stubble in a court sketch, appeared in front of magistrates today . Cleary is accused of hacking the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency. He appeared for the first time in . public at the City of Westminster Magistrates Court after he was charged . with five hacking offences.

Soca website, the CIA,  U.S. Senate, NHS and games firms, Sony and . Nintendo. Today the loner was remanded in . custody for up to three days to allow detectives to question him about . other alleged computer offences in America, which could result in him . facing extradition. But his mother Rita, 45, warned that any attempt to extradite him to the United States would be a death sentence for him. Today the alleged hacker, who suffers from agoraphobia, appeared anxious and frightened during the short hearing. Back to the cells: A police officer drives a car believed to contain  Cleary, as they leave the court . Just moments before he appeared in court, he warned his mother that he may attempt suicide. Mrs Cleary told the Mail:  'He said, ‘If I don't get out, you know what I'll do mum”. 'That's his way of telling me he'll kill himself. 'His threat is very real and I'm terrified of what will happen if he is not given bail.’ Cleary also told his mother that he . had not slept and asked her to bring some  detective crime novels, . clothing and razorblades so he could shave. During the hearing, his tearful mother waved to her son from the public gallery. Afterwards she said: 'It was a relief to finally see Ryan but it was clear he is not coping well.

Igor and Marek Marcin offered their unsuspecting victims the promise of a better life in the UK. But for 15 men who travelled from eastern Europe the reality was very different - they were forced to live in cramped conditions with other workers, and were given just a fraction of their wages. The brothers, from Slovakia, are today behind bars, after admitting trafficking men into the country. Igor Marcin, left, and his brother Marek, right, were jailed for trafficking men from eastern Europe into the UK, promising them a better life. Judge Jonathan Gosling told the pair they 'dehumanised' their 15 victims . Sentencing the pair, Judge Jonathan Gosling, said their exploitation was 'targeted and cynical'. He told them: 'In a word, these men were dehumanised.' Igor Marcin, 36, from Derby, was jailed for four years and four months while 40-year-old Marek, also of Derby, was given a three years and four month sentence. The Marcins preyed on vulnerable men, who were desperate of a better life. They offered their victims a good job, accommodation and food. But when their victims, who were of Slovak and Czech origin, arrived in Derby they found a very different reality. They were forced to live in the defendants' homes, sharing bedrooms and sleeping on mattresses on the floor, prosecutor Jonathan Spicer said. They were fed at set meal times but were banned from taking food from the kitchen at any other time. They had no access to the internet or post, and were allowed little or no social interaction with their fellow victims. The brothers took away their victims' identity documents and passports and forced them to open bank accounts, from which they gave them 'pocket money' of around £10 or £20, while they took the rest for themselves. The men had no access to their earnings, were not given bank cards or allowed any of the documentation relating to their accounts. Igor Marcin's wife Dagmar Marcinova, admitted fraud and theft and was jailed for 10 months. Marek's wife, Gabriela Marcinova, also admitted a charge of theft and was sentenced to eight months in prison . One victim was under the impression his wages were being held but would eventually be given to him, the court heard. Mr Spicer said: 'He understood his money was being saved for him by Igor so he did not question why he was only earning £20 a week.' One man was told he owed money to pay off the travel costs to the UK but the money taken far exceeded this cost. Benefits and tax credits were also claimed in the names of their victims, Derby Crown Court heard. Following the sentencing, one victim spoke out about his treatment and how the brothers had taken all his documents and most of his wages, leaving him with no means of escape. In a statement released through police Frantisek Ruzicka, 44, said he was brought to Derby from the Czech Republic and shared a room in a house in Cameron Road with three other men. Describing the conditions he lived in, he said: 'It wasn’t full of fleas but there were beetles. There were four of us in one room. 'I would wake up at 3am and you are being eaten alive by these flat beetles. You have got all these spots all over the place. At 6am, you are supposed to be getting up and going to work. 'I was working in a flower factory and you have bites all over the place and you want to scratch yourself but you can’t. The itching was terrible, I really couldn’t cope. 'They had all my documents so it was impossible to get work elsewhere. I was thinking of going back to the Czech Republic but I had no money so how could I?' Mr Ruzicka said he hopes his experience will encourage other people in the same situation to contact police. He added: 'Do not be afraid. Tell the police and police will deal with it. All those people who were in charge were arrested. 'They wanted a lot and now they have ended up with nothing.' The charges related to 12 men, but a total of 15 had been identified, between 2010 and July 2013, when the brothers were arrested. The men were made to work in a number of jobs including at car washes, as flower packers, and in food factories. The court heard more than £101,000 had been claimed in state benefits and tax credits by the Marcins, and a further £53,444 was stolen from the wages paid to the workers. The court also hear that on two occasions Marek Marcin assaulted one of the men when he complained about his circumstances. 'He was saying to him words to the effect: ‘Who is the boss?’ He was slapped round the face.' It was only when one of the victims plucked up the courage to go to the Salvation Army last April and tell them his story that the dire situation the men were in came to light. Judge Gosling told the brothers they had 'carefully selected' their victims. 'Their own description of their circumstances in Slovakia - leading rather lonely, aimless lives with scant family support - made them an easy target for your plan,' he said. The Marcins both pleaded guilty to offences under section four of the 2004 Asylum and Immigration Act. Igor’s wife Dagmar Marcinova, 38, who admitted fraud and theft, was sentenced to 10 months. She took money from one of the victim’s bank accounts and stole cash from another. Marek’s wife Gabriela Marcinova, 42, pleaded guilty to theft after stealing money belonging to one of the victims. She was sentenced to eight months. Both women walked free from court because they have already served half of their sentences since they were remanded in custody following their arrests last year. The two couples were arrested on July 15 by Derbyshire police officers, the National Crime Agency’s UK Human Trafficking Centre and the Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA), who visited several addresses across Derby. They found 12 victims of human trafficking at the houses. The men were taken to a special reception centre, set up by Derbyshire County Council, Derby City Council, the Salvation Army and the British Red Cross. A police spokeswoman said nine of the victims have returned to their home countries while three remain in the UK, being supported by police and specialist charities. The officer in charge of the case, Detective Inspector Emlyn Richards, today welcomed the sentence. He said: 'While we are obviously pleased that the Marcin brothers and their wives have been sentenced, the real success of this operation is that these victims are no longer being exploited. 'When they arrived at the reception centre and started to tell us what had happened to them, we were shocked by what we were hearing. 'They lived in cramped conditions, with just a mattress on the floor to sleep on, and were only receiving a fraction of what they were actually earning - around £15 to £25 for a full working week. 'Meanwhile, the Marcin family were driving around in high-value cars. The traffickers kept the men’s documents so they had no way of leaving. 'Some of the men had chemical burns where they had been made to work at car washes in just their slippers. 'The chemicals had seeped through the footwear and burnt their skin. One victim told of how he removed his own tooth because he was denied access to a dentist. 'We were also told of a man who had suffered constant earache but was denied medical treatment. 'To end the pain he was in, he perforated his own ear drum. 'Another victim told us how over several months he had managed to save about £55, which he intended to use to escape and buy a flight home. 'He returned from working one day to find his room had been searched and the money had been stolen.' GLA chief executive Paul Broadbent added: 'This was a shocking example of people driven by nothing but greed lining their pockets at the expense of the health, welfare and safety of men who were forced to work for them. 'It may shock the people of Derby to learn that the horrific practice of human trafficking is happening in their city. Regrettably, it comes as no surprise to the GLA because we know this can and does happen everywhere. 'The kind of organised criminal scam being operated by these two couples is typical of cases we are uncovering on a regular basis across the country. 'We will continue to work in partnership with the police, the NCA and all other relevant organisations to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable people and make sure offenders are convicted just like they were in this case.'","Igor Marcin and his brother Markek admitted trafficking men into the country .

A defiant father is refusing to leave the £1million house he built himself despite being completely surrounded by fields of muddy floodwater on the Somerset Levels. Builder Sam Notaro, 40, has kept the house in Moorland safe from the rising floodwater by building his own flood defences which consist of a five-foot deep moat around his house, brick waterproofing and a pump system. He insisted his partner and their two young children left in case the defences breached, but Sam refused to evacuate despite the impending storm and inevitable deluge. An Englishman's home: Sam Notaro built his own flood defences to protect his four-bedroom home in Moorland, Somerset . Marooned: Sam Notaro is keeping his house dry by using a moat, water-proofing and a pump system. He built the house himself four years ago . Mr Notaro spent around £1million building his four-bedroom detached home from scratch and moved into it just two-and-a-half years ago. The home sits on a four-acre plot which is the highest point in Moorland.The house was built on a spot which according to records had never previously flooded - and Mr Notaro is determined to maintain the record. The flood water is currently 2ft away from the top of the barrier and any water which breaches his blockade is quickly pumped back out of the house. He has also wrapped the bottom of his house in polythene in an attempt to stop any rainwater soaking through the bricks. The father-of-two is using diggers to make sure the defences remain firm under the mounting pressure . Mr Notaro looks out onto the flooded scene outside his home in Moorland Somerset . Mr Notaro said: 'All around the house is completely flooded but because we've built a band around it we've managed to stop it actually coming into the house. 'If we hadn't have put the band around the house it would be completely flooded now. 'As it stands the barrier we've built is about 2ft higher than the water, so that's how much more we're hoping it'll take. 'Obviously . it might collapse if the pressure of the water gets too much. For about . three days solid we've been pumping water out with two big pumps and . stopping it from getting in. It's our home. I'm determined to stay here . and look after it. 'I won't be able to get out of here now anyway - the water all around the house is up to my waist. 'We can't even get up and down the drive. I've got to stay here. I need to man the pumps anyway.' Sam Notaro stands defiant in the land surrounding his £1million home on the Somerset Levels . A friend in need:  Mr Notaro's neighbours have delivered food to the home and helped keep the water at bay . Mr Notaro's partner Alana O'Dell, 31, . and their two children, who are 18-months-old and 20-weeks-old, left . the house on Tuesday. He added: 'My friend came out last night on his boat and delivered me some food. It's a disaster area around here. 'Rescuers waded through waist deep water at 2am to knock on the door and tell me to leave. 'I told them I wasn't going and they just shook my hand and said fair play, good luck.' Sam brought his land with Alana nearly four years ago. Knowing . that the area was vulnerable to flooding they ensured the house was . built as high as the Environment Agency would allow - much higher than . any recorded flood. In spite of this their house is now completely surrounded by water 3ft deep in the lowest points and 8ft deep in other areas. Out on top: The builder's planning has saved him the heartache of the floods - as more rain and winds are predicted for tonight . Head and shoulders above the rest: A view of Sam Notaro's house (centre, right) on the edge of the village of Moorland which was evacuated last night when flood water rose a further metre . Mr Notaro added: 'We brought the land four years ago. When we brought it we were sure that it would be safe from flooding. 'The . land around here has always been managed well to prevent flooding. We . brought it and knocked the old farm house here down and started again. 'We . spent about £1 million on the house - buying the land and then actually . building and decorating the house. It took us about 18 months, then we . moved in. 'Just to be on . the safe side we made sure we built the house higher than the highest . recorded flood. Ironically we wanted to build it higher than we did but . the Environment Agency wouldn't allow it. The water level is higher than . ever at the moment and that's how the house has ended up at risk. 'We all know it's called ""Moorland"" but it's not meant to flood like this. All four of my acres are under . water now. Another thing that's upsetting is how much this will have . devalued the house - if we want to ever sell it now we'll struggle.' The . builder's planning has saved him from some of the most destructive . weather the UK has encountered in years. But the torrential rain and . powerful winds is far from over. Helping hand: Sam Notaro's friend drives one of the builder's diggers at the property . Friends have delivered supplies to the property while Mr Notaro desperately tries to defy the elements . Sam Notaro is the last man standing in flooded Somerset - after creating improvised flood defences around his home . Winds of 80mph and heavy rain will sweep in from the Atlantic tomorrow, in what forecasters say could be the worst of the dramatic weather so far this winter. Flooded areas and sea defences weakened by earlier storms will be bombarded once more. Yet again, the worst hit will be the South West of England, where coastal homes and businesses have been severely damaged. The flooded Somerset Levels meanwhile, where hamlets have been turned into 'ghost villages' after homes were evacuated due to rising flood waters, is also expecting a new deluge of torrential rain. Royal Marines who had been in the region building sandbag defences were drafted in to assist with the evacuation of residents in the village of Moorland this morning. Two weather systems are on course to collide in the coming days, bringing more than an inch of rain to some areas. The warning came as Prime Minister David Cameron faced growing pressure over the floods. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles last night said an extra £130million was needed for emergency repairs and clean up. He criticised the Environment Agency, saying its chairman, Labour peer Chris Smith, was wrong to suggest the countryside would have to be sacrificed to protect urban areas. ‘We will work to defend both town and country,’ Mr Pickles said. Lord Smith has faced criticism for the quango’s decision to stop dredging rivers in flood-prone areas. After claiming that Britain must choose between saving ‘the town or country’, he is sure of a vocal welcome from locals, many of whom have called for him to resign. King Canute, pictured right, also known as Canute the Great, lived between 985 and 1035. Although Danish he was King of Denmark, England, Scotland and Norway at the same time. Canute's claim to the throne of England was initially rejected by this country's noblemen so he returned home. There raised an army of more than 10,000 men and in 1016 launched an invasion force that sailed up the Thames. According to legend he believed himself to be so powerful his command could hold back the tide. He tested this theory by having his throne placed on the shore where he vainly tried to command the tides back until he nearly drowned. However, some historians argue the demonstration was proof of his wisdom in showing courtiers he was not taken in by their flattery. After his death Canute was buried in the Old Minster at Winchester. However, during the English Civil War, his coffin was among those smashed by parliamentarian soldiers and his bones scattered. His bones remain at Winchester Cathedral but are intermingled with those of other deceased English kings.","Builder Sam Notaro bought the land and started building his house four years ago with his partner Alana O'Dell .

The grieving mother of a teenage meningitis victim says more could have been done to save her daughter’s life after paramedics took two hours to get her to hospital. Stephanie Sanpher, 13, collapsed on January 31 after staying off school with a sore throat. Her mother Joanne, 36, saw red marks on her body and called an ambulance when she started to vomit. A rapid response car arrived at their home in Dersingham, Norfolk, after four minutes - but an ambulance did not turn up until 84 minutes after the 999 call, Ms Sanpher says. Ms Sanpher says by the time the ambulance arrived, Stephanie, who had epilepsy, was critically ill and medics at hospital could not save her. She said: ‘They didn’t help her in time and that left her brain damaged. ‘The hospital did a great job, but it was too late by the time she got to the hospital, she was already brain damaged.’ She added: ‘We loved her so much. She was absolutely our world. She was the most kind and understanding girl. ‘She never judged anybody, was just an angel and no trouble. She loved the TV series Hollyoaks and the band, One Direction. ‘She was one of those girls that everybody loves. She could go into a room full of strangers and they would immediately take to her.’ Stephanie’s brother Alex, 10, said his sister was ‘always helpful and played games’ with him. An East of England Ambulance Service Trust (EEAST) spokesman confirmed it had a call from Stephanie’s mother at 12:07pm but says it has not received a formal complaint from her. Ms Sanpher says a rapid response car was on the scene within four minutes but an ambulance did not arrive until 1.31pm. Stephanie's mother, Joanne, says Stephanie had already suffered brain damage by the time she reached Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn. Despite their best efforts, doctors were unable to save her . She added that Stephanie did not reach the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, until 2.03pm - two hours after her initial call. The seven mile journey from her house to the hospital takes 13 minutes. The call was classed as ‘red’ - the highest priority. The EEAST’s policy states red calls should be responded to within eight minutes 75 per cent of the time. Early warning signs of bacterial meningitis - the more serious form - include pain in the muscles, joints or limbs, unusually cold hand and feet, shivering and pale or blotchy skin. The next symptoms to develop are often a severe headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and feeling generally unwell. As the condition develops the patient may suffer drowsiness, confusion, fits, a fear of bright lights, a stiff neck, fast breathing and a blotchy red rash that does not fade when a glass is pressed against it. In babies and young children the symptoms include being floppy and unresponsive, becoming irritable and not wanting to be held, unusual crying, vomiting, pale and blotchy skin, loss of appetite, a staring expression and being very sleepy.

Service (CATS) from Great Ormond Street Hospital but she died four days . later. Dr Anthony Marsh, EEAST Chief Executive, said: 'We’re extremely saddened to hear that Stephanie died following her collapse last Friday, and send the family our condolences. 'Our first paramedic on scene did everything possible we would expect from an initial response, but clearly Stephanie’s condition deteriorated and an ambulance should have been with her more quickly for which we apologise. 'The Trust is in the process of recruiting 400 student paramedics and has taken immediate steps to increase ambulance cover in Norfolk.' Cases of bacterial meningitis have halved in the past 25 years but it still affects 3,200 a year. One in ten of those who contract the illness die. Stephanie’s headteacher Jon Goodchild, at Smithdon High School in Hunstanton, Norfolk, said: ‘Stephanie was a kind and caring girl. Staff and students remember her beautiful singing voice and really valued her friendship - she was often the one who would bring a smile to friends’ faces when they needed cheering up, and try to make things better. ‘We are all so very sad and our thoughts are with Stephanie’s family - we can only offer them our most sincere sympathy, love and support.’ The case has been described as an ‘isolated incident’ by Public Health England. Dr Giri Shankar, consultant in communicable disease control at Public Health England Anglia and Essex, said: ‘Parents of children at the school have been advised they are not at an increased risk as a result of this case and should not be absent from school. ‘However, it is important for everyone to be aware of the symptoms of meningitis, particularly in young children. If you notice any of these, seek medical advice straight away.’ Tragedy: Last March three-month-old Bella Hellings died when paramedics took three times the target time to reach her . This incident follows a catalogue of errors and ambulance delays by the EEAST. Last . March three-month-old Bella Hellings died when paramedics took three . times the target time to reach her after getting lost twice and then . stopping en route to refuel. The same month an ambulance took two hours to reach a pensioner who had suffered a fall just four miles away from their base. And in August last year another blunder led to the death of teenager Elouise Keeling, 14, who died when she had an asthma attack on an Army Cadets sports day. On that occasion paramedics took twice the target response time after they drove to the wrong address and a second ambulance had to be sent.

The number of families struggling to pay for their healthcare has come down slightly, but one in five families still struggles to pay for medical bills, federal researchers found. Figures showed that 20.3 per cent of people under 65 are in families that had trouble paying a medical bill during the first half of 2012. The figure was down from 21.7 per cent in the first half of 2011, the National Center for Health Statistics found. Vital signs: The prognosis for affordable healthcare is not looking good, with one in five families struggling . The numbers will be closely scrutinized as the U.S. moves towards healthcare reform. The 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, is designed to get more people covered by health insurance and, in theory, take away some of the financial burdens. In the health statistics study Robin Cohen and colleagues looked at data from national surveys for their report. They excluded people who are 65 or older because they have the right to coverage by Medicare, the federal health insurance plan for the elderly. However, a quarter of those who had public health insurance such as Medicare or Medicaid struggled to pay for their medical care, the survey found. 'In the first 6 months of 2012, among persons under age 65, 36.3 per cent of those who were uninsured, 14 per cent of those who had private coverage, and 25.6 per cent of those who had public coverage were in families having problems paying medical bills,'  the report said. Poor health: Researchers found 14 per cent of the wealthier families still struggled to pay for their medical bills . The figures come after research found last month that people who have cancer diagnosed have a greater risk of bankruptcy, even if they have insurance. The U.S. has one of the highest healthcare costs among developed nations, with about 50 million Americans unable to pay for health insurance, according to the Huffington Post. The study found however, that even those with private healthcare struggled to pay their expenses. While 30 per cent of families who live below the poverty line of $22,350 for a family of four, reported difficulties in paying their medical bills, 14 per cent of families two times over the poverty threshold  also struggled, the report found. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that Obamacare will reduce the number of uninsured people to 27 million by 2023. While it is not designed to replace private health insurance, one of Obamacare's plans is to prevent health insurance companies discriminating against patients with pre-existing conditions. It would allow people who earn just over $15,000 to claim Medicaid and provide tax credits for private healthcare. Coverage: The study shows 36 per cent of uninsured and 14 per cent of privately insured families struggle . Part of the reason why families struggle is because medical procedures and treatment cost far more in the U.S. than in comparable countries. The New York Times found that on average an American pays four times more for a hip replacement  than patients in France or Switzerland, while a Nasonex nasal spray for allergies costs $108 in the U.S. and only $21 in Spain. The high cost of treatment can, in some cases, deter people from seeking help early on which means their health deteriorates and potentially becomes more expensive.","Even those who earn twice the poverty threshold have trouble paying .

But for the rest of us, these beautiful maps reveal the paths trodden by joggers around the world's biggest cities. They were created using the publicly available 'virtual tracks' left by users of the popular Runkeeper app. New York for runners: These maps were created from the publicly available virtual tracks of runners left by the runkeeper app. Many popular fitness apps allow users to record their movement. Dr Yau used the publicly available feeds or people using Runkeeper to create the maps. The data is a complete listing or GPs co-ordinates for each runner or cyclist. Using special software, Dr Lau was able to combine them to create these maps. The maps were built by Dr. Nathan Yau. 'There are many exercise apps that allow you to keep track of your running, riding, and other activities,' he said. 'Record speed, time, elevation, and location from your phone, and millions of people do this, me included. ' He decided that the information was too personal, and wanted to join the individual tracks together. 'However, when we look at activity logs, whether they be our own, from our friends, or from a public timeline, the activities only appear individually.' 'What about all together? Not only is it fun to see, but it can be useful to the data collectors to plan future workouts or even city planners who make sure citizens have proper bike lanes and running paths.' London for runners: The map reveals that the capitals parks are popular destinations, as are the paths along the Thames. Charlotte appears to resemble an insect, with adventurous runners venturing far out of the city centre . Dr Lau says he was inspired by tunning trace maps created by Nikita Barsukov. 'I wondered what the paths looked like for others,' he said. 'A lot of people make their workouts public on a variety of services, so there's definitely accessible data. 'I use RunKeeper for cycling. I sampled from there.' Sydney: Runners tend not to stray outside the city, but still favour seafront routes . Boston: runners again congregate around the sea and riverferont . 'The maps below are what I got, mostly for American cities, but there are a few European cities in there too . 'If there's one quick (and expected) takeaway, it's that people like to run by the water and in parks, probably to get away from cars and the scenery. 'In the smaller inland cities, there seem to be a few high-traffic roads with less running elsewhere.' Miami's map reveals that seafront running is virtually the only kind of running done in the city . Paris is also dominated by its parks for runners, although some attempt the large look through the suburbs. San Francisco's map shows runners heading for the city's sea front, although Golden Gate Park is also a popular route.","Cities most popular routes revealed .

The jailed drug-dealing boss of a clothing racket faces ruin after he and his family were ordered to pay back more than £400,000 of the profits of their criminal enterprises. Mohammed Basit Chaudhry, 26, was convicted last year of running a counterfeit clothing racket and trafficking cannabis after raids on his family home in Chorlton, Manchester. He had boasted of his ill-gotten gains by posing for a picture waving a thick wad of £10 notes, prompting comparisons with the 'Loadsamoney' character played by Harry Enfield in the Eighties. 'Loadsamoney': This picture of Mohammed Basit Chaudhry, left, taken on holiday in Dubai, prompted comparisons with the obnoxious Cockney plasterer created by comedian Harry Enfield in the Eighties, right . The photo - taken on a holiday in Dubai - showed him wearing a gold-striped hooded tracksuit jacket, baseball cap and D&G bag as he pointed at the bundle of cash, said to be worth £20,000. Police found the incriminating picture on Chaudhry's phone after searches at the opulently furnished and newly renovated £200,000 semi-detached home where he lived with his brother and parents. Inquiries revealed the Chaudhrys - who wore expensive clothing, designer watches and holidayed in exotic locations - operated as a crime family. During the investigation police discovered fake clothing worth £250,000 and over seven kilograms of cannabis, which they estimated had a street value of around £70,000. Today Greater Manchester Police said that a financial investigation into the Chaudhrys had found they had made more £2.5million from their rackets. But based on available assets they have available to them now, the family have been ordered to pay back a total of just £423,942.36. Chaudhry faces extra jail time if he fails to pay of his £14,155 share of the proceeds within three months. All the family's properties have already been sold and their leased cars returned.

Raphael and Tamar Altman were found dead on their bed and left a simple one word explanation in a diary - 'departed' The son of a couple who died after making a suicide pact kissed them both goodbye and gave them his blessing. Tai Altman said he knew his parents Raphael, 69, and Tamar, 72, who had been married for 46 years, were going to kill themselves. The coroner at an inquest in Oxford said it was clear the couple, who were both in poor health, had decided to end their lives together in a 'dignified' way. The couple, from Great Milton in Oxfordshire, were found dead in each others arms after drinking poison. They were both supporters of Dignity in Dying, and had marked October 3, 2013 in their diary with the single word - ‘depart’. Their son Mr Altman, 43, with his father's cancer reaching the final stages, he realised the time had come. He said he knew the devoted couple would choose to die together, if they could. The father-of-three from Auldearn, near Inverness, said: 'We spent two days saying goodbye, we got the chance to say everything we wanted to say. 'I told them they had been good parents and I felt honoured to have had them and the values they had given me would be passed to their grandchildren. 'I wanted to give them a feeling that they would leave something tangible behind.' The couple used the same lethal potion provided by Dignitas - the Swiss organisation which helps people end their lives. At this week's inquest, the coroner passed a verdict of death by suicide. The court heard how Mr and Mrs Altman turned down the lights, put on soothing music before pouring the liquid poison into a glass and a bowl. Tai Altman said his father, a former religious education teacher, was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2006 but he enjoyed a good quality of life until a few days before he died. Mrs Altman suffered from diabetes, neuralgia and muscular problems and made it clear to her family she was not prepared to live without her husband. 'On more than one occasion I gave my mother a scenario in which she could stay,' Mr Altman said. Tai Altman said the family spent two days saying goodbye, before he gave his parents - who were both in poor health - his blessing . 'I told her she could move here and be with us and her grandchildren but she was not without her own physical ailments. She wasn’t about to relocate 500 miles. I didn’t argue about it.' He spent two days with his parents at their home in Oxford in October, knowing it would be the last time he would see them alive. 'When my father lost the motor control of his body I knew it was close to the end,' he said. 'I did a lot of crying because I knew what was going to happen. 'We got him out of hospital on the Monday. He couldn’t walk, he couldn’t even feed himself. 'A few days earlier he was able to get up and down the stairs and take care of himself. It was good that happened so quickly. Who would want to spent months and months in pain?' The family went back to Mr Altman’s parent’s home in Oxford and spent the next two days together. 'I had already asked them how they were going to do it,' he said. 'They said it was the same stuff that Dignitas uses, which is a chemical compound. I didn’t have any questions. 'I told them there was nothing I felt I had missed out on in life, there was not a single bit of regret. 'I knew that this was the chance to give them what they wanted. This was what all the talk had been about. 'He was immobile, she couldn’t support him, she couldn’t get him onto a commode. I knew that when I left they would do it soon.' Mr Altman received an email from his father, as planned, telling him to contact their GP. The doctor found the couple dead in their bed at their home in Great Milton, near Wheatley. Her head was resting on his shoulder, her arm over his chest. 'I always knew they were mated for life,' said Mr Altman, a driving instructor. The Altmans with their two children, Tanyah and Tai . 'They were hippies, dad was from Cape Town, mum was a New Yorker. Before they moved to England to raise us they set up a kibbutz, they lived on a Spanish island with other hippies with no running water or electricity. They were free-thinking people with their own mind set.' Mr Altman believes the suicide potion was purchased 'surreptitiously' over the internet. 'I played no part in that,' he said. 'They were big campaigners of the right to die. 'My father gave evidence to a government commission on assisted dying. I understand their beliefs and I am happy to support the right to die.' He added: 'Their send-off could not have been better but we had our fears. 'What if it didn’t work, or it only worked on one of them and dad was left lying there and he couldn’t move. If it had been legal we’d not have had to worry about any of that.' Both Mr and Mrs Altman left a note indicating their plans and a letter to their GP, Dr Lynda Ware, thanking her for her years of care. They emailed both their children and friends, saying their goodbyes. Police called to the couple's home said the room was lit by a soft red light and soothing music was playing. Mr Altman met his wife in the UK and after five years of friendship they became a couple. They had two children, Tai and Tanyah, and ran a glass painting business for 10 years. Mr Altman carried on having chemotherapy and radiotherapy after his diagnosis until last year. As a right-to-die advocate, he gave evidence to the 2012 Government commission on assisted dying. Mr Altman wrote an article in 1999 for Radiance Magazine, a journal for larger women, in which he praised his wife’s shape, calling her his 'fat Aphrodite'. Assistant coroner Peter Clark said the couple had made a careful decision to end their lives in a 'dignified' way.

Flight simulators have come a long way since they were first dreamt up at the turn of the 20th century. The first rudimentary designs quickly evolved from bizarre ‘rocking’ cockpits to the terrifyingly realistic simulators used today. Back in the 1950s, simulators were used to train pilots on some the most technically-challenging aircraft around. The KC-97 flight simulator, built in 1953 was one of eleven ever made. Weighing in at nine tonnes and costing £520,000 ($853,000), the simulator took three technicians to maintain . These incredible images reveal the inner workings of a machine that prepared pilots to fly a  WWII-era KC-97 Stratotanker. Among other things, the KC-97 Stratotanker Simulator was used to perform a mid-air fuel transfer between aircraft. Pilots would spend hours at the controls of this £520,000 ($853,000) simulator before they ever set foot in the real thing, according to a report in The Aviationist. These incredible images reveal the bizarre inner workings of a machine that prepared pilots to fly a prop-driven, WWII-era C-97 Stratotanker . Its four analog computers had to be programmed before each training session via stacks of 'resistance cards' that dictated the behaviour of the simulator's 117 motor-driven resistors . The KC-97 Stratotanker was an aerial refueling tanker variant of the C-97 Stratofreighter . The USAF began operating the KC-97 in 1950 when it  purchased a total of 816  from Boeing. The KC-97 used piston engines, fuelled by aviation gasoline, but it carried jet fuel for its refuelling mission. The KC-97 saw service well into the Vietnam Conflict era. There were 888 C-97s built between 1951 and 1956, 814 of these were modified to KC-97 tankers. Built in 1953, the KC-97 Stratotanker Simulator weighed a nine tonnes, required three technicians to operate and was one of only eleven ever made. The simulator was crammed with a maze of dials, instruments, switches and other gears that would surround the pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer. According to a 1968 National Guard press release, it was used to familiarise flight crews with proper pre-flight checks including take-off procedures, emergency flight operating procedures and fuel management. Its four analog computers had to be programmed before each training session via stacks of ‘resistance cards’ that dictated the behaviour of the simulator's 117 motor-driven resistors. The 1968 release states that the ‘power equipment around the device generates enough heat each hour to warm two small homes.’ This simulator appears to have remained in operation as part of the 128th Air Refuelling Wing of the Air National Guard until the early 1970s. The 128th Air Refuelling Wing still has a dedicated training simulator located on base, though now it is an digital, full motion KC-135R simulator made by Boeing.

A teenager convicted of attempted murder and stealing celebrity chef Guy Fieri's Lamborghini was sentenced to 21 years in prison yesterday. Max Wade, 19, stole the TV cook's $200,000 convertible in a 'Mission-Impossible-style' heist in 2011 in a bid to woo pretty blonde Eva Dedier, then 17. But when she spurned his advances, Wade tried to kill her and her new boyfriend in a failed drive-by shooting a year later. Max Wade, right, is accused of stealing celebrity chef Guy Fieri's car back in March 2011 . The celebrity chef¿s bright-yellow Lamborghini was worth $800,000 and was missing for over 18 months . He was charged in Marin County Superior Court as an adult even though . he was under 18 at the time the crimes were committed, the paper said. The court heard how Wade rappelled into British Motors in 2011 and stole the $200,000 car while it was in the dealership for repairs. Wade . was also found guilty of attempted murder and firing a gun into an . occupied vehicle in an unrelated drive-by shooting of a man who was . dating a girl Wade desired. The man wasn't injured. Marin County prosecutor Yvette . Martinez said Wade had stolen the yellow Lamborghini to impress the girl . and was willing to kill to get her attention. Wade pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. Detectives . testified during the trial that they found the gun used in the . shooting, two assault weapons and shotgun shells, as well as climbing . gear. Fieri, a star of Food . Network, testified during the trial that he had never met Wade and never . gave him permission to drive his car. The . teen made news again last year after at least two people tried to break . into Marin County's juvenile hall with sledgehammers in an unsuccessful . attempt to free him. Authorities . took extra measures to ensure security in the courtroom during the . trial, keeping Wade tethered to a chair bolted to the floor.

Fieri . appeared in court as a witness during the case, testifying for just a . few minutes to confirm that he did not know the teen nor did he give him . permission to take the luxury car out of the dealership. Prosecutors allege that Wade stole the car in a ‘Mission Impossible’-style heist to impress the girl, Eva Dedier, who is now 19. Then in April 2012 he attempted to kill Dedier and her former boyfriend, Landon Wahlstrom, as they sat in Wahlstrom’s truck. That . investigation led authorities to Wade's storage container in Richmond, . where they found the Food Network star's stolen yellow Lamborghini. Fieri told reporters outside of court that he is relieved the ordeal is nearly over. ‘It's been a really crazy story,’ he said. During the 18 month period that the car, Fieri said he constantly received calls from people who had spotted the vehicle being driven around the Bay Area . He had been in Chicago filming his . show ‘Dives, Diners and Drive-ins’ for the Food Network when he heard . the car had been stolen. ‘I thought it was a bad joke,’ Fieri told NBC Bay Area. During the 18 month period that the car, the chef said he constantly received calls from people who had spotted the vehicle. Fieri said he thought Wade’s story would make a great movie. ‘I'm . sorry to see laws get broken,’ Fieri said. ‘This has so many other . facets that are far more important than my car. My car is a very small . portion of it.

Facebook has hit back at a controversial Princeton study that claimed it would 'die like a virus' and lose 80% of its users by 2015. Researchers at the social network say the study is fatally flawed - and turned it on Princeton to prove their point. Using the University's own method, it found Princeton would have no students by 2021. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook CEO: the firm's researchers have hit back at a Princeton study which claimed it will lose 80% of its users by 2015. The team from Princeton claim the social networking site spread 'like an infectious diseases.' They predict its 'decline phase' has already begun - and will be swift, and used methods normally used to study the spread of disease. 'Extrapolating the best ﬁt model into the future suggests that Facebook will undergo a rapid decline in the coming years, losing 80% of its peak user base between 2015 and 2017,' they said. 'The site has 'already reached the peak of its popularity and has entered a decline phase.' To explain why social networks are like infectious diseases, the study pointed to similar research done with ideas. 'Ideas, like diseases, have been shown to spread infectiously between people before eventually dying out, and have been successfully described with epidemiological model,' they say. 'Idea manifesters ultimately lose interest with the idea and no longer manifest the idea, which can be thought of as the gain of “immunity” to the idea.' Mike Develin, Lada Adamic, and Sean Taylor, of Facebook's data team, used the same methods as the original paper to show that Princeton was facing a decline in undergraduates of 50 per cent in the next four years and would have none at all by 2021. 'Like many of you, we were intrigued by a recent article by Princeton researchers predicting the imminent demise of Facebook,' they wrote. 'Of particular interest was the innovative use of Google search data to predict engagement trends, instead of studying the actual engagement trends. 'Using the same robust methodology featured in the paper, we attempted to find out more about this 'Princeton University' - and you won't believe what we found! 'In keeping with the scientific principle 'correlation equals causation,' our research unequivocally demonstrated that Princeton may be in danger of disappearing entirely.' They also used the same logic to show the world will run out of air by 2060. 'We don’t really think Princeton or the world’s air supply is going anywhere soon,' they said. 'We love Princeton (and air).

Former Dallas Cowboys player Josh Brent has been sentenced to just 180 days in prison for a drunk crash that killed his teammate and close friend, Jerry Brown. Brent, 25, who was convicted on Wednesday of vehicular manslaughter, was also handed 10 years probation and a $10,000 fine at his sentencing in Dallas on Friday. He could have been sentenced to up to 20 years in prison for the fiery December 2012 crash. After delivering the sentence, state District Judge Robert Burns scolded Brent for his actions, the Dallas Morning News reported. Sentenced: Former Dallas Cowboys player Josh Brent, pictured before his sentencing on Friday, must serve 180 days in prison for the fiery crash that killed his friend and fellow football player, Jerry Brown . Regret: Brent was convicted of killing his close friend in a 2012 car crash after drinking and driving . 'You are not the first Dallas Cowboy to kill someone with a vehicle, but I hope you’re the last,' the judge said. Brent was charged in a December 2012 . wreck in a Dallas suburb that killed Jerry Brown, a practice squad . linebacker who was Brent's close friend and also a teammate at the . University of Illinois. The two men were headed home from partying with fellow Cowboys at a nightclub when Brent lost control of his Mercedes, causing a fiery accident. Officers who arrived on scene said Brent was seen trying to pull Brown's body from the wreckage. Police say Brent's blood-alcohol level was tested shortly after the crash at 0.18 percent, more than twice the legal limit for drivers in Texas. Guilty: 25-year-old Brent, left, was convicted of . intoxication manslaughter after the drunk-driving crash that killed his . friend and Dallas Cowboys teammate Jerry Brown, right, in December 2012 . Sadness: LaTasha Brent, Brent's mother, is helped from the court after her son's punishment was read . Prosecutors last week argued that the . burly, 320-pound defensive tackle had as many as 17 drinks that night . of the crash and was driving around 110 miles per hour. One . prosecutor, Heath Harris, told jurors in closing arguments: 'This is . almost like a poster child case for intoxication manslaughter.' He and fellow prosecutor, Jason Hermus, had urged the jury to send a message about the seriousness of Brent's crime, saying drunk-driving put the public in danger. Brent's attorneys argued the blood tests . used by police were faulty and that Brent could not have drank nearly . that much. Attorney George Milner said his client was 'guilty of being . stupid behind the wheel of a car,' not drinking beforehand.

James Isted, 27, will serve a minimum of nine years for twice attacking lone women in the graveyard of All Saints Church, Orpington. One was pregnant and lost her child in the attack . A rapist released after a police error was sentenced to life today for striking again in a terrifying identical repeat attack on a pregnant woman who then lost her unborn child. James Isted, 27, will serve a minimum of nine years for twice attacking lone women in the graveyard of All Saints Church, Orpington, after following his victims, aged seventeen and twenty-seven. Isted was arrested the first time for raping a teenager, who he struck over the head before beating - but was not charged. The man, described by the probation service as 'A highly dangerous individual . capable of causing significant harm,  threatened his second victim with a knife and raped her in the same location twenty months later. Married father-of-two Isted, from Orpington was convicted at Croydon Crown Court of two . counts of rape and robbery against the women on September 30, 2011 and . May 7 2013. The construction worker was also convicted of assault by penetration in relation to the second victim and assaulting PC Steve Patterson, with intent to resist arrest. The officer was left with a nasty cut to his hand. Recorder of Croydon Warwick McKinnon sentencing told Isted: 'Very clearly you are a very dangerous . man.' A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: . 'The MPS acknowledges that in this case we made mistakes and we have . apologised to the victim of the second offence. 'Had certain actions been taken earlier, a second offence may have been prevented.' The Met refused to say what mistakes had been made because an internal inquiry is taking place. Both attacks occurred in the churchyard - the first at 2.40am when the lone teen was struck and dragged into the deserted graveyard. She was subjected to a harrowing and lengthy ordeal and Isted left with her handbag, which contained a mobile phone and other personal items. 'She was jumped on from behind and struck,' said prosecutor Mr. Jonathan Polnay. 'She says her life has been destroyed by this.' The court heard the teen immediately moved out of the area and plans to emigrate to the United States as a result of being raped. Isted was sentenced at Croydon Crown Court, pictured. Recorder of Croydon Warwick McKinnon told him today: 'Very clearly you are a very dangerous man.' 'She was walking home in the dead of night, a vulnerable victim,' added Mr Polnay. 'It is also an aggravating feature that the rapes took place in a graveyard, heightening the fear and the ordeal.' The prosecutor submitted the location of the rapes was 'grossly offensive' and insulting to the families of the deceased. He was arrested a few days later on October 4, but was bailed pending further inquiries. Almost two years later, after being told by police there would be no further action, the man raped his second victim at 1.30pm at the same place. A probation officer, who interviewed Isted after he was convicted, wrote: 'Emboldened by the fact the police did not charge him for the first offence he carried out the second offence, believing he would not be detected' It was in the graveyard of All Saint's Church in Orpington (pictured) where Isted attacked his victims . He threatened his victim  - who was pregnant at the time - with a Stanley knife . 'He knew she was pregnant at the time, but continued to rape her,' explained Mr. Polnay. 'She told him she was pregnant. 'A Stanley knife was used and not only did she see it, he used it to cut parts of her clothing and threatened to cut her hair, being paranoid about DNA.' This time a witness reported the  daylight attack and Isted was arrested after a short police chase in possession of the victim’s bank card and jewellery, including her engagement ring and another ring.","James Isted, 27 will serve a minimum of nine years for the two rapes .

Virginia State Senator Creigh Deeds has broken his silence about the terrifying moment his son attacked him before shooting himself dead last year. He recounted how he had been feeding his horses when his son Gus, 24, awoke on November 19 - the morning after he had been turned away from state-run psychiatric care - and went outside to see his father. 'I turned my back... and he was just on me,' Deeds, 56, told CBS in an interview that partially aired on Thursday night and will air in full on Sunday. But Deeds, who has visible scars on his from the brutal knife attack, refused to blame his 'perfect son' for the incident, and instead said the system had failed him. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Creigh Deeds has broken his silence about the moment his 24-year-old son Gus stabbed him last November before shooting himself dead. Scars are visible on the Virginia senator's face . 'I really don't want Gus to be defined by . his illness,' he said. 'I don't want Gus to be defined by what . happened on the 19th. Gus was a great kid. He was a perfect son. It's . clear the system failed. It's clear that it failed Gus. It killed Gus.' Gus, a talented musician and top student at William and Mary, was diagnosed as bipolar when he was 21, and last November his father became worried he would kill himself. He gained a court order to take his son to the emergency room to check him into a psychiatric ward, but the court order expired after six hours. In that time, staff had not been able to find him a bed. So instead, he was simply sent home with his father. 'I was concerned that if he came home, there was going to be a crisis,' Deeds said. Together: Gus Deeds, pictured left in 2009 with his father, had been diagnosed as bipolar when he was 21 . Close: Deeds' son Gus was a prominent fixture on his failed gubernatorial campaign in 2009, pictured . Deeds woke up the next . day expecting his son to be upset, but he never could have imagined the . violent scene that followed. 'I got ready for work, and I went out to . the barn to feed the horses, and Gus was coming across the yard and... I said, ""Hey, bud, how'd you sleep?""' he recounted. 'He said, ""Fine."" 'I turned my . back and... had this feed thing in my hands . and he was just on me... He got me twice.' In fact, Deeds suffered 10 stab wound, including those to his face. Following the frenzied attack, Deeds stumbled into the road where he was found by a neighbor and rushed to hospital. But his son returned to the house and shot himself dead. The full interview detailing the attack will air on CBS on Sunday. Rural: The attack took place in Deeds' Millboro, . Virginia home, pictured.

Gus and his father were said to have had a close relationship, and he was a fixture on his dad's failed gubernatorial campaign in 2009.

Martin Olujosun, 22, initially claimed to have acted in self defense after lashing out at senior examiner Darral Gregory - splintering a bone in his shoulder and leaving him in immense pain and unable to work. At Medway Magistrates' Court he pleaded guilty to threatening behaviour and common assault and was spared jail, instead receiving an 18-month suspended sentence. Martin Olujosun, 22, took his driving test at the Gillingham Driving Test Centre, but when he had failed, he took it out on staff . The confrontation came about after examiners at the test centre in Gillingham, Kent told Olujosun he had failed his driving test. When told his complaints would have to be put in writing Olusojun started swinging wildly in Mr Gregory's face. As he tried to defend himself Mr Gregory grabbed Olujosun’s jumper and fell into some chairs. Olujosun, of Woolwich, south east London, continued his attack and elbowed the examiner in the face before pushing him over again. Other examiners tried to come to Mr Gregory’s aid as other learner drivers waiting to take their tests at the centre in Gillingham, Kent watched in horror.

And the mother-of-two was so determined that she refused to let a potentially life-threatening allergy to animals get in the way of owning her own veterinary practice. The 38-year-old faces a daily battle against sneezing and spluttering, sticking to a rigorous timetable of medications to help ease her symptoms. But carrying out a routine examination on a dog, cat or rabbit can render the vet incapacitated, fighting to breathe and suffering from a painful skin rash. Vet Tanya Crawley faces a daily battle against a potentially life-threatening allergy to animals . Every day is a fight against the allergy, with Ms Crawley keeping a ready supply of antihistamines and inhalers close to hand. Despite the constant battle, Ms Crawley refuses to let her allergy get in the way of the job she loves. She said: 'Being a vet is part of who I am - I have never even considered doing anything else. 'I’ve known that I’ve been allergic to cat and dogs from a fairly young age, and the rabbit allergy seemed to develop a few years ago. 'It can be hard sometimes but as long as I’m careful and ensure I have good hand hygiene, then I get along fine. 'I am most allergic to rabbits, so if I feel like my airways are starting to close up I’ll just step outside and take a few puffs on my inhaler. 'It would probably be better for me to wear gloves and a mask when I’m treating an animal, but I don’t think it’s fair on them - a mask can look quite scary and you can’t examine them properly with gloves on. So severe is the 38-year-old's allergy, that a routine examination can leave her fighting to breathe and with a painful skin rash . The mother-of-two is particularly allergic to rabbits. She keeps a ready supply of antihistamines and inhalers close at hand to keep her symptoms at bay . 'Sometimes I’m snuffly during a consulation, but I assure the owners I’m not contagious. The animals are never put in in any danger, so I’ll keep going for as long as I can - I just love my job.' Ms Crawley first discovered she was allergic to animals when her family took a dog home from Battersea Dogs Home. She said: 'When I was a child I went to Battersea with my dad and my sister and we came home with a dog. 'It was common in those days to be allergy tested and shortly after I found out I was allergic to a few animals. 'I remember playing with my friend’s kitten, Jellicoe, and after she had scratched me a little, as all kittens do, my skin erupted in red wheals. 'My allergies are constantly changing and evolving - I think I’ve recently developed an allergy to fleas. It starts with an itch in my nose, and I can tell as soon a pet with fleas walks into the room. 'I’d say I’m allergic to pretty much all of the animals that I treat on a regular basis. 'Once I had to treat a giant rabbit and in the car on my way home I really started to struggle to breathe. 'I stepped out of my car and nearly had to call an ambulance - it was really scary. This is when I first realised that I had developed an allergy to rabbits and that I’d need to control it. 'Rabbits are by far the worst - after I’ve seen about three or four rabbits in a row I’ll need to take some time out.' But despite her serious allergies, Ms Crawley, who runs the veterinary practice at Companion Care Vets in Swindon, continues to be dedicated to her profession and refuses to let them get in the way of delivering the best patient care that she can. Ms Crawley first discovered she was allergic to animals when, as a child, her family picked up a dog from Battersea Dogs Home . 'I take antihistamines most days, and I have to have my inhalers with me at all times, in case of emergency. 'Most owners wouldn’t know I have these allergies, as I manage to control them so well. 'If I know I’ve got a particularly heavy day - especially with lots of rabbits then I’ll take extra medication. 'I also have a fantastic team around me that support me and would know what to do if I had an . extreme reaction.' But whilst Tanya battles on through her allergies, she often finds them frustrating. She said: 'To be honest I just find them a bit annoying. 'It just irritates me and I hate getting wheezy because I can barely speak. I find it a bit embarrassing but I just try not to think about it most of the time.' But despite her allergies, being a vet has always been a dream of Tanya’s. She added: 'I have never wanted to do anything other than being a vet. 'As a little girl, when my friends were saying they wanted to be princesses and fairies when they grew up, I always wanted to be a vet. 'All my soft toys were animals and I absolutely adored our family pets. But Ms Crawley refuses to let the allergy get in the way of her dream. She said: Being a vet, allergies or not, is part of being me, I just love it' 'I just love animals - the bond that you can have with a pet is just incredible, and I love that I can be there for an animal, and find out what’s wrong with them when they could never tell you themselves - I give them a voice. 'I knew that I’d run into some difficulty being a vet, but I can control my allergies with medications and inhalers, so I’ll keep going for as long as I can. 'I have never thought about doing anything else. Despite the constant challenges, the lack of rest breaks, the long hours, and my allergies, I just love being a vet. I wouldn’t swap it for anything. 'I spend most of my down time working, either talking to anxious owners or tending to one of the many abandoned pets that come to us.

Nasa's Curiosity rover has been looking back at its home planet - and even send a picture back. The amazing image reveals the Earth and the moon in the far distance. It was taken as controllers prepare to send to rover on a risky mission to climb a large sand dune. Can you spot home? This view of the twilight sky and Martian horizon taken by NASA's Curiosity Mars rover includes Earth as the brightest point of light in the night sky.

The unique view of the twilight sky and Martian horizon taken by NASA's Curiosity Mars rover includes Earth as the brightest point of light in the night sky. Earth is a little left of center in the image, and our moon is just below Earth. Researchers used the left eye camera of Curiosity's Mast Camera (Mastcam) to capture this scene about 80 minutes after sunset on the 529th Martian day, or sol, of the rover's work on Mars on Jan 31st. 'A human observer with normal vision, if standing on Mars, could easily see Earth and the moon as two distinct, bright 'evening stars,' the space agency said. 'A human observer with normal vision, if standing on Mars, could easily see Earth and the moon as two distinct, bright 'evening stars,' the space agency said. However, curiosity is not the first rover to photograph home from the red planet. That honour goes to the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit one hour before sunrise on the 63rd martian day, or sol, of its mission. The image is a mosaic of images taken by the rover's navigation camera showing a broad view of the sky, and an image taken by the rover's panoramic camera of Earth. The contrast in the panoramic camera image was increased two times to make Earth easier to see. This is the first image ever taken of Earth from the surface of a planet beyond the Moon, taken by the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit ion 2004 . Mission controllers were today set to give its Curiosity rover its toughest assignment yet - attempting to drive over a 1m high dune. Mission controllers say the route, despite the dune, is far safer. They were concerned their planned route was filled with sharp rocks that could damage the rover's wheels. Will it make it? Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover is set to drive west and attempt to climb the 1m high dune in the foreground of this picture. Curiosity is on a southwestward traverse of many months from an area where it found evidence of ancient conditions favorable for microbial life to its long-term science destination on the lower slopes of Mount Sharp. Based on analysis of images taken from orbit by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a location dubbed 'Dingo Gap' was assessed as a possible gateway to a favorable route for the next portion of the traverse. A final decision on whether to pass through this valley will ride on evaluation of a short drive planned this week toward the top of the dune that lies across 'Dingo Gap.' 'The decision hasn't been made yet, but it is prudent to go check,' said Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., project manager for Curiosity. Recent close-up pictures reveal multiple punctures, rips and dimples in Curiosity's metal 'tyres'. 'We'll take a peek over the dune into the valley immediately to the west to see whether the terrain looks as good as the analysis of orbital images implies.' The dune is about 3 feet (1 meter) high at its center, tapered off at both sides of the gap between two low scarps. Recent close-up pictures reveal multiple punctures, rips and dimples in Curiosity's metal 'tyres'. The track pattern â€” dot-dash-dash-dash, dot-dash-dash-dot, dot-dash-dot-dot ('.--- .--. .-..') â€” spells out 'JPL' in Morse code, which translates letters and numbers into a series of short (""dot') and long ('dash') signals. Another image revealing the dune Curiosity is attempting to climb . 'We have intentionally put holes in the wheels to leave a unique track on Mars,' Nasa said. 'So if we are in sand dunes where we don't have lots of rock features around us, we can use those patterns to do our visual odometry.' The agency is taking no chances after Nasa's Spirit rover was lost in a sand trap in 2009 . A color view assembled from images taken by Curiosity's Mast Camera (Mastcam) on the east side of the dune shows details of the valley that the rover may traverse this month. This mosaic of images from the Navigation Camera (Navcam) on NASA's Mars rover Curiosity shows the terrain to the west from the rover's position on the 528th Martian day, or sol, of the mission (Jan. 30, 2014). NASA's Mars Science Laboratory Project is using Curiosity to assess ancient habitable environments and major changes in Martian environmental conditions. JPL, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, built the rover and manages the project for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.","Dune is 1m high, and located in 'Dingo Gap' on the Martian surface .

Police . were called to the Blackburn branch of the DIY giant and Brown, who is married and whose wife Eileen is standing by him, was stopped as he went to leave the store, saying: 'I'm sorry, am I in the s*** now?', the prosecutor said. It . emerged that the father-of-one from Accrington, Lancashire, had filmed a number of women over a period of a month after taking medication which gave him 'hypersexuality.' Today Brown, who told police: 'It got to be a habit', pleaded guilty . to outraging public decency following the incidents between April and . May last year. Prosecutor . Cathy Allan said: 'The defendant was in B&Q. A staff member saw the . defendant described as fixated on an unknown female wearing a very . short summer dress. 'He . approached her, right up next to her, so close it was believed he was . going to collide with her. He placed his foot near the back of her shoe. 'He . then approached another woman and moved to place an item on his shoe . before moving his foot outstretched. She walked off unaware. When he . went to leave the store he was detained.' Miss . Allan said Brown had filmed a video looking up at females' skirts, and there was further video footage on his phone showing other videos he had made the same way between 11 April 2013 and 18 . May 2013. She added: 'When arrested he told police it had ""got to be a habit"". It is described as 'upskirting'. Defence lawyer Richard Prew said Brown was 'utterly distraught' at what he had done. He added: 'He is 62, no previous convictions, never known to the police . and courts and was leading a law-abiding lifestyle. 'He . was on a high dose of medication and had taken a higher dose than he . should have done. One of the side effects was hypersexuality - although . it in no way excuses what he did. 'The . behaviour was completely out of character. The victims were unaware of . his actions and have never been identified. Shop: Brown was spotted by a security guard standing near women at the Blackburn branch of B&Q . 'The defendant quite candidly . said that if this had happened to his wife of daughter he would have . been absolutely distraught himself.' Mr Prew said Brown had sought counselling, and was now on a lower dose of the medication - which wasn't named - which was proved to cause the problem. He added: 'There . is no public interest in sending him to prison today. The experience he . has had to go through, whilst taking nothing away from the victims has . been a salutary lesson to him.'

The technology can identify a customer before showing the hostess their flight information and more . The Google Glass trial is designed to create a more personalised service on Virgin flights, yet Virgin Atlantic also asked 10,000 passengers what they wanted most from the airline. More space and bigger windows was the most popular demand, with 60 per cent of people claiming this would improve their flight experience. On-board Wi-Fi came second with 55 per cent, while a third would prefer personalised menus ordered in advance. In the UK, 41 per cent of passengers said their favourite thing about flying is the in-flight entertainment system. Worldwide, only Japanese passengers said that they prefer the free drinks (47 per cent) over in-flight entertainment (39 per cent). The technology then immediately begins checking that passenger in, and can update the hostess on travel information, weather and events at the customer's destination. This personalised service can also store preferences for future trips. Virgin Atlantic is trialling the scheme for the next six weeks at Heathrow's Terminal Three, and if successful, the initiative may be rolled to other lounges and airports. Google Glass has already proved useful in other industries, including interior design and medicine. At the end of last year, a surgeon at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Centre spent almost four months using Google Glass during operations. Dr Pierre Theodore used the display on the wearable technology to see X-ray scans without having to leave the room, or consult a separate chart.

Elsewhere, Dr Christopher Kaeding performed knee-ligament surgery while wearing Google Glass in Ohio last September, and broadcast the operation to students at Ohio State University. Architects and interior designers have also been developing ways of using the technology to help plan and virtually decorate houses. ColorSnap Glass, for example, is a free app that uses the device’s built-in camera with Ohio-based paint group Sherwin Williams' colour recognition technology.

Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning says he has no plans to quit the NFL even if he wins his second Super Bowl on Sunday. Manning, 37, has so far thrown a record breaking season of 55 touchdown passes and 5,447 yards, and will make history as the only quarterback to win Super Bowl titles with separate teams if the Denver Broncos beat the Seattle Seahawks. But the quarterback has denied speculation that he might quit while he's ahead, telling a press conference that he still enjoys the game and has no plans for a swift exit. Scroll down for video . Peyton Manning, 37, has said he has no plans to retire, even if the Denver Broncos win on Sunday . Speaking to Associated Press, he said: 'I think when you still enjoy the preparation and the work part of it, then you probably still ought to be doing that. 'I think as soon as I stop enjoying it, if I can't produce, if I can't help a team, that's when I'll stop. 'If that's next year, maybe it is, but I certainly want to continue to keep playing.' Manning previously won the Super Bowl in 2006 with the Indianapolis Colts, but following 14 season with the team he underwent surgery on a herniated disc in his spine, an injury which nearly cost him his career. If the Broncos are victorious, Manning will make history as the first quarterback to win the title with two separate teams. He won with the Indianapolis Colts in 2006 . The disc had been pressing on a nerve, and after the surgery he discovered his right tricep was very weak, and he was unable to grip properly with his right hand. The disc herniated again, and Manning went in for a second operation, before being dropped by the Colts and having to build his career up again. Now, with two vertebrae fused together, he is stronger than ever, and luckily for the Broncos Manning also hinted that he may be staying put. Manning has thrown a record-breaking season so far, with 5 touchdown passes and 5,447 yards . He added: 'In two years I feel like we've seen a lot, as far as on the field situations, weather, crowd noise, you name it, so I do feel comfortable.' Super Bowl XLVIII will take place on Sunday at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, in front of 82,500 fans.

This shocking photograph shows how a defenceless elderly woman was left with multiple head injuries after she was brutally beaten over the head with a doorstop in her own home. Retired English teacher Jean Taylor, 76, was left covered in blood after the prolonged assault by the thug who ransacked her home in Bristol and stole £100. Miss Taylor had a polite conversation with the attacker for several minutes on her doorstep before he forced his way into her home and hit her over the head with the cat-shaped, pottery doorstop. Horrifying: Jean Taylor, 76, was beaten over the head with a doorstop after a thug made his way into her house . Doorstop: She was hit over the head with pottery cat which would have looked similar to this . Then, as she lay in agony on the floor, he began to throw rubbish at her. Mrs Taylor - who uses a walking stick to get around - required sitches and glue in the aftermath of the attack. She has been left traumatised by the horrifying encounter and  is still receiving treatment for bruised ribs and hands . The grammar school teacher of 40 years described the attacker as 'pure evil' and said: 'It was mid-afternoon when he rang the bell. He looked quite pleasant and he was to begin with. 'He was just making conversation about general things and talking about people moving in and out of the street. 'He said something about a cat. I said ""my cat’s upstairs in bed"" and when I turned away he pushed me on the floor. I thought I was going to die, I really did. 'I think he hit me with my door stop - a pottery cat - because it was something very hard and it’s not in the house any more. 'He just kept hitting me and I . thought he was going to break my skull. I just didn’t know why he did . it - it was awful. If you had seen his face it was pure evil. 'Then he started making a mess, throwing rubbish at me. It was like a disaster area.

Shock: Kirsty Tierney-Jones was given a parking fine despite driving to the A&E with severe pain and bleeding while pregnant with baby Alice-Neve . A pregnant woman who drove herself to A&E when she though she was losing the second of her twin babies has been fined for parking at the hospital without a ticket. Kirsty Tierney-Jones, 33, rushed to Queen's Hospital in Romford at 5am on October 18 with severe pain and bleeding after falling over at home while 38 weeks pregnant. Despite suffering the same symptoms that had already claimed the life of one of her twin babies 24 weeks earlier, Mrs Tierney-Jones, from Hornchurch in Essex, was given a parking ticket and threatened with court action if she did not pay out. Upon arriving at the hospital by herself at 5am, Mrs Tierney-Jones was helped from her car and into A&E by an elderly couple. She left her vehicle in a space at the flagship hospital’s car park, but there was no time for her to purchase a ticket from a pay-and-display machine. Mrs Tierney-Jones had been struck down by hyperemesis gravidarum, which causes nausea and vomiting, and which had already claimed the life of one of her twins at just 14 weeks. It was the same devastating condition suffered by the Duchess of Cambridge, who was taken into hospital at the beginning of her pregnancy with Prince George. Mrs Tierney-Jones, who lost a stone-and-a-half as she battled the illness, later gave birth to a healthy baby girl, Alice-Neve. But she was shocked to receive a £75 parking fine several weeks after her terrifying visit to A&E. Mrs Tierney-Jones appealed to Gemini Parking Solutions, which runs the hospital’s parking payments system, on January 23 of this year. But the company initially refused to waive the fine and even threatened to take legal action against her if she did not make the payment. Emergency: Upon arriving at the hospital by herself at 5am, Mrs Tierney-Jones left her vehicle in a space in the hospital's car park (pictured), but there was no time to purchase a pay-and-display ticket . Mrs Tierney-Jones said: 'It’s absolutely disgusting - my child’s life was at risk and they still want to fine me.' 'My baby could have died... I had already lost her sibling', she added. She went on to say: 'It would have been different if it was an appointment but this was an emergency.' A spokesman Gemini Parking Solutions claims the company has since cancelled the parking ticket after local newspaper The Romford Recorder intervened on her behalf. The practice of charging hospital patients for car parking has long been controversial. Branded a 'tax on the sick' by campaigners, many hospitals rake in millions of pounds in profit every year, with a study by the Health and Social Care Information Centre last year finding some NHS organisations charge almost three times the national average for non-hospital parking spaces. Some of the worst affected by parking charges are people who have to visit hospitals regularly, including cancer patients, those with sick children and people visiting relatives in intensive care. Although it is down to each individual hospital to set its own charges, the NHS explicitly advises them to offer 'fair and appropriate concessions' for patients forced to pay disproportionate sums. However some hospitals, including the Royal Free London Foundation Trust, the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Foundation Trust and the Countess of Chester Hospital Foundation Trust are still charging patients a base rate of £3-an-hour to park, rising much higher when the stay is for several hours or days. According to its website, Queen's Hospital in Romford, where Mrs Tierney-Jones had treatment, charges patients £1.20 an hour, rising to £18 to stay in its multi-storey car park for 12 hours. Disabled blue badge holders are allowed to park for free outside the main entrance when displaying their permit, but they too must pay to park in the multi-storey car park. There are, however, concessions for people visiting the hospital if they are visiting a relative who is expected to die, next-of-kins or birthing partners visiting a labour ward, or inpatients facing treatment for either less than seven days, or for between 14 and 21 days. Cancer patients visiting the hospital regularly for treatment have to pay for parking, but they may be reimbersed at a later date at the discretion of a matron or senior sister.","Kirsty Tierney-Jones, 33 drove to A&E fearing she was about to lose baby .

Four rare white lion cubs born in a UK safari park have been sent to perform in a Japanese circus after being trained in a British facility. The cubs were born at West Midlands Safari Park, in Bewdley, Worcester, in 2008 but will spend their adult lives entertaining crowds in the Far East. Animal rights charities have expressed outrage after discovering they were flown 6,000 miles to Japan’s Circus Kinoshita. Scroll down for video . Pictured are white lions, who were born in the same set as those at West Midlands Safari Park who were sent to Japan . The safari park has been criticised for providing four rare white lion cubs to a businessman who provided them to a Japanese circus . It is understood one of the lions has since moved to a zoo in western Japan after it developed a nervous condition which caused its mane to fall out. The animals were given to British businessman Jim Clubb who runs Amazing Animals, which also goes by the name Heythrop Zoological Gardens, in Chipping Norton, Oxon. Undercover video footage taken by Captive Animals’ Protection Society (CAPS) and Lion Aid taken in 2010 appears to show Clubb training the lion cubs during an open day at his firm.

CAPS discovered one of the lions has been moved to a zoo in the west of . the country after it was attacked by the other circus animals. The lion is reported to have developed a 'nervous disease called autonomic ataxia' causing his mane to completely fall out. Animal rights campaigners have criticised the safari park for allowing the lions to end up in a circus. The four cubs were among eight  born at West Midlands Safari Park in Bewdley in 2008 and sent to Amazing Animals of Chipping Norton, Oxon, aged six months . Undercover footage appears to show Amazing Animals owner Jim Clubb training the lions now in Japan's Circus Kinoshita . CAPS director Liz Tyson said: 'The current Government has promised an outright ban on the use of wild animals in circuses as a result of overwhelming public, expert and parliamentary support. 'And yet here we have a zoo apparently providing lion cubs to this cruel and unethical trade via a middleman, whilst publicising their work to their paying visitors as based in conservation and welfare. 'It is an appalling betrayal of those people that trust the zoo to protect and care for the animals. 'But most importantly, it is an appalling betrayal of the lion cubs who appear to have been abandoned to this hopeless fate by West Midland Safari Park.' An investigation by CAPS claim the safari park has close ties with Clubb’s animal entertainment business.

But Potts, commercial manager on the customer service desk at the Altrincham branch in Greater Manchester, failed to hand over the £200 after it was collected in a bucket in the staff canteen. Instead she repeatedly fobbed off the serviceman’s grandmother and came up with various excuses when she was later asked about the cash three months after the collection. An embarrassed colleague eventually paid the money himself after being told by Potts to take the cash out of the till. The serviceman’s family passed the money to the Help for Heroes charity. Police were called in and discovered Potts carried out 254 cash refunds worth £5,000 between March 2010 and February 2011 when customers were not present during the transactions. Potts - who had worked for Sainsburys for 25 years - would log in to tills for just a few minutes at a time and often put through refunds - mainly for bottles of wine - at a rate of more than one every 30 seconds, often billing more than £100 in less than 15 minutes. She had also held onto £70 which had been given to her by colleagues towards a works trip to London. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Potts, from Bowdon, was found guilty of two counts of fraud and two counts of theft. But she was cleared of actually stealing the money earmarked for the soldier. Judge Bernard Lever told her: 'It was your job to check that other people didn’t steal money, not to steal money yourself. That is what makes this such a flagrant breach of trust case. 'It wasn’t the amount of money that was important but you took the bucket and got the cashier to change it into notes and the despicable thing was that you held on to that money. 'The grandmother repeatedly asked you where the money was and you fobbed them off. Police were called to the Sainsbury's store in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, pictured, where Potts worked after she failed to hand over £200 donations for an injured soldier. Officers then discovered she had carried out hundreds of cash donations without a customer present . 'It can’t be said that you stopped them getting the £200 but it was no thanks to you that they eventually got it. You did everything in your power to delay them getting the money. 'Your disgrace has been very public owing to the delay in paying of the money for the young man who was injured in Afghanistan. 'If it hadn’t been for your despicable behaviour I might have contemplated suspending this term. But it is wrong and impossible for me to do so having regard to this case in the round.' The court heard how store worker Patricia Harrison, who worked on the Deli counter at Sainsbury's, took a week off work when she learned in December 2010 that her soldier grandson Jason had been hurt. She said she learned about the collection when she returned to work at the store, where she had been employed for nine years. Staff had placed a collection bucket in the canteen and raised about £200. Suspicions began after Potts took the bucket and got the cashier to change it into notes before taking the money to her office. In court: Potts was cleared of stealing the donations for the soldier but found guilty at Minshull Street Crown Court of committing theft and fraud at the Sainsbury's store where she worked . During . the court case Mrs Harrison, whose husband David also worked at the . store, told the jury: 'I had to keep going to Alison Potts and ask when . she was going to give me the collection money. 'I didn’t like to ask, ""Have you got the money?"" I did say ""I believe there’s a collection"" and she said ""I’ve got to count it"". She used to say ""I’ll see you tomorrow"" or ""I’ll see you next week"". She did say, ""I’ve got to count it"".' Asked how often she had asked about . the collection, Mrs Harrison replied: 'It was quite a few times' and . added: 'People in the store thought I had already got the collection . money and they were shocked when they found out so many weeks . afterwards. 'I must have asked her at least 12 times but there was always some excuse.' Another . member of staff, Phil Walker, told the jury he had approached Mrs Potts . about the collection and she had told him to ‘get it out of the till’. Staff . told senior managers at Sainsbury’s about their concerns and Potts who . had worked for the company for 25 years was suspended. She has since . left the company. Potts . said she had been keeping the collection bucket in her locker and had . not produced the cash because the fundraising was ‘ongoing’. She . said: 'It was not hidden. I was waiting for donations from members of . the night staff who had told me they wanted to contribute. I took the . collection bucket away because it didn’t need to stay out.' In . mitigation defence counsel, Miss Rachel Faux said: 'She is a respected . member of the family and has shown a great deal of kindness and in that . context it can be said these offences come out of character. 'There . is a history of personal difficulty she has had against a background of . family tragedy and her own mental and emotional stability. 'Things have been sent to her address as well as deliberately targeted junk mail. She has felt hugely punished by her involvement but she looks forward with a sense of determination to get back and re-establish her reputation as a trusted member of the community who has much to give.' A Sainsbury’s spokesman said: 'We regard any crime of this nature very seriously and have robust processes in place to prevent such activities occurring.'","Alison Potts, 51, was entrusted .

The schoolgirl who ran away with jailed teacher Jeremy Forrest has reportedly written three 'love notes' to him in prison saying she wants to get back together with him when he is freed. Forrest, 31, is currently serving a five-and-a-half year sentence for sexual offences and abduction after fleeing to France with the girl when she was just 15. According to reports, the girl, now 16, has sent Forrest three letters saying she still cares for him and wants to rekindle their relationship. However, when authorities at Ashfield prison in Bristol refused to let him read the messages, he complained - apparently prompting him to be moved to the remote Dartmoor jail. The schoolgirl, who cannot be named, is pictured with her teacher Jeremy Forrest aboard a Channel ferry as they head to France in September last year . The decision by prison bosses to prevent Forrest from reading the letters came after social workers banned the girl - who cannot be named for legal reasons - from speaking to him until she is 18. The disgraced teacher, . who was told the letters had been sent, . is understood to have complained to prison authorities, demanding to know if they had broken the rules by confiscating the letters without having . carried out a risk assessment. A source told The Sun: 'The girl has written three letters to him, which have been taken. She . wants to be in contact with him. 'They are about wanting to be with him. They are warm messages to him. They're not dumping letters. She wants to continue a relationship with him.' Forrest has reportedly complained to prison authorities after they refused to let him read the letters . Forrest's family believe that the decision to move him from Ashfield to Dartmoor is a direct result of the row over the letters, after he demanded to know whether the correct procedures had been followed when prison chiefs withheld the notes from him. It had previously been reported that the schoolgirl had 'dumped' the teacher after finding a boyfriend her own age, but then broke up with her new lover because she still had feelings for Forrest. The Prison Service has refused to comment on the reports of the girl's love letters. Forrest triggered an international manhunt last summer when he fled with the . girl. He had groomed her when she was one of his 14-year-old pupils . at Bishop Bell School in Eastbourne, East Sussex. After . taking her virginity one week after her 15th birthday in his marital . home, they left for France, using the names Jack Dean and Gemma Grant. At . first, the girl’s devastated family feared she had been kidnapped but . soon after CCTV footage showed her with her arms around her teacher on . board a ferry from Dover to Calais. They were on the run for eight days before being found in Bordeaux where he was arrested in front of her. He was convicted of child abduction and five counts of sexual activity with a child at Lewes Crown Court in June. The girl has reportedly confided in friends that she is desperate to speak to the former teacher. She had previously claimed in interviews that she wanted to have his children and would wait for him until he was released from prison. Forrest . began his relationship with the girl on a school trip to Los Angeles . when she was 14 and was seen holding her hand on the plane – something . she claims he was doing to comfort her as she was struggling with . bulimia. She opened up to . him about the break-up of her parents’ marriage before he kissed her in a . classroom. She said they would have sex in his Ford Fiesta or hotels, . which they would check into as Mr and Mrs Forrest. Forrest, 31, has been moved from Bristol's Ashfield jail to the remote Dartmoor Prison (pictured) After . Forrest was jailed, she said: ‘I love Jeremy so much. I don’t want . anyone else. I want to spend the rest of my life with him and maybe once . he’s out, we can marry and have children.’ The college student, now 16, claimed she instigated their escape to France, adding: ‘If anything, I groomed him.’ Forrest, who will have to sign the sex offenders’ register for life, has been divorced by his wife, Emily, 32, after she cited 'unreasonable behaviour' in divorce papers. The former couple are believed to have sold the family home and divided the proceedings.","Forrest, 31,  was jailed for five-and-a-half years for abducting the girl .

Three ski workers were missing tonight and dozens of others injured after fire swept through an Alpine resort hugely popular with British holidaymakers. A 64-year-old woman was among those badly hurt after she jumped from the sixth floor of a burning tourist hostel in Val d'Isere, in eastern France. Called ‘Les jardins de la Balme’ (The Gardens of Balme), the residence is used by mainly young workers, many of them from the UK. Blaze: Firemen are working to extinguish the fire that broke out on the hostel in Val d'Isere, French Alps . All of the missing were last seen on the top floor of the wooden building, but local officials said there was no sign of them. ‘There is no news about the three people - we don't know if they were on the ninth floor or moved,’ said Elizabeth Castellotti, a regional official from Albertville. Ms Castellotti said there was a ‘chance’ that all had managed to get out before the fire spread. No names or nationalities of victims were immediately available. Four others were rushed to hospital suffering from the effects of serious smoke inhalation, while there were also victims with minor injuries. Burning: The Les jardins de la Balme tourist hostel is used by ski workers, many are from the UK . Up to 200 others, including young children, were evacuated from nearby buildings, including a primary school. Fire ripped through the nine storey building this afternoon after starting on the fifth floor for an unknown reason at around 1pm, said one firefighter. He said the roof was completely destroyed. Terrified occupants were seen escaping, some of them with just towels around their waists, despite the freezing winter temperatures. Concern: The missing were last seen on the top floor of the wooden building, but officials say they have not been seen . The injured were being transported to hospital in the nearby town of Bourg-Saint-Maurice. Marc Bauer, the mayor of Val d’Isere, said the building housed around 40 seasonal tourist workers. ‘Our priority is to make she they are rehoused for the rest of the season,’ he said. Val d’Isere, which hosted the Alpine Skiing World Cup last year, is one of the most popular resorts in Alps and attracts hundreds of thousands of British in both winter and summer.","Dozens injured at Les Jardins de la Balme tourist hostel in Val d'Isere .

A Belfast-born convert to Islam who planned to shoot Prince Harry dead has been jailed after admitting making a threat to kill. Ashraf Islam, 31, who was formerly known as Mark Townley, had wanted to kill the fourth in line to the throne, whom he believed 'had blood on his hands' after taking part in two tours of Afghanistan, by disarming a bodyguard and using his gun to shoot Harry. Today he was jailed for three years after the judge at Isleworth Crown Court in west London described Islam’s plot as 'vague and unlikely to succeed', but said he presented a risk to the public. Ashraf Islam, 31, who was Mark Townley, left, before he converted to Islam, was jailed today for three years after telling police he was plotting to kill Prince Harry, whom he thought had 'blood on his hands' as a soldier . Islam, of no fixed address but who had been living in west London, had handed himself in to police in May last year the day after drummer Lee Rigby was killed in Woolwich. His barrister, Roxanne Morrell, told the judge that Islam had given himself up and volunteered information about his plot. Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson, the recorder for Kensington and Chelsea, said he would not go over details of Islam’s plot, but he told Islam during the brief hearing: 'This was not a threat made in isolation. 'The examination of your computer revealed you conducted research on his [Prince Harry’s] whereabouts and intentions. 'You had given the matter considerable thought.' He added: 'The reason behind that is that you thought he and other serving officers had some moral guilt, and you thought you had a moral right to judge. 'I accept that there is nothing here that could be described as professional plans as to your expressed intentions. 'Your plan was vague and unlikely to succeed.' Islam intended to shoot Prince Harry with a gun he hoped to take from a royal bodyguard, a court was told . But the judge said police would have intervened had Islam, who has previous convictions for dishonesty and for involvement in an attempted robbery, attempted to carry out his plan. The judge said he considered a longer sentence, but said it would have been deemed 'excessive'. 'I would have wished to consider an extended sentence,' he said. 'But the authorities are clear, even if a court finds that the person does represent a danger to the public, that doesn’t justify a longer sentence.' Ms Morrell said her client had a personality disorder. 'Aim for target.  No civilians to be injured....Not to be viewed as Islamist extremist' Notes found on Islam's computer after he confessed murder plot . At a hearing last September, Isleworth Crown Court was told that Islam had 'advanced' plans to shoot Prince Harry at close range with a low-calibre pistol. The court was told that Islam, who separated from his wife and young child in Northern Ireland after making ‘several reckless financial decisions’, converted to the religion in Belfast and changed his name by deed poll in 2010. He spent 10 days in Thailand researching the prince and his whereabouts, before flying back into Heathrow and then walking into Hounslow police station on 23 May and saying he wanted to talk about a murder, the court heard. The would-be killer gave himself up after he began to feel nervous about his plans, which he intended to carry out the next day, the court was told.  It was alleged he aimed to disarm an officer during a parade because he did not want to bring a firearm into London. Police then found a document on Islam’s computer that read: ‘Aim for target. No civilians to be injured. Dress code is the biker look. Use low-calibre pistol at close range. Not to be viewed as Islamist extremist.’ Islam was said to have converted to the religion while serving time in prison for fraud.","Ashraf Islam, 31, was born Mark Townley in Belfast but converted to Islam .

Carle Neale, 23, was jailed for six years for punching a drug dealer who was attacking a woman on the street . A father who punched a drug dealer after seeing him attack a vulnerable woman in the street has been jailed - but the pusher won't be prosecuted because he was so badly hurt. Father-of-one Carl Neale, 23, floored the dealer with a single punch after shouting at him to stop hitting the terrified woman. A court heard the argument had erupted after the dealer, who has not been named, demanded the woman repay a £40 debt. After punching the man on Clarence Street, Nuneaton, Warwickshire on August 14 last year, Neale hit him again as he lay on the floor. He then walked away. Neale, also from Nuneaton, was jailed for six years on Friday after Coventry Crown Court heard the drug dealer had been left fighting for his life. Doctors were forced to remove a portion of the man’s skull to allow his brain to balloon in size. Afterwards he was put into an induced coma while surgeons treated injuries to his face and head. He has since been released from hospital. The court heard because his injuries were so horrific, the drug dealer was not prosecuted over the attack on the woman. Judge Gregory told Neale he had put the court in 'an impossible position'. He said: 'You are a young man with a wife and a child and you have a decent future ahead of you if you are prepared to allow yourself that future. 'If you carry on behaving the way you have over the last few years you will be spending the majority of that future behind bars. 'You are very very fortunate you do not face a murder charge. 'You are also an intelligent articulate man capable of doing hard work - but have a grossly irresponsible streak.' Neale attacked the drug dealer on Clarence Street, Nuneaton (pictured). The dealer was left with brain damage following the attack, but has since been released from hospital . Prosecutor Shane Crawford told the court the victim will suffer fatigue, memory loss and anxiety attacks as a result of his brain damage. He added: 'The woman was being pursued by the complainant into Clarence Street, she tried to escape from him but was punched by him in this road. 'At this point residents of Clarence Street came out to see what was happening. This defendant was heard to say ""you shouldn’t do that"". 'His victim released the woman who he was holding over the bonnet of a car and walked towards the defendant who told him to let her go. Coventry Crown Court, pictured, heard the dealer will not be charged for attacking the woman as his injuries were so severe. Judge Gregory told Neale he was 'fortunate not to face a murder charge' 'The defendant punched the complainant to the face which felled him instantly.' John Brotherton, defending, told the court Neale was 'not a violent man”. He said: 'He went to the assistance of a lady who was being attacked by a drug dealer. He is not a violent man, it was two punches. 'Among his references is a letter from the former mayor of Nuneaton and Bedworth who speaks very highly of him.' Neale admitted one count of causing grievous bodily harm, as well as charges of dangerous driving, assault with intent to resist arrest, attempted burglary, aggravated vehicle taking and two counts of driving whilst disqualified.","Carl Neale, 23, saw dealer hitting a woman on the street - so punched him .

It was a moment she had dreamed of since she was a girl and saw her claim Britain’s first medal in a snow event at the Winter Olympics in 90 years. But for many, Jenny Jones’s bronze in the snowboarding slopestyle final was marred by the BBC commentary. The corporation was forced to apologise after more than 300 viewers complained. Commentators Ed Leigh and Tim Warwood were labelled ‘immature idiots’ for whooping and cheering as Miss Jones competed in Sochi, Russia, on Sunday. Apology: Hundreds of viewers complained that the BBC had spoiled Jenny Jones's Olympic bronze medal success and branded commentators including snowboarder Aimee Fuller 'puerile and hyperactive' Team: BBC Commentators Ed Leigh (left) and Tim Warwood (right) were also in the commentary box .

The pair, who were joined by Miss . Jones’s friend and fellow snowboarder Aimee Fuller, repeatedly talked . over each other and appeared to celebrate when her Austrian rival Anna . Glasser fell, ensuring 33-year-old Miss Jones a medal. At . one point Miss Fuller yelled ‘Go on the Jones!’, while Warwood said ‘I . can’t look, someone else commentate’ as she was about to start her run. When . Miss Glasser fell, the BBC team erupted into cheers and Miss Fuller . screamed: ‘Jones gets bronze. Can I stand on my chair now?’ The cheering became so loud that Miss Fuller herself remarked: ‘Whoa, are we supposed to do that? Probably not.’ In . one exchange as Miss Jones, from Bristol, waited for her score, Leigh . said: ‘I can feel my pulse in my lower intestine.’ Warwood replied: . ‘That’s not your pulse, Ed.’ Crude: Mr Leigh also referred to Olympic hero Jenny's reaction to winning the bronze - telling viewers she 'had a face that can help bread rise' Shock: Jenny Jones realises her parents, who she believed were at home, were in the crowd as she competed, pictured left. She immediately rushed over to give them a hug, pictured right . A . total of 303 complained to the BBC about the coverage. Writing on the . BBC’s own Points Of View messageboard, one viewer said: ‘Shame, the . Jones medal overshadowed by immature idiots.’ Another criticised the ‘shrieking with joy at the fall of a non-GB athlete’. A . BBC spokesman said: ‘This was a truly historic occasion for Team GB and . the commentary team were understandably very excited. However, we . acknowledge that on occasion this excitement got the better of them.’ American Jamie Anderson took . gold in the event with 95.25, ahead of Finland’s Enni Rukajarvi on 92.50. The three . medal winners shouted their delight and hugged as the final competitor . failed to match their scores. Success: Miss Jones beams as she reaches the foot of the slope . Jones had previously been world champion and had won . three gold medals at the Winter X Games but had never previously . competed at the Olympics as the snowboard slopestyle event was making . its Olympic debut. Miss . Jones was the oldest competitor in the final by six years and had not . even picked up a snowboard until she was 17 when she visited a dry ski . slope. And she had . been forced to put her preparations for the games on hold over Christmas . after she suffered a concussion during training. She . confessed that she has slept with the medal under her pillow and that . the reality of her win was only just 'starting to sink in a little bit.' Tumble: Despite repeatedly telling viewers how sporting snowboarding rivals were, the presenters distastefully cheered when Miss Jones's main competitor Anna Gasser suffered a fall . But her victory has been slightly overshadowed by criticism of the coverage of the event. Fuming viewers took to Twitter to vent their frustration at the commentary team - with some admitting they had been forced to switch the sound off. Paul Morton wrote: 'I thought I’d tuned into CBeebies or “Grange Hill does Val d’ISere” by mistake, turned out to be BBC’s #Slopestyle commentators #myeardrums.'

Nick Blacow wrote: 'Deary me can the @BBCSport slopestyle commentators please get a grip you are working for the BBC for god’s sake!' And user Adam Yates added: 'Never heard such puerile hyperactive guff in my life. BBC should axe those three clowns immediately. Had to mute coverage.' Precious: Miss Jones confessed today that she had slept with the medal under her pillow last night and that the reality of her win was only just 'starting to sink in a little bit' Pumped: Jones poses with her parents who surprised her at the ceremony . Other viewers were offended by the sexual innuendos the commentary team used, including joking about a competitor having 'slugs in her knickers'. Mr Leigh and Mr Warwood also collapsed into fits of infantile giggles when they joked about 'pumping the fist in the commentary box' - slang for a sexual act. Mr Leigh also referred to Olympic hero Miss Jones’s reaction to winning the bronze - telling viewers she 'had a face that can help bread rise'. Mr Leigh, 39, has worked for the BBC presenting flagship snow sports show Ski Sunday since 2007 after previously working for Channel 4, while Mr Warwood presented CBBC show Wild! after a low-key career as a professional snowboarder. One viewer said: 'It was awful, you would not have expected this in the heyday of BBC coverage, could you imagine Ski Sunday commentators reacting like that?' Amir Adhamy added: 'So just popped online to see people’s reactions to the commentary, I cannot believe I’m alone in finding them unbearably annoying.

Two men were today convicted of helping serial killer Joanna Dennehy, who stabbed three men in the heart before dumping their bodies in ditches. Gary Stretch was found guilty of three counts of preventing the lawful burial of a body and one of attempted murder at Cambridge Crown Court. Leslie Layton was also found guilty of perverting the course of justice. Killer: Joanna Dennehy pictured brandishing a knife shortly after murdering three men . Guilty: Gary Stretch, left, has been convicted of attempted murder over his involvement with Dennehy, right . The bodies of Dennehy's victims - Lukasz Slaboszewski, Kevin Lee and John Chapman - were found in March and April last year. After . the killings, Dennehy and Stretch drove to Hereford where she selected . two other men - Robin Bereza and John Rogers - at random, the court has . heard. She repeatedly stabbed the dog walkers in the street but both survived. During the trial, prosecutors said Dennehy 'cast a spell' over her alleged accomplices and some of her victims as she killed 'for fun'.

Dennehy was likened to 'Uma Thurman . from Kill Bill and the woman from the Terminator' by married . father-of-two Mr Lee shortly before his death. Mr Chapman had dubbed her the 'man woman' because of her intimidating nature. At . the height of a nationwide man-hunt, she bragged to one witness that . she had killed eight people - although no further murders have been . detected. All of the murder victims died from multiple stab injuries, including wounds to the heart. After his death at a house in Peterborough, on or around March 19, the body of Mr Slaboszewski, 31, was stored in a wheelie bin.

Terrifiying: Drivers were forced to take evasive action to avoid ploughing into the unidentified woman's red Citroen as it sped towards oncoming traffic along the A11 and A14 roads in Cambridgeshire . The shocking incident was captured on video by Tom Hind, 40, who watched in horror from the back seat of a vehicle driving along the same road, only in the right direction. Mr Hind, a piano technician from Hornchurch, East London, dialled 999 as soon as he saw the woman travelling at high speed along the busy dual carriageway. He says police told him they had already been swamped with calls over the incident. Mr Hind said: 'I saw someone driving the wrong way and it took me a minute to process what was actually happening.' 'It was quite startling and I immediately called the police and they said they'd been inundated with calls from people telling them someone was driving the wrong way at speed,' he added.

Mr Hind said: 'They must have been going for about 10 or 15 miles. It's an absolute miracle that no-one was hurt.' 'I could see cars pulling out of the way as the driver was on the outside lane...The driver was eventually stopped by police in the same lane.'

Mother-of-two Lisa Woodhead fought off a robber who entered her shop and demanded cash from the till by grabbing his genitals . A shop assistant fought off a hammer-wielding robber who demanded cash from the till by grabbing his genitals. Mother-of-two Lisa Woodhead, 33, was working in the eCloud store in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, on Friday when the robber entered the shop. The man, who was holding a hammer, then demanded she gave him cash from the till. But rather than giving in to his demands, the woman wrestled with the man - during which time she made a grab for his genitals. After 15 minutes, two customers entered the shop and the robber ran away. South Yorkshire police are investigating the incident and are appealing for witnesses. Ms Woodhead from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, said: 'I haven’t had a fight for a good few years and that got a good bit of anger out of me. 'He was quite surprised, although I didn’t feel much in my hand so I wouldn’t say he’s too well endowed. 'I was desperate to get rid of him so my only hope was to grab his privates - it was the only way I could attempt to protect myself. 'I was keeping one hand on the hammer which he was holding and so I only had my right hand spare. Thinking back, it certainly puts a smile on my face.' The mother to Kieran, 14, and Krystal, six, was working alone in the store at around 9.30am on Friday when the man entered the shop and began browsing a selection of e-cigarettes in a glass cabinet before brandishing a hammer at her. She said: 'He was having a look around and then he came over and said ""give me the money"". 'My first reaction was just ""what?"" but he repeated himself. He was holding the hammer in the air with one hand and he was banging the buttons on the till with the other, trying to open it. 'I grabbed the hammer to stop him hitting me with it, and we ended up in a scuffle and went into the back room. I was refusing to let go.' The intruder then began pushing the worker into the shop’s bathroom and on to the floor. The man entered the eCloud store in Rotherham, South Yorkshire (pictured) before making his demands. Following a 15-minute wrestle, the man was scared off by customers . Desperate to fend him off, the mother grabbed his privates and in an attempt to punch him, scratched his face. She said: 'I was absolutely terrified. As he pushed me into the bathroom, I thought he was going to overpower me. I’m only a little lady and he seemed to be stopping at nothing to get what he wanted. 'All I could think about was my kids, and whether I was going to see them again. But I was determined not to give up without a fight. 'I’ve got his DNA under my fingernails - we were fighting for about 15 minutes.' Eventually, Ms Woodhead heard the shop door ring as two customers entered. She screamed for help - and the man fled after threatening the couple with the hammer. Ms Woodhead added: 'He was kicking me in the back and I was shouting for help. He ran off with his hammer in the air. 'People have called me brave but it could have been a different story so maybe it was a bit stupid of me. I just couldn’t let him brazenly steal from the shop whether he had a hammer or not.' During the fight, the thief ripped the mother's gold chain from her neck and grabbed an empty e-cigarette packet from the side - which she believes he thought was her purse. The shop assistant says she 'didn't feel much' when she grabbed the man's genitals. Police are now investigating the incident and appealing for witnesses . She added: 'I was so relieved. The man who came into the shop chased him down the street but the thief got away. 'He left empty-handed other than my gold chain and that’s mine. He didn’t take anything from the shop, but he still got away with something. 'I am going back to work this week but I am a bit reluctant. You just don’t know what lengths people will go to.' South Yorkshire Police confirmed they are investigating the incident, and detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward. The intruder is described as wearing dark clothing and a dark hat. Lisa added: 'He had some cheek trying to break into a shop first thing in the morning without covering his face. 'It was only the beginning of the day so we didn’t even have any takings, but he obviously thought I was going to give him what he wanted without a fight. 'Anyone who can help, please come forward because I don’t want it to happen to anyone else. Next time it could be someone who can’t defend themselves.'

A soldier fatally shot 12 times by Afghan terrorists who hid guns in their robes begged the battlefield medic: 'I’m going to die, tell my Mrs and baby I love them,' an inquest heard. Grenadier Guardsman Karl Whittle, 22, was fired at by a gang of insurgents on motorbikes while he was on a sentry patrol in Helmand province. The rebels fired on the new father from just one or two metres away, shooting him 12 times in the body and legs before he was even able to fire his weapon. Family man: Grenadier Guardsman Karl Whittle (pictured right with daughter Grace) told his colleagues 'I'm going to die, tell my Mrs and baby I love them', after he was shot while on sentry duty in Nahr-e Saraj .

In his thoughts: Guardsman Whittle's fiancee Zoe Falim with their daughter Grace, now aged two . As he lay injured, Guardsman Whittle asked his colleagues in Nahr-e Saraj to send his love to his fiancee Zoe Falim and new-born daughter Grace, repeating: 'I’m going to die, I’m going to die.' An inquest into Guardsman Whittle's death heard the soldier was airlifted to Camp . Bastion following the attack on August 14, 2012, and died three weeks later. Speaking at the hearing at Flax Bourton, near Bristol, Major Piers Ashfield said witnesses ran into the main compound after the attack on the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards. 'Four motorbike passengers approached the sentry,' he said. 'From underneath their robes they pulled out weapons and engaged the sentry from one or two metres away.' The insurgents then attacked the main compound - but were repelled - while medic Lance Corporal Robin King tried to save Guardsman Whittle. Precious: One of the only pictures ever taken of Grenadier Whittle with his fiancee Zoe Falim and their little daughter Grace . He told the hearing that the soldier from Bristol, said: 'I’m going to die, I’m going to die, tell my Mrs and baby I love them.' Guardsman Whittle was manning a sangar fortification on a solo sentry position at a checkpoint when he was attacked at around midday. According to Lance Corporal Ashley Hendy, who spoke to the injured soldier as he was being treated, Guardsman Whittle said: 'I didn’t even fire my weapon. I couldn’t see them. 'They just popped up from the tree line in front of me.' Always will remember: Miss Falim said his touching words after the shooting were comforting and came as no surprise . Tony Reuben, a former lance corporal serving with Guardsman Whittle, broke down in tears as he recounted the attack. 'I said to him ""what did you see?"", he said. 'He was just saying ""I’m going to die, I’m going to die"".' A post-mortem examination found the soldier was shot at least 12 times before he was airlifted to Camp Bastion where he was stabilised over three days. He was transferred to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham where his condition deteriorated until doctors found that 'further intervention was futile'. He died on September 7, and Major Ashfield said his long battle to survive was 'testament to his fitness and stamina'. The pathologist’s report said Guardsman Whittle died from multiple organ failure, hypothermia and multiple gunshot wounds. Little trooper: Grace pictured shortly before her father's death . Doting father: Guardsman Whittle with his little girl. His fiancee described him as the 'perfect father' Coroner Maria Voisin concluded he had been unlawfully killed while on active service. She added that his family had asked her to thank all the medics who attempted to save the young soldier. Speaking outside the court, Karl’s mother Julie Cogzell, 45, said: 'The whole family, including his fiancee and daughter are incredibly proud of him. 'The fact that he survived for so long after being shot 12 times shows just how strong he was.' Speaking of the moments after her son was attacked she added: 'They were having to cut his clothes off . and he was apparently joking about his parts being on show - that's . Karl. We would expect that from him. 'Even when they were carrying him to the helicopter he was joking by telling them not to drop him.' Guardsman Whittle's fiancee described him as the perfect partner and father who doted on his newborn 'little princess'. Guardsman Whittle met Miss Falim, 20, when she was just 16 and he was 19 and the pair were matched together as doubles partners in a game of pool at a pub in Bristol. Miss Falim said his touching words after the shooting were comforting and came as no surprise because Guardsman Whittle always kept his family in his thoughts. Tributes: Grace, now two, with her mother Zoe Falim, who said Guardsman Whittle had doted on his 'little princess' 'He was a perfect father and a perfect fiance,' the care worker from Bristol said today. 'I know he always had Grace with him because he had a picture of her that he took whenever he went out that he kept in his pocket. 'Grace was his little princess. 'He was such a family man. We were such a close group and I still am really close to his family. He was most happy when he was with us all. 'He was always thinking of us. It was so sweet and touching to hear that he was thinking of us despite everything he was going through.' Loving: Guardsman Whittle was a devoted father to his daughter Grace who is now two-years-old . Guardsman Whittle also left behind a sister Leanne, 25, and brother Aaron, nine.

The developer of Flappy Bird, which was the most popular free mobile game on Apple App Store and Google's Android Play store, removed the game from the online stores on the weekend. Today it was revealed he had received a barrage of death threats on Twitter, as players who missed their chance appear to be willing to pay a huge premium on eBay for the game.

Flappy Bird caused a sensation after rising out of obscurity to become one of the most downloaded mobile games on both Apple and Google's online stores. Users have to steer a bird between green pipes. The Android version has been downloaded up to 50 million times, and attracted more than half a million reviews. It also topped the Apple download charts, although figures have not been released for the iOS version. There were over 4500 iPhones with the game loaded on them listed on eBay this morning, with prices up to $20,300. Nguyen Ha Dong, a Vietnamese, Hanoi-based game developer, announced the grounding of the addictive game in a Tweet at 1900 GMT on Saturday in which he also apologized to Flappy Bird players. '22 hours from now, I will take ""Flappy Bird"" down,' Dong said adding: 'It is not anything related to legal issues.' 'I cannot take this anymore,' he wrote. The move led to a barrage of abuse, including one tweeter who messaged: “YOU BEST NOT BE DELETING FLAPPY BIRD BECAUSE I WILL MURDER YOU IF U DO.” while another told Dong “I’ll find you and i’ll kill you.” Flappy Bird caused a sensation after rising out of obscurity to become one of the most downloaded mobile games on both Apple and Google's online stores. Users have to steer a bird between green pipes. The Android version has been downloaded up to 50 million times, and attracted more than half a million reviews. Many people have been questioning Dong on Twitter about his decision to take down the game as only a day earlier he had been talking about developing the game for Microsoft's Windows phones. Nguyen Ha Dong, the author of the game Flappy Bird, has pulled his creation from online stores after announcing that its runaway success had ruined his 'simple life' Dong could not be reached for comment. He had turned his telephone off after cancelling an interview with Reuters on Thursday and not finalizing arrangements for one on Friday. Unlike other successful game makers such as Rovio Entertainment, which produced the hugely popular Angry Birds game and has hundreds of programmers, Dong made Flappy Bird by himself in a few nights, he said on Twitter earlier. Removal: Dong doesn't explain in any further detail why he's decided to take down his popular game . The game, which he said was inspired by Nintendo's Mario Bros, had been earning on average $50,000 a day from advertising, Dong said in a media interview. Two friends of Dong said Nintendo had sent him a warning letter. However the Japanese game maker said it was not considering a lawsuit. 'It sounds very much like a rumor, and if it is, we certainly can't comment on that,' Nintendo's media representative told Reuters on Friday. One gaming company manager said Dong's decision to take down the game was wise. 'Dong is taking one step back to avoid legal risk because it's too difficult to deal with legal issues himself if it happens,' said Duy Doan, a senior manager at VTC Online, one of Vietnam's leading game companies. Addictive: Players must guide birds between green tubes . The end: Dong does not appear to be selling the game to a game development company . 'Dong said earlier that he was not looking for any investors and would not sell the game. One expert said investors would not be interested. 'Flappy Bird is not to the taste of many game investors because it's just hit-based which will bring very uncertain cash flow and no recurring,' said Nguyen Hieu Linh, investment manager at the Japanese CyberAgent Ventures Inc. 'I doubt he needs to fund raise as he's already earned a certain amount of money and he doesn't need more help to make this kind of mini game,' Linh added.","Nguyen Ha Dong, a Vietnamese game developer, announced on Twitter Saturday that he would take down his game Flappy Birds .

He would usually get off a stop earlier but is believed to have accidentally missed his stop on the day he was murdered . Mr Mayley suffered from learning difficulties related to microcephaly which his family say left him very easily led. The last sighting of him before the attack was when he waved goodbye to the bus driver after missing his usual stop and getting off on The Broadway instead. What happened to Mr Mayley in the 50 minutes between the sighting and the attack in Ruislip Road remains a mystery. After the attack he was taken to St Maryâ€™s Hospital in Paddington where he died later the same evening. Tragic: Dean Mayley pictured with nephew Callum. Their family describe the pair as 'inseparable' Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner, of the Metropolitan Policeâ€™s Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: 'Dean was a vulnerable young man who had . travelled alone to the Greenford Broadway area to visit a relative.' 'He had made this journey many times before without incident and there was no reason this should have been any different,' he added. 'Sadly that was not the case and Dean was later to die following what appears to have been an unprovoked attack,' Detective Chief Inspector Bonner went on to say. As yet there have been no arrests and police say their inquiries are continuing. Mr Mayley's mother Donna, 51, said: 'I hope there is somebody, somewhere, who knows something. I'm begging you, really - I don't know what to do.' Mrs Mayley said her son was aware of his learning difficulties which meant he struggled with reading and writing. But it also meant he saw the best in everyone and trusted people easily. She said: 'Dean was very vulnerable and easily led he just wanted to please people all the time. He wanted to be an adult - to be like all the other lads... It took me a long time to be able give him that independence he wanted, bit by bit. 'He was a creature of habit - he knew how to get the bus and took exactly the same route every time. But something went wrong that day and he didn't get off at the usual stop,' she added. Mrs Mayley said: 'He was very friendly and I'm sure all the shop keepers in Greenford knew who he was. I just hope someone can help us because we will never get closure without knowing what happened.' 'He was vulnerable and didn't know how nasty the world is. Obviously now we know. What has happened to him is evil - but we need to know what happened,' she went on to say. Mr Mayley was captured on CCTV waving goodbye to the bus driver after getting off the bus at the wrong stop.

An elderly man claims he has waited eight years to have a hernia operation on the NHS. Frederick Bevan, from Swansea, was first referred for surgery in 2006 but the 77-year-old widower is still waiting for the operation to take place. He said: ‘I know things are bad at A&Es, but eight years can’t be right. Frederick Bevan, 77, says he has been waiting eight years for a hernia operation on the NHS . ‘My life is on hold. I can’t socialise, I can’t go out and have a little dance.’ Mr Bevan agrees that fate has also played a role in the long delay. At one stage he decided to go private but it snowed and the operation was cancelled. Then he experienced more bad luck. ‘I agreed to go to Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend in 2011 but ended up in intensive care following an allergic reaction to an antibiotic so I still had the hernia,’ he said. ‘Then in October last year I went into Morriston Hospital and they told me I was having the operation. I waited three hours and they sent me home. There were no beds.’ Mr Bevan, who says he has paid . National Insurance all his working life, has even gone to his MP Geraint . Davies about the situation. If left untreated some hernias can cause a bowel obstruction or cut off the blood supply to the affected tissue - both are medical emergencies. At one point, Mr Bevan was told he would have the operation at Morriston Hospital (pictured) but he waited for three hours and was then sent home because there were no spare beds . A spokesman for Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said: ‘Mr Bevan was due to have undergone surgery at Morriston Hospital in October. ‘Unfortunately we sometimes have to postpone non-urgent, pre-planned operations due to emergency patients needing urgent, unplanned care. ‘Although Morriston Hospital continues to be extremely busy, we are in contact with Mr Bevan to arrange an alternative date as soon as possible. ‘We offer our sincere apologies for any inconvenience and upset caused.’ A hernia occurs when an internal part of the body pushes through a weakness in the muscle or tissue wall. They can occur anywhere in the abdomen and there are several different types. These include hernias where part of the bowel comes through the abdomen and into the groin - inguinal hernias - and hernias where tissue pokes through a surgical wound. Inguinal hernias account for three in four cases. About one in four men and three in 100 women will have an inguinal hernia during their lifetime. Hernias are more common in older people, those who are obese, those who do a lot of heavy lifting and those with a long-term cough. Some hernias cause no problems while others can cause a bowel obstruction or interrupt the blood supply to the affected tissue - both of these situations are medical emergencies. Some hernias need to be operated on - whether surgery is required depends on the location of the hernia and what symptoms it is causing.

A man who built Britain’s biggest private aquarium in his basement may be forced to get rid of his pets after he received a £11,000 energy bill. Jack Heathcote, 39, created the underwater world in the basement of his five-bedroom home in Carlton, Nottingham, filling it with tropical species from the Amazon and Congo. But the installation in his red-brick Edwardian property, which measures 12ft 6in by 12ft 8in by 7ft, needs plenty of power to keep the 4,800 gallons of water at the right temperature for the creatures. Jack Heathcote, 39, at his home in Carlton, Nottingham where he has installed a 4,800-gallon fish tank. But the aquarium, thought to be Britain's largest, is now in jeopardy following a row over an energy bill . Mr Heathcote, whose tank is filled with species from Congo and the Amazon, was issued with an £11,000 bill by British Gas following a meter reading . It previously cost the salsa teacher £6,000-a-year in heating and filtering cost. But he’s just been hit with a huge arrears bill from British Gas after an error with his meter readings. Initially, the company demanded he pay £11,000 - which has since been decreased to £4,500. Mr Heathcote is currently appealing against paying the bill - while British Gas are threatening him with disconnection if he doesn’t. The man says he will have to get rid of the tropical species because he can no longer afford the electricity - and instead replace them with freshwater fish. Mr Heathcote, who built the 4,800-gallon tank 10 years ago, said: 'It’s a tremendous blow, it has really cut me up. Mr Heathcote sits in the tank - which he accesses through the bay window on the floor above. British Gas have since decreased his bill to £4,500 - but the salsa teacher says he may still be forced to get rid of the fish . Mr Heathcote cleans the tank. He says is furious at the energy company who claims have behaved 'atrociously' 'I have gone to great lengths to provide a suitable spacious home for these creatures and now I’ve got to get rid. 'I’m really angry, because the way they have behaved has been atrocious. 'They should have recognised they have made a mistake and been apologetic for that and not be trying to charge me this enormous bill.' His collection of fish includes some . valuable species like two chainsaw doradids, three 2ft long Pacus, some . Pangasius, a Red tail hybrid catfish, two alligator gars, eight enormous . stingrays and two Fly River turtles. The aquarium is so large that Mr Heathcote has to dive in every fortnight to clean it. The only way in is through the the bay window in the living room above. The salsa teacher during one of his fortnightly cleans. British Gas claim the man hasn't paid his bills in months and say they have made every effort to offer different payment plans . Mr Heathcote, who has been fascinated by fish since a trip to a Blackpool aquarium when he was ten said: ‘My hobby’s not only taken over my life, it’s taken over my home. But I love it!’ Mr Heathcote and his former girlfriend bought their Nottingham home with the intention of turning the cellar into one massive fish tank. Three of the tank's edges are foundation walls of the house. A large section of floor was removed by the bay window to allow access. Downstairs, a wall of glass has replaced the brick wall, and behind it are some of the largest fish kept in captivity. The tank cost £5,000 to install - including £700 for glass and £800 for fibreglass lining. Mr Heathcote said: 'When it’s full there’s around 4,800 gallons in the tank and I’m on a meter. Mr Heatcote in diving gear with one of the fish. The tank cost £5,000 to install . 'Each water change sees up to 1,200 gallons being taken out and then replaced and even with my high pressure hose, it takes six hours to re-fill.’ ‘When I bought the house I knew exactly what I wanted to do in the cellar and the work really didn’t take that long.'In his previous home, he built an indoor tropical pond which he filled with 12 stingrays. Last night British Gas said Mr Heathcote had not paid anything for months, despite their attempts to resolve the issue and the offer of different payment plans. The company also claimed it had reduced the bill from £11,000 to £4,500 and sent him accurate readings.","Jack Heathcote, 39, created a 4,800-gallon tank in his basement .

Married to one of the most powerful men in the kingdom and mistress of another, Elizabeth Chudleigh's future seemed secure. But all that came crashing down after it was discovered that Chudleigh was not only unfaithful to her first husband, she'd married her second while he was still alive. The court case that ensued convulsed Georgian high society and after being roasted in the press and shunned by society, Chudleigh fled abroad, never to return. Notorious: Elizabeth Chudleigh's unorthodox living arrangements caused a scandal when they came to light . So who was Georgian Britain's most notorious resident? Born in 1720, Chudleigh was the daughter of Colonel Thomas Chudleigh and counted the children of Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole among her childhood companions. As a young woman in 1743, she was appointed maid-of-honour to Princess Augusta, wife of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and mother of the future George III. The same year, she made a glittering marriage to the Hon. Augustus John Hervey, the future Earl of Bristol but it wasn't long before things began to go wrong. Her marriage was unhappy and by 1744 she had embarked on the first of several affairs - infidelity that eventually led to the couple separating just five years later. In the same year, she scandalised society by appearing in public in a flesh-coloured skintight gown that made her appear nude. In . a book written about her in 1788, The Life and Memoirs of . Elizabeth Chudleigh, the incident was given pride of place. Shocking: A plate from Matrimonial Magazine showing Elizabeth Chudleigh and her two husbands . Spectacular: The British Library exhibition also includes artifacts such as this ornate fan . Wrote the anonymous author: 'It . has been asserted this lady appeared [at a masquerade] in a shape of . flesh-coloured silk so nicely and closely fitted to her body as to . produce a perfect review of the unadorned mother of mankind, and that . this fair representative of frailty, … had contrived a method of giving . as evident tokens of modesty, by binding her loins with a partial . covering, or zone, of fig-leaves.' The book, which appears in British Library exhibition, Georgians Revealed: Life, Style and the Making of Modern Britain, is one of several artifacts charting her scandalous life currently on show in London. 'She led a very  eventful life,' adds Moira Goff, a curator at the British Library. 'Her love . of fine living, particularly jewellery, good food and wine and luxurious . surroundings, as well as her enjoyment of publicity and her scandalous . private life, made her celebrated. Stylish citizens: The fashion plates of the day, pictured in the UK's first fashion magazine, The Gallery of Fashion . Stylish: Joseph Van Aken's 1720 painting, An English Family at Tea, has been loaned by the Tate Gallery . 'She has much in common with . celebrities of the 21st century and would undoubtedly have been the . subject of much gossip in today’s newspapers and magazines.' But . her most scandalous moment was still to come. After separating from her . first husband, Chudleigh began a relationship with Evelyn Pierrepoint, . Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull. And . in 1769, she married him after obtaining a legal agreement that stated . her first marriage was invalid. As she was soon to discover, it wasn't. When . the Duke died in 1773, he left her everything on condition that she . remain a widow. Once again, Chudleigh's future seemed assured but it . wasn't to last. Bacchanalian: George Cruikshank's La Belle Assemblee shows London's most stylish dancing circa 1817 . No sooner . had the ink dried on the Duke's death certificate, his furious nephew . and heir, Charles Medow, the first Earl Manvers, accused Chudleigh of . bigamy; a case that soon reached the scandal sheets and the ears of her . former boss, Princess Augusta. 'The . Royal family reacted with complete silence,' comments Goff,  'although . it seems likely that Elizabeth Chudleigh’s court links became more . tenuous and ceased completely when her bigamous marriage became public . knowledge.' The Georgian . public, by contrast, lapped up the scandal. 'The Georgians loved juicy . gossip and controversy – the stuff of the newspapers and magazines that . were being published in ever-increasing numbers from the mid-1700s,' adds Goff. 'Elizabeth . Chudleigh was a well-known member of the highest society and her . behaviour  was particularly outrageous – all the more so as she was . someone that the middle classes were supposed to look up to.' By the time the court case rumbled to a close in 1776, Chudleigh was considered one of the most notorious women in the UK. Stylish: This illustration detailing the lavish dress of Georgian aristocrats like Chudleigh . She . was also considered a bigamist, with the court ruling in Earl Manvers . favour. Humiliated, she fled Britain for Paris, where she died in 1788 . under the name of the Countess of Bristol - the title given to her by . her first husband. 'Elizabeth . Chudleigh flouted convention both socially and morally and apparently . had little regard for public opinion, although she seems to have enjoyed . her ill-gotten fame,' says Goff. 'She . certainly deserved her notoriety, and she was obviously a fairly . self-absorbed woman but there's something attractive about her zest for . life.' Georgians .

Vigilantes battling the ruthless Knights Templar drug cartel in Mexico have entered a gang-held city to clear it of gunmen, a leader of the movement said. The group has driven the quasi-religious cartel from a series of towns in the west entered the city of Apatzingan with government forces on Saturday, it was claimed. Dozens of vigilante group members, who wore white t-shirts to identify themselves, were seen speeding into the area in the back of pickup trucks.

Flanked by weapons a man from a self-defense group sits inside a barricade at the entrance of Apatzingan in Michoacan state . The city of 100,000 in Michoacan state has been under effective control of the Knights Templar cartel for several years. 'Federal forces are working with self-defense groups,' vigilante leader Hipolito Mora told a reporter by telephone from the center of Apatzingan. 'Guys from the self-defense groups are moving around the city, cooperating in certain ways with the federal government. Many, many people have been detained.' Mora said federal police controlled security in the city and both armed and unarmed member of the 'self-defense' movement were working with them to identify Knights Templar hideouts. He said approximately 200 gang members were arrested, including the brother of one of its leaders, Enrique 'Kiki' Plancarte. The government made no immediate comment. The vigilantes' presence in the city is both a symbolic and tactical boost for the movement. A vigilante, or member of the community police, holds a gun as he rides in a vehicle .

Vigilantes, or members of the community police, climb down the stairs of a house under construction that they use as a safe house at a periphery of Apatzingan . The control of the Knights Templar group was once so complete that it would have been unthinkable for any rival to enter Apatzingan. The Knights Templar often traveled in vehicles marked with its symbol, a red cross, and sponsored demonstrations calling for the federal police to leave the city. The cartel promotes itself as a mystic Christian order dedicated to protecting the population from abuse at the hands of the military and police.

It ran 'training schools,' including one in Apatzingan, that taught courses in leadership portraying cartel members as clean-living men of honor, steeped in Asian religion alongside Catholicism. Its members not only lived off methamphetamine and marijuana smuggling and extortion, but controlled much of the local economy. In October, vigilantes tried to march into Apatzingan but were turned back by soldiers who said they couldn't enter with weapons. A convoy of hundreds of unarmed self-defense patrol members returned the next day and successfully entered the city, where they were met by gunfire, presumably from the Knights Templar.

In apparent retaliation to the attempted incursion, suspected cartel members mounted coordinated attacks on vigilante positions, killing five, according to police. They also destroyed government electrical facilities, including power distribution plants and electrical sub-stations, in 14 towns and cities around Michoacan, cutting power to hundreds of thousands of people. Mora said that this latest incursion was 'a triumph.' The vigilantes' knowledge of the city is already boosting government operations against the Knights Templar, according to Mora, who said self-defense force members were going door-to-door pointing out suspected cartel members to federal police and helping police man check points on the roads in and out of the city. 'They're all around the city watching to see if members of the Knights Templar are coming or going,' he said. Mexico legalized the growing 'self-defense' movement in Michoacan late last month, saying they would be incorporated into quasi-military units called Rural Defense Corps. Vigilante groups estimate their numbers at 20,000 men under arms. Mora said vigilantes who have been formally incorporated into the Rural Defense Corps were armed, while those not yet registered had no weapons. He said he and his close associates were unarmed, and were there primarily to attend an afternoon rally for peace and the rule of law called by an Apatzingan clergyman who has opposed the Knights Templar. Vigilantes began rising up last February against the Knights Templar reign of terror and extortion after police and troops failed to stop the abuses. Vigilante leaders have been asked to submit a list of their members to the Defense Department and are being allowed to keep their weapons as long as they register them with the army. The military is giving the groups 'all the means necessary for communications, operations and movement,' according to the agreement.","Group has driven the quasi-religious cartel from a series of towns .

Star Trek has once again proved how ahead of its time it was after being the influence behind a new range of biotechnological devices from Nasa. When Commander Riker has a run in with Data’s cat, in TV series Star Trek: The Next Generation, Dr Beverley Crusher heals his wounds instantly using a simple handheld device. The gadget, called a dermal regenerator, works by regenerating Riker’s cells and despite being a work of fiction, the technology could soon become a reality on board the International Space Station. Nasa has signed a deal to create ‘novel biotechnology’ devices including a system that builds 3D human cells, and another that treats pain externally. Nasa has partnered with GRoK Technologies to build biotechnology including a device called BioReplicates. It will create 3D human tissue similar to how the dermal regenerator worked in Star Trek, pictured. Image taken from The Next Generation episode Frame of Mind starring Jonathan Frakes as Commander William Riker . The dermal regenerator was a medical device used by doctors and and nurses in Starfleet, as well as by civilians, and other races in the Star Trek universe. It was used to almost instantly heal minor injuries like cuts or burns to the skin by regenerating cells quickly. The device was also used to heal scar tissue, as well as restore facial features that had been surgically altered back to normal. In the year 2369, in Star Trek: The Next Generation episode Timescape, Commander Riker was treated with a dermal regenerator after he suffered from deep cuts on his head caused by Data's cat Spot. The gadgets will be built under patent licensing agreements in partnership with Texas-based GRoK Technologies and are the results of the agency's Technology Transfer Program. The first device, called BioReplicates, will let users create 3D human tissue models that can be used for drug and cosmetic testing. They will increase the ‘safety, efficacy and toxicity’ of current tests and add ‘greater accuracy, reliability and cost-efficiency.’ Nasa said the technology could help reduce animal testing, too. The technology would work in a similar way to the dermal regenerators used in Star Trek and future models could one day heal wounds automatically. A second platform, called Scionic, would be used in medical devices to target pain and inflammation externally. The Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA) already has similar technology called Scenar, pictured, that sends electrical signals to a person's brain, which in turn releases natural painkillers . The second technology, called Scionic, would be used in medical devices that could target musculoskeletal pain and inflammation externally. For example, devices could be rubbed over the skin and boost the body’s natural painkilling functions, without the use of drugs. The Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA) has already created technology that performs a similar job to GRoK . Technologies’ Scionic concept. Called Scenar, the device uses a mild electrical signal that’s placed over a person’s skin on areas of pain. Dermal nerve receptors in the skin send these signals through the central nervous system to the brain. The . brain reacts by releasing neuropeptides - natural healing and . regulatory substances, including some of the strongest known painkillers . such as endorphins. It . differs from TENS machines, because it encourages the body to heal . itself, whereas TENS uses electrical signals to temporarily block pain . signals from reaching the brain. Nasa said it is interested in the potential these technologies present for regenerating bone and muscle. During long spaceflights, for example, astronauts have been known to develop osteopenia - a condition that arises from the loss of bone and muscle mass and bone density. The patented technologies will help GRoK develop breakthrough products for the research and medical communities and advance overall understanding of biomedicine. ‘It's not just science fiction anymore. All indications are that 21st century life sciences will change dramatically during the next several decades, and GRoK is working to define the forefront of a new scientific wave,’ explained GRoK's founder and CEO Moshe Kushman.

And now a study suggests that people who play video games from a villain’s perspective, become a little bit meaner in the real world. How gamers represent themselves in the virtual world of video games may affect how they behave toward others in the real world, U.S. researchers have warned. A new study suggests that people who play video games from a villain's perspective, become a little bit meaner in the real world. Students took on the role of Voldemort (pictured centre) - the main baddie in Harry Potter - to contribute to the findings . In the experiment, gamers who played as either heroes, villains or a neutral character were asked to dish out either chocolate or chilli sauce to another blindfolded student to eat. Those who played as Superman poured on average nearly twice as much chocolate as chilli sauce for an unknown student to consume. The researchers also discovered that the gamers who played as a hero poured significantly more chocolate than those who played as either of the other avatars, perhaps suggesting that they became more generous. However, participants who played as Voldemort the villain poured out nearly twice as much of the spicy chilli sauce than they did chocolate, suggesting their desire to inflict discomfort on other participants of the experiment. They also poured significantly more chilli sauce for students to consume compared to the other participants, the scientists said. Gunwoo Yoon, a researcher from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said: ‘Our results indicate that just five minutes of role-play in virtual environments as either a hero or villain can easily cause people to reward or punish anonymous strangers.’ The conducted a novel blind taste test experiment to come to their conclusion. He and Patrick Vargas, another co-author of the study, which as published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, explained that virtual environments afford people the opportunity to take on identities and experience circumstances that they otherwise can't in real life, providing ‘a vehicle for observation, imitation, and modelling.’ They recruited 194 undergraduates to explore whether the experiences of taking on heroic or villainous avatars might carry over into everyday behaviour. Students were randomly assigned to play as Superman (a heroic avatar), Voldemort (a villainous avatar), or a circle (a neutral avatar). They played a videogame for five minutes in which they, as their avatars, were tasked with fighting enemies. The results of the experiment indicate that just five minutes of role-play in virtual environments as either a hero, such as Superman (pictured) or villain can easily cause people to reward or punish anonymous strangers . The students then participated in a blind taste test and were asked to give either chocolate or chilli sauce to another student. They were told to pour the chosen food item into a plastic dish and that the future participant would consume all of the food provided. Those who played as Superman poured on average nearly twice as much chocolate as chilli sauce for an unknown student to consume. The researchers also discovered that the gamers who played as a hero poured significantly more chocolate than those who played as either of the other avatars. However, participants who played as Voldemort the villain poured out nearly twice as much of the spicy chilli sauce than they did chocolate, suggesting their desire to inflict discomfort on other participants of the experiment. They also poured significantly more chilli sauce for students to consume compared to the other participants, the scientists said. Student who played a video game as heroes dished out  nearly twice as much chocolate (left) as chilli sauce (right) for unknown students to consume, indicating the desire to do good rubbed off on them, while those that played as villains were more likely to punish blindfolded experiment participants by feeding the chilli sauce . A second experiment with 125 undergraduates confirmed the findings and showed that playing as an avatar yielded stronger effects on subsequent behaviour than just watching someone else play as the avatar. But interestingly, the degree to which participants actually identified with their avatar didn't seem to make a difference. ‘These behaviours occur despite modest, equivalent levels of self-reported identification with heroic and villainous avatars, alike,’ the researchers wrote. ‘People are prone to be unaware of the influence of their virtual representations on their behavioural responses.’ They think that how involved or 'keyed into' the game players are, might be an important factor driving the behavioural effects they observed. ‘In virtual environments, people can freely choose avatars that allow them to opt into or opt out of a certain entity, group, or situation,’ Dr Yoon said. ‘Consumers and practitioners should remember that powerful imitative effects can occur when people put on virtual masks.’","Gamers that adopted villainous Voldemort as an avatar, were more likely to dish out a punishment in the experiment .

George Pepper, founder of Shift.ms and . diagnosed with MS nine years ago, said: 'Our charity is aimed at young . people and the forum is full of comments about how starting a family is a . worry. MS is a very uncertain condition to live with, no two cases are . the same and it can impact lives on completely different scales.

Sunshine: Shift.ms says that women whose pregnancies span the summer months absorb greater vitamin D from a stronger sun - which research shows has a positive impact on immune system development . Researchers . are now calling for pregnant women to be given vitamin D supplements to cut . cases of the disease - an issue especially relevant to British women who absorb less sunlight than those nearer the equator. Multiple Sclerosis usually strikes people in their 20s and 30s and affects 2.5million people around the world, including 85,000 Britons. It can cause blindness and paralysis, but current drugs are not suitable for all and there is no cure. Multiple sclerosis occurs when ‘friendly fire' from the body's immune system, destroys myelin, the fatty protective sheath around nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting the transmission of signals vital to everything from seeing and walking to thinking and bladder control. The research shows white blood cells called T cells to be pivotal to the process. It is thought that overactive T cells accumulate in the brain, where, with the help of other immune cells they produce a chemical ‘soup’ that destroys the myelin and short-circuits the signalling process. It is already known that MS cases are higher in countries like Britain which are further away from the equator with relatively low sunlight levels. Diabetes, asthma and life-threatening heart disease in babies are also linked to low levels of vitamin D in early life. Dr . Sreeram Ramagopalan, of Queen Mary University of London, Blizard . Institute, who conducted the biggest study of its kind on the relationship of vitamin D and MS in 2011, told the Daily Mail at the time: 'Around 90 per cent of women are vitamin D deficient during the winter months which means pregnant women are especially at risk.' Dr Ramagopalan said the notion that vitamin D deficiency contributed to MS was first aired in the 1960s. 'It was laughed at' he said. 'No one could believe a simple vitamin would have this sort of impact. It is only by consistent replication of studies showing a link that we can say it is a genuine one. 'We believe the Government should get behind this and tell midwives and pregnant women that taking supplements can have health benefits for the baby' he said.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey has urged a probe into the scale of profits made by some gas companies . Shares in British Gas lost £600million in early trading yesterday after the Energy Secretary suggested the firm could be broken up over claims of profiteering. Ed Davey said the company’s 11.2 per cent profit margin on gas was too high – and has written to regulators, raising the prospect they may see fit to break up British Gas and parent company Centrica. Centrica makes its money from selling North Sea gas and by running electricity power stations. Some say this supply business should be separated from British Gas, which sells gas and electricity to households and businesses. The news sent shockwaves through the City with the value of shares of the UK’s largest energy supplier falling by as much as 4 per cent, or around £600million. They rebounded to end the day nearly 2 per cent down, which equates to a fall in value of around £270million. Centrica and British Gas, which has 41 per cent of the gas supply market and around 16million household accounts, insist their profit margins are modest and fair, running at around 5 per cent for gas and electricity combined. Mr Davey said if you break out the figure for gas alone, the profit margin in 2012 was 11.2 per cent. In a letter to Ofgem, he wrote: ‘There is evidence that British Gas, the company with the largest share of the gas domestic supply market, has tended to charge one of the highest prices over the past three years, and has been on average the most profitable.’ In an accompanying note, he asks: ‘Does this indicate that British Gas has a strong monopoly position which enables it to generate high profit margins?’ The letter, which was also sent to the Competition & Markets Authority, asks regulators to consider all possible remedies ‘including a break-up of any companies found to have monopoly power to the detriment of the consumer’. British Gas insisted it was complying with an ongoing independent market assessment being conducted by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), Ofgem and the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) British Gas . rejected the attack and said it is already participating in a market . investigation by Ofgem, the Office of Fair Trading, Ofgem and the CMA. Managing . director, Chris Weston, hit back, saying: ‘Britain has one of the most . competitive energy markets in the world, with gas and electricity prices . among the lowest in western Europe. ‘Our . parent company Centrica does more than any other organisation to secure . gas and power for British customers, with commitments totalling more . than £60billion, and we can only shoulder responsibilities on this scale . if we are a profitable business.’ The . GMB union joined the battle and accused Mr Davey of mounting a . dangerous publicity stunt. Its national secretary for energy, Gary . Smith, said: ‘Ed Davey has opportunistically unleashed a hugely damaging . feeding frenzy on a British owned company. ‘This . company has invested billions to securing reliable energy supplies for . the UK. It employs and is committed to employing tens of thousands of . workers in the UK. ‘British . Gas is probably the biggest employer of apprentices and trainees in the . UK. Hundreds of apprenticeships in smart metering that would have been . created this year probably won’t be because of Davey’s dithering over . policy.

Health officials have begun to predict the end of cigarette smoking in America. They have long wished for a cigarette-free America, but shied away from calling for smoking rates to fall to zero or near zero by any particular year. The power of tobacco companies and popularity of their products made such a goal seem like a pipe dream. But a confluence of changes has recently prompted public health leaders to start throwing around phrases like 'endgame' and 'tobacco-free generation.' Now, they talk about the slowly-declining adult smoking rate dropping to 10 percent in the next decade and to 5 percent or lower by 2050. The end is coming: Officials say Americans may fully kick the habit within the next few decades . Acting U.S. Surgeon General Boris Lushniak last month released a 980-page report on smoking that pushed for stepped-up tobacco-control measures. His news conference was an unusually animated showing of anti-smoking bravado, with Lushniak nearly yelling, repeatedly, 'Enough is enough!' 'I can't accept that we're just allowing these numbers to trickle down,' he said, in a recent interview with the AP. 'We believe we have the public health tools to get us to the zero level.' This is not the first time a federal health official has spoken so boldly. In 1984, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop called for a ""smoke-free society"" by the year 2000. However, Koop - a bold talker on many issues - didn't offer specifics on how to achieve such a goal. 'What's different today is that we have policies and programs that have been proven to drive down tobacco use,' said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. 'We couldn't say that in 1984.' Among the things that have changed: . -Cigarette taxes have increased around the country, making smokes more expensive. Though prices vary from state to state, on average a pack of cigarettes that would have sold for about $1.75 20 years ago would cost more than triple that now. -Laws banning smoking in restaurants, bars and workplaces have popped up all over the country. Airline flights have long been off-limits for smoking. -Polls show that cigarette smoking is no longer considered normal behavior, and is now less popular among teens than marijuana. Halting all sales: CVS/Caremark has announced it will no longer sell cigarettes as of October 1 . -Federal officials are increasingly aggressive about anti-smoking advertising. The Food and Drug Administration launched a new youth tobacco prevention campaign last week. At about the same time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention debuted a third, $60-million round of its successful anti-tobacco ad campaign - this one featuring poignant, deathbed images of a woman featured in earlier ads. -Tobacco companies, once considered impervious to legal attack, have suffered some huge defeats in court. Perhaps the biggest was the 1998 settlement of a case brought by more than 40 states demanding compensation for the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. Big Tobacco agreed to pay about $200 billion and curtail marketing of cigarettes to youths. -Retailing of cigarettes is changing, too. CVS Caremark, the nation's second-largest pharmacy chain, announced last week it will stop selling tobacco products at its more than 7,600 drugstores. The company said it made the decision in a bid to focus more on providing health care, but medical and public health leaders predicted pressure will increase on companies like Walgreen Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to follow suit. 'I do think, in another few years, that pharmacies selling cigarettes will look as anachronistic' as old cigarette ads featuring physician endorsements look today, said CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden. Mounting pressure: Experts believe pressure will eventually force retailers Walmart and Walgreen's to follow CVS/Caremark's lead . These developments have made many in public health dream bigger. It's caused Myers' organization and others to recently tout the goal of bringing the adult smoking rate down to 10 percent by 2024, from the current 18 percent. That would mean dropping it at twice the speed it declined over the last 10 years. The bigger goal is to reduce U.S. smoking-related deaths to fewer than 10,000, from the current level of 480,000. But even if smoking rates dropped to zero immediately, it would take decades to see that benefit, since smoking-triggered cancers can take decades to develop. But while some experts and advocates are swinging for the fences, others are more pessimistic. They say the key to reaching such goals is not simply more taxes and more local smoking bans, but action by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to regulate smoking. A 2009 federal law gave the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products. The law barred FDA from outright blocking the sale of cigarettes, but the agency was free to take such pivotal steps as prohibiting the use of appealing menthol flavoring in cigarettes and requiring cigarette makers to ratchet down the amount of addictive nicotine in each smoke. Becoming obsolete: Displays like this will be less common as more and more retailers stop selling smokes . But nearly five years after gaining power over cigarettes, FDA has yet to even propose such regulations. Agency officials say they're working on it. Many believe FDA's delay is driven by defense preparations for an anticipated battery of legal and political challenges. A spokesman for Altria Group Inc., the maker of Marlboro, said the company supports FDA exercising its regulatory authority over tobacco products. But as a whole, the industry has tended to fight regulation. Some of the nation's largest tobacco companies - though not Altria - sued to stop FDA-proposed graphic warning labels on cigarette packs. A federal court blocked the ads. 'The industry makes money as long as they can delay regulation,' said Kenneth Warner, a University of Michigan public health professor who is a leading authority on smoking and health. Warner and Michigan colleague David Mendez estimate that, barring any major new tobacco control victories, the adult smoking rate will drop from its current 18 percent only to about 12 percent by 2050. If health officials do make huge strides, the rate could drop as low as 6 percent, they think. But Lushniak said zero. Will that ever happen? More accepted: More teens now smoke marijuana than cigarettes . Some experts doubt it. As long as cigarettes and other combustible tobacco products are legal, it's likely some people will smoke them. Efforts to prohibit them are likely to fail, they say. (Remember Prohibition?) 'It's hard to do a ban on cigarettes because you're taking something away from people they have and are using. Once you have something, you hold tight,' said Richard Daynard, a Northeastern University law professor who focuses on tobacco issues. Better, he said, to bar people from having a product in the first place. He is intrigued by legal efforts in Singapore and a handful of other countries to ban sales of tobacco to anyone born after a certain year - 2000, say. That would be constitutional, he said. The question is: Would our culture accept it? Probably not, said Ruth Malone, editor-in-chief of the scientific journal Tobacco Control. 'In our culture, we tend to think we have a right to things even if they're terrible for us,' she said. A growing number of experts believe the most promising option is to get people to switch voluntarily to something else, like electronic cigarettes. On the fringe: Smokers have already been pushed outdoors for their fix - soon they will be pushed out altogether, if predictions hold true . Electronic cigarettes are battery-powered devices that provide users with aerosol puffs that typically contain nicotine, and sometimes flavorings like fruit, mint or chocolate. They've often been described as a less dangerous alternative to regular cigarettes. But there are few studies exploring exactly what chemicals are in them, and in what concentrations, and whether those levels are harmful. They're controversial: Some experts believe that at a time when cigarette smoking has finally become passe in popular culture, e-cigarettes may re-glamorize puffing away in public places. Cigarette sales could surge. 'It could go in either direction,' said John Seffrin, the American Cancer Society's chief executive officer. But if the FDA can ratchet down nicotine in conventional cigarettes to levels below what's in e-cigarettes, perhaps everyone who clings to smoking will switch to the higher-nicotine new products. That could achieve the end of smoking, at least of combustible, carcinogen-filled cigarettes - or so the thinking goes. In the past, 'the country really wasn't ready' to walk away from cigarettes,' Daynard said. 'I think the country's ready now.'","Cigarette smoking is no longer considered normal behavior and is less popular among teens than marijuana .

Village greens across Britain could be under threat after a developer won permission to build on a beloved beauty spot despite a decade-long court battle by campaigners fighting to save the land. A property company plans to build around 80 homes on a 46-acre patch of grassland near Weymouth in Dorset, known as Curtis Fields, which was officially registered as a town green. A passionate group of activists have spent nine years and £100,000 in a bid to stop the courts stripping the land of its protected status, but last week the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the developer. Conservationists have warned that the . decision could endanger Britain's 4,000 other town and village greens by . boosting builders' scope to overturn legal protections. At risk: Curtis Fields in Weymouth, Dorset is set to built on after campaigners lost a bid to preserve it . Activists: Gill Taylor, right, has led the campaign to preserve the land for communal use . Curtis Fields, also called Markham and Little Francis, was granted town green status in 2001 on the grounds that it had been used freely by locals for at least 20 years. But when development firm Betterment Properties bought the plot in 2005, they applied to remove the protection so that they could develop the site. Local residents formed the Society for the Protection of Markham and Little Francis to block the application in the courts. However, in 2010 the High Court ruled that the land should be stripped of its town green status because its use as a recreation ground did not in fact stretch back for the requisite 20 years as it was used as farmland until the mid-1980s. Threat: Betterment Properties, which owns the land, is planning to build on it and restrict public access . Status: Curtis Fields was officially registered as a town green in 2001, but that decision has been overturned . Campaigners spent £100,000 taking the . case to the Court of Appeal and then the Supreme Court, arguing that the . landowner had waited too long to appeal against the town green . registration. 2001: Curtis Fields is officially registered as a town green. 2005: The land is bought by Betterment Properties, which appeals to overturn the registration. 2008: Local residents form the Society for the Protection of Markham and Little Francis in order to fight the company's claim. 2010: The High Court rules in favour of Betterment on the grounds that the land was not used as a green for long enough. 2012: The Appeal Court turns down the campaigners' appeal as Betterment reveals plans to build on the land. 2014: The Supreme Court rejects the residents' argument that the company waited too long to file its application. Last week, Britain's highest court ruled in favour of Betterment - leaving the society with an additional legal bill of £15,000, which they plan to repay by holding fundraisers. The failed campaign was supported by organisations such as the Open Spaces Society and the Campaign to Protect Rural England, which are worried by the knock-on effect of the decision. Kate Ashbrook, general secretary for the Open Spaces Society, said: 'We are dismayed by this decision which gives a green light to developers to grab our village greens. 'It invites them to unpick the laws which were intended to protect land which local people have cherished for recreation, and to challenge whether the land should have been registered as a green.' Alastair Wallace, a lawyer who . represented the campaigners, said: 'This case will encourage speculative . developers to re-look at green areas, because the registration of town . green status is now worthless. 'This . is like Sainsbury's getting permission to build a supermarket, and then . four years later a green activist comes along and overturns the . planning permission and Sainsbury's have to pull down their store.' Fears: The failure of the battle to save Curtis Fields could endanger other pieces of land used as town greens . One reason for the initial High Court decision in favour of Betterment was that the local council used outdated legislation to determine the award of town green status. Gill Taylor, chairman of the Curtis Fields campaign group, fears that other developers will now try to find similar minor errors in planning decisions in order to overturn legal protections. 'This is a huge blow, but if we had not stood up and challenged the application to deregister the town green people's rights would have been lost without any fight,' she said. A spokesman for Betterment Properties said: 'We have no wish to deprive anyone of the use of this land. We will allow everyone to continue to enjoy the same use as they have had in the past until we require the land for other purposes.' The village green is central to the . vision of traditional English life in the countryside, and for centuries . certain patches of land have been recognised as having a special status . within rural communities. However, . it was not until the creation of the Commons Registration Act in 1965 . that greens were first afforded formal legal protection. The . law - now determined by the Commons Act 2006 - allows local residents . to apply for town or village green status for any plot of land which has . been used by the community for at least 20 years. The land has to be used 'as of right' - that is, openly and without asking permission from the owner - in order to qualify. It . is forbidden to build on, interfere with or fence off registered town . greens, meaning that registrations are often opposed by landowners who . fear their property plunging in value.","Curtis Fields in Dorset was officially registered as a town green in 2001 .

Humans might admire the peacock’s tall tail feathers displaying colourful iridescent eyespots but amorous peahens aren't so impressed and lower their gaze when sizing up a male. The females are naturally drawn to the males' legs as researchers think a peacock’s dancing skills could mark him out as an ideal partner. U.S. scientists used eye-tracking technology and small cameras mounted on a customised peahen hat to work out how the female birds pick their perfect partner. U.S. scientists used eye-tracking technology and little cameras mounted on a customised peahen hat to work out how the female birds pick their perfect partner - and this visual shows that they look at peacocks' legs and not their display of feathers . Jessica Yorzinski, a postdoctoral fellow at Purdue University’s Department of Biological Sciences, said: ‘Surprisingly, the peahens are looking at the lowest edge of tail feathers and aren't paying much attention to the rest of the five-foot tall displays.’ ‘According to our study, the females' gaze rarely fell at or above the peacocks' heads. ‘Of the small portion of time spent looking at the males, females looked longest at the legs and lower portion of the train,’ she said. The peacocks have a hard time trying to keep a peahen’s attention as she is constantly on the lookout for food and predators, so males have to rely on some fancy footwork. ‘What garnered the most attention from the peahens was when the peacocks would turn around and shake their wings and rattle their tails during the courtship dance, Dr Yorzinski said. Here's looking at you: A peahen wearing eye-tracking equipment watches a peacock. Researcher Dr Jessica Yorzinski studied the visual attention of peahens during courtship and thinks her study could help protect the birds . ‘It seems that mastering certain dance moves is important for peacocks,’ she added. Her study of 12 peahens, which was published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, followed their gaze in the presence of multiple males vying for attention during the mating season, but did not evaluate which males won a mate. Dr Yorzinski is now looking at the results of another experiment that tracked what peacocks watch when looking for a mate. She believes that understanding the birds’ perception could lead to improvements in the protection of endangered species. Dr Yorzinski began the experiments at Duke University and is now continuing her research at Purdue.","Researchers at Purdue University, Indiana, attached little cameras mounted on hats to work out how the female birds pick their perfect partner .

It was care fit for a king: The yellowing parchment was fitted inside a custom-designed aluminum and steel case with monitors, then wrapped in specially made packaging. Once it was on the plane, a canon chancellor nervously tracked the flight as it crossed the Atlantic Ocean. That document, a rarely seen copy of the Magna Carta, had never before left England's shores and only once been outside its home in the Hereford Chapel near the Welsh border. Now, the famous charter, written nearly 800 years ago and considered one of the most important documents in the history of democracy, is safely ensconced in the Houston Museum of Natural Sciences, where it will be part of an exhibit that opens Friday. Monumental: One of four copies of the 1217 Magna Carta has left England for the first time to travel to Houston, Texas where it will be part of an exhibit on the document and Medieval life . Precursor: The famous charter was written nearly 800 years ago and is considered a major inspiration for the U.S. Constitution . 'A very historic flight for us, and the cathedral and the document,' said Glyn Morgan, chief executive of the Hereford Cathedral Perpetual Trust, who accompanied the document on its journey and is helping ensure it is properly cared for during its stay in Houston. It will be on display for six months before being whisked back for a celebration of its 800th anniversary. The Magna Carta was first issued on June 15, 1215, by England's King John in Runnymeade. The document was designed to prevent civil war by granting rebellious barons certain freedoms, including three that are enshrined in American government: an acknowledgement that taxes cannot be arbitrary, that free men cannot be imprisoned without first being judged by their peers or the law and that justice cannot be denied or delayed. Home: The version of the Magna Carta set for the exhibition in Houston is kept by Hereford Chapel near the Welsh border in England . While scribes were hand-writing the Magna Carta in Latin, the king sent sheriffs and constables advance notice — or a writ — telling them to expect new royal orders. At the time, there were probably dozens of copies of this writ, but the only known surviving one is owned by a chapter of the Hereford Cathedral. That document, too, will be on display in Houston. In the end, the Magna Carta didn't prevent civil war under King John because the pope nullified the charter shortly after it was issued. But two years later, after John died, his 9-year-old son, King Henry III, reissued the charter. This 1217 document is the one visiting Houston. The original folds from when it was delivered with two of the king's seals are still apparent. The iron gall ink made from oak tree acid has turned from blue, to black to brown over the years, the tightly scripted dialect of Latin that few people understand today. Yet the ideas live on. History: The original Magna Carta was created under the reign of King John of Runnymade (left) to quell a civil war. It was quickly repealed by the Pope, but brought back two years later by King John's son King Henry III (right) 'Your life and the country you live in and this thing that you call the Constitution is influenced by this document, so this is a living document,' said Dirk Van Tuerenhout, the museum's curator of anthropology. Preparations to bring the Magna Carta to Houston have taken months, especially since the medieval document is only known to have left the cathedral's stone walls once before. During World War II, the Magna Carta, along with art from the National Gallery and other important documents, were put in 'deep storage' in Aberystwyth, on the west coast of Wales, chosen with great secrecy to store Britain's treasures during the German attack on London. In addition to the precautions taken during travel, caretakers of the Magna Carta need to ensure it is not exposed to great amounts of light — especially ultraviolet rays — or humidity, explained Chris Woods, director of the National Conservation Service. Fragile: Chris Woods, director of London's National Conservation Service, inspects the Manga Carta on February 5, after it arrived in Houston for display . After the document's arrival in Houston on February 3, Woods, Morgan and museum curators spent hours calculating the level of ultraviolet rays, trying to get as close to zero as possible. A cavity underneath the case filled with silica gel — a chemical that helps regulate humidity — will prevent the parchment from wrinkling. Museum curators will check a sensor inside the case to ensure conditions don't change, and the room's temperature will be no warmer than 71.6 degrees Fahrenheit. A separate monitor will feed data to Woods' computer to become part of the permanent record keeping. 'I'll check each day,' Woods said, who will return to England after the exhibit opens. The museum, meanwhile, has prepared an exhibit designed primarily to convey to visitors — especially children — the document's importance and what life was like in the Middle Ages. There will be swords, knights, intricate stained glass replicas from a cathedral in Gloucester and models of the various kings' seals. 'This is intrinsically important and interesting,' Van Tuerenhout said.","The document signed by King John in 1215 is a considered an inspiration for the U.S. Constitution .

The siblings, who put their longevity down to 'good genes', have a total of 43 children between them, and all still live in or near Middlesbrough, where they grew up sleeping four to a bed in a small terraced house. The matriarch of the giant brood, Elizabeth Brudenell, who died aged 89 in 1991, laboured from 5am until midnight to feed and clothe her family. With no washing machine she was forced to wash everything by hand, while the family kept chickens and grew vegetables for food. She married the children's father, William, a steelworker, when she was 23, and he died aged 72 in 1975. Their children are Bernadette Lowrie, 89, William Brudenell, 88, Winifred Devine, 83, Mary Tipping, 80, May Clarkson, 79, Vincent Brudenell, 78, James Brudenell, 76, Marion Campbell, 74, Jean Ewart, 71, John Brudenell, 69, and Robert Brudenell, 68. William Brudenell, now 88, was the first boy, seen left aged one, and the last was Robert, now 68, seen at three . Another wedding: Winifred Devine (nee Brudenell), is seen left aged 19 with her sister May, second right . Jean Ewart, who still lives in Middlesbrough and has three children, eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren, said her childhood was 'idyllic'. 'We never fought - Mum and Dad were very strict with us.  They had to be. 'The kids just kept coming, one after the other.  It feels great to be part of such an old family, Mum and Dad would have been thrilled. 'I am not sure why we have lived so long, but it is something to be proud of.' It was Mrs Ewart's granddaughter, Louise Ewart, 33, who realised she might be part of a record-breaking family. She said: 'I was curious to see what all of their ages would add up to.  My nana and I sat down one day, and totted all the ages up, and we were amazed when we saw the figure. 'I went on the internet and the oldest I could find was an Italian family.' Family: Winifred Devine (nee Brudenell), 83, pictured left at 27 and her son, Anthony, pictured right at seven .

Miss Ewart contacted Guinness World Records, where someone confirmed they knew of no family with a higher combined age, and said they would welcome an application from the brothers and sisters. Miss Ewart said: 'I'm not entirely sure why they have all lived so long, but I do know they have all kept very active. 'We are thrilled to be the oldest in the world.' The family remains close, with most still living in Middlesbrough and nearby Redcar. Jean Ewart said: 'We pop round to each other's houses all the time and are all still as close as we were when we were kids. 'I've lost count of all the christenings and weddings I have been to over the years - it feels like millions.' A Guinness World Records spokesman said: 'The highest combined age of nine living siblings is currently held by the Melis family in Italy and stands at 828 years and 45 days. 'We would welcome an application from the Brudenell family.' Robert Brudenell, 68, a retired labourer, of Eston, Middlesbrough, has eight children, all boys, and is married to Marion. John Brudenell, 69, a retired labourer, of Grangetown, Redcar and Cleveland,has four children, one boy and three girls, and six grandchildren. Jean Ewart, 71, of Grangetown, Redcar and Cleveland, was married to Hylton, a labourer, who died aged 42, 30 years ago. She has three children, two boys and one girl, eight grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.

A Bengal tiger prowling near villages in northern India claimed its tenth victims last night, a day after making a narrow escape from a trap set by hunters. The female big cat, which killed its first human six weeks ago, savaged a 50-year-old man, taking bites of his leg and abdomen while he was out collecting firewood. It is believed that the animal strayed from Jim Corbett National Park, a 200-square-mile reserve created to give the animals space to roam. It struck its latest victim outside Kalgarh village in Uttarakhand state. On the prowl: A tiger similar to this one has been stalking the lands outside Corbett Tiger Reserve, and has killed ten people . Saket Badola, deputy director of the national park, said the tiger was scared away from its prey by fellow villagers waving metal rods and shovels, but the man had already been badly injured and later died. Hunters had almost captured the tiger a day before the latest killing, by using a calf as bait. Mr Badola said: 'On Saturday night the tigress almost fell in trap and was close to the calf. But she did not attack the bait and left silently.' Reports that a killer tiger was on the loose began circulating in late December, when a 65-year-old man was mauled in Sambhal district of Uttar Pradesh state, across the border from Uttarakhand. Since then, thousands of terrified villagers have been told to watch out for the animal and to avoid the forests. The tiger has been on the prowl across an area spanning 80 miles. 'The animal has started attacking humans because it is not getting its natural prey,' said Rupek De, chief wildlife warden of Uttar Pradesh. 'The tigress must be tired because it is not getting adequate rest.' He said the hunters hired to kill the animal were having trouble tracking it in dense forests, and were suffering from staffing issues after half their team did not show up for work. Habitat: The tiger is through to have strayed from the Jim Corbett National Park, pictured . Mr De said that only three of the six men asked to track and capture the tiger actually made an appearance. On Sunday, angry villagers seized a national forestry office, demanding protection and compensation for the families of the dead. 'We can understand the predicament of the villagers,' Mr Badola said. 'The villagers do not have toilets in their homes. They go out in the open or forest areas to answer nature's call. In this scenario it is difficult to give protection to each and every villager. We have advised them to move in groups.' India's wild tigers are considered endangered because of rampant poaching and shrinking habitat as India undergoes breakneck development to accommodate the staggering growth of its 1.2billion people. India today has more than half of the world's remaining 3,200 tigers.","Female tiger believed to have strayed from Jim Corbett National Park .

Blundering officials from security company G4S wrongly told the family of an innocent man that he had died in a jail cell at one of their prisons, after mixing up his name. Staff at the controversial company have apologised for the name mix-up after inmate Mohamoud Ali, 36, died in custody at their privately-run prison. The G4S staff mistakenly reported the tragedy to the family of another Mohamoud Ali in a crowded mosque - where he was alive and well and in the middle of praying. Prison chiefs wrongly told the family of an innocent man that he had died in a jail cell at Parc Prison in Bridgend, South Wales (pictured) A source close to the family of innocent Mr Ali said: 'They went into a local mosque to try and find the family. 'An announcement was made in the mosque, much to the consternation of the congregation, about the death of Mr Ali. 'But they said: ""This man's not dead. He's right here, praying."" It is not as if it is an unusual name in a mosque. 'The family of the actual Mr Ali who died only then heard about it through the grapevine.' Mr Ali was being held on 'immigration matters' at Parc Prison in Bridgend, South Wales, when he died in Cell 15 of D Block. The family of the actual victim reportedly only heard about his death 'through the grapevine' His family have been told he may have suffered an epileptic seizure but more tests are due to be carried out after initial results showed the cause of death was 'unascertained'. Somali-born Mr Ali was found 'unresponsive' in his cell at 7am by prison staff who attempted CPR and called paramedics - but he couldn't be saved. His family, from Grangetown, Cardiff, say he had no history of epilepsy. Parc holds 1,200 inmates as a Category B men's prison operated by G4S as the only privately operated prison in Wales. It was the first prison in the UK to be built under the Government's Private Finance Initiative at a cost of Â£82million when it opened in 1997. The Independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman is now conducting an investigation into the case. A G4S spokeswoman said: 'What happened is completely unacceptable and we have approached the family so that they may receive a personal apology. 'The death of a prisoner in custody is an extremely distressing time for the family. 'We make every effort possible to ensure that next of kin are informed quickly and with the utmost sensitivity.' An inquest into his death was opened in Aberdare, South Wales. Glamorgan coroner Andrew Barkley ordered a full report from police before adjourning the inquest to a later date. G4S were scrutinised when Angolan deportee Jimmy Mubenga died while being restrained by three guards on a plane at Heathrow airport. A jury at an inquest into his death, in October 2010, returned a verdict of unlawful killing. The coroner issued a damning report saying their was evidence of 'pervasive racism' among G4S detention custody officers.","Staff reported the tragedy to the family of the wrong Mohamoud Ali .

The first predators to walk on land were not afraid to bite off more than they could chew. These creatures had teeth like steak knives that let them 'rip and dismember' larger prey, according to a new study. New research claims the Dimetrodon, which lived between 298 million and 272 million years ago, was the first land dwelling vertebrate with crocodile-like teeth. Research found that the Dimetrodon, which lived between 298 million and 272 million years ago, was the first land dwelling vertebrate with crocodile-like teeth . And it is thought that the so-called ziphodont teeth produced a more efficient bite allowing the Dimetrodon to prey on larger creatures. Although most carnivorous dinosaurs had ziphodont teeth, researchers believe that serrated teeth first evolved in Dimetrodon around 40 million years earlier than theropods, a type of bipedal dinosaur. Dr Robert Reisz, from the University of Toronto Mississauga said: 'The steak knife configuration of these teeth and the architecture of the skull suggest Dimetrodon was able to grab and rip and dismember large prey.' The Dimetrodon lived at least 50 million years before the first dinosaurs evolved around 280 million years ago, during the Permian period . The Dimetrodon lived at least 50 million years before the first dinosaurs evolved around 280 million years ago, during the Permian period. It is an example of a pelycosaur--one of the first families of reptiles to live entirely on land--and went extinct about 250 million years ago. One of its most prominent features was its large sail, which ran along the entire length of its back. Paleontologists speculate that the main purpose of this sail was temperature regulation or to help attract a mate. Kirstin Brink, a graduate student from the University of Toronto Mississauga added: 'Technologies such as scanning electron microscope (SEM) and histology allowed us to examine these teeth in detail to reveal previously unknown patterns in the evolutionary history of Dimetrodon.' The study, published in Nature Communications, found that the four-metre-long creature was at the top of the food chain in the early Permian Period and is the forerunner of all mammals. The Permian Period lasted from 299 to 251 million years ago and was the last period of the Paleozoic Era. According to the research, Dimetrodon had a group of previously unknown tooth structures and were also the first vertebrate to develop cusps, teeth with raised points on the crown. These are common in mammals. The study also suggests ziphodont teeth were confined to later species of Dimetrodon, indicating a gradual change in feeding habits. Dr Reisz said: 'This research is an important step in reconstructing the structure of ancient complex communities. 'Teeth tell us a lot more about the ecology of animals than just looking at the skeleton. 'We already know from fossil evidence which animals existed at that time but now with this type of research we are starting to piece together how the members of these communities interacted.' Researchers looked at the changes in Dimetrodon teeth across 25 million years of evolution and found that skull shapes did not change even though tooth shape did. 'Teeth fossils have attracted a lot of attention in dinosaurs but much less is known about the animals that lived during this first chapter in terrestrial evolution,' added Dr Reisz.

A blind Border Terrier has formed an inseparable bond with his father who helps him live life to the full by acting as his guide dog. Two-year-old Lucky was born without retinas and has never been able to see. However his father Scruff, aged three, noticed his son was often in difficulty and stepped in to help, guiding him out of harm's way and comforting him if he bumped into things. Lucky (left) was born without retinas and has never been able to see, so he relies on his father Scruff (right) Jim Leonard, 65, who often looks after the pet for his granddaughter Chelsea,14, said: 'Lucky was blind from birth and it seemed that he was always running or knocking into something and hurting himself. We were really worried about how he was going to cope. Jim Leonard says the pair share an 'incredible' bond, with Scruffy leading his son around, and licking him if he bumps into something . 'But we started to take Lucky and Scruff on walks together and it was amazing to see Scruff starting to take charge, looking after Lucky and checking he was okay.' He added: 'It is unbelievable the bond that they have. If Lucky walks into something and yelps Scruff is back like a shot licking him in the face. It is marvellous to see, a treat to watch.' Vet charity PDSA also gave the family suggestions on how to help Lucky cope with his disability around the home. Following discussions with PDSA vets Mr Leonard wears bells at the bottom of his trousers to let Lucky know where he is. The also put strong smelling scents like lemon or lime in parts of the room where there are dangers so that he knows not to go there. Mr Leonard, from Glasgow, said that Lucky does not let his blindness hold him back. He said: 'He lives life to the full. He has a great sense of smell, he can smell things from so far away, he must be compensating for having no eyes. He loves getting petted and made attention of. 'He is adorable, he is a wee cutie.' PDSA senior vet Elaine Pendlebury said the bond between Lucky and his father is a reminder of how dogs continually surprise us with their character and abilities. She said: 'Dogs can behave in a unique and extraordinary way. They're extremely social animals and can help both pets and people in ways that never fail to amaze. 'It's inspiring to us all that Scruff acts as a guide dog to his canine companion and how he looks after his son to the best of his ability. Mr Leonard wears bells on the bottom of his trousers so Lucky knows where he is, and puts strong smelling liquids such as lemon or lime juice in dangerous places around the house so Lucky knows not to go there . Scruffy has not had any guide dog training and has picked up on ways to help his son by pure instinct . 'It's nice to see that all of Lucky's family - both owner and fellow dog - are working together to make sure that he can live life to the full.' The charity said that while blindness in pets can be challenging for owners, with the right support it is possible to help pets adapt well to their surroundings. If a dog has a problem with their sight, vets can discuss treatment options and offer support and guidance in dealing with the condition. The PDSA said that sight is not the primary sense in all pets. Dogs have an extremely well-developed sense of smell which can be up to 100,000 times more sensitive than a human's, depending on the breed.","Lucky was born blind and so kept bumping into things .

It was the quietest of announcements that had the effect of a thunder-clap on the Catholic world: A year ago today, Pope Benedict XVI said - in a voice so soft that cardinals strained to hear - that he was becoming the first pontiff to resign in more than half a millennium. On the eve of the anniversary, Benedict's longtime private secretary credited his boss' stunning decision with opening the way to the 'enormous impact' Pope Francis is having on the church and the world at large. Monsignor Georg Gaenswein's comments sent out a message of continuity between Benedict and his charismatic successor, the first Jesuit pope and the first pontiff from Latin America. Emeritus: Pope Benedict with his long-time aide Monsignor Georg Gaenswein, who says the pontiff's resignation paved the way for the positive papacy of Francis . It also may suggest that Benedict approves of the dramatic changes that Francis is bringing about within the church - even if many seem to go against the grain of his more conservative papacy. 'We are all seeing the impact that Pope Francis is having on the world, not just the faithful in the church but in the world - it's an enormous impact - and this impact was also facilitated by Pope Benedict in resigning,' Gaenswein told Vatican Television. 'He opened a possibility that until then wasn't there, and we can see that Pope Francis has taken this situation in hand and we're delighted.' Gaenswein is in a unique situation in history of serving two popes. While he remains Benedict's secretary, lives with him in his retirement home in the Vatican gardens and takes daily walks with him each afternoon, Gaenswein is also the head of Pope Francis' household, arranging his schedule and appearing regularly with him at his Wednesday general audiences and other public events. Benedict's longtime deputy recently issued a mea culpa for not having been able to better protect his boss from the 'ruthless criticism' thrown his way over sexual abuse and the leaks of confidential papal documents . Gaenswein was by Benedict's side on that Monday morning, February 11, 2013 when Benedict announced that he no longer had the 'strength of mind and body' to be pope and would retire at the end of the month. Francis was elected about a month later and has dazzled the world with his simple style, message of mercy over moralising and a tone of welcoming that has thrilled progressive Catholics and troubled conservatives. He has since been named 'Person Of The Year' by Time magazine and has injected new life into an institution that was crumbling following a decade of scandal over sexual abuse, and more recently over the theft of Benedict's private papers by his own butler. Pontiff power: A street art mural depicting Pope Francis as a superhero is seen in downtown Rome near The Vatican . As the first anniversary of that momentous day approached, Vatican officials have sought to stress Benedict's generosity, courage and service to the church in deciding to step down as they battle to preserve his legacy amid the increasing temptation to contrast his often problematic papacy and reserved personality with his crowd-pleasing successor. It's no easy feat when no one ever made a 'Super Pope' wall painting of Benedict or created a life-sized chocolate statue of him - as has been the case with Francis. Recently, the Vatican spokesman felt the need to defend Benedict when Rolling Stone magazine put Francis on the cover and compared his 'gentle revolution' to the 'disastrous papacy' of his predecessor. Benedict's longtime deputy recently issued a mea culpa for not having been able to better protect his boss from the 'ruthless criticism' thrown his way over sexual abuse and the leaks of confidential papal documents. And over the weekend, Benedict's personal theologian, Cardinal Georges Cottier, said the real Benedict really only came to be known once he resigned. 'In the eight years prior, Benedict was a pope who had to be discovered, sampling his beautiful homilies and studying the profoundness of his texts. But his shy and reserved character, in addition to a certain hostility by the media, didn't completely show him off,' Cottier told Avvenire, the newspaper of the Italian bishops' conference. 'Now, after his resignation, people are beginning to realize what a big heart he has. He's a humble, good man, without any toughness.' Benedict has largely stuck to his retirement pledge to live his remaining years 'hidden from the world' in a converted convent in the Vatican gardens, rising at 5.30am to pray, read, play piano and receive visitors. The Pope's message of forgiveness  has resonated with both Catholics and the wider world . He has only attended one public event with Francis - to inaugurate a statue in the Vatican gardens in the summer - and he has put the lid on his once-prolific book-publication pace. Francis seems perfectly at ease with the pope next door. They exchanged visits over the Christmas holidays and they not only speak frequently by phone but exchange written notes back and forth. Gaenswein acknowledged that February 2013 was tough on him, as it would be on anyone saying goodbye. On Benedict's final day as pope, February 28, Gaenswein openly wept as he and the pope bid farewell to staff in the Apostolic Palace and headed out to the helicopter waiting to take them away to the papal residence in Castel Gandolfo, where Benedict spent his first months in retirement. 'For me, the last day of the pontificate was a day of terrible pain,' he said. Pope Francis stands in front of a life-size statue made of chocolate .

It feels like someone is trying to clean my hand with the nozzle of a vacuum cleaner, but every now and then I feel a sharp prickle as though I’ve brushed against a stinging nettle. I’ve had a few unpleasant therapies in my time, but it’s the sight of what’s happening that’s hardest to stomach with this. I’m undergoing my first session of leech therapy. Attached to my hand and hoovering up my blood at a rate of knots are two fat, juicy, black leeches. Claudia Connell tests out the latest new health craze for her aches and pains - and is impressed with the results . When they started half-an-hour ago, they were the same thickness as a garden worm. But having treated the back of my hand and wrist like an all-you-can-eat buffet, they have quadrupled in size, engorged with my blood. Swedish therapist Maryam Rahbari is the brains behind the UK’s first dedicated leech treatment centre, where an hour-long session costs £75. She’s evangelical about leeches’ healing powers and regularly undergoes treatment herself for aches and pains. ‘I was a beauty therapist for years,’ she tells me. ‘Then one day I read a story about how surgeons were using leeches in modern medicine to restore blood flow, and I quickly became fascinated by how they work.’ The use of leeches for blood-letting (draining a small amount of blood from the body) can be traced back to the 5th century, when Egyptians used them to treat conditions including headaches and gout. They believed leeches released impurities in the body. When leeches suck blood, they release anti-clotting, blood-thinning chemicals, which allow continuous blood circulation . Of course, it was also thought that drilling a hole in the skull would cure headaches, and  red-hot irons would sort out haemorrhoids at that time. Thankfully, times have changed but leeches are still administered — the NHS buys 20,000 a year. In most cases, they are used in plastic and reconstructive surgery. When leeches suck blood, they release anti-clotting, blood-thinning chemicals, which allow continuous blood circulation. This is vital in procedures such as skin-grafting or limb, finger and toe reattachments. In 2011, when a Swedish woman was horrifically injured in a dog attack, surgeons repaired much of the damage with the aid of more than 300 leeches. Although a single leech only sucks blood for 20 to 40 minutes, the anti-clotting chemical they release keeps the blood flowing through the wound for at least another ten hours. Many alternative therapists like Maryam are convinced by the healing power of leeches for other illnesses, too. There are scientific studies that suggest leech therapy may be beneficial for a host of ailments, including arthritis, shingles and varicose veins. In one study, patients with arthritis in their knees reported no pain for an astonishing four weeks after just one treatment, thanks to the anaesthetic leeches secrete when they bite. Other people like to use them as a beauty treatment, including Hollywood actress Demi Moore, 51, who travels to Austria for the leech therapy she credits for her youthful looks. There’s also anecdotal evidence that leeches can help with migraines and headaches thanks to the pain- relieving chemicals in their saliva. There are almost 700 different species of leeches - some are land-based, some marine and some freshwater . This is why I visit Maryam — I suffer from lots of headaches, and painkillers don’t really work for me. Maryam’s sterile, white rooms in London’s Harley Street look much like any spa, save for a giant jar of leeches swimming in water. Suddenly, the idea of them slithering over my face and neck doesn’t exactly delight me. But, as it turns out, the leeches aren’t too thrilled at the prospect either. Maryam had already warned me not to use any heavy perfumes or body lotions as their smell can repel the leeches, stopping them from attaching. I had showered that morning in nothing but warm water but the leeches still weren’t keen. I’ve faced rejection in my time, but being snubbed by a leech is a new low. ‘Sometimes leeches just don’t take to a person,’ says Maryam. ‘It might be your shampoo, what you ate last night, or it could be that your blood is too thick or too sweet. They like the taste of salt though, so sweaty people are good.’ As my neck has been rejected, Maryam tries to attach a leech to my right hand. Being a writer means I have a repetitive strain injury in my wrist that is getting worse. Maryam assures me the leeches will sort it out — again thanks to their pain- relieving chemicals. A leech eventually sinks its teeth in, and I feel a sharp nip like a bee sting. It’s quickly joined by another thirsty companion. This being my first treatment, I am only permitted to have two leeches as I am expected to bleed for a long time afterwards. As you have more treatments, your body builds up immunity to the leeches’ chemicals, meaning you can subject yourself to a greater number. Maryam’s tells me her most regular client has 70 attached all over his body in a single session. Demi Moore, 51, travels to Austria for the leech therapy she credits for her youthful looks . While I’m being eaten alive, Maryam explains that the leeches are a specially bred medical variety and supplied by a farm in Wales. They are hermaphrodites, meaning they have male and female reproductive parts, and each one has 300 tiny teeth and three sets of jaws. At the end of their sucking session, each leech has consumed 50ml of my blood. I imagine they feel like I do after a big meal, when I need to undo the top button of my jeans and lie down on the sofa. One of them falls away naturally but the other — greedy so-and-so — refuses to budge and has to be encouraged off by Maryam with a firm yank. The bad news for the leeches is that, for hygiene reasons, this feast  is their last supper as they are only used once then disposed of with a generous sprinkling of kitchen salt, which makes them shrivel and die. After they’re removed, the blood flows and my hand is heavily bandaged to mop up the damage. Maryam tells me I should expect to bleed for 12 hours. The next day, the wound is still wet but the bleeding has stopped. The leeches have each left a distinct Y-shaped mark where they sunk their teeth in — it truly looks as though I’ve been bitten by a vampire. A fortnight after the treatment, the marks have still not faded — but my wrist has not hurt once. I’m currently writing a book and have been typing on my laptop more than ever yet I’ve not had a single twinge. Nothing. Maybe it’s just the strangest of coincidences or maybe those slippery little suckers really do possess magical, if yucky, healing powers. I, for one, am convinced.

Australian astronomers have found a star 13.7 billion-years-old - the oldest ever to be discovered in our universe. The stellar body is thought to have formed from the materials left when the universe's first stars began exploding. The discovery could help to resolve long-standing differences between observations and theories about the Big Bang billions of years ago. Scroll down for video .

According to the researchers, the ancient star is about 6,000 light years from Earth - relatively close in astronomical terms. After 11 years of searching, the star was discovered using the SkyMapper telescope at the Siding Spring Observatory near Coonabarabran in northern New South Wales. The telescope is being used to search for ancient stars as part of a project to produce the first digital map of the southern sky. ‘This star was formed shortly after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago,’ said Dr Stefan Keller, lead researcher at the Australian National University Research School. ‘It's giving us insight into our fundamental place in the universe. What we're seeing is the origin of where all the material around us that we need to survive came from.’ The Big Bang was the inception of the universe, he said, and gave rise to a universe filled with hydrogen, helium, and a trace.

Photo by David Paterson, who made the discovery . Dr Stefan Keller with the SkyMapper telescope . It was one of 60 million stars photographed by SkyMapper in its first year. This is the first time researchers have unambiguously been able to say they have identified  material from the first generation of stars. ‘We're now going to be able to put that piece of the jigsaw puzzle in its right place,’ said Dr Keller. Dr Keller said it was previously thought primordial stars died in extremely violent explosions that polluted huge volumes of space with iron. But the ancient star shows signs of pollution with lighter elements such as carbon and magnesium - with no sign of iron. The lack of iron changes our understanding of the early universe. In current Big Bang modelling, those first-generation stars should have discarded iron as well as other elements – and that should be observed in a second-generation star. This discovery suggests another process could be at work. Dr Keller suggests these first stars have these smaller explosions, and subsequent generations have more energetic explosions.Because the first generation stars had weaker explosions, they ended up consuming all their iron. Previous sweeps of the sky have turned up four other stars with similar very low iron content, which suggests that these kinds of supernovae played a vital role in creating stars, and then galaxies, in the early universe. ‘A star is like an onion - it has all these layers and the heaviest material like iron is right down in the core. ‘The only thing to come out of it was the carbon and a little bit of magnesium from that supernova and that's what we're seeing today in the star that we've discovered.’ Previous contenders for the title of oldest star are around 13.2 billion years old—two objects described by European and U.S. teams respectively in 2007 and 2013.","Star is 6,000 light years from Earth - relatively close in astronomical terms .

Dmytro Bulatov, 35, a member of Automaiden - a group of car owners that has taken part in protests against President Viktor Yanukovyvh - went missing on January 22. He said he was kidnapped, crucified and had part of his ear cut off as his captors forced him to say on camera that he had accepted money from the US Embassy, to organise anti-government protests in the country. He was discovered outside Kiev yesterday and told rescuers that his kidnappers kept him in the dark for more than a week, beat him severely, nailed him to a cross and sliced off a piece of ear, before eventually dumping him in a forest.

'I was telling them lies just to stop the torture... At one point I asked them to kill me because I couldn't stand it any more,' said the 35-year-old, speaking at the Vilnius University Emergency Hospital in Lithuania where he is being treated after leaving Ukraine on Sunday. He said unidentified assailants had driven nails through his hands in a 'crucifixion' and had beaten him during a week in captivity. 'They crucified me, they nailed down my hands. They cut off my ear, they cut my face. There isn't a spot on my body that hasn't been beaten...Thank God I am alive,' Bulatov told Ukraine's Channel 5. Footage shows his face and clothes covered in blood and his swollen hands showing nail marks. EU leaders offered to help the activist after Ukrainian police said they wanted to charge him with taking part in 'mass disorder' related to protests consisting of convoys of sometimes hundreds of cars driving up to the homes of allies of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Bulatov described his kidnap as 'the worst experience I've ever had'. He still suffered severe headaches and dizziness. Video of his bloodied face has been replayed repeatedly on opposition television channels in Ukraine, fuelling anger among protesters occupying main streets and public buildings across the country. Bulatov said he would not return to Ukraine unless he got guarantees that he will not be prosecuted. 'I want my government to give guarantees to the international community that I will not be politically prosecuted,' he said. 'The government should close all criminal cases against activists, including me, who have taken part in the protests.'

Bulatov is among three activists whose disappearances have shocked the country, especially after one of them was found dead. He went missing one day after Igor Lutsenko, another prominent opposition activist, who was discovered after being taken to the woods and beaten severely by unknown attackers. Lutsenko was kidnapped from a hospital, where he had brought a fellow protester, Yuri Verbitsky, to be treated for an eye injury. Verbitsky was also beaten severely and was later discovered dead. The disappearances prompted an outcry from protesters, who accused the government of intimidating the opposition.

Atlanta-area officials are pulling no punches in dealing with an impending ice storm after their bungled response to one last month left the city paralyzed for days. The city cancelled classes for Tuesday and Wednesday and was soon followed by suburban DeKalb County – Governor Nathan Deal (R) has also declared a weather-related state of emergency in 45 counties and begun preparations in advance. Forecasts are calling for anywhere from about six inches of snow in northern suburbs to a combination of snow and ice similar to the one that paralyzed the country’s ninth-largest metro area. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Man on a mission: Georgia Emergency Management Director Charley English, left, speaks as Gov. Nathan Deal looks on during a Monday press conference in Atlanta . Moving in advance: Deal speaks during Monday's news conference where he declared a state of emergency in 45 counties . Governor Deal appears to be trying to make good on his vows after the last storm to never allow the mayhem that ensued to happen again under his watch. ‘I'm willing to accept whatever blame comes my way,’ Deal said in the immediate aftermath of the previous storm. ‘And if I'm responsible for it, I'll accept that.’ He accepted the blame, and now he’s trying to prove he learned from those mistakes while armed with an ominous forecast days in advance. 'We are making every effort to be prepared for these events,' the governor said at a Monday news conference. Deal convened the emergency management committee formed after the last storm at 11.00a Monday morning to plot out their plan of attack, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. A state of emergency was declared in 45 separate counties and schools were closed for multiple days - this time Deal is taking a proactive approach. 'We're not looking back, we're looking forward,' he added. 'The next three days are going to be challenging.' A nasty mix of precipitation that constantly changes from rain to snow to sleet and back again is expected to cause significant icing and snow accumulations for millions of people not generally accustomed to winter weather. The ominous forecast left at least a few residents skeptical of whether it could be handled effectively. 'I'm not counting on it,' Terri Herod said as she was buying sand and a shovel at Home Depot. 'I've been in Georgia on and off for 20 years. It's usually the same scenario, not enough preparations and not enough equipment.' College student Jay Ali expressed a similar sentiment. 'I don't think they have the infrastructure to protect themselves if a storm gets really bad.' Stocking up: Richard Bethea carries his purchases from a store, Monday in Atlanta. Monday is his normal shopping day but the oncoming winter storm warranted some additional items on this trip . Here it comes: Steady precipitation is expected for all of Tuesday . The icing: Tuesday night will see a shift to sleet and freezing rain for downtown Atlanta and it's southern suburbs . ‘Rain Monday night will mix with and possibly change over to snow or a snow/sleet mix by sunrise Tuesday morning,’ the weather service told the Journal-Constitution. ‘Precipitation will likely change back over to rain before transitioning again back to a mix of rain, sleet and snow Tuesday evening,’ the Weather Service continued. ‘By Wednesday morning, expect a mix of sleet and freezing rain, finally transitioning back to snow by Thursday morning.’ A quarter of an inch of ice or more is expected to accumulate in the city. That dire forecast forced the hand of city officials in cancelling school and getting their ducks in order to combat the ice and snow. Counties north of the city will see mostly snow, but those south will see what could amount to a historic icing event. Half of an inch of ice or more will likely plague the area, bringing down trees and power lines while turning roads into death traps. This has prompted Governor Deal to plead . with motorists to stay off the roads and for trucks especially to avoid . Interstate 285, which loops around the city as wide as 12 lanes - all . of which stood still during and after the last ice storm. Airlines have only cancelled a dozen flights into or out of Hartsfield Jackson International Airport, In Atlanta, according to FlightAware, but that number should rise sharply. Ready to rumble: Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) workers and City of Conyers employees prepare materials for the roads Monday in advance of the approaching winter weather . Not much better: Wednesday is expected to see much of the same . Finally coming to an end: The storm is expected to be finished by Thursday, as it lifts off towards the northeast . Pictures from January’s ice storm showed horrific pileups involving dozens of cars, miles-long traffic delays and pictures of stranded people sleeping in a Home Depot. At least 2,000 children spent hours stuck in schools and 13 people were killed in traffic accidents and other freak occurrences. A baby was born on I-285 and Atlanta Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman was famously saved from the side of the road by retired former teammate Chipper Jones – who showed up on a four wheeler. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s front page ran the headline ‘How did this happen?’ with an ice-covered highway leading directly into the city just after the storm. ‘Today Show’ meteorologist lashed out at . officials, saying the nightmare was caused not by the storm, but by . ‘poor planning on the mayor and governor's part.’ What a mess: The Atlanta southbound connector was clogged January 29 with traffic as the connector northbound is an empty sheet of ice . Officials had to call in the reinforcements: Georgia National Guard troops drove down Interstate 285 January 29 as they look to help people get their stranded cars out of the snow . Brough to its knees: Normally bustling Atlanta highways were empty sheets of ice even during the day . ‘Daily Show’ host John Stewart lampooned officials saying they didn’t have the latest forecast by pointing out the Weather Channel’s headquarters is in Atlanta. 'The ice age zombie doomsday apocalypse has come to Atlanta,' sarcastically quipped. That storm dumped only 2.6 inches on downtown Atlanta, along with some ice accumulations. This storm is set to be much worse. By closing schools early and moving assets into place ahead of time, officials look to be much more ready for round two. Precipitation across the region is expected to start falling early Monday evening and last until Thursday morning.","More than a quarter inch of ice is expected in downtown Atlanta, with even more icing forecast to the south of downtown .

European countries threatened today to review their relations with Switzerland after voters there backed a proposal to limit immigration from the EU, putting the Alpine nation on a collision course with France and Germany. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius described the vote, initiated by the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) and opposed by the government in Berne, as a 'worrying' move that showed Switzerland was withdrawing into itself. 'We're going to review our relations with Switzerland,' Fabius told RTL radio. European partners have threatened  to review their ties with Switzerland after voters in the Alpine nation narrowly backed a proposal to curtail immigration . French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius described the vote, initiated by the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP), as 'worrying' Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman said that while Berlin respected the result, it would create 'considerable problems' for Switzerland's relationship with the EU. The European Commission said it went against the principle of free movement between the Alpine nation and the EU that has existed for over a decade. 'The EU will examine the implications of this initiative on EU-Swiss relations as a whole,' the Commission said. Switzerland is not a member of the 28-nation EU, but a pact with Brussels has ensured the free movement of citizens to and from the bloc since 2002. The vote to reintroduce immigration quotas, backed by a razor-thin margin of 19,526 voters on Sunday, threatens that pact, and with it a key pillar of the Swiss economy, which relies on the EU for nearly one-fifth of its workforce. Switzerland is home to food and beverage giant Nestle, drugmakers Novartis and Roche, as well as a host of major commodities dealers such as Glencore Xtrata and Louis Dreyfus Commodities. 'What's the point of investing in Switzerland, when in the end it's not certain whether you can get qualified staff to carry out your plans,' Valentin Vogt, president of the Swiss Employers Association, told the NZZ newspaper. He said the vote created toxic uncertainty for Swiss businesses, which already face pressure amid a foreign crackdown on banking secrecy and an outcry over the favorable tax rates some Swiss cantons offers to multinationals. Swiss banks including and Credit Suisse are especially dependent on the flow of foreign workers, employing up to 25 percent of overall staff from the EU. 'We fear that the pool of available workers will dwindle,' said Sindy Schmiegel of the Swiss Banking Association. 'It could become much more difficult for banks to meet their staffing needs.' Switzerland is not a member of the 28-nation EU, but a deal with Brussels has ensured the free movement of citizens since 2002 . Although the Swiss government had urged voters to reject the introduction of EU immigration quotas, it is now obliged to write the results of the referendum into law. It will have a degree of flexibility as the referendum did not set specific quotas. Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga said on Sunday that the government planned to draft a law by the autumn, before approaching the EU with its plans. Anger among parties that had opposed the vote was palpable on Monday, with the Swiss Liberal Democrats suggesting that Christoph Blocher, the billionaire industrialist and SVP lawmaker who poured his own money into the quota campaign, be sent to Brussels himself to explain the vote. 'He has an obligation to find a good solution, together with the other parties,' the FDP said in a statement.","Referendum was initiated by right-wing SVP party .

The New York-based couple has a son and daughter. 'I don't think Tim Armstrong meant to hurt our family,' Fei told Today before speaking with the CEO. But she said she felt she needed to speak up to defend her daughter, who was born four months premature and spent three months in intensive care. 'It did sound like the implication (was) that somehow we were greedy consumers of healthcare benefits, that we had gobbled up more than our share of the pie.

Fei said the experience (of having a premature baby) was so traumatic that even some of the couple's closest friends didn't know what happened, until she spoke up in response to Armstrong's insensitive remarks. 'When I saw the headlines, it was sort of impossible to process he was talking about my daughter,' Fei told NBC Nightly News last week of the moment she first heard Armstrong's controversial comments. 'It (was) a violation - for singling us out for using the health plan we paid for.'

The switch would have cost employees who left mid-year and even those who stayed, since they would not see the benefits of compounding in their retirement accounts, Washington Post reported. But the embattled chief made matters worse when he tried to explain the controversial plan during an employee meeting last Thursday. Armstrong told a story about two women covered by AOL who had complicated pregnancies, forcing the company to shell out $2 million 'above and beyond' what was necessary. He said, with Obamacare potentially adding $7.1 million to AOL's costs in addition to the 'distressed babies', the company needed to find cost savings elsewhere and was forced to change 401(k) to protect itself. Armstrong reportedly earned $12 million in 2012. The comments caused a publicity storm, with employees sending letters to Armstrong, and Huffington Post giving it big coverage. Twitter blew up with outraged users. Big wigs: Peter S. Goodman executive business editor at AOL-owned Huffington Post, holding his son and speaking with Arianna Huffington . As a result of the outcry, Armstrong apologized publicly and agreed to restore the original 401(k) policy. 'The leadership team and I listened to your feedback over the last week. We heard you on this topic,' he wrote in an email to employees, according to Business Insider. 'And as we discussed the matter over several days, with management and employees, we have decided to change the policy back to a per-pay-period matching contribution.' However Fei, author of 2010 bestseller 'A Thread of Sky', remained upset. She decided to pen a heartbreaking first-person article for Slate in which she recounted the painful birth of her now one-year-old daughter and . reprimanded Armstrong for his thoughtless comments. Writer: Deanna Fei is the author of 2010 novel, 'A Thread of Sky' 'I take issue with how he reduced my daughter to a 'distressed baby' who cost the company too much money. How he blamed the saving of her life for his decision to scale back employee benefits,' she wrote. 'How he exposed the most searing experience of our lives, one that my husband and I still struggle to discuss with anyone but each other, for no other purpose than an absurd justification for corporate cost-cutting... 'Our daughter has already overcome more setbacks than most of us have endured in the span of our lives. Having her very existence used as a scapegoat for cutting corporate benefits was one indignity too many.' In the harrowing piece, Fei explained how her little girl was born prematurely on October 9, 2012, with reddish-purple skin, bloody and bruised all over. 'One doctor, visibly shaken, described it as ""gelatinous,""' she wrote. 'I couldn't hold my daughter or nurse her or hear her cries, which were silenced by the ventilator. Without it, she couldn't breathe.' Doctors told the couple their daughter might not survive one month or one week or one day. She also had at least a one-third chance of being severely disabled. In the toughest months, the little girl suffered a brain hemorrhage, her right lung collapsed and one morning, she stopped breathing altogether. She spent three months in the NICU, enduring blood transfusions, head ultrasounds, the insertion of breathing tubes, feeding tubes, and a central line extending nearly to her heart. 'Because the day of her birth was the furthest thing from a happy event, because so many of her first days were lived under the specter of death, I've never had the luxury of taking her presence for granted,' Fei wrote for Slate. 'It can be a struggle to set aside my lingering trauma amid the daily realities of coordinating her care to simply celebrate the fierce, beautiful girl who has completed our family. 'All of which made the implication from Armstrong that the saving of her life was an extravagant option, an oversize burden on the company bottom line, feel like a cruel violation, no less brutal for the ludicrousness of his contention.'","New York mom, Deanna Fei, was stunned when Tim Armstrong blamed her premature baby's exorbitant medical costs for slashing 401(k) benefits .

A 19-year-old Florida woman is accused of stabbing a 22-year-old rival five times during a Redneck Yacht Club event, before telling her 'I hope you die.' Investigators said Jessica Hess, of Riverview, Florida, attacked a woman who she saw riding an ATV with her ex-boyfriend in the muddy Punta Gorda park at around 9 p.m. Saturday. The victim, Amy Rachel, stepped in to stop the fight, which is when Hess allegedly stabbed her repeatedly with a three-inch pocket knife. After the attack, witnesses said they heard Hess tell the woman, 'I hope you die.' Other onlookers didn't realize what had happened until they noticed Rachel bleeding. She was then brought to the front gate of the park, where EMS responded and eventually she was airlifted to Lee Memorial Hospital's Trauma Center for treatment. She has now been released. Hess was taken to a Charlotte County hospital for treatment of minor injuries. After her release, Hess was arrested and is facing charges of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. According to NBC News, Hess' former boyfriend said the pair had broken up about a year ago. He said the teen has tried to fight any woman she saw him with since then.

Benihana founder Hiroaki ‘Rocky’ Aoki’s widow is fighting with his famous children over millions she says they looted from his estate the night before he died. Keiko Ono Aoki, 59, says the restaurateur’s six children, including model Devon Aoki and DJ Steve Aoki, swindled $3million from their ailing father July 9, 2008 as he ‘lay dying in his hospital bed.’ Keiko Ono Aoki, his third wife, only gained control of the $35million estate last year, and her late husband’s children claim the money was from a trust she had no rights over, according to a New York Post report. Better times: Rocky Aoki and wife Keiko Ono Aoki pose while attending a 2008 charity benefit . Rocky Aoki realized the American dream with his vast empire of teppanyaki resturants where food is theatrically grilled at the same table diners eat at. He set up a trust for his children 10 years prior to his death after being convicted of insider trading. The former Japanese Olympic wrestling qualifier named sons Kevin and Kyle, daughter Kana Grace and close friend Kenneth Podziba trustees – Keiko Ono Aoki was not named. Trusts grant trustees the right to distribute funds at their discretion – which happened to be the eve of their patriarch’s death. ‘Keiko had no more right to notice [of the money transfer] than did Rocky’s doctors or chauffeur, as she is not a named beneficiary,’ a court filing cited by the Post claims. The pair married in 2002 without a prenuptial agreement, and the founder had previously sued his children over the attempts to wrestle control over his steakhouse empire from him after he had children by at least three different women, according to New York magazine. Model daughter: Devon Aoki has made a name for herself acting in movies, gracing magazine covers and walking runways around the world . Also world famous: DJ Steve Aoki is also named in the suit . The money was handed out at that time because two of his children were ‘in dire need’ of cash, a source told the paper. The funds were distributed equally among the six children. Daughter Devon, known for movie roles such as 'Sin City' and walking runways all over the world, and son Steve, a DJ who tours the world and has permanent residence in a Las Vegas nightclub, were not likely among those who needed cash - but they still received their cuts. Keiko Ono Aoki is now CEO of Beniahana and has overseen expansion to 100 locations around the world, according to the company’s website. Her late husband qualified for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome but did not compete, instead choosing to barnstorm around the United States where he went undefeated. The empire: Rocky Aoki built a fortune on theatrical teppanyaki dining in his Benihana restaurants . Rocky leveraged the fame garnered from three consecutive national championships to open the first Benihana in 1964 in Midtown Manhattan. He died of pneumonia the day following the cash grab. Podziba declined to comment when reached by the Post, the attorney for Keiko Ono Aoki told the paper the dispute was ‘not uncommon.’","Benihana founder Hiroaki 'Rocky' Aoki died July 10, 2008 .

French police are on the trail of a 'hortensia gang' who they believe are looting ornamental hydrangeas from parks and gardens to smoke as a cheap alternative to Cannabis. Authorities in the north of the country believe cash-strapped potheads have resorted to puffing on the petals because they can no longer afford to buy the real thing due to the country's economic downturn. Locals in the small village of Hucqueliers near Boulougne were left devastated after dozens of hydrangea bushes were stripped of their glorious white and pink petals in a spate of night-time raids. Flower power: French potheads have turned to smoking hydrangea flowers stolen from parks and gardens because they can no longer afford cannabis due to the country's economic crisis, police believe . One victim, Jean Carpentier, who lost . around 30 of his prized flowers told regional TV station France 3: 'The . thieves came and cut my plants right under my window. 'They must have been well-informed as our garden is not visible from the street.' Experts warn that smoking hydrangeas could cause respiratory problems . At first the local Gendarmarie refused to . investigate but when the thefts spread to the neighbouring villages of . Humbert, Saint-Michel-sous-Bois and Bécourt, and local mayors began . reporting phoning up, they were forced to act. Local phamracist Maurice Dumez confirmed that when dried and mixed with tobacco, hydrangeas, also known as hortensias, can be smoked to produce an effect similar to cannabis. Police are now working on the theory that the thefts have come about due to France's worsening economic downturn. Captain Frédéric Evrard, spokesman for the Nord-Pas-de-Calais regional gendarmerie, told Le Figaro: 'With the crisis we have the impression people are now turning towards natural products, because synthetic ones are more expensive. 'If these thefts are linked to drug use, then it’s the same sort of wave as the hallucinogenic mushrooms collected in the wild.' Some medical experts have warned that smoking hydrangea flowers can cause respiratory problems, and even produce hydrogen cyanide, a deadly poison. It follows a spate of hydrangea thefts in Germany when batches of the flowers were stolen from Bavarian public gardens, which authroties believed were for smoking.","Hydrangea bushes being stripped in villages across northern France .

As remarkable as 3D printing is, most objects created using the . technique have, up until now, been limited to rigid structures. But this could be about to change with a new generation of . materials that are allowing designers to create morphing 3D designs. Richard . Clarkson from Victoria University of Wellington has become one of the . first to make use of multi-material 3D printing by creating inflatable . rubber-like flowers. Scroll down for video... As well as creating beautiful art installations, multi-material 3D printing aims reduce the number of manufacturing steps for one object. it allows, for instance a working product to be created with different properties without the need to bring together separate components. Experts claim it increases speed to market by allowing organisations to prototype increasingly complex parts. It also reduces waste products by using exactly the right amount of material required. The flowers, created as part of the ‘seamless blossom project’, open up as air is pumped into inner chambers, revealing a colourful inner core. Mr Clarkson claims they are the first ever inflatable objects to be created with 3D printing. ‘Basically, it’s a curved hollow chamber with flexible rubber. As you inflate it, it creates a gap of air that pushes against the inner layer, forcing the outer layers open. It almost blooms, like a flower,’ he said. Recent advances in 3D printing now allow the simultaneous layering of different build materials in a single print . A screenshot from the computer aided design (CAD) programme Richard Clarkson used to create the flowers . The flowers were created using Objet’s multi-material printer which is able to simultaneously print a mix of both a flexible and rigid material at point of print. Mr Clarkson has designed his project as an interactive installation without any electronics, sensors or computer control, working only on air pressure. It is the first in what experts are predicting could be a wave of 3D printed objects that use different materials to morph shape. Last year, for instance, U.S. architect Skylar Tibbits announced a project to develop morphing materials in collaboration with Minneapolis-based group Stratasys. Mr Clarkson has designed his project as an interactive installation without any electronics, sensors or computer control, working only on air pressure . The flowers, created as part of the 'seamless blossom project' open up as air is pumped into inner chambers, revealing a colourful inner core . Mr Tibbits has now set up a radical lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to create materials that self-assemble. Like Mr Clarkson, the MIT lab plans to use of multi-material 3D printing to programme different properties into various parts of a product’s geometry. The idea is that these parts will have varying water-absorbing characteristics that activate a change in shape when they come into contact with moisture. The technique could lead to structures such as self-assembling furniture, or water pipes that know when to expand and contract.

Artist Sam Humphreys said she wants to show the difference between how children view the world and its much darker realities . Her project, It's A Matter Of Trust, has the tagline 'We shouldn't be taught that life is perfect.' She said: 'The dolls are part of a project demonstrating how reality actually is and that life isn't perfect.' 'I was interested in how, when we're younger, we're led to believe that everything is perfect and how as children we are quite rightly sheltered from the harsh realities of adulthood.' Sam, 41, who is studying a degree in Contemporary Art and Design at the Writtle School of Design in Chelmsford, Essex, used ten dolls for her project. Here's Barbie as you've never seen her before: as a victim of domestic abuse . They range from some showing the iconic toy as bruised to some being sick and others being beaten to death. Three have been selected for a display at Leicester University called Speaking Out which looks at depictions of violence against women in art. This exhibition explores how survivors can overcome their traumatic experiences and promote a positive view of womenâ€™s forms of resistance and empowerment through art. Sam herself argues that the only way domestic violence can be stamped out is by teaching children about respect from an early age. She added: 'Using Barbie is a nice way of using a toy that everyone recognises as an imagine of perfection and undercutting that. 'My children have seen it. My youngest is only eight, so I wouldn't tell her anything scary. A spokeswoman for Mattel, which manufactures Barbie, said: 'Barbie is often used by adults to start conversations or leverage a cause in society.' 'She has seen a picture of the bruised Barbie but she hasn't asked what it's all about. She could have just fallen over, I don't think it's explicit or shocking.

Davina McCall has reassured fans that she's well enough to continue with her gruelling Sport Relief triathlon after causing concern following her 1.5-mile swim of Lake Windermere on Monday morning. The 46-year-old presenter, who admitted last week that she was terrified about the prospect of the swim, was seen having to be dragged out of the water after finishing the stretch. But as she embarked on the next section of her 500-mile journey from Edinburgh to London - a 65-mile bike ride to Monday's finishing point in Accrington - Davina dismissed concerns about her health with a positive message to her supporters. 'I'm fine': Davina McCall reassured fans that she'll continue with her Sport Relief triathlon as she embarked on a 65-mile cycle ride on Monday . She told the crowds waiting to see her off as she embarked on the next leg of her journey: 'I’m completely fine, I was just cold! I’ve warmed up now, I’ve had a nice bath and I’m ready to get on the bike.' As well as a bath, Davina was seen indulging in a burger and chips for a much-needed calorie and energy boost. And the mother-of-three certainly looked in better spirits as she tucked in - a sharp contrast to her worrying appearance after the Windermere swim just hours earlier. Cheering her on: Supporters flocked around Davina to give her some encouragement ahead of the next leg of her journey . Pedal power: Davina looked determined as she put her game face on . Contrast: Davina's determination and good spirits were in sharp contrast to earlier in the day, when she was seen being dragged out of Lake Windermere following a 1.5 mile swim . After reaching the finish point, Davina was seen clinging to the support kayak for dear life as she was taken over to the dock. But once on solid ground, Davina struggled to stand, and had to be carried by a member of the crew. As she was rushed up to the hotel, Davina couldn't even open her eyes, and appeared beyond exhausted. Pictures . of Davina later posted on the Sport Relief Twitter page showed the . presenter wrapped up in blankets as the medical team battled to raise . her core body temperature.

Davina appeared cheery as she cycled along the tarmac . Dig in! Davina was able to enjoy the scenery as she pedalled along . Speaking after the swim, Davina said: . 'The moment I got in the water my chest felt crushed - I couldn’t do . front crawl, I couldn’t put my head under water, I couldn’t breathe. One . thing Greg told me that was pulling me through was to think of the . building ahead of us as a magnet, drawing us towards it. When I was near . the end and really struggling, I got so desperate I looked up to God – . if there was anyone up there I needed their help! 'I . kept trying to lift my arm to swim, trying to pull the crawl out of the . bag, but I couldn’t even get it up. I ended up doing doggy paddle! I . imagined my sister holding me and pulling me through it. It was such a . struggle, but I have such a great team around me, I couldn’t have done . it without them. Although I’m shattered I never felt unsafe, I’m in the . best possible hands.' And . Davina's trainer added: 'I was in the water throughout the whole swim to . ensure Davina’s safety. It was very tough and very cold, but I can . reassure people that she was safe throughout and never in any real . danger. I’m full of admiration for her determination to finish this swim . and get back on her bike.' Helping hand: Davina had to be hauled out of the water by the crew after the gruelling swim . Completely drained: Questions are sure to arise . as to whether Davina will be able to complete the rest of the challenge, . which concludes on Friday . Struggling to finish: The pain on Davina's face was clear to see as she finished the one-mile swim . Holding on for dear life: Davina was seen clinging onto the boat as she got back to the dock . Fears over Davina's heath certainly weren't unwarranted, however, as it was . revealed over the weekend that she was undergoing medical tests due . to concerns that she may be suffering from hypothermia. Sport Relief chiefs said that she was 'undergoing a medical assessment after suffering suspected signs of hypothermia'. However, she was later cleared to continue with the challenge.

Rushing her inside: Davina was accompanied by a large crew of medical professionals as she was taken into the hotel . So . far in the BT Sport Relief Challenge: Davina - Beyond Breaking Point, . she has pedalled her way through temperatures which have been just 3C .

River Thames, as well as developing sores from his wetsuit, and two . years ago John Bishop was left in agony amid worries about stress . fractures as he did back-to-back marathon distances while travelling . from Paris to London. Prior . to embarking on the swim, Davina's fear was clear to see, with a video . of the mother-of-three showing her breaking down in tears as she . prepared for the task ahead. Wrapped up: The team's main concern was raising Davina's core body temperature after she was brought in from the cold . Trying to warm up: Davina looked entirely exhausted as she sat in bed covered in blankets . That's better: As Davina was given a hot chocolate, she finally managed a small smile . Wearing a black wetsuit, Davina . attempted to hold back the sobs as she coaxed herself into the water, . telling her trainer, Professor Whyte: 'I'm gonna be ok'.

Relief have also been keeping fans updated with Davina's progress on . their Twitter page, admitting it has been 'hard to watch' someone who is . clearly so terrified attempt to complete the latest section of the . challenge. Terrified: Davina McCall was seen looking petrified as she embarked on her one-mile swim of Lake Windermere on Monday as part of her Sport Relief challenge . Struggling: Davina explained earlier this week that the Windermere swim was the part of the 500-mile journey she was most scared of . Reassurance: Davina was seen telling herself 'I'm gonna be ok' before she lowered herself into the freezing cold lake . They tweeted: 'She's struggling. Finding it incredibly hard to breathe because of the intense cold #davina #windermere.' Before adding: 'Unfortunately this swim is proving to be every bit as difficult as #davina feared.' And then: 'She's stopped. She's talking to herself, desperate not to give up. #davina #windermere.' But Davina managed to get past her fears and complete the challenge successfully, after a gruelling and physically draining swim. Last minute pep talk: Davina finally managed a smile before she and her trainer lowered themselves into the water . And she's off: Davina was struggling during the journey, but appeared to be determined not to give in . Explaining her intense fear over the prospect of swimming Lake Windermere, Davina wrote in The Telegraph . newspaper earlier this week: 'I don't like swimming in . lakes and I especially don't like swimming in lakes that are only a . degree or two above freezing. 'This entire challenge makes my stomach do . funny things but the Windermere swim petrifies me. 'My . open water training under the tutelage of Prof Greg Whyte who helped .

The news of his death has also topped almost every news bulletin for a week, dominated current affairs shows such as Newsnight, and has been screened almost continuously on BBC News 24. Mr Burns said: ‘It has got to the stage where we are being told “Breaking News – Mandela is still dead”. They are losing all sense of proportion.’ Over the past week, BBC1 and BBC2 have carried a series of live programmes – totalling more than 21 hours of screen time, covering every moment of every ceremony. On Tuesday, five hours were devoted to his memorial service, a further four hours was allocated to coverage of his coffin being laid in state the following day, and today BBC2 will report on the transfer of his coffin to his childhood village. Another extended programme will cover his funeral tomorrow. Meanwhile, Radio 5 Live commissioned more than 48 hours of programming, there was another ten hours on Radio 4, and 27 hours on the World Service. Thursday’s Question Time – hosted by David Dimbleby – was originally scheduled to be filmed in Swansea, but was moved to Johannesburg instead. The BBC refused to reveal the cost of flights for him and eight staff. Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘It just proves how overfunded the BBC is if they can spend money on this kind of largesse.

His death has been of considerable interest to millions of people watching and listening to the BBC at home and across the globe.’ He added: ‘Peter Hain was an integral part of the panel, bringing the UK government’s involvement into the wider story.

"By . Peter Allen . PUBLISHED: . 05:28 EST, 23 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:09 EST, 24 January 2014 . Her ruthless determination has earned her the unflattering nickname The Rottweiler. Now, it seems, Valerie Trierweiler has been living up to that volatile, ferocious image. It was claimed yesterday that France’s First Lady flew into such a rage when she learned that Francois Hollande was cheating on her that she smashed up his office – causing  £2.5million damage. Hopes: Valerie Trierweiler is reportedly desperate to save her relationship with cheating President Francois Hollande . The 48-year-old allegedly went on the rampage after a magazine revealed the President’s trysts with an actress. Among the national treasures  said to have been shattered by the notoriously volatile Miss Trierweiler was a Sevres porcelain vase dating back more than 200 years to the reign of Louis XVI. As the claims swirled around the French media, a spokesman for the Mobilier National – the office responsible for presidential furniture – was forced to ‘categorically deny’ them. Despite this, the latest edition of Closer magazine, which first carried pictures revealing Mr Hollande’s two-year affair with Julie Gayet, 41, runs the headline: ‘The truth about the clean-up which cost the state three million euros.’ The latest twist in France’s presidential soap opera came  as Mr Hollande was told to ‘stop dithering’ about the future of Miss Trierweiler. Closer suggests the damaging claims about . the President’s partner have been stirred by her numerous enemies, one . of whom tells the magazine the First Lady ‘always puts her emotions . first’. Reports that Trierweiler caused £2.5 million worth of damage after going on a rampage around The Elysee Palace on hearing about Hollande's affair were categorically denied . Rampage allegedly took place after a magazine revealed the President’s trysts with actress Julie Gayet (left) Following eight days in a public hospital suffering from stress, she is now staying in La Lanterne, the luxury presidential home in Versailles, west of Paris. There she enjoys a heated swimming pool, a cordon bleu kitchen and numerous other perks – including one of the best-stocked wine cellars in France. Nicolas Sarkozy is likely to attempt a political comeback because he is desperate not to ‘end up like Tony Blair’. The former French president has seen his old friend become an increasingly marginal figure on the world stage. Despite being prime minister for a decade, Mr Blair, 60, now concentrates on making a living as a highly-paid consultant and lecturer. Mr Sarkozy, 58, lasted only one term before losing to Francois Hollande in 2012. Despite facing corruption inquiries, he is convinced he can beat Mr Hollande in 2017. According to Le Figaro newspaper, he has said ‘no to a life like Tony Blair’, showing that Mr Blair’s admission that he regrets having left Downing Street has not been lost on Mr Sarkozy. He wants to avoid being ‘nothing more than an upmarket adviser’. Like Mr Blair, Mr Sarkozy is often accused of mainly being interested in making lots of money. Closer claims that Miss Trierweiler is at least ‘under the control’ of the presidential establishment while she is at La Lanterne. But it warns that she is determined to travel to Washington DC next month as First Lady, even though Mr Hollande wants a formal separation. Elysee Palace sources told French media yesterday that Mr Hollande needed to stop dithering about his love life, and announce to the world exactly who his First Lady is. Meanwhile, says Closer, the delighted Miss Gayet has already held a party for close friends and family to celebrate her relationship with Mr Hollande being made public. A photograph of the smiling actress, who has appeared in more than 50 French films, is also splashed across the cover of the latest edition of Paris Match magazine. In photographs which were clearly taken with her permission, she is seen walking close to her parents’ country estate in the Gers department in south-west France. They will infuriate her love rival – Miss Trierweiler has been a staff writer on Paris Match for more than 20 years, even holding on to the job when she became La Premiere Dame in 2012. Both women have used the media constantly to bolster their careers, and their strong links with France’s most intrusive popular magazines  will be another cause of embarrassment for Mr Hollande. Earlier this week, his advisers said he should remain a ‘bachelor president’ to avoid further scandal. The President is reportedly seeking legal advice on how to to bring his ten-year relationship with Ms Trierweiler to an end . The 59-year-old Socialist has made no official comment on his domestic future since revelations of his secret visits to Miss Gayet, with pictures of him arriving at a Paris love nest on the back of a scooter. But one source said: ‘If there must be a split, it must be dignified and elegant regarding Valerie Trierweiler. ‘And above all, Julie Gayet mustn’t instantly move into the Elysee.’ The Motoblouz 'Dexter' helmet, now listed on the company's website as the 'Dexter President' A French crash helmet company has publicly thanked President Frangois Hollande for wearing one of their products on his way to secret trysts with glamorous actress Julie Gayet. Hollande, 59, was pictured wearing the 'Dexter' helmet made by French company Motoblouz on his way to clandestine meetings with his 41-year-old mistress. Since the photos were published by France's Closer magazine when they exposed his affair two weeks ago, the Dexter helmets have sold out across France. The helmet is now listed on the company's website as the Dexter President, where it is being billed as a 'Star des Medias' (media star). Now Motoblouz boss Thomas Thumerelle has taken out a quarter-page ad in French daily Liberation to thank the president for choosing his product to his his face from papparazzi. The ad reads: 'Thank you Mr President - for having used our helmet for your personal protection. 'We salute your choice of a French-made helmet for your scooter outings. And you will find other models on our website for your future escapades. 'You will also see that we have a collection of women's jackets, which would make an ideal Valentine's Day gift.' Thumerelle said his company normally sold 20,000 Dexter helmets a year, but had sent out 1,000 within 24 hours of the Closer revelations. He added: 'We were both extremely surprised and deeply proud to see the president wearing one of our helmets. 'We thought the most appropriate response would be to write him an open letter, both sincere and a bit tongue-in-cheek, to thank him for the excellent publicity.' Hollande's popularity has also soared in France since the scandal erupted on January 10. The philandering leader's approval rating leapt to 31 per cent this week, up from 26 per cent in October - the lowest level a French president in modern times.","French First Lady 'ready to forgive' President for affair with Julie Gayet .

A deranged husband who murdered his estranged wife by strangling her to death in a dispute over a piece of land has been jailed for life. Mohammed Liaqat Ali, 37, throttled Lilima Akter Munny, 27, at their rented home on June 13 last year. Ali moved to the UK in 1998 from Bangladesh before returning home to wed Lilima in 2004 in an arranged marriage. The pair moved to the UK in 2005, although their relationship quickly broke down when Ali became involved in a dispute over land in Bangladesh with his wife's mother . The pair moved to the UK in 2005, although their relationship quickly broke down when Ali became involved in a dispute over land in Bangladesh with his wife's mother. The argument, which lasted for months, resulted in Ali stating he would kill his wife if the deeds were not changed to his name. Ali eventually carried out his threats on the mother-of-two last summer, who was found by officers after being alerted by a family member when she failed to collect her children from school. Police gained entry into the couples rented home in Birmingham in the early hours of June 14 to find her body at the foot of the stairs. A post-mortem examination later found that she died from pressure to the neck. Yesterday at Birmingham Crown Court, Ali was handed a life sentence and ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years behind bars. After the murder, the court heard how Ali pretended to look for his wife when she didn't collect the children . Judge Patrick Thomas QC said: 'The background to the killing of your wife involves a dispute, which you took deeply to heart, about the title to land you had bought in Bangladesh. 'I am satisfied that a significant part of your character is a stark inability to understand that anybody who differs from your views could possibly be right. 'You also have a very short fuse. I am satisfied that you have resorted on previous occasions to using violence against your wife in the course of disputes, mainly about money.' He added that Ali squeezed his wife's neck for a 'significant amount of time'. After the murder, the court heard how Ali pretended to look for his wife when she didn't collect the children. Robert Price, prosecuting said: 'The victim's two children had been waiting at school to be collected on the day their mother died. 'Ali had played a ""cool and calculated game"" by pretending to look for Lilima.' Christopher Hotten QC, defending, there had been no significant pre-planning and no weapon had been used. Speaking after the case, Detective Sergeant Ranj Sangha, who led the investigation, said: 'I'm satisfied with today's hearing which will see Ali behind bars for a considerable amount of time. 'This was a tragic case where a long running argument over land in Bangladesh has resulted in Lilima losing her life. 'It was a violent attack against an innocent woman in her home that has left her family completely devastated by what happened. 'Lilima has left behind her two young daughters whose lives will never be the same following this terrible crime. 'I hope that today's verdict brings some closure to Lilima's family and they can now begin to come to terms with what happened.'","Mohammed Liaqat Ali, 37, throttled Lilima Akter Munny, 27, at their rented home on June 13 last year over a land dispute .

Cavemen in Israel buried their dead with complex rituals that involved food offerings to their friends and families, as well as flowers. The earliest evidence of humans burying their dead with plants - dating back 13,700 years - was discovered last summer in a Raqefet Cave, Mount Carmel, Israel. Now archaeologists digging in the same region have found further evidence suggesting these rituals were even more elaborate than first thought, and included exotic gazelle meat as well as processed grains used for a final meal to honour the dead. Researchers from Israel found saliva and mint under human skeletons in four separate graves at the Raqefet cave, pictured. The skeletons date back 13,700 years to the Natufian period. Some plants were buried with the dead, while others were eaten as final meals at the burial . The earliest evidence of humans burying their dead with flowers, some 13,700 years ago, was discovered in the same location as the recent findings, at Mount Carmel, last summer. In modern times the tradition is used . as a sign of respect or remembrance, but it is believed to have started . thousands of years ago to disguise the stench of the rotting corpse. It was also hoped the scent of the plants would stop animals being attracted to the grave to dig up the body. Researchers found sage, mint and other plants buried with the skeletons. The latest findings suggest this ritual may have been more complex than first thought and some of these plants were eaten in honour of the dead. Researchers from the University of Hafia, Israel, found multiple impressions of saliva and mint under human skeletons in four separate graves dating from the Natufian period â€“ between 13,700 and 11,700 years ago, Haaretz reported. Professor Dani Nadel from the university believes the use of plants in the cave extended beyond burying them with the dead and that people ate final meals at the burial too. The people living in the Raqefet caves belonged to the Natufian culture, believed to be among the first groups of humans to settle in permanent locations, instead of travelling around. Archaeologists also believe Carmel . cavemen were the first to bury their dead in graveyards over . generations, based on their find of 29 skeletons discovered in the cave . between 2004 and 2011. They . also discovered 100 small nooks carved into the walls of the cave to . hold bowls and mortars, which they said were used for grinding grains.

Researchers found sage, mint (pictured) and other plants buried with the skeletons. The latest findings suggest this ritual may have been more complex than first thought . Archaeologists claim the food offerings included exotic gazelle meat, as well as processed grains such as wheat husk, pictured right, and grass, pictured left. The team found more grasses in the cave than any other plant and think cavemen ate wheat and barley, as well as smaller-seeded grasses not commonly eaten today . They came to this conclusion by examining phytolith samples taken from the graves as well as the mortar, the study published in the Journal of Anthropological Archaeology explained. The entrance to the Natufian-era burial cave in Israel . Phytoliths are microscopic particles made by plants that last long after the plant itself has rotted away and enable scientists to identify the different herbs and plants eaten by the cavemen. Archaeologists found more grasses in the cave than any other plant and think that the cavemen ate wheat and barley, as well as smaller-seeded grasses that are not commonly eaten today. Professor Nadel believes phytoliths discovered near the abdomen of two of the skeletons reveal that a food offering was made to the dead. They also think that the small seeded grasses were served as a final meal inside the cave. The theory that a last meal was offered to the dead was bolstered by the discovery of traces of gazelle meat in the cave. It is believed the cavemen held wakes with animal meat after burying their relatives. The archaeologists also think other rituals to mark the passing of people took place as stone slabs were placed at the head of the grave, while horizontal stones were also sometimes placed across the buried bodies, which were also buried with flowers. Scientists are continuing to build up a better picture of how ancient people living 13,000-years-ago honoured their dead with rituals that live on in altered forms today.

A woman whose frenzied boyfriend stabbed and slashed her 40 times named him as the culprit from her hospital bed, then slipped into a coma and died. Joanna Hall, 35, begged unemployed chef Steven Williams to dial 999 as she lay bleeding on the floor but he waited five hours - then laughed down the phone to the operator. Williams told police a mystery knifeman had broken in while he was shopping at Sainsbury's. But a jury found him guilty of murder after they were told of his girlfriend's deathbed confession. Williams, 30, from Tenby, west Wales, is expected to be jailed for life tomorrow. Swansea Crown Court heard the pair had been dating for about six months when Williams grew suspicious that his girlfriend had given him a sexually transmitted disease. On March 16 last year he arrived at her flat in Tenby after drinking whisky and launched into an argument. It escalated and he stabbed and slashed her repeatedly across her breasts and stomach with a kitchen knife. Then, as she lay bleeding on the floor, Williams went out for 10 minutes to buy more whisky, sarcastically telling her not to go anywhere while he was gone. When she was eventually airlifted to hospital in Swansea - only after she had started falling unconscious - Joanna had enough energy to point the finger at Williams in conversations with police, hospital staff and her sister Georgina before slipping into a coma from which she never recovered. Her life support machine was switched off almost three weeks after the attack. According to her sister, she said from her deathbed: 'It was Steven Williams. He turned up at my flat after drinking whisky, there was argument and he flipped. Killing: Joanna Hall, left, had been dating Steven Williams for about six months when he accused her of giving him a sexually transmitted disease. CCTV captured the moment he was arrested outside a supermarket, right . Murder: The pair both lived in the seaside town of Tenby, pictured (file photo) 'He began stabbing me - then sat with me smoking a cigarette and said: “Will you just die?""' The court was also read Joanna's police statement, which said: 'He started shouting at me and went into the kitchen and came back with a knife. 'I asked him what he was going to do with it and he said: “Watch me”. 'He stabbed me in the back and the knife got stuck but he managed to get it out and carried on stabbing me.' Williams was arrested outside a nearby supermarket shortly after the stabbing. He denied the attack throughout the trial - but the jury was shown evidence of injuries he sustained as Joanna tried to fight him off. Prosecutor Elwen Evans described Joanna's injuries, some of which were too distressing to be published. Caught: Police arresting Williams. He claimed a mystery knifeman had broken into the flat and stabbed Joanna . Sentence: Williams is expected to be jailed for life tomorrow at Swansea Crown Court after he was found guilty . 'Her condition was very serious indeed,' she told the court. 'She had suffered substantial blood loss. 'She was flown by helicopter to hospital where she underwent surgery and was put on a life support machine. 'Her organs stopped functioning and she died in April 2013, 20 days after the attack, but before going unconscious she was able to give an account of what had happened to her.' The jury found Williams guilty by a majority of 10 to two, the smallest normally allowed in the law, after a three week trial. In a statement reported by WalesOnline, Joanna's family said: 'Williams is an evil monster who needs to be locked away so that he can't hurt anyone else in the same way as Jo. 'Nothing will bring Jo back or change the heinous things that Williams did to her and unfortunately we now have to live with that for the rest of our lives.' He will be sentenced tomorrow.

Proud grandfather Michael Poyzer who has finally been awarded a degree after taking 43 years to complete his studies . A dogged student has finally graduated from university – 43 years after starting his degree. Michael Poyzer, 65, began his studies in science and technology with the Open University in 1971 when he was aged just 22. Over the next four decades he juggled his degree with running a business, writing a novel and looking after three children – and later four grandchildren. And his persistence finally paid off when the delighted student was told last summer he had passed his Bsc Honours course with a 2:2 qualification. And following a glitzy graduation ceremony last month alongside students in their 20s, Mr Poyzer now plans to go and study for a Master's degree. From start to finish it has taken the pensioner nearly as long as it did to build the Taj Mahal, Hadrian's Wall and the Humber Bridge combined. Incredibly, if he had started his degree with the current average university costs Michael would have amassed the equivalent of £387,000 in tuition fees. Mr Poyzer, from Carlton, Nottinghamshire, yesterday said he now even plans to go on to study a Masters in Creative Writing at Nottingham Trent University. 'Hopefully the Masters won't take as long - it's something I really want to do. I've got the thirst for academia again. I love learning, no matter how long it might have taken me,' he said. 'It was a relief to have finally graduated. I was never going to quit. When I kept picking the books back up it always came flooding back. 'It's been quite a juggling act though being a father, owning a business and doing a degree. 'I always felt I was going to go back to it. When you've got a dream, you should never give up on it. 'In those days, you had to study whenever you could. I would have had a better result if I had worked a bit harder in the early days. 'Courses are much different now compared to the 70's as lectures are delivered online and through other media, allowing people to fit their degree around their life. 'There was a lot of television programmes on at obscure times. The TV channels would close down and the Open University would start up after. 'But as the years passed I always thought ""I'm going to finish that degree one of these days.""' Mr Poyzer, 65, began studying science and technology at the Open University in 1971 when he was aged just 22 . Mr Poyzer left school at 16 to become an apprentice at the Raleigh bike factory in Nottingham. Over the four decades he juggled his degree with running a business, writing a novel and looking after three children ¿ and later four grandchildren . He was then among 25,000 students who started the Open University in 1971, when it was set up - the same year that decimal currency was introduced. A year before he started his degree, he married Susan, 63, had his first child, Christopher in 1975, his second, Victoria in 1977, and third Joseph in 1985. He opened his business, Super Cycles, in 1977 and in 2001 he moved his shop and re-named it Rock 'n' Roll Bikes, which he still runs. But the whole time My Poyzer kept going back to his degree. In total it has cost him £2,500 to complete the course on-and-off over the 43-year period. Following a ceremony in Birmingham . Symphony Hall last week his proud wife said: 'We're very, very proud of . him but now I can see him more and he'll have more time with the . grandchildren.' A spokesman . for the Open University said: 'Congratulations to Mr Poyzer for . returning to study after his long break and completing his degree.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 15:21 EST, 25 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:20 EST, 26 November 2013 . During a token policy appearance Monday in San Francisco, President Obama railed against Republicans for standing in the way of his 'comprehensive' immigration reform plans that would extend an amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. 'We've got to finish the job,' Obama said, referring to bipartisan legislation that passed the U.S. Senate in June but has long stalled in the House. 'It is long past time to reform an immigration system that doesn't serve America as well as it should,' he told a crowd estimated at 600. 'We could be doing so much more to unleash America's potential.' Protesters interrupted him at one point, shouting 'Stop deportations!' and begging him to use an executive order to fix the nation's immigration failings. 'You have the power,' one yelled. 'Actually, I don't,' Obama replied. 'If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so,' he insisted. 'But we are a nation of laws.' As business leaders – including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg – have begun to issue public demands for looser immigration policies, both parties are feeling pressure. An anti-deportation protester (R) in the audience shouted down the president until Obama insisted that he's powerless to act without Congress . Obama tried to pressure the GOP by insisting that business leaders, including many who didn't vote for him, favor a new immigration plan . Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, seen with his Chinese-American wife Priscilla Chan, is arguing for looser immigration policies in what some say is a power grab to free up cheaper labor in the U.S. Video Source C-SPAN . 'The . only thing standing in our way right now,' Obama said, 'is the . unwillingness of certain Republicans in congress to catch up with the . rest of the country. On Sunday, Zuckerberg said on the ABC . program 'This Week' that immigration reform is one of the 'biggest civil . rights issues of our time' and said it's 'really heartbreaking' to see . children of illegal immigrants shut out of employment opportunities . through no fault of their own. But skeptics believe big business is engaged in a naked political ploy for a cheaper source of domestic labor. 'America is not an oligarchy,' Republican Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions complained on Monday. 'Congressional . leaders must forcefully reject the notion, evidently accepted by the . President, that a small cadre of CEOs can tailor the nation’s entire . immigration policy to suit their narrow interests.' Obama spoke at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center in San Francisco, where he is scheduled to appear at two Democratic fundraisers before flying to Los Angeles for more cash-collection events . Obama, Sessions noted, 'is preparing to hold a . fundraiser with Silicon Valley executives, a group clamoring for more . guest workers at a time when nearly half of recent college grads are . underemployed.' Obama, however, said immigration reform is 'the smart thing to do' economically, claiming it 'would boost our economy and shrink our deficits.' Some in the GOP, most notably Senate moderates, have made their peace with proposals that would give legal residency to people who live in the U.S. illegally and put many on a path to citizenship. But House hard-liners have embraced an over-our-dead-bodies approach, holding out for tougher enforcement and tighter border security as a condition of any new law. Obama is on a West Coast fundraising swing, appearing at seven separate events to collect cash for Democrats. But in order to justify the government expense involved with travel for the better part of a week, the White House scheduled one policy speech at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center and another at Dreamworks, the film studio, in Los Angeles. The National Taxpayers Union Foundation estimates that it costs $176,000 per hour to operate Air Force One, the president's private aircraft. Speaking to reporters on board the plane on Monday, Deputy White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest claimed that 'there is strong bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for common-sense immigration reform.' Citizen engagement: Obama turned to talk with the agitator while the audience of 600 waited . Immigration activists like thee in Atlanta have taken protests directly to ICE's offices, insisting that the government should stop departing illegal immigrants . Surprise! Obama is the undisputed king of illegal-immigrant deportations, but is now calling for a new national policy . Monday's heavily stage-managed event managed to let some protesters through, despite the White House's best efforts to control the president's image . 'The only thing that’s blocking that right now is not one party, it’s one faction of one party.' He complained of 'significant consequences for our economy' if an immigration reform bill does not reach the president's desk. Obama faces discontent from immigration activists who demand an immediate halt to deportations, which have reached all-time high numbers since his first inauguration. In 2011 alone, the Obama administration sent 392,000 illegal immigrants back to their home countries, according to statistics from the Department of Homeland Security. Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions complained that an 'oligarchy' of business titans is trying to manipulate immigration policy to serve their own narrow interests . But Sen. Sessions, the most senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, warned Monday that Obama has a 'dismal record on immigration.' 'During his time in office, the president has systematically dismantled interior enforcement, handcuffing immigration officers and bypassing Congress. ... No agreement should be entered into while such lawlessness continues.' Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, raised hackles among border guards inside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency when he weighed on immigration in this month. Chris Crane, President of the National ICE Council, criticized him on Monday for supporting the immigration bill that passed in the Senate earlier this year. 'Why did you support a bill, S. 744, which legalizes aliens with extensive criminal records, including sex offenders, gang members and other violent and dangerous criminal aliens?' he asked. 'Until Mr. Zuckerberg meets with officers and learns the truth about our immigration system, I would respectfully suggest he suspend his lobbying activities.' House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy said Sunday on the CBS 'Face the Nation' program that the GOP will ultimately back some sort of reform, but with conditions attached that the Senate may not like. Chris Crane, President of the National ICE Council, criticized Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for supporting Senate legislation that 'legalizes aliens with extensive criminal records, including sex offenders, gang members and other violent and dangerous criminal aliens' Obama is in San Francsisco to attend fundraisers, and squeezed a single policy speech into his itinerary to justify the government's travel expenses on the political trip . 'Immigration reform is going to happen,' McCarthy said, 'but it’s going to happen in a step-by-step method. ... We have a broken process – the immigration system, it is broken. It needs to be fixed.' Bone of contention: The Rio Grande River marks the U.S.-Mexico Border with Juarez, Mexico on the left (south) side and El Paso, Texas on the right (north). Thousands of illegal immigrants cross the border here every week . Those steps include new border security measures, including spending billions to wall off America's southern border with Mexico. Also on the GOP's wish list is a system of enforcement that will stop the annual release of thousands of criminal aliens from immigration detention facilities. Obama has seemingly endorsed these measures, but won't agree to implement them in advance of establishing 'an earned path to citizenship' – what some in the GOP see as an amnesty for as many as 11 million lawbreakers. House Republicans lack a political incentive to act any time soon, since only a handful have enough Latino constituents to pose a re-election risk in 2014. A poll released Monday by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute found that most Americans – including a majority of Republicans – support a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. But barely one-third of Republicans say there's enough urgency in the problem to suggest that it should be addressed in the coming few years. Obama also lacks the long coat-tails that marked his first term in office. His is a damaged brand, reeling from the failures of Obamacare and leaking political capital in the wake of a nuclear deal with Iran that has polarized Capitol Hill. But he insisted Monday that 'everybody wins if we get this done.' 'It's up to Republicans in the House to decide if we can move forward ... If they don't want to see it happen, they've got to explain why.'","Business leaders including Facebook's CEO are demanding looser immigration policies but skeptics say they're only after cheaper labor .

Beleaguered New Jersey Governor Chris Christie just gained a brand new headache Monday when it was revealed a state trooper from his security detail was arrested last month for shoplifting, among other things, gun accessories. Trooper William Carvounis, 35, of North Brunswick, was at a Cabela's sporting goods store on January 8 when he put several items in his cargo pants pockets — including some handgun grips, and a pistol magazine among other items — according to Tilden police. Surveillance footage allegedly reveals Carvounis even tried to walk out of the store wearing a stolen hat, the same one he wore while begging police not to arrest him 'out of professional courtesy.' Gone fishin': A member of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's security detail was arrested January 8 on shoplifting charges, it was revealed Monday. Trooper William Carvounis allegedly pocketed nearly $300 in merchandise including gun accessories at a Pennsylvania Cabela's sporting goods store . While Carvounis paid for some items at checkout, he allegedly did not pay for the concealed items, which were worth $267.38. Tilden Township Chief William McEllroy confirmed the arrest first reported by NewJersey.Watchdog.org, a news website run by an investigative reporter. Bad timing: The revelation could become yet another thorn in the beleaguered governor's side. Trooper Carvoulis was suspended from duty by the New Jersey State Police as soon as they learned of his arrest . The Watchdog also confirmed that Carvounis is a State Trooper who is part of the governor's security detail. 'Carvounis said he was on the governor’s security detail,' McEllroy said. 'He said he makes $140,000 a year, and he’s afraid of losing his job.' 'We don’t give preferential treatment when someone breaks the law,' replied McEllroy. Carvounis didn't explicitly ask for the break because of his position on the governor's detail; it was 'more or less one cop asking another cop for a break multiple times,' McEllroy said. The trooper's attorney, Charles Sciarra, said his client denies he sought special treatment and the underlying shoplifting charges. He said a police report and the criminal complaint don't mention the trooper asking for a break. 'The initial reports we have don't indicate anything about such a request,' said Sciarra. 'With that said, my client made purchases that day and denies any allegation of any shoplifting. And quite frankly, we see no connection between what's occurred in the store in Pennsylvania and his duties for the New Jersey State Police.' Sciarra confirmed that Carvounis has been suspended from his job. He said 'his suspension paperwork from the state police does not mention anything about asking for a courtesy and abusing his position.' Carvounis is charged with two counts of retail theft, online court records show. One is a first-degree misdemeanor that can carry up to five years' in prison, and the other a summary offense, which is similar to a traffic ticket. The trooper remained free on bond Monday, and court records show he has waived his right to a preliminary hearing, meaning the charges must be disposed of at a trial or through a plea in Berks County Common Pleas Court.

A former RAF serviceman has been found guilty of stabbing his wife to death during a drunken row over her shopping habits. James Roy Simister, 49, dialled 999 to request help after repeatedly plunging a blade into his wife Deborah's neck during an argument at their home in Amesbury, Wiltshire on April 8 last year. Simister later claimed he couldn’t remember attacking the 45-year-old mother-of-one, with a breathalyser test showing him to have been four times over the drink-drive limit at the time. Murder: James Roy Simister (left) dialled 999 to request help after repeatedly plunging a blade into the neck of his wife Deborah (right) during an argument at their home on April 8 last year . Deborah, who had been married to James Roy Simister for five years, had previously told friends and family that she wanted to separate from her husband. Winchester Crown Court heard she had packed her bags and was planning to leave Simister the next day to stay with her elderly father for a few weeks. The couple, known as Roy and Debbie, . had a volatile relationship with a history of domestic violence and . alcohol abuse, the jury heard. The pair had apparently spent the afternoon of Monday, April 8 . drinking after a shopping trip to Andover with one of Mrs Simister's . daughters. The court heard the pair got into an . argument about how much they spent on other family members, before Simister lashed out with a knife. Mrs Simister was stabbed several times in her neck and died later in hospital. Following the attack, Simister called 999 and said: 'I’ve just stabbed my wife.' Asked if she was all right, he responded: 'No, she’s dying. Please get here.' Winchester Crown Court (pictured) heard Deborah Simister had packed her bags and was planning to leave her husband the next day to stay with her elderly father for a few weeks . Simister, who was four times over the drink drive limit when the stabbing occurred, admitted his relationship with his wife often led to violence. Giving evidence, he said: 'It was always something of nothing...It wasn’t the best, we were trying to sort ourselves out to a future we could enjoy.' A jury convicted him of murder today following a trial at Winchester Crown Court in Hampshire. Simister will be sentenced at the same court on Monday. The murder victim’s family released a tribute to her at the end of the tragic case. It said: 'We are happy with the verdict and the fact that he was found to be guilty, but no amount of imprisonment will bring back our precious Debs.' 'She was the heart and soul of our family and now that she is no longer with us, we are completely torn apart. 'All generations have been affected, not to mention that she will never see her beautiful grandchildren grow up. 'Heaven has gained an angel and she will always live on in our hearts. Now it is all over we can finally put it all to rest and move forward.' Detective Sergeant Pete Ritson, of the Wiltshire Police Major Crime Investigation Team, said: 'Tragically, Roy Simister’s actions that night deprived Debbie of that chance to leave and continue making positive changes in her life. 'The outcome today may not bring much comfort to Debbie’s friends and family but we hope that they feel justice has been done.

The son of Benjamin Netanyahu has caused outrage in Israel after it has been revealed that he is dating a Norwegian girl – who is not Jewish. Yair Netanyahu, 23, has allegedly been seeing blonde communications student Sandra Leikanger, 25, since last summer and even visited her home country. Their love affair was cabled out across the world after Norway’s prime minister Erna Solberg revealed that Mr Netanyahu had been ‘boasting’ of his son’s relationship with Miss Leikanger, when they met at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week. Young love: Benjamin Netanyahu's son Yair, 23, with his girlfriend, Norwegian student Sandra Leikangen, 25 . Ms Solberg said that Netanyahu had spoken of ‘new friends’ and mentioned that his son had recently visited Norway with his girlfriend – Sandra from Grimstad in southern Norway. Norwegian newspaper Dagen soon tracked down Miss Leikanger’s Facebook which had several photographs of the smiling couple, including one depicting the pair in the Norwegian archipelago, taken in September last year. The story quickly spread to the newspaper gossip pages in Israel, and resulted in a backlash from orthodox Jewish organisations in the country. On Monday, the leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party said he believed the relationship actually caused Netanyahu and his wife great ‘heartache.’ Arieh Deri told a local radio station the relationship was no mere personal matter because Netanyahu is a ‘symbol of the Jewish people.’ Let the cat out: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, pictured with his wife Sara, 'boasted' about his son's relationship, and recent trip to Norway, to the country's prime minister Erna Solberg in Davos last week . ‘I know friends of mine who invest tens of millions and more, hundreds of millions to fight assimilation in the world,’ Deri told the Kol Barama station. ‘If God forbid it's true, woe to us.’ Other groups called on Netanyahu to put a stop to the relationship. Even the prime minister's brother in law, Hagai Ben-Artzi, took to the airwaves to speak out against it. ‘Yair should know that if he does such a thing, if he doesn't break off the relationship, then ... he is spitting on the graves of his grandmother and grandfather who loved him so much and raised him,’ Ben-Artzi told Kikar Shabbat, an ultra-Orthodox news site. Miss Leikanger has not commented in Norwegian or Israeli media on her relationship with Yair whom she met at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, where they both study. She has instead restricted her social network accounts. Mr Netanyahu the younger already has strict privacy settings on his, after he posted offensive comments regarding Arab-Israeli relations as a teenager. Israel always had an ultra-Orthodox minority of devout and conservative Jews, who despite accounting for just under a tenth of the population, oversee weddings, divorces and burials. As a result, should Miss Leikanger and Yair ever wish to tie the knot, she must convert to Judaism for them to be able to do so in Israel. Yossi Sarid, a former Israeli education minister and onetime leader of the secular-rights party Meretz, called the younger Netanyahu's love life a ‘private matter.’ But he said the uproar among the religious was ‘nonsense.’ ‘It's not fair. You can't expect fairness from those people,’ Sarid said. ‘They don't like non-Jews. They don't like non-Orthodox Jews. They are behaving as fanatics everywhere behave.’ Early Wednesday morning, the office of Benjamin Netanyahu denied that Yair was dating Miss Leikanger, telling Channel 10 that the two 'only study together' and that he had not spoken to Norwegian PM Solberg about his son.","Benjamin Netanyahu's son Yair is dating 25-year-old Sandra Leikanger .

Thieves are cashing in on the devastating floods by stealing warning signs to sell for scrap metal, it has been claimed. The theft of the signs in the past month has led to dozens of motorists driving into flooded areas unaware and getting stuck in their cars after their engines conked out. One car which may have been a victim was a £60,000 Audi which was stripped bare by thieves after the driver abandoned it after driving into floodwater in Chertsey, Surrey, last month. A BMWs which attempted to cross Trescott Ford near Wolverhampton appears to have been abandoned and looted . The abandoned car near Wolverhampton was left with smashed windows, as councils across the country reported incidents of alleged looting . The BMW 5 series was left in over two ft of water as the country was battered by floods and gale force winds . Council chiefs in Surrey said the 600 signs - stolen from all over the county, but particularly in Spelthorne and Runnymede - would cost £23,000 to replace. Local Grant Garvey, 36, said: 'Whoever is taking the signs should know they are the worst kind of thieves. 'They are removing important safety signs to sell on for just a few quid in scrap metal - they have no thought at all for other people.' A Surrey County Council spokesman said: . 'We have been appalled during the flooding by the theft of warning . signs, which are there for the safety of our residents and motorists. Stuck in the mud: This £60,000 sports car was abandoned by its owner when its engine stopped on a flooded road and within a fortnight was 'ripped to shreds' by thieves . Vanished: All of the car's plush fittings have been taken and its remains have been left to rust on the roadside . 'In Spelthorne and Runnymede, about 600 signs have disappeared at a total cost to our contractor of about £23,000. 'This theft is a cynical and dangerous act at a time when many people are in difficult and distressing circumstances.' In the flood-stricken Somerset Levels meanwhile, three more alleged fuel thieves have been arrested. Police stopped the trio at 4am today near the flooded village Muchelney and found drums and an electric pump in their 4x4.

Police have ordered further tests on the body of a 16-year-old boy who died from an ecstasy overdose. Daniel Spargo-Mabbs died in hospital on Monday after collapsing at a rave on an industrial site in Hayes, west London. He suffered a massive heart attack at the party on Saturday night, and passed away in his mother's arms two days later in an intensive care unit. But a post-mortem failed to establish a definitive cause of death for the sixth-former from Croydon, south London, who heartbreakingly promised his parents 'I won't die' as he left for the event. Two people have been charged with drugs offences following the death of Daniel from Croydon in south London. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'A post-mortem examination took place on Thursday at Uxbridge Mortuary. 'No formal cause of death has been given at this stage and we await the results of further tests. 'Detectives from Hillingdon are investigating. 'Two men, aged 18 and 20, have been charged in relation to the incident. Both have been remanded in custody to appear at Isleworth Crown Court in February. 'A third man, aged 19, was arrested in connection with the incident has been bailed until a date in late March, pending further investigation.' Daniel's mother, Fiona Spargo-Mabbs, 46, spoke of the 'peaceful' moment her son - who had dreams of joining the army - died in her arms. Tragedy: Daniel fell ill after taking ecstasy at a rave in Hayes, west London, in the early hours of Saturday and, despite hospital treatment, died on Monday in the arms of his mother . She said she was grateful for the chance to say goodbye to him in person rather than him being killed on active duty. Mrs Spargo-Mabbs said: 'He could have gone to Afghanistan and been blown to smithereens, but I got to hold him while he died,' said Mrs Spargo-Mabbs. 'It was so peaceful and we all got to say goodbye and we were all with him.' The mother-of-two said that before Daniel's death her family had seen the negative effects of drugs through a relative who had battled addiction, and warned other parents not to be naive about their children taking illegal substances. Fantastic boy: Mrs Spargo-Mabbs said her son was a 'good kid with a sense of adventure' 'We have seen at first hand the effect . of addiction and the knock-on effect on the wider family, and he knew . what that looked like,' she said. 'We told him just don’t even do it once. You just don’t know if that’s going to be you. But Daniel would have known people that would have done it and said it was amazing.' Heartbroken: Fiona Spargo-Mabbs, 46, has described the moment her son died in her arms . 'However good they are and however much you think you know what they might be aware of, if you’ve got a teenager they will know people who have taken drugs. And it’s frighteningly cheap, it’s pocket money.' Daniel's parents have left his bed unmade in his bedroom at their home in Croydon, south London, which has a collage of photographs stuck to the walls and a Prom King certificate from last summer. His father Tim opens and closes the curtains each day. He said: 'He is never coming back. Nobody is ever going to sleep in that bed again, he will never enter this house again. 'What used to be a lively vibrant room is now still and empty and quiet. It’s just awful.' The couple, who also have an 18-year-old son, Jacob, said they have had messages of support from all over the world including Australia, Cambodia, India and the United States, and hope to raise awareness of the dangers of drug-taking. Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, from Croydon, and Ryan Kirk, 20, from Beckenham, both south London, appeared at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court yesterday and are next due at Isleworth Crown Court on February 5.","Daniel Spargo-Mabbs died on Monday after taking pill at a rave in London .

Hundreds of thousands from outside the EU will be eligible to work in Britain from today because of a passport giveaway by Bulgaria and Romania. It will give some of the poorest in Europe the right to live and work here. Bulgaria and Romania are offering national status to minority or ethnic groups living in non-EU states including Moldova, Macedonia, Serbia, Ukraine and Turkey. Romania and Bulgaria have been handing out passports to thousands of non-EU citizens, allowing them to come and work in Britain now that visa restrictions are lifted . Officials in Bulgaria have already issued 90,000 passports to Macedonians, while Romania is offering all of Moldova’s four million population the opportunity to obtain Romanian nationality. A further 300,000 in Turkey can apply for Bulgarian passports. Hungary has granted EU passports to those in neighbouring countries. There are only two conditions – a direct ancestor who was a Hungarian citizen and a basic knowledge of the language. Some 100,000 from Serbia have applied. Meanwhile Malta has announced plans to sell EU passports to foreigners for 650,000 euros from today. Thousands of migrants have used Bulgarian or Romanian passports to move to other EU countries since the two states joined seven years ago. From today they will be able to do the same to get into Britain, as the working restrictions on those with Bulgarian and Romanian passports are being lifted. Romania has offered a passport to all four million of Moldova's citizens while Bulgaria has issued 90,000 passports to Macedonians . Bulgaria has been criticised for its lax procedures for issuing passports and corrupt officials have been accused of fast-tracking applications for less than £200. It originally set up its passport giveaway to strengthen links with the 2.5million Bulgarian ethnic minorities in neighbouring countries – it has long claimed that Macedonia, formerly part of Yugoslavia, is Bulgarian. However, many applicants do not speak Bulgarian, do not have Bulgarian heritage, know nothing about the country and are motivated by the prospect of getting into the EU job market. Romania has issued passports to more than 120,000 Moldovans. Moldova, one of the poorest countries in Europe, was part of Romania until 1940, when it was annexed by the Soviet Union. When Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU in January 2007, temporary curbs were placed on the type of work their nationals could take in the UK. The curbs have been lifted from today because under treaty rules they cannot be extended any further. Bulgarians and Romanians will be entitled to claim the same benefits and NHS care as other EU citizens. Yesterday the Mail revealed how many flights and coaches from Romania and Bulgaria to London this week are fully booked, while some experts have predicted a 50,000-a-year surge in migrants from the two countries. Last night Bojdar Dimitrov, a former government minister in Bulgaria, said his government had issued tens of thousands of passports to Macedonians and is continuing to do so. Mr Dimitrov, a Bulgarian nationalist who supports the expansion of his people, said: ‘Bulgarian citizenship is very popular in Macedonia. Almost 90,000 Macedonians have been issued with Bulgarian passports. ‘When I was in the foreign ministry we . would issue 500 passports a week. All they would need to prove was that . they had Bulgarian heritage. ‘Romania . has a more liberal immigration law even than Bulgaria. Everyone who . lives in Moldova, which was part of Romania before the end of the Second . World War, has the right to receive a Romanian passport within two . weeks of applying.’ Some experts have predicted a 50,000-a-year surge in migrants from the two countries . He said that 20,000 Serbians also have Bulgarian passports but added: ‘It is not the Bulgarians you need to be concerned about in Britain but the Moldovans, Russians and Ukrainians, who will take advantage of the relaxed laws in Romania to claim EU passports to travel to your country.’ Last night MigrationWatch chairman Sir Andrew Green said: ‘The issue of EU passports to people who are not citizens is bound to widen the pool of people who can migrate to Northern Europe. It may even be that they acquired the passports for that very purpose.’ David Cameron was urged earlier this week by 90 senior Tories to re–impose controls on Bulgarian and Romanian migrants or risk social unrest. They demanded that the Prime Minister use a little-known clause in EU law that allows governments to continue with border controls if their country is ‘undergoing or foresees serious labour market disturbances’. Labour home affairs spokesman  Yvette Cooper said of the lifting of controls: ‘We need a calm, considered debate and practical policies. Sadly, from the Government, we’ve had little of either. ‘They still aren’t addressing the practical problems around those who exploit migrant workers to undercut local businesses and staff.’","Bulgaria and Romanian offering passports to non-EU citizens .

Nelson Mandela remains in a 'serious but stable' condition as he spends a third day in hospital, the South African government said today. President Jacob Zuma called for the country to 'pray for Madiba' as his office announced Mr Mandela's 'condition is unchanged.' The former president, who will be 95 next month, was taken to hospital on Saturday after experiencing breathing difficulties. He has been hospitalised four times in the last six months. Scroll down for video . Nelson Mandela remains in a 'serious but stable' condition after spending a fifth night in hospital for a lung infection. He is pictured here on April 29 recuperating at home after being hospitalised with pneumonia . President Jacob Zuma was seen placing a hand on Mr Mandela's following his release from hospital in April . The government has previously played down fears over the ailing health of Mr Mandela, also known by his clan name Madiba. He is said to be conscious, able to breathe on his own and communicate. Today, Archbishop Desmond Tutu made the ailing leader the focus of his prayers. 'As the beloved father of our nation ... Nelson Mandela once again endures the ravages of time in hospital our prayers are for his comfort and his dignity,' a statement from Desmond and Leah Tutu's foundation said. 'We offer our thanks to God for the extraordinary gift of Mr Mandela, and wish his family strength,' Tutu said. Mr Mandela’s wife, Graça Machel, accompanied him to hospital in Pretoria and remains at his bedside. 'President Jacob Zuma reiterates his call . for South Africa to pray for Madiba and the family during this time,' the presidential statement said. Yesterday, members of the Mandela family were seen visiting the hospital where the anti-apartheid leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate is believed to be staying. His wife, 67, cancelled an appearance at a high-profile hunger summit in London yesterday to be with her husband. Ms Machel was due to address the Nutrition for Growth meeting in the capital along with dozens of African leaders, non-governmental organisations and charities, as well as speakers such as Bill Gates and Justine Greening, Secretary of State for International Development.

Ndileka Mandela, left, and Makaziwe Mandela, right, were seen leaving the Mediclinic Heart Hospital on Sunday in Pretoria where their father is believed to be staying . During a hospital stay in April, doctors diagnosed Mr Mandela with pneumonia and drained fluid from his chest. On . April 29, state television broadcast footage of a visit by Zuma and . other leaders of the ruling African National Congress to Mandela's home. President Zuma said then that Mandela was in good shape, but the footage - the first public images of Mandela in nearly a year - showed him silent and unresponsive, even when Zuma tried to hold his hand. Mr Mandela has been particularly vulnerable to respiratory problems since contracting tuberculosis during 27 years as the prisoner of the white South African government. The bulk of that period was spent on Robben Island, off the coast of Cape Town where Mandela and other prisoners spent part of the time toiling in a stone quarry. Mandela, seen at his 94th birthday celebrations last year, has his wife Graça Machel at his bedside . The treatment for a recurring lung infection is Mr Mandela's fourth hospitalisation in six months . Mandela was freed in 1990 and won election to the presidency in the country's first all-race elections in 1994. He was seen by many around the world as a symbol of resolve and reconciliation for his sacrifice in confinement as well as his peacemaking efforts during the tense transition that saw the demise of the apartheid system. The former leader retired from public life years ago and had received medical care at home in Johannesburg until his latest transfer to a hospital.

Wasted: The MoD has bought 2million too many bullets for troops in Afghanistan this year (stock image) The Ministry of Defence has bought twice as many bullets as it needs for troops in Afghanistan, at a cost to taxpayers of around £500,000. The department has ordered around four million bullets, despite the fact that forces will be slowly withdrawn from Helmand province throughout the year. The MoD has said it expects it will need only around 50 per cent of the bullets as troop numbers are reduced from 8,000 soldiers to around 5,000. But it has admitted it is tied into contracts - described as 'committed purchases in the system based on previous estimates' - which means it has had to pay for the full amount. The extra bullets cannot be saved for future conflicts as they have a use-by date after which the propellant perishes and they become useless. The MoD has already started recycling 400 tonnes of brass ammunition casings to save costs after installing a furnace at Camp Bastion. Out-of-date bullets are also being destroyed at a facility in Sweden, which aims to recycle 95 per cent of the material. But the department has admitted there are 'limited outlets for reusing ammunition' and that it is attempting to negotiate selling surplus bullets back to manufacturers. In an article in the government department's own magazine, Defence Focus, the 2million wasted bullets are compared to a family having to throw out mouldy yoghurts. 'It happens in every household,' the report said. 'You get to the end of the week, and you . are cursing yourself for buying all those yoghurts you haven’t eaten. And despite being determined to keep the housekeeping costs under . control, yet again you are pitching out products past their sell by . date.' The purchasing of ammunition is organised by the Defence General Munitions project team, part of the MoD's Weapons Operating Centre. Conflict: The number of troops in Afghanistan is being reduced from 8,000 to around 5,000 this year . The DGM's Colonel Richard Aspray told Defence Focus: 'Supplying safe and suitable munitions to meet operational and . training requirements while reducing your spend and using up your . stockpile holdings means striking a very fine balance. 'Buy too much and your stockpile goes up, buy too little and you risk . putting personnel in danger of running low at a critical moment.' An MoD spokesman: 'It is wrong to suggest that the MoD has been wasteful. No-one would want our troops to run out of ammunition whilst on operations and we have to plan for the worst possible scenarios – it is clearly better to have more than enough ammunition than not enough.'","MoD bought 4million bullets despite reduction in troop numbers in Helmand .

Russian men who drink at least 1.5 litres of vodka per week run a 35 per cent of dying before 55, researchers from Oxford University found. The average Russian adult drinks 20 litres of vodka per year while the average Briton drinks about three litres of spirits. From Russia with l-hic!-ove: Russian men who drink at least 1.5 litres of vodka per week run a 35 per cent of dying before 55 . Overall, 25 per cent Russian men die before reaching 55, compared with seven per cent of men in the UK, and the male life expectancy in Russia is 64 years. Although it is not clear how many Russian men more than 1.5litres of vodka a week, lead researcher Sir Richard Peto of Oxford University said the average Russian adult drinks 20 litres of vodka per year. ‘Russians clearly drink a lot, but it's this pattern of getting really smashed on vodka and then continuing to drink that is dangerous,’ Peto said. ‘The rate of men dying prematurely in Russia is totally out of line with the rest of Europe,’ he said. ‘There's also a heavy drinking culture in Finland and Poland but they still have nothing like Russia's risk of death.’ The nation's favourite: The average Russian man drinks 20 litres of vodka per year - not including other spirits - compared to Britons who consume an average of three litres of any spirits per year . Alcohol has long been a top killer in Russia and vodka is often the drink of choice, available cheaply and often homemade in small villages. Previous studies have estimated that more than 40 per cent of working-age men in Russia die because they drink too much, including using alcohol that is not meant to be consumed like that in colognes and antiseptics. Drinking is so engrained in Russian culture there's a word that describes a drinking binge that lasts several days: ‘zapoi.’ Other experts said the Russian preference for hard liquor was particularly dangerous. ‘If you're drinking vodka, you get a lot more ethanol in that than if you were drinking something like lager,’ said David Leon, a professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who has also studied the impact of alcohol in Russia but was not part of the Lancet study. Part of the culture: Two men have fallen asleep after drinking on a bench in downtown Moscow . He said changing drinking patterns in Russia to combat the problem was possible but that it would take a significant cultural adjustments. ‘It's not considered out-of-order to drink until you can't function in Russia,’ Leon said. ‘It just seems to be part of being a guy in Russia that you are expected to drink heavily.’ The team from Oxford University tracked 150,000 adult men in the Russian cities of Barnaul, Byisk and Tomsk from 1999 to 2010. They interviewed them about their drinking habits and, when about 8,000 later died, followed up to monitor their causes of death.","A quarter of Russian men die before they turn 55 .

The CEO of the company at the center of a chemical leak in West Virginia that has left more than 300,000 people without drinking water for four days is facing mounting criticism following his arrogant display before the television cameras on Friday night. Freedom Industries President Gary Southern sounded rude and aloof as he attempted to cut short his press conference in Charleston after complaining to reporters that he had had a long day. To make matters worse Southern repeatedly swigged from a water of bottle, seemingly impervious to the fact that his company had disrupted water services in nine counties, depriving 300,000 people of tap water to drink or even wash themselves. Scroll down for video . Thirsty work: Freedom Industries President Gary Southern repeatedly swigged from a water of bottle on Friday, seemingly impervious to the fact that his company had depriving 300,000 people of tap water to drink or even wash themselves . Beware: More than 300,000 people have been told to indefinitely avoid drinking or even touching tap water following Thursday's chemical spill in Charleston, West Virgina . During his abbreviated press conference, Southern issued an apology for the chemical spill, but he quickly turned terse when it came times for questions. ‘Look guys, it’s been an extremely long day. I’m having a lot of trouble talking at the moment. I’d appreciate it if we could wrap this thing up,’ he complained. But before Southern could walk away, he was quickly interrupted by local news anchor/reporter Kallie Cart from WCHS8. ‘We actually have a lot of questions,’ said the persistent reporter. ‘It’s been a long day for a lot of people who don’t have water.’ Local news anchor/reporter Kallie Cart from WCHS8 has won plaudits for her dogged interview style . When her line of questioning started to get a little awkward for Southern, he made another ill-judged attempt to wrap things up by saying ‘that’s all we have time for.’ Once again Cart was quick to stop Southern in his tracks. 'We're not done!' she shouted as Southern turned his back on the cameras. The look he gives her as he realizes that he is going to have to take another question is priceless. Cart has received praise for her handling of the water crisis and for her dogged interview style on both Facebook and Twitter, while Southern's ill-judged lack of compassion has been compared to Tony Hayward, the disgraced former boss of BP. In the wake of Southern's disastrous TV appearance, Freedom Industries' local public relations firm Charleston Ryan Associates announced on Sunday that it has decided it will no longer represent the chemicals company, reports WCHS. Video: Watch Gary Southern's disastrous press conference . If looks could kill: Southern quickly grew terse when it came time for questions and he shot Cart an extremely dirty look when she called him back after he attempted to end their interview . It could be days before uncontaminated water is flowing again for about 300,000 people in nine West Virginia counties. Chris Laws found bottled water on Saturday for his two elderly next-door neighbors. ‘They can't get out,’ said Laws, 42, of Marmet, a coal miner. 'I'm keeping an eye on them. You got to watch out for your neighbors. They're the ones who are going to watch out for you.' He said he was angry at the company at the center of the leak, Freedom Industries. 'A lot of people are facing bad situations because of this,' he said. 'They're struggling. What I don't understand is how did this happen?' The emergency began on Thursday following complaints to West Virginia American Water about a licorice-type odor in the tap water. The source: the chemical 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, which had leaked out of a 40,000-gallon tank at a Freedom Industries facility along the Elk River. State officials said on Saturday they believe about 7,500 gallons leaked. Some of the chemical was contained before flowing into the river; it's not clear exactly how much entered the water supply. It could take days for clean tap water to flow again. First, water sample test results must consistently show that the chemical's presence in the public water system is at or below 1 parts per million, the level recommended by federal agencies, West Virginia American Water President Jeff McIntyre said on Saturday at a news conference. Southern, right, made an ill-judged attempt to wrap things up by saying 'that's all we have time for' and turning his back on the cameras while being questioned by Cart, left . Most visitors have cleared out of Charleston while locals are either staying home or driving out of the area to find a hot meal or a shower elsewhere. Orders not to use tap water for much other than flushing toilets mean that the spill is an emergency not just for the environment but for local businesses. 'I haven't been able to cook anything at home and was hoping they were open,' Bill Rogers, 52, said outside a closed Tudor's Biscuit World in Marmet, just east of Charleston. 'It seems like every place is closed. It's frustrating. Really frustrating.' There's no question businesses have been hurt - particularly restaurants and hotels, said Matt Ballard, president of the Charleston Area Alliance, the state's largest regional chamber of commerce. 'I don't know that it can be quantified at this point because we don't know how long it will last,' Ballard said. 'I'm hoping a solution by early next week so business can get back to normal.' The Alliance is urging business owners to check their insurance policies to see if they can make claims over lost sales. It plans to hold workshops to assist businesses with those issues, Ballard said. Dire need: Employees of the South Charleston Public Works Department help local residents to obtain water as officials remained mum as to win the tap water would become safe again . All told, 32 people have sought treatment at hospitals for symptoms such as nausea. Of those, four were admitted to the Charleston Area Medical Center but their conditions weren't immediately available. Federal authorities, including the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, opened an investigation into Thursday's spill. West Virginia National guard officials said they need a 24-hour period in which samples at the water treatment facility are below 1 part per million. Many samples are meeting the mark, but some are still hitting slightly above 1 part per million. After they achieve that goal, West Virginia American Water Company can begin sampling across the nine-county region and flushing the system. That process would take days, said company president Jeff McIntyre. According to Department of Environmental Protection officials, Freedom Industries is exempt from DEP inspections and permitting since it stores chemicals, and doesn't produce them. Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said he will work with his environmental agency chief on tightening regulation of chemical storage facilities in the current legislative session. Local businesses remain closed and unable to serve food and water in Charleston, West Virginia on Sunday after a chemical spill on Thursday in the Elk River . In downtown, the store Taylor Books usually fills the 40 seats in its cafe. But the cafe was shut down by the state Department of Health on Friday because it said employees had no way to safely wash their hands before serving customers. On Saturday only three people sat in the bookstore using the wireless Internet. Manager Dan Carlisle said he canceled a musician scheduled to play that night and the store was going to close five hours early. 'It's pretty annoying,' Carlisle said about Freedom Industries' response to the spill. 'I feel like you should just be honest with people immediately.' At Charleston's Yeager Airport, seven inbound and outbound flights were canceled. The reason for the cancellations was an agreement between the airlines and unions for flight crews and pilots that hotels meet a certain threshold of service, and the lack of water violates the agreement, said airport spokesman Brian Belcher. State officials were working over the weekend on alternative sources of water that may allow restaurants to reopen. Several businesses that had arranged other sources of water were inspected Saturday. 'We will work around the clock, 24-7, and try to open ... as many businesses as possible in the next couple of days,' said Dr. Rahul Gupta, health officer for the Kanawha-Charleston and Putnam County boards of health.","More than 300,000 people haven't had water to drink or wash in West Virginia since Thursday .
