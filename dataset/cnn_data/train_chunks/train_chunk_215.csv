"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China's bird flu crisis showed no sign of easing Tuesday as the death toll rose to nine, a government agency said. The National Health and Family Planning Commission announced two more fatalities Tuesday afternoon -- one in Anhui province and the other in Jiangsu province. These are the first bird flu-related deaths reported this year in those two provinces. Five deaths -- and just less than half of the 28 confirmed infections nationwide -- have been in Shanghai, according to the Chinese commission. The virus had been found in pigeons but had not previously been discovered in humans until a series of cases were reported in China last week. In Shanghai, more than 100,000 live birds have been killed in the past week at live-poultry markets across the city in an effort to contain the problem, the Shanghai Municipal Ministry of Agriculture said. A number of cities across China have also announced trading suspensions. During a news conference in Beijing on Monday, World Health Organization and Chinese health ministry officials tried to reassure the public about the outbreak, saying they would continue to jointly monitor the behavior of the virus. ""Although we do not know the source of the infection, at this time there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission,"" said the WHO's Michael O'Leary. The Chinese health agency also said Tuesday that there are no reported cases of human-to-human transmission. Liang Wannian, director of the H7N9 influenza prevention and control office under the National Health and Family Planning Commission, told reporters that 621 close contacts of infected patients had been monitored with no reported abnormalities. Meanwhile, Chinese Vice Premier Liu Yandong called for further efforts to prevent the spread of H7N9 infections and the treatment of patients after visiting the country's disease control center on Monday, Xinhua reported. She also urged more transparency in information about the virus and said any new infection should be discovered, reported, diagnosed and treated as early as possible. She added that President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang were paying close attention to the crisis. In 2003, during the SARS outbreak, Chinese authorities were accused of acting slowly and concealing the extent of the problem in an effort to ease fears about the spread of the epidemic. CNN's Ke Feng in Beijing contributed to this report.","NEW: Two bird flu deaths occur in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, a government agency says .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A narrow window of time is closing quickly for Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who has infuriated the U.S. government by leaking details of surveillance programs after fleeing the country. As FBI agents gather evidence against him, the 29 year old is racing to find a permanent refuge while hiding out in Hong Kong on what's thought to be a 90-day tourist visa which could expire in early August. Experts say Snowden's visa is unlikely to be extended, as he would struggle to prove that his planned stay is temporary. ""Once the 90 days are over, and unless his visa is extended, he's an illegal immigrant here and could be picked up by the police for overstaying,"" said Professor Simon Young, director of the Centre for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong. What becomes of Snowden depends on a number of factors, not least when and if the U.S. submits a ""surrender request"" with the Hong Kong government to pave the way for Snowden's return to the U.S. Scenario 1: He applies to be a refugee and is spirited out of the city within 90 days . Snowden arrived in the city on May 20 and took refuge in a hotel where he made his revelations to the British-based Guardian newspaper before checking out on June 10. His whereabouts are unknown. It's not clear whether he has approached the local office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) -- the office has declined to comment on individual cases -- but Young said it was one way Snowden could extend his stay. ""The UNHCR is duty-bound to determine if he's a mandate refugee. If by some miracle they're able to do that within 90 days and say that he is a refugee, and secondly are able to find a place that will take him, then he could be off to that place,"" Young said. Speaking hypothetically, a protection officer for the UNHCR in Hong Kong said that Snowden would not be given preferential treatment. ""We prioritize older cases,"" Nazneen Farooqi said, according to the South China Morning Post. Claims through the UNHCR have been known to take years. Scenario 2: He finds a country willing to take him . Snowden has already sounded out Iceland for a potential asylum claim, according to WikiLeaks spokesman, Icelandic journalist Kristinn Hrafnsson. Hrafnsson told CNN he was asked by an intermediary, who he was ""100% certain"" was acting on behalf of Snowden, to approach the Icelandic government. Hrafnsson said he contacted two offices -- the interior ministry and the prime minister's office -- and the response was less than welcoming. POLL: Most Americans give Snowden thumbs down . ""They pointed to the legal code and the understanding, for example, that the asylum seeker must be in the jurisdiction before he can apply for asylum,"" Hrafnsson said. However, he added that he did not consider what he called the ministers' ""informal"" replies as a final answer. ""This is a matter not just for the government in Iceland but also the Icelandic parliament and an important issue to be debated among the general public."" When asked in a live chat Monday on the Guardian website why he didn't fly direct to Iceland, Snowden said he feared he'd be intercepted en route so he chose ""a country with the legal framework to allow me to work without being immediately detained."" He added that ""Iceland could be pushed harder, quicker, before the public could have a chance to make their feelings known, and I would not put that past the current U.S. administration."" A number of other countries have been floated as a possible refugee for the NSA leaker who has acknowledged that he can never go home. Early speculation centered on potential deal with China, however an opinion piece published Thursday in Communist Party newspaper, The Global Times, suggests that Beijing may be best advised to stay out of it. ""China should make good use of the 'one country, two systems' practice with regards to Hong Kong, and let the Hong Kong authorities deal with Snowden in accordance with their own laws,"" the author wrote. Another opinion piece in Communist Party paper The People's Daily suggested that Beijing should side with public opinion. ""The consequences of extraditing Snowden back to the U.S. would be more troublesome than the alternative, because the local reaction would bring more trouble to Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. China's growing power is attracting people to seek asylum in China. This is unavoidable and should be used to accumulate moral standing."" Scenario 3: His visa expires and he's arrested by Hong Kong police . If Snowden is still in Hong Kong when his visa expires, he'd most likely make an asylum claim, if he hasn't already gone to the UNHCR. ""If he was to make an asylum claim at that point in time then they wouldn't go ahead with the overstaying prosecution -- it would be suspended -- and then the asylum process kicks in,"" Young said. If Snowden sought asylum in Hong Kong, it's likely he'd file a torture claim, based on Articles 1 and 3 of the 1984 U.N. ""Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,"" Young said. However, Jo Renshaw, an immigration lawyer at Turnpin & Miller, said torture claims were hard to prove. ""The threshold for 'cruel, inhuman and degrading' is pretty high particularly when the country in question is the U.S. It has succeeded in relation to Russian prison conditions. It is arguable in the light of Bradley Manning but you would need to find a country which is willing to take on the U.S. and say that its treatment of prisoners breaches Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights,"" she said. Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier accused of providing classified information to website WikiLeaks, has claimed he has been mistreated in custody. In 2011, Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint alleging his client had been stripped, denied his glasses and confined to a cell for 23 hours a day with no pillow, sheets or personal items. Manning is appearing before a court-martial this week after pleading guilty to 10 of 22 charges against him and faces up to 20 years in jail. Scenario 4: He makes a run for it... Being spirited away on a plane or a boat might be attractive options for Snowden to escape Hong Kong authorities, if his visa is about to expire and the U.S. has yet to make its move. Young said until the U.S. files an arrest warrant -- or even a provisional one -- there's no onus on carriers to report Snowden's presence if he turns up at a departure gate. ""It may well be that informally that there are channels 'that these are individuals, if you do come across them let us know please' but nothing that obligates them to do this,"" he added. CNN asked a number of airlines whether they've been asked by authorities report Snowden. Cathay Pacific said in a statement: ""For privacy and security reasons, it would be inappropriate for us to discuss communications, if any, received from governmental agencies. It would be up to the sending agency to share the information it deems appropriate."" Qantas and Virgin Atlantic gave a similar response. If Snowden was able to make it onto a vessel, U.S. authorities would be limited in their ability arrest him, even if they were on board, said Dr Zhao Yun, associate professor at the University of Hong Kong. ""That would be a violation of the sovereignty of the airline,"" Zhao said, adding that the country where the airline is registered has jurisdiction over the flight. The same applies for ships, except in the case of piracy. However, he said if the alleged crime was serious enough -- for example, crimes against humanity, torture, slavery and hijacking -- universal jurisdiction kicks in. ""Crimes subject to universal jurisdiction are considered crimes against all (the entire world community),"" he said, adding ""In this sense, I do not think universal jurisdiction shall apply in (Snowden's) case."" Scenario 5: U.S. issues an arrest warrant and he's detained . This could be the worst case scenario for Snowden. If the U.S. issues a surrender warrant, Snowden could be detained by authorities in Hong Kong, after first being given the go-ahead by the territory's chief executive to arrest him. Once detained, Young said Snowden would likely appear in an open court where a magistrate would decide whether there is enough evidence to commit him to trial. Based on that decision, Hong Kong's chief executive would then decide whether to approve the surrender order and send Snowden back to the U.S. Under Hong Kong law, the surrender order could be blocked if it appears that the offense is of a political nature or if the alleged offender might be punished on the basis of his or her political opinions. However, other considerations would be the 1996 treaty between the U.N. and Hong Kong which takes precedence over the relevant law and includes a clause on ""offenses involving the unlawful use of computers,"" Young said.","Time is running out for Snowden before his 90-day Hong Kong tourist visa expires .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Rescuers searched typhoon-swept waters off South Korea's Jeju Island Tuesday for 28 Chinese fishermen missing in the wake of Typhoon Bolaven, a ferocious storm that headed for the Korean Peninsula after making landfall on Okinawa. Maritime police on Jeju Island said six people had been rescued but searches were on for the others after two boats capsized early Tuesday as Bolaven raged. Okinawa, meanwhile, emerged relatively unscathed after the typhoon swept it with maximum sustained winds near its center of 185 kilometers per hour (115 mph), according to the Hong Kong Observatory, which monitors storms in the region. That wind strength put Bolaven in the ""super typhoon"" category. And with a cloud field of 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), it was 20 times larger than Okinawa's length. But the island, which is situated in an area of the western Pacific Ocean where typhoons are frequent, avoided the kind of destruction that some other storms have caused in East Asia this summer. Five people were injured in Okinawa, the local authorities said, and 549 residents took shelter in public buildings to avoid potential damage to their homes. About 17,500 households lost electricity as the storm damaged power lines. Storm chaser James Reynolds was on the northwestern coast of the island during the worst of the typhoon. ""Like the rest of the population we all just kind of holed up in the strong and sturdy buildings which make up Okinawa,"" he said Monday. The infrastructure on Okinawa is designed to withstand violent storms. ""Everything's made of solid concrete,"" Reynolds said. The damage was also limited because Bolaven didn't bring winds as powerful as initially feared, said Morichiyo Ohshiro, an official from the Okinawa Prefecture Disaster Prevention and Crisis Management Division. North of Okinawa, the Amami Islands suffered a major power outage as a result of the typhoon. According to Kyushu Electric Power Corporation, which provides power to the area, 56,300 households were without power as of Monday morning. All residents of about 2,540 households on Yoron, one of the islands in the chain, were advised by the local authorities to relocate to nearby public facilities as the storm made its way northward. President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea on Monday called on government agencies to take measures to minimize damage from the approaching storm, the national news agency Yonhap reported, citing Park Jeong-ha, a spokesman for Lee. Isaac near hurricane strength; watch extends to Louisiana . Typhoon Tembin made landfall in southern Taiwan a few days ago, and was expected to work its way toward Hong Kong. But Bolaven, which is much stronger, has stopped Tembin's movement toward Hong Kong and has been spinning it around. Time: Most destructive U.S. hurricanes . ""As Typhoon Bolaven moves northward towards the Yellow Sea, it will drag Tembin toward the China coast very near Shanghai,"" said CNN International meteorologist Tom Sater.

"(CNN) -- As Rafael grew into a hurricane, residents and officials on the tiny island of Bermuda were expecting the storm to pass by Tuesday. The island's top emergency official said residents and tourists should see strong winds and rough seas as the storm approaches but expressed confidence that Rafael's impact would be minimal. ""We are expecting the worst of the storm to pass to our east, and it will therefore be business as usual tomorrow,"" Wayne Perinchief, chairman of Bermuda's Emergency Measures Organization, said Monday. Forecasters said the island might see 2 to 4 inches of rain from the storm. The storm, with 85 mph winds, was centered about 545 miles (about 880 kilometers) south of Bermuda on Monday night, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. It was moving north at 10 mph, forecasters said. ""It's far enough away for our culture to not feel a threat yet. ... We're so used to this, season after season. Most people have their plywood in their garages at home, already pre-cut and labeled,"" said resident John Manderson. ""So often, we get storms that come so close."" The 46-year-old telecommunications consultant said the harbor waters near his office in Hamilton, Bermuda, were calm Monday. Yet forecasters predicted the storm will become a hurricane later in the day. Authorities in Bermuda have issued a tropical storm warning, meaning tropical storm conditions are possible there within 36 hours. That warning doesn't faze residents, Manderson said, but a change in the forecast might. ""If people feel like we're going to have a direct hit or a Category 1 only 100 miles or less away, you'll see people running around like crazy just to finish preparations,"" he said. He updated CNN on Monday night, saying residents were still going on as normal but he expected to see residents take action in the morning. While the National Hurricane Center expects Rafael will stay well to the east of the Bahamas through Monday night, it is warning of life-threatening surf conditions and rip currents on the eastward-facing beaches of the Bahamas over the next few days. Farther south, the northern Leeward Islands, which were drenched by the storm over the weekend, can expect 1 to 3 additional inches of rain, bringing the total rainfall from Rafael in some pockets to as much as 12 inches, forecasters said. ""These rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, especially in areas of mountainous terrain,"" the hurricane center said.

"(CNN) -- Snow covers most of the lower 48 states after a week of wicked weather, but forecasters warned on Friday that it's not over yet. Freezing rain threatened parts of Texas, Missouri and Tennessee and a fresh snowstorm was expected to push into the Ohio Valley. Residents of Oklahoma and Arkansas are ""likely to see ice accumulate on top of snow and that could compromise power lines,"" said CNN meteorologist Bonnie Schneider. ""Keep that in mind for those of you traveling on Interstate 40 specifically."" Snow covers 65% of the ground in the lower 48 states, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. For comparison, last winter's top snow coverage for the lower 48 was nearly 48%. ""That was in February at the peak of winter and we're still in December,"" Schneider said. The powerful winter storm that dumped all that snow has moved out over the Atlantic, but not before depositing from 10 to 17 inches of snow across parts of Maine, according to the National Weather Service. Send us your photos and video of ice, snow, storms and sleet. Nationwide, storm-related incidents have been blamed for the deaths of 10 people, including two children in Arkansas and an 81-year-old Alabama man. He died Thursday of injuries suffered when a tree fell on his house in Georgiana. Snowfall totals of a foot or more were common throughout the Northeast: 21 inches fell in Woodford, Vermont; 17.4 inches in Addison, New York; and 15 inches in Ashfield, Massachusetts. The front was welcome news to snow enthusiasts in Vermont and northern New York. ""It will keep the ski resorts happy and they won't waste money making snow,"" said John Goff, lead forecaster of the National Weather Service office in Burlington. The area hopes to return to a normal winter of about 80 inches of snow, up dramatically from the scant 37 to 38 inches it received last season, Goff said. ""Usually you get one or two whoppers like this and it will get you caught up quickly."" Snowfall totals will be smaller Saturday, he predicted, with 2 to 4 inches in valleys and 3 to 6 inches in the mountains. Caleb Clark, a CNN iReporter in Brattleboro in southern Vermont, called it a 'classic snowstorm.' "" ""(It is) a nice and fluffy New England snow, not too dangerous and you could walk around without mittens,"" he said. For travelers, major airports reported relatively few weather-related problems after a week that included thousands of flight delays and cancellations. Friday's storm in the South was expected to move into the Northeast on Saturday. Two to four inches of snow could fall from southern Illinois to New Jersey. New York City will see a couple inches of snow on Saturday. Areas of Connecticut to eastern Massachusetts could see higher snow amounts by Saturday night depending on the storm's track. Winter storm strands travelers . Here's the damage that the winter storm has wrought so far: . Traffic nightmares . On the roads on Thursday, the storm triggered multivehicle pileups and other traffic nightmares across the Midwest. Even drivers in the Northeast had a tough time navigating the icy conditions. Jim DeMarino said a normally four-hour drive from Pittsburgh to northern Virginia took eight hours. DeMarino, who lives in Alexandria, Virginia, submitted photos of what he called a ""tricky drive"" along highways that were ""scattered with abandoned, crashed and disabled vehicles."" Dozens of tornadoes . The same weather system that dumped heavy snow in the Midwest and Northeast spawned as many as 30 tornadoes on Christmas, some with wind speeds of more than 100 mph, across the Southeast. Fifteen of Tuesday's powerful twisters struck Alabama, the National Weather Service confirmed. In Mobile County, David Saraceno spotted something ominous as he sped down Interstate 165 on Tuesday. He was traveling with his wife and 1-year-old daughter to visit family when he saw a tornado on the side of the road. His wife videotaped it. ""It looked like it was about two miles away from us,"" Saraceno said. ""I put the pedal to the floor to try and get out of harm's way, but it seemed to be getting closer and closer."" Panicked, Saraceno got off the interstate near the town of Chickasaw, drove in a different direction and turned around to go home. Mississippi remained under a state of emergency Friday, with 12 counties reporting storm damage. Nearly 60 homes were destroyed in those counties, and 22 injuries were reported. Winter wonderland in Dallas . For others, the winter storm system brought a rare white Christmas. In Dallas, some residents had to change from short sleeves to winter coats on Tuesday, as temperatures plummeted from the 60s to the low 20s in one day. ""We knew it was going to be a white Christmas in Dallas this year as per the weather advisory, but were not aware it will turn out to be so beautiful and freezing cold,"" Shail Bhatt said. It's not often that Dallas gets more snow than Chicago, but that's what happened this week.

"(CNN) -- Many residents returning to their homes in southern Louisiana after Hurricane Isaac will find little comfort. Throughout the state, at least 13,000 homes were damaged, Christina Stephens, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said Tuesday. She stressed the figure is a preliminary estimate, and that officials expect the number will rise as they gain access to some of the hardest-hit areas. St. John the Baptist Parish, west of New Orleans, suffered extensive flooding after Isaac struck the northern Gulf Coast last week. Thousands of residents were driven from their homes when the storm forced water over the banks of Lake Pontchartrain. Many are returning for the first time, Parish President Natalie Robottom told CNN affiliate WWL, and they are going to need help. ""They're doing what they need to do and we need to do our part. The state needs to do its part and so does the federal government,"" she said. ""When these folks get home, they lost everything."" In nearby Plaquemines Parish, floodwaters are still flowing out. ""We got a long way to go. It's so much water,"" Parish President Billy Nungesser told WWL. ""It's going to be some time before it all gets out of here."" He said authorities hope to patch levee breaches and then use pumps to get the rest of the water out. Nungesser also praised the work of the federal government, just one day after President Barack Obama was in the area to offer assistance and view the damage. Throughout the state, roughly 40,000 customers were without power Tuesday, down from a peak of 903,000, according to the Public Service Commission. Those without power must contend with a new obstacle: rebuilding their lives amid blistering temperatures and no air conditioning. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory Tuesday for some areas without power, including the cities of Lutcher and New Orleans. ""The cumulative affect of typically hot and humid conditions combined with the lack of climate control due to power outages from Hurricane Isaac have created a life-threatening situation,"" the weather service said. While many residents are focused on recovery, ""we need everyone to take their risk of heat stroke seriously,"" said Bruce D. Greenstein, Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals secretary. ""This is a serious condition that can kill you."" Meanwhile, tar balls washed ashore on southeast Louisiana beaches, prompting some coastal water closures. They were found along shorelines that were affected heavily by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Flood warnings remained in effect for parts of Louisiana and Mississippi. The Pearl River, along the Mississippi state line, crested at 18.54 feet, roughly 4Â¼ feet above flood stage as authorities monitored a weakened lock on an adjoining canal. Parish officials warned people to stay away from the area, but authorities lifted a mandatory evacuation order over the weekend after they released water from the lock to relieve pressure. Authorities were still dealing with threats posed by rain-swollen rivers and lakes, particularly in St. Tammany Parish, northeast of New Orleans. Standing water can serve as ripe breeding ground for mosquitoes and the city of New Orleans urged residents to take care to protect themselves against West Nile virus, which has killed at least nine people in the state this year. How communities bounce back from disaster . On Monday, Obama praised rescuers and volunteers helping clean up after Hurricane Isaac and offered federal help to beef up flood protection in the stricken area. ""I want to commend everybody who's here for the excellent work they've done in making sure that lives were saved, that although there was tremendous property damage, that people were in a position to get out quickly,"" he told reporters. Authorities have blamed eight U.S. deaths on Isaac, six of them in Louisiana. The latest came Monday, when a 90-year-old man was found dead in his home in suburban New Orleans, Jefferson Parish Coroner Gerry Cvitanovich said. The home was equipped with air conditioning, but the system didn't work with the electricity out, Cvitanovich said. Temperatures in the area were in the low 90s on Monday. Isaac struck the Gulf Coast south of New Orleans as a Category 1 hurricane early Wednesday, the seventh anniversary of the devastating Hurricane Katrina. It had already killed 19 people in the Caribbean nation of Haiti, where it struck before moving into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm posed the first real test to New Orleans since a $14.5 billion federal effort to reconstruct the city's flood control system after it failed during Katrina in 2005. Katrina killed almost 1,800 people, most when the storm overwhelmed the levee system and flooded the city. Most of the areas hit hard by Isaac were outside the rebuilt levee system.

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- The Mexican government has issued a hurricane warning for part of its western coast due to a powerful storm that could get even stronger in the coming hours, the National Hurricane Center said. Earlier Thursday, the Miami-based weather agency reported that Hurricane Bud had grown to become a Category 2 storm. A new advisory at 5 p.m. (8 p.m. ET), indicated that the hurricane continued to pack sustained winds of around 110 mph. ""Slight strengthening is possible (Thursday night) or Friday morning, and Bud could become a major hurricane before weakening begins by Friday afternoon,"" the center said. ""Bud is still expected to reach the coast of Mexico as a hurricane."" A hurricane warning has been issued for Manzanillo northwest to Cabo Corrientes, where winds are expected to exceed 39 mph within the next 36 hours and eventually top 74 mph. There are hurricane and tropical storm watches and warnings in effect for larger swaths of the country, including San Blas and Punta San Telmo, the hurricane center said. As of early Thursday evening, the system's center was located about 200 miles (325 kilometers) south-southwest of Manzanillo and 260 miles south of Cabo Corrientes. It was moving northeast at a rate of about 9 mph. Whereas it was once unclear if the storm would make landfall in Mexico, the latest forecast has Bud's center moving over the Latin American nation's mainland ""along the Mexican coast late Friday."" ""Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within the hurricane warning area by Friday afternoon,"" the hurricane center said in its advisory. By Thursday night, meanwhile, the winds should already be strong -- in excess of 39 mph -- ""making outside preparations difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,"" said the center. Bud is the second named tropical storm of the East Pacific hurricane season. NOAA predicts 4-8 Atlanta hurricanes . The National Hurricane Center warned that Bud is expected to bring 4 to 6 inches of rain along Mexico's southwestern coast, with possible isolated amounts of 10 inches. ""These rainfall amounts could produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides,"" added the U.S. agency. Swells generated by Bud had already begun to affect some coastal areas on Mexico's southern and southwestern coasts Thursday, and ""are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,"" the hurricane center said.

"(CNN) -- Gore Vidal, the eclectic author who faithfully chronicled the major shifts and upheavals in the United States in books, essays and plays, has died. He was 86. Vidal died at his Los Angeles home Tuesday evening of complications from pneumonia, his nephew Burr Steers said. The author had also been suffering from heart ailments. Widely hailed as one of America's greatest men of letters, the aristocratic Vidal was a high-profile commentator on politics, including his bitter opposition to the war in Iraq and his belief that the United States had betrayed its humble roots to become an imperial power. Tribute: My friend, il maestro Gore Vidal . Born into politics as a member of a rich and powerful family, he joined the Navy at 17 before shocking the world by writing one of the first novels to include an openly gay character: his 1948 work, ""The City and the Pillar."" ""He was the godfather of gay literature in spite of himself,"" said Christopher Bram, author of ""Eminent Outlaws,"" a profile of the groundbreaking homosexual authors of Vidal's era. ""He really didn't want the title for himself, but he wanted to be acknowledged as being important to gay people."" In all, Vidal wrote some 25 novels, two successful Broadway plays, numerous screenplays, more than 200 essays and the memoir ""Palimpsest."" His collection of essays ""United States: Essays, 1952-1992"" won the National Book Award in 1993, while a revival of his play ""The Best Man"" -- about the backstabbing and deception surrounding a national political convention -- was nominated for a Tony award this year. A look back at his accomplishments . Vidal also appeared in a number of films, including the political satire, ""Bob Roberts,"" where he played a U.S. senator. He twice ran for office himself: as a candidate for Congress from upstate New York in 1960, calling for the recognition of Communist China, and later as a Senate candidate in California in 1982, which became the subject of a documentary. Throughout his life, Vidal didn't shy away from controversy -- either actively courting it or inviting it through his acerbic one-liners. He riled the right by saying the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks occurred because the Bush administration was ""incompetent"" and Bush himself was ""inactive and inopportune."" Vanity Fair refused to publish an essay he wrote reflecting on the tragedy. He ruffled others by befriending convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and saying he understood ""why he did what he did."" The more they communicated, the more impressed he was by McVeigh, Vidal said. His book ""Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace: How We Got to Be So Hated"" takes the position that both attacks were provoked by ""our government's reckless assaults upon other societies."" A firestorm of criticism followed. ""I've had hard targets in my lifetime, I've taken on general superstitions, but that's what writers do. So I certainly, wouldn't have changed my modus vivendi one bit,"" he said of the furor. Vidal ""was always a gadfly,"" Bram said. ""But in the last 10 to 15 years, it turned into this very bitter, not always rational anger with American government across the board. Conservatives, liberals -- he disliked them all, and could be intensely critical of them all."" Vidal often appeared on the television talk show circuit, going head-to-head with those with opposing viewpoints -- and gave as good as he got. Opinion: Vidal's strengths and weaknesses . He once compared author Norman Mailer to the infamous killer Charles Manson, which prompted Mailer to head-butt him before a show. Author Truman Capote once said he felt sad about Vidal, ""very sad that he has to breathe every day."" And in a live TV debate, conservative author and journalist William F. Buckley Jr. famously called him ""queer."" To be fair, Vidal had called him a ""crypto-Nazi"" first. ""Well, I mean I won the debates, there was no question of that,"" Vidal recounted in a CNN interview in 2007. ""They took polls, it was ABC Television. ... And because I'm a writer, people think that I'm this poor little fragile thing. I'm not poor and fragile. ... And anybody who insults me is going to get it right back."" He also voiced himself on the animated show ""The Simpsons."" Vidal would say he was a once-famous novelist who was relegated to going on television because people ""seldom read anymore."" ""All these literary prizes should go to the readers: 'Nobel Prize for the best reader in Milwaukee,' "" he said. ""And you know, we must honor them because they are so few."" But the truth is, Vidal, all his life, relished his role as provocateur, as an anti-establishmentarian, as a self-proclaimed conspiracy ""analyst."" Gore Vidal's 12 best quotes . Relishing his role . He was born Eugene Luther Gore Vidal on October 3, 1925. His grandfather, T.P. Gore, helped write the state constitution of Oklahoma. His father, Eugene, played professional football, competed in the decathlon in the Antwerp Olympics in 1920 and, as an aviator, was instrumental in expanding the U.S. aeronautics program. And when his mother, Nina, remarried, Vidal shared a stepfather with Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. He detested his mother (""drunks are not much fun to be around"") and worshiped his grandfather, from whom he inherited his love for politics. ""He was blind, so from the age of 10, I was reading to him. From the congressional record, from American history, poetry,"" Vidal said. ""He was very good, he was extraordinary, he was my education."" Unlike his father, Vidal showed no interest in sports and took to writing at age 14, joined the Navy at 17 and published his first novel, the World War II-themed ""Williwaw,"" while on night watch in port at 19. It was well-received. But it was his third novel, the coming-out tale ""The City and the Pillar,"" that brought him notoriety. The book ""got reviews everywhere,"" Bram said. ""It also got attacked everywhere, and he really ended up getting kicked in the teeth on it. He was only 23 years old, and I don't think he expected it to be treated as autobiographical, which it wasn't."" The novel came out at a time when laws against homosexuality were still on the books in all 48 states. As a result of the controversy, ""He backed away from the subject for a while,"" said Bram, who teaches English at New York University. Homosexuality ""pops up here and there"" in his later work, ""but never as strongly as in 'The City and the Pillar.' "" Opinion: Gore Vidal hates being dead . Though Vidal's homosexuality was an ""open secret,"" Bram said, Vidal never claimed to be gay: He argued that the term ""homosexual"" was ""an adjective, not a noun."" Vidal himself once said of the book, ""I sold a million copies and it caused much distress at The New York Times."" The newspaper, along with others, would not review his future work, forcing Vidal, the pariah, to write mysteries under the pseudonym Edgar Box -- and to turn to Hollywood. While not particularly enamored by it, he was good at churning out dramas for television. He took one of them, the science fiction political satire ""Visit to a Small Planet,"" and successfully adapted it for Broadway. His other stage success came with ""The Best Man,"" about two presidential contenders. Following his lucrative TV stint, Vidal returned to writing and produced three widely acclaimed novels that cemented his reputation as an internationally best-selling author: ""Julian"" (1964), about the Roman emperor who wanted to restore paganism; ""Washington, D.C."" (1967), the first of his fictional chronicles of American history; and ""Myra Breckinridge"" (1968), a satirical treatise on transsexualism. At the same time, he published prolifically in magazines his critiques on politics, religion and sexuality. ""I would say that since 1945, the United States, which was absolutely the 'mandate of heaven,' as Confucius would say, had fallen upon us,"" he told CNN in 2007. ""The world was ours. ... We'd lost it all. So, my war against American imperialism is my largest."" Obituaries 2012: The lives they've lived . Steers, Vidal's nephew, did not elaborate on funeral arrangements for the author, only saying that the family asks people to donate to the Alzheimer's Association instead of sending flowers. Vidal said in the CNN interview that he wanted to be cremated and then have his ashes placed at Rockcreek Cemetery in Washington. The remains of his partner of five decades, Howard Austen, rest there. Austen died in 2003. ""We share a plot, and I'll be there,"" Vidal said. ""And I'll be looking forward to seeing him.""

"(CNN) -- A tsunami warning for Hawaii, triggered by a powerful earthquake in Canada, proved nothing more than a pre-Halloween scare for thousands of people this weekend. ""The tourists are doing their best Chicken Little impressions,"" one CNN iReporter in West Maui, Hawaii, wrote early Sunday. Sirens announced the tsunami warning across Hawaii on Saturday night, as thousands of revelers packed streets in Honolulu for the annual Hallowbaloo festival and many others in costumes headed to Halloween parties. Restaurants, clubs and the festival immediately shut down and the parties turned into bumper-to-bumper traffic jams as residents headed to higher ground. Visions of the devastating quake and tsunami that killed thousands in Japan in March 2011 fueled the fright, but the waves proved to be smaller and less powerful than feared. While the warning said waves could surge between 3 and 6 feet, the largest wave, measured in Kahului on the island of Maui, was about 2.5 feet above ambient sea level, according to Gerard Fryer, senior geophysicist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. The evacuation orders for coastal residents and the tsunami warning were canceled by 1 a.m. in Hawaii (7 a.m. ET) and a tsunami advisory was put in its place. That advisory was lifted three hours later. Honolulu Mayor Peter Carlisle said early Sunday that people who had evacuated could return to their homes. CNN affiliate Hawaii News Now reported that was also the case for coastal residents in various parts of the state. Earlier, local television showed images of bumper-to-bumper traffic on roads leading from the coast to higher ground. About 80,000 people live in evacuation zones on the island of Oahu, where Honolulu is located. Read the latest developments in our live blog . Even Hawaiians accustomed to tsunami warnings spared no effort in bracing for the worst. Honolulu resident Victoria Shioi filled her bathtub with water, set her refrigerator to the coldest setting and gathered candles in case of water or power outages. ""Also backed up my computer and put the external (hard drive) in the waterproof safe,"" Shioi said. The tsunami was spawned by a sizable earthquake in western British Columbia, prompting a local tsunami warning. ""A (magnitude) 7.7 is a big, hefty earthquake -- not something you can ignore,"" Fryer said. ""It definitely would have done some damage if it had been under a city."" Instead, the quake struck about 139 kilometers (86 miles) south of Masset on British Columbia's Queen Charlotte Islands. No major damage was reported. The Alaska Tsunami Warning Center issued a warning for western British Columbia from Vancouver to the southern panhandle of Alaska. Canadians as far away as Prince Rupert, on mainland British Columbia, felt the quake. Tanya Simonds said she felt as if her house was ""sliding back and forth on mud,"" but didn't see any damage from the tremor. Shawn Martin was at a movie theater when the quake struck. ""It just felt like the seats were moving. It felt like someone was kicking your seat,"" he said. Martin said more than hundred cars headed toward a popular intersection in the city known for its higher ground. Thousands of miles across the Pacific, residents in Hawaii did the same.

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- The backup legal team for admitted Fort Hood gunman Maj. Nidal Hasan asked to withdraw from active participation in the case Wednesday, telling a judge that Hasan wants to be sentenced to death. The request brought Hasan's court-martial to a screeching halt on what would have been the second day of testimony. The presiding judge, Col. Tara Osborn, recessed court until Thursday to hold a closed-door hearing with Hasan and his lawyers. Hasan is representing himself on charges that he shot and killed 13 people and wounded 32 in the November 2009 rampage at the installation, near Killeen, Texas. But Osborn ruled before the court-martial began that defense lawyers would act as stand-by counsel during the proceedings. The lawyers' roles had been limited to helping Hasan file motions and coaching him on procedural matters. But after Tuesday, when Hasan used his opening statement to declare ""I am the shooter,"" they filed a motion to step aside. The head of the legal team, Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, said Wednesday that Hasan was ""working in concert with the prosecution to achieve a death sentence."" ""It becomes clear that his goal is to remove impediments and obstacles and is working towards a death penalty,"" Poppe said. He and the two other lawyers said they were still willing to defend Hasan if needed but couldn't ethically stand by to help him at this point. Hasan objected to Poppe's characterization, calling it ""a twist of the facts."" But he refused to submit his objection in writing, a move that Osborn requested to avoid revealing privileged information, and insisted on being heard in open court. Geoffrey Corn, a military justice expert at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, said the lawyers are in ""a terrible predicament."" ""They have to stand by and watch the person they are ostensibly charged with assisting to represent himself essentially put a noose around his own neck, and they view this as fundamentally inconsistent with their ethical obligation as lawyers,"" he said. But Corn said Hasan not only has the right to defend himself, ""He has the right to do it poorly"" -- even to the point of asking for death. ""The defense lawyers would love to get off this case, because it becomes unbearable,"" Corn said. ""If you imagine having to sit there, being an ardent opponent of capital punishment, watching this guy seal his own fate with every move he makes, it must be torture. But the judge can't let them off the case."" Witnesses describes horror of shooting . Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, was paralyzed by a police bullet during the rampage. He listened impassively as one of the first witnesses recounted the horror unleashed that November day at a processing center for soldiers heading to Afghanistan and Iraq. Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford stared hard at Hasan, appearing to brace for a cross-examination from the man who had admitted to shooting him seven times. But Hasan just stared back. The courtroom turned silent as Lunsford was called as a witness. He was the first of several survivors scheduled to testify against Hasan. Lunsford recounted how the gunman rose from a chair in the processing center, shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" pulled out a pistol and began shooting. ""It was a state of panic,"" Lunsford said. Lunsford, a health care specialist, described how his friend and colleague, physician's assistant Michael Cahill, tried to hit Hasan with a chair to stop the shooting; Hasan shot him dead. Soldiers tried to flee or take cover inside the processing center as Hasan fired dozens of shots. As Lunsford was checking behind him, ""Major Hasan is turning the weapon on me,"" he said. ""He has a laser on his weapon and it goes across my line of sight and I blink. In that time, he discharges his weapon. The first round, I'm hit in the head."" A second shot caught Lunsford in the back. He decided to play dead for a while before changing his mind and deciding to run for the door. He made it out of the building but was shot five more times outside, he testified. Hasan continued shooting at Lunsford even as he was receiving first aid outside the processing center, before police arrived. Officers shot and wounded Hasan, ending the rampage and leaving him paralyzed from the chest down. After the prosecution finished questioning Lunsford, the judge asked Hasan whether he had any questions for the witness. ""I have no questions,"" Hasan said. Hasan also declined to question Michelle Harper, who worked at the deployment center and was inside when the shooting began. Prosecutors played a recording of her 911 call, where she pleaded for help. Scheduled to go to Afghanistan . A U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, Hasan had been scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan before the killings. Prosecutors hope to show that the devout Muslim had undergone a ""progressive radicalization,"" giving presentations in defense of suicide bombings and about soldiers conflicted between military service and their religion when such conflicts result in crime. Military death row: More than 50 years and no executions . Hasan did not want to deploy to fight against other Muslims and believed ""that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible,"" said Col. Michael Mulligan, the lead prosecutor in the case. Investigators found 146 spent shell casings in the room where the attack began, Mulligan said. Hasan carried two laser-sighted pistols and 420 rounds of ammunition, his pockets lined with paper towels to muffle the sounds of the magazines banging together, he said. Internet searches on Hasan's computer used keywords like ""terrorist killing,"" ""innocent,"" ""Quran,"" ""fatwas"" and ""suicide bombings,"" Mulligan said. Hasan told the panel in his opening statement, ""We mujahedeen are trying to establish the perfect religion."" But, he added, ""I apologize for the mistakes I made in this endeavor."" The mujahedeen consider themselves warriors who defend the Islamic faith. Witness: 'His punishment will come' Hasan told his family he had been taunted after the al Qaeda attacks of September 11, 2001. Investigations that followed the killings found he had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, the Yemeni-American radical cleric killed by a U.S. drone attack in 2011. The case was first set to begin in March 2012, but was delayed repeatedly, notably over a previous judge's unsuccessful demand that the beard Hasan has grown while in custody be forcibly shaved. Josh Rubin reported from Fort Hood. CNN's Ed Lavandera and Jason Morris contributed to this report.","NEW: Hasan has the right to defend himself, even ""poorly,"" expert says .

"(CNN) -- Nicole Frye watered the wooden roof of the house where she'd lived for 18 years. Then she got in her car and captured her own evacuation with a video camera. Watch Frye's evacuation . All around her, the sky glowed orange from the towering flames that had roared down the mountain and into western subdivisions of Colorado Springs. ""Oh my God,"" she sobbed. ""We gotta get out of here."" She knew her neighborhood would never be the same. ""So I wanted to make sure I had at least a memory of something that was remaining,"" she said. Reaction: Monster fire terrorizes a Colorado city . She wanted a memory, too, of the Waldo Canyon Fire which, a week after igniting, has consumed nearly 350 homes, damaged two dozen more and killed two people. Firefighters, aided by helicopters, air tankers and military planes dropping water and retardant, fought Saturday to contain the inferno, still threatening 20,000 homes and 160 businesses. About 120 Colorado National Guard troops were deploying to assist local law enforcement officers, said Colorado Springs Police Chief Pete Carey. Already, the Waldo Canyon Fire has scorched more than 17,000 acres -- close to 27 square miles -- and brought fear, anxiety and grief to Colorado Springs, the state's second-largest city that was, until a few days ago, happily situated in the valley below picturesque Pikes Peak. It was 45% contained Saturday, said incident commander Rich Harvey. In responses to Colorado Springs fire, a distinctly evangelical tone . Steve Cox, assistant to the Colorado Springs mayor, said the city remains hopeful. ""But it is a long process,"" he told CNN affiliate KKTV. ""It's going to take us a long time to recover from this."" The fire forced the evacuation of more than 36,000 people earlier this week. Many have since been allowed to return, and authorities are no longer keeping track of how many people are still evacuated, said Anne Rys-sikora, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service. Thousands are still waiting for word when they would be able to go home. Others, like Frye, will have to stay with friends, family or in hotel rooms. She learned her house was gone. She has not returned yet but seen the devastation in aerial photographs. The city has organized bus tours for about 4,000 people whose neighborhoods were charred. ""You'll be able to look at your property,"" Cox said. ""You're not going to be able to get out and walk around the property because we're still in an active fire situation."" Barry Boulier was among those evacuated when 65 mph winds on Tuesday whipped the blaze into a firestorm that spewed ash and smoke ""like a scene out of the movie 'Dante's Peak.' "" Obama tours site of deadly fire in Colorado . It was so thick, that he couldn't see or breathe, he said on CNN iReport. ""It happened so fast -- our only thought was leave NOW."" Boulier and his wife have been staying with family since they fled, though they have since learned their home was spared after firefighters stopped its advance in their backyard. His neighbors, though, are not so lucky. Most of their houses, he said, have been burned. ""I'm kind of dreading returning,"" he said. iReporters share their harrowing views of the raging wildfires . President Barack Obama declared Colorado a disaster area to allow federal dollars to help fight the Waldo Canyon Fire as well the High Park Fire, which burned 87,284 acres and destroyed nearly 260 homes in northern Colorado since it began on June 9. As of Saturday evening, that fire is 100% contained and all evacuation orders have been lifted. Firefighters will continue mopping up hotspots along the perimeter of the fire, which has cost more than $38 million to date. Almost half of the acreage burned by the High Park Fire is on U.S. Forest Service land. ""We have been putting everything we have into trying to deal with what is one of the worst fires we've seen here in Colorado,"" said Obama, who toured Colorado Springs on Friday to get a first-hand look at the devastation. ""We've still got a lot more work to do."" New app tracks Colorado wildfires . The U.S. Forest Service has warned it could be mid-July before the Waldo Canyon Fire is fully under control. The wildfire is one of 11 active fires in Colorado. Other Western states -- including Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah -- also are battling wildfires, which is straining firefighting resources. The effort to tame the flames in Colorado got a boost Friday from the military, which is deploying eight of the U.S. Forest Service's Modular Airborne Firefighting Systems aboard C-130 aircraft. The systems will drop retardant on the Waldo Canyon Fire as well as other wildfires still burning in Colorado. A battalion of U.S. Army troops from Fort Carson, Colorado, also began training Friday to fight wildfires. More than 500 troops are undergoing three days of training, according to Lt. Col. Steven Wollman, a spokesman for the 4th Infantry Division headquartered at the base just south of Colorado Springs. A decision has not been made whether to send the troops into the Waldo Canyon Fire.

"(CNN) -- Lynne was driving home late at night after a trip out of town when it hit her. She had to share her story of surviving rape, to reach out and reassure other women who had been through the same traumatic experience that they were not alone. CNN iReport asked people to send in their personal testimonies of surviving rape after the recent controversy over comments made by U.S. congressman Todd Akin, who said in an interview that women's bodies could naturally prevent pregnancy in the case of ""legitimate rape."" The request led to a flood of soul searching and often passionate responses from women such as Lynne who have survived such an assault. Akin's 'legitimate rape' comments trouble for Republicans . More than 40 people sent in stories from across the U.S. and beyond. Some had not spoken of what had happened to them, even to their own families; others used the traumatic experience to go public to inform and reassure others. Many were angry; others were reflective over what had happened. Some spoke of, inasmuch as it was possible, coming to terms with what they had survived, while for others, emotions were still as raw as the day they were assaulted. Because some perceive negative connotations in the term ""victim,"" many of those affected, and the organizations and individuals who support them, prefer the term ""survivor."" Catherine, from Canada, was attacked as a freshman in college by a man who offered to walk her home from a party. She said Akin's comments harkened back to darker times when women's rights were of little consequence. ""Don't define to me what's legitimate or not legitimate just because I didn't fight back,"" she said. ""These are attitudes that we should have left in the 1900s."" This year, the U.S. Justice Department revised its definition of rape to mean any kind of non-consensual penetration, no matter the gender of the attacker or victim. One woman who wished to remain anonymous finds the use of terminology such as ""forcible rape,"" when rape by its definition is forcible, particularly egregious. ""I never went to the police. My friend told me later that the police would probably say that I deserved it because I was drunk and flirted with him at the bar that I shouldn't have been in because I was only 18,"" she said. ""I still think she believes that I deserved it. ""The question is, would my story be considered 'forcible' rape? I don't think in ... Akin's case it would be. I think their definition is a woman being bruised, scared and bloody."" ""Sometimes, a woman has to do what she has to in order to protect herself, even if it means having sex with a man she didn't want to and even if she didn't yell to the top of her lungs about it."" Opinion: What young men still don't get about rape . Recovery from the trauma of rape or sexual assault can take years. Talking about it and sharing the story of what happened is, understandably, something survivors are often unwilling to do. Given the damage to a rape survivor's psyche, not to mention the physical scars that can be inflicted, it is not hard to see why such stories remain unspoken for years. Dr. Thema Bryant-Davis is a licensed psychologist and director of the Culture and Trauma Research Lab at Pepperdine University in California. She sent in her passionate response to Akin's comments shortly after the controversy emerged, arguing that such comments invalidate victims, brand them liars and delegitimize their suffering, all of which greatly affects their attempts to come to terms with what happened to them. ""It is 2012, and we continue the legacy that seeks to invalidate victims, to call them in essence all liars, because if you are pregnant, you are not a legitimate survivor,"" she said. ""The silence, the lies and the ignorance must stop."" iReport: 'I was just a little kid' When asked how they had coped with the trauma, many iReporters said it was on a day to day basis. Some mentioned thoughts of suicide; many had had therapy. Others looked to those to close to them for support. Martina Lunardelli, from Italy, who was assaulted as a child, credited her family and friends for support and assistance. ""I am lucky, because my whole family has always stayed with me,"" she said. ""And also because I am surrounded by real men, my dad, my partner and friends, who are 'real' men since they understand the suffering and continuously support me and stand on the woman's side."" Not all were so fortunate. ""After I was assaulted, my own dad -- who was from the 'old school' -- chastised me and said that I must have 'done something to ask for it,' "" said Gail from San Diego. ""Rape is wrong, period. Men and politicians can try to quantify or qualify it, but only the victims know the true sting of the crime."" Gail became a chaplain to support those who had been the victims of such a crime and to offer the help she felt she was never given by her father. Indeed, many survivors had converted their trauma into a chance to support others. Lynne, the late-night driver, became a nurse. She recalled long nights in bustling emergency wards assisting vulnerable women who had been assaulted. ""Has (Akin) ever held the hand of someone who was either raped or the victim of incest?"" she asked. ""Seen the crumpled faces, the faces of those they love coming to the ER? Given someone the morning-after pill and the counseling information, because it only takes one time to become pregnant, no matter the setting?"" Catherine, the woman assaulted as a freshman in college, spoke of using her creativity to give shape to the emotions she often felt roiling inside her. Through scrapbooking, painting and poetry, she felt she could exert some form of calm, of control over the emotions she experienced day to day. ""Take that pain and transmute it, turn it into art, dance it, sing it, paint it ... you can make something beautiful out of the trauma, and don't ever let it define you,"" she said. ""I'm a rape survivor but also a friend, a daughter, a mother, so much more."" Have you survived rape or sexual assault and want to share your story? Send us your stories.","Women responded to CNN iReport's call for testimonies on surviving rape .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Welcome to America's Finest City where the beaches are pristine, the downtown is spotless, but -- if you believe the accusers -- the mayor is filthy. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department has set up a hotline for women who believe they are victims of sexual harassment by San Diego Mayor Bob Filner. The city attorney's office asked its lawyers, particularly females, as far back as February not to meet with the mayor unless a witness is present. Recently, Filner was restricted from meeting with women alone at city facilities. Every few days, more women come forward to tell their stories. Filner is taking two weeks off in August -- not for vacation, but for intensive therapy to treat what seems to be a behavioral disorder. Secrets that women of San Diego no long keep about its mayor . Is that what they call it these days? In the 1970s, when Filner began his 20-year career as a university history professor -- after which came a stint on the San Diego City Council and another 20 years in Congress -- we might just as easily have said that he was a lech and left it at that. Now we think everything is curable. Take a pill. Go to therapy. Attend meetings. But there might not be a cure for what ails Filner. It has afflicted the 70-year-old for too long. Over the last few weeks, seven women have stepped forward to say that Filner said or did something inappropriate. The accusations range from crude comments to unwanted advances to bullying to the infamous ""Filner headlock."" Let's say it's not just a friendly hug. In one of the latest developments in this soap opera by the sea, Filner wants the city to cover his legal expenses to fight a lawsuit filed by one of the women, Irene McCormack Jackson, who is a former employee. Jackson was the first woman to accuse Filner publicly of impropriety. Her 11-page lawsuit alleges that Filner asked her to ""get naked"" and to kiss him. The San Diego City Council is set to discuss Filner's request this week. The council should deny the request and make Filner pay his own legal bills. He obviously has a problem, and he's admitted as much by going to therapy. ""Let me be absolutely clear,"" Filner said in a statement. ""The behavior I have engaged in over many years is wrong. My failure to respect women, and the intimidating contact is inexcusable."" Filner must have known about his failings, while he was in Congress and before he ran for mayor. He needs to take personal responsibility and pay for his own legal defense. Of course, what Filner really needs to do -- before the list of accusers gets any longer -- is resign. That's what Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California says. During an appearance Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union With Candy Crowley,"" the senator said that Filner ""lacks a moral compass"" and that he should make it easier on himself, his city, and fellow Democrats by stepping down. In California Democratic circles, once you've lost Feinstein, it's game over. For a politician, the only thing worse than being caught in a sex scandal is being caught in a sex scandal at the same time as someone else. That all but ensures extra coverage by the media, as the two of you will be paired together in the same paragraph in story after story. Filner has company, a fellow Democrat with whom he served in Congress. New Yorkers are suffering through the ""sext-capades"" of Anthony Weiner. The supposedly rehabilitated amateur photographer wants to be mayor of New York, but he has fallen to fourth place among Democratic contenders in the polls since admitting he engaged in the same behavior that caused him to resign from Congress in disgrace. As I watch the Weiner drama from afar, I can't help but think that one of the factors hurting his candidacy is that his public relations machine had gone to such great lengths to portray him as ""all better"" when it turns out he's not. New Yorkers don't like being played for suckers, and now Weiner is experiencing their wrath. Filner should watch and learn. He'll be back from his two-week leave of absence soon enough. Then what? ""When I return on August 19,"" he told reporters, ""my focus will be on making sure that I am doing right by the city in terms of being the best mayor that I can be and the best person I must be."" Is it really that easy for someone to get rid of a disorder that has plagued him for decades? I don't think so. When he returns to office, Filner might just get into more trouble with women. And if and when that happens, he'll experience the same public backlash that Weiner has. He might not need to resign. A recall effort is already under way. And hell hath no fury like a voter who thinks he's being played for a fool. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Seven women have come forward to say San Diego mayor was sexually inappropriate .
Ruben Navarrette: Mayor Bob Filner is going to therapy, but it's unlikely to cure longtime problem .

"(CNN) -- The other night was one of the most sacred and extraordinary events of my life as an advocate. A gathering of people from all around our country with one thing in common: a desire to stop the gun violence that plagues their lives and continues to plague our nation. Marking the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting in a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, young Sikhs of Oak Creek organized a candlelight vigil against gun violence at the same gurdwara where six people were murdered. One would anticipate the one-year anniversary vigil to be small and somber. Most people I meet know Aurora and Newtown but draw a blank when they hear Oak Creek. It simply blurs into the string of horrific mass shootings last year that each time failed to yield the solutions to gun violence that we were desperate for. And yet, more than 1,000 people of all faiths and backgrounds gathered in Wisconsin for the vigil with many more watching online. Holding candles and wearing scarves and turbans in solidarity, they listened to survivor stories of Oak Creek and other national tragedies, from Virginia Tech to Newtown. Rather than a solemn affair, the Sikh Americans of Oak Creek interwove tearful testimonies with multifaith prayer and music, stories and songs that repeatedly lifted up the Sikh spirit of ""Chardi Kala,"" everlasting optimism and high spirits even in hardship and suffering. The Oak Creek mass shooting was a national tragedy. It was the biggest act of violence against a faith community since the 1963 Alabama church bombings. But it is also a story of how a community got up from being floored and organized for concrete social and political change. In a time when many who want gun violence prevention legislation are frustrated and tempted to give up, Oak Creek offers hope and inspiration. Immediately after the mass shooting, the Sikh community rightly understood the Oak Creek tragedy was part of a history of discrimination on the basis of race and religion. Sikhs in Oak Creek joined civil rights groups and allies in a national grassroots campaign calling for the FBI to track hate crimes against Sikhs and others vulnerable to violence. Their work resulted in a historic Senate hearing on the rise of domestic terrorism and hate crimes in America. On September 19, 2012, Harpreet Singh Saini, a teenager whose mother was gunned down in the prayer hall, became the first Sikh in U.S. history to testify before Congress. ""I want to protect other people from what happened to my mother,"" Harpreet said. ""I want to combat hate, not just against Sikhs but against all people. Senators, I know what happened at Oak Creek was not an isolated incident. I fear it may happen again if we don't stand up and do something."" Harpreet asked the government to give his mother the dignity of being counted in hate crimes statistics. On Friday, after a year of concerted organizing, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Department of Justice will finally begin to track hate crimes against Sikh Americans, Hindus, Arabs, Buddhists, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses and Orthodox Christians. They will be counted on the Hate Crime Incident Report form for the first time. Although adding categories to an incident report might seem like a minor improvement, it is not. It's impossible to combat the problem of hate-based violence in America without acknowledging that it exists. The policy change is an important crime-fighting tool and a civil rights victory for a community that has suffered discrimination, especially since 9/11. Quick action that galvanized Oak Creek in the wake of tragedy helped get this done. But it was also the result of more than a decade of sustained effort by determined community advocates, such as the Sikh Coalition, the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund and South Asian Americans Leading Together. Now, some Sikh Americans are joining the movement against gun violence for the first time. Amardeep Singh Kaleka, whose father Satwant Singh Kaleka was killed fighting the gunman in the shooting, has become a prominent voice against gun violence. His brother, Pardeep Singh Kaleka, teamed up with former white supremacist Arno Michaelis to educate young people about the roots of violence. They helped the Sikh youth of Oak Creek found Serve2Unite in the aftermath of the mass shooting. Watch ""Oak Creek: In Memoriam,"" a short film about tragedy and healing . ""We refused to let that act define what we became,"" said Oak Creek Mayor Steve Scaffidi. ""We can accomplish something. We can make a change that's real. We don't have to wait for Washington or someone else to do it."" As a Sikh American, I was deeply inspired that the vigil honored all victims of gun violence. The ceremony began and ended with a reading of the names of people murdered by guns -- a school in Newtown, a theater in Aurora, the streets of Chicago and daily homicides that barely make headlines. Between stories of victims, the drums of Native American tribes flowed into Sikh prayers and the voices of a children's choir. The vigil also featured an array of representatives from some 45 groups who worked with Sikhs since the tragedy, including Groundswell at Auburn Seminary, a multifaith social action network of 100,000 people of faith I helped found. The movement against gun violence has not fizzled out. Even in the midst of the distractions of the next day's news cycle, we must remain focused in the pursuit of solutions that make our streets and schools, homes and houses of worship, safer for all. Young Sikh Americans are among the many new voices that can re-energize the movement. After all, the story of Oak Creek teaches us the way forward beyond the passage of reasonable legislation such as background checks. It reminds us to focus on curbing the impulse to violence and hate in our own homes and hearts. And it shows us how to keep working even when times are bleak -- in Chardi Kala, a spirit of relentless optimism. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Valarie Kaur.","Vigil at Sikh temple one year after murders brings people from all faiths hurt by gun violence .

"(CNN) -- Undaunted after receiving another point penalty this week, runaway MotoGP leader Marc Marquez put himself in a good position to win yet another race when he sped to pole position in Malaysia. A wet track didn't hinder the Spanish rookie, who eclipsed Casey Stoner's lap record of six years ago by clocking two minutes, 011 seconds at Sepang on Saturday. He overcame a mistake on his second-last qualifying lap to end an exciting session that saw Valentino Rossi, Cal Crutchlow, Jorge Lorenzo and Dani Pedrosa all hold the lead at one stage. The dominant Marquez recorded his eighth pole of the campaign and fourth in succession. ""I'm really happy with this pole position, particularly as earning it was a little different to my previous poles,"" Marquez was quoted as saying by MotoGP's official website. ""At the start of qualifying there were two completely wet corners, which made it hard to put in a hot lap as we had to calculate the amount of risk while still maintaining our speed. ""I knew that the final lap of the session would be definitive because the surface was drying out and conditions were getting better by the minute."" Marquez was docked a third point this season for colliding with Repsol Honda teammate Pedrosa at the Aragon Grand Prix last month and if he is deducted a fourth point, he'll have to start a race at the back of the grid. While Pedrosa wasn't pleased with Marquez's antics, Yamaha's Lorenzo -- the reigning world champion and second to Marquez in the standings -- came to the 20-year-old's defense. Rejuvenated Rossi . Nine-time world champion Rossi placed second Saturday, his best qualifying result in three years. ""I'm very happy about today,"" Rossi, 0.325 seconds adrift of Marquez, was quoted as saying by MotoGP's official website. ""We worked hard with the team this weekend and I like the set up a lot. ""I can really push and have good pace."" Cal Crutchlow starts third on the grid, ahead of Lorenzo and Pedrosa. Pedrosa, nursing a hip injury sustained when he crashed after tangling with Marquez, was fastest in three practice sessions in Sepang before slipping to fifth in qualifying. ""A couple of corners were wet and so it wasn't easy for qualifying,"" Pedrosa was quoted as saying by MotoGP's official website. He won last year's race and likely needs to finish in the points Sunday to keep his miniscule chances of earning a maiden title alive. With four races remaining, Marquez owns a 39-point lead over Lorenzo and is 59 points better than Pedrosa. German Stefan Bradl, sixth in the standings, will miss the race after fracturing his right ankle in the final practice session.","Marc Marquez claims his fourth pole position in a row, finishing fastest in Malaysia .

"(CNN) -- I approached Baalbek on a hot, dry day out of Beirut, down a broken road where children played, oblivious to passing cars. I pulled up by a small hut on the outskirts of the city, where I'd been told to ask for Abdul Nabi al-Afi. There he was, a slim, cheery, weather-beaten man who offered me coffee. I was sweating from the heat, but Abdul found Lebanon cold at this time of year and he was wearing a blazer over two pullovers. I sat down to hear how this former sergeant in the Lebanese army had found himself guardian of one of the most extraordinary sights in the region. Treasure beneath rubbish . Twelve years ago, Abdul had retired from the military and returned to the Beqaa Valley -- a broad, green swathe running for 120 kilometers through eastern Lebanon -- and his home in Baalbek. ""Many Palestinian refugees had moved here in the time I'd been away,"" he said, ""and I saw they'd been throwing their rubbish into an old quarry."" At a loose end, Abdul started removing the garbage from the site near his home. As he did, he uncovered an ancient object -- the largest single stone ever carved, lying at the bottom of the quarry. It was a huge piece of limestone, longer than a school bus and estimated to weigh more than a thousand tons. Carved by the Romans more than 2,000 years ago, the monolith had been intended for the nearby temple complex of Heliopolis. Now a Lebanese flag flies at one end of it, and, over the cafe Abdul has set up nearby, a sign trumpets: ""La Plus Grande Pierre dans le Monde."" Three gods . Traveling in the Middle East, I'd heard of Baalbek but not of Heliopolis. As we stepped down into the old shallow quarry, Abdul pointed to the huge white columns of an abandoned temple visible on the horizon between two concrete housing blocks and loops of telephone wire. ""In those days Baalbek was known as Heliopolis,"" Abdul said. ""Our temple was the biggest ever built by the Romans. ""Here they worshiped not one god but three: Jupiter, Venus and Bacchus. Today Heliopolis is a UNESCO World Heritage Site."" Abdul receives no government assistance for his upkeep of the quarry and the monolith so, as I was leaving, I bought a guidebook from his shop for $7. Would he ever leave Baalbek, I asked as we shook hands. ""I can't,"" he said. ""The quarry would go back to the way it was. I won't let that happen."" Iran: time for travelers to return? ""Die Tempel von Heliopolis"" I drove on through the scruffy outskirts of modern Baalbek, parked my car and bought a ticket for ancient Heliopolis. A group of young German men marched into the ruins ahead of me. They weren't the first: German students have been coming to Baalbek for more than a century. Before World War I, the Kaiser, an ally of the Ottoman Turks who then ruled here, sent his best archeologists to excavate and secure the ruins. A drawing of their proposed reconstruction pinned to the ticket booth reads: ""Die Tempel von Heliopolis, Ba'albek."" At the combined size of several football pitches, the three temples of Heliopolis were built on a scale much larger than anything seen in Rome. Shrine to Ba'al . The complex was actually constructed on top of a shrine to the Canaanite god Ba'al. To build it, the Romans had first to create a vast plateau above the valley. That alone must have been an extraordinary undertaking. During the Christian era, the temple complex was quarried for buildings including the Hagia Sofia in Constantinople (the new Roman capital) and the rest was roofed over to create a church of dimensions not seen again until the building of St. Peter's in Rome. When Islam came to the Beqaa Valley, the steps of this church were hacked away to create an inaccessible Muslim fortress held in 1175 by the mighty Saladin. Crusaders besieged it several times but never broke through. Today the complex still towers over this low-rise city. The occasional tourist wanders through in the company of a guide -- like Abdul, always well wrapped up against the sunshine -- but you can have it to yourself most of the time. Six top beers from the Middle East . Vanishing tourists . With civil war raging in its eastern neighbor, Syria, and security always fierce in Israel to the south, tourism has dropped off drastically in Lebanon in recent years. Nature has also played a destructive part. Inching away from Africa, the Arabian tectonic plate has caused three earthquakes at Heliopolis, bringing columns and pediments crashing down. Yet still it somehow stands, huge and white, an ancient marble enclave within modern Baalbek. The temple wins the crown for most impressive archeological site in the region, but there's much more to see. At Hermel there's a mysterious pyramidal tower thought to have been built 3,000 years ago -- no one knows why. Lebanese white . Lebanon may be dry but it isn't, so to speak, necessarily dry. ChÃ¢teau Ksara (+961 88 134 95), founded in 1857 by Jesuit priests, created one of the first white wines in Lebanon. ""Until recently we received 7,000 visitors a year,"" Sabah, who works in the visitor shop, told me. ""This valley still produces more than six million bottles of wine a year,"" she continued. ""We sweep the car park every day. We're optimistic."" Everything might be slightly falling apart in the Beqaa Valley, but then this strife-torn region often has to rely on the goodwill of people such as Abdul to maintain its world class tourist attractions. Nevertheless, the valley exudes calm. It's seen a lot of history and knows it'll see more. Now, when the most recent chapter of that history has scared most people off, could be a good time to go. Baalbek is approximately 85 kilometers east of Beirut. Lebanon-R-Us is one local company offering tours of the city and its sights; +961 76 513 800. The monolith and Abdul's cafe are located near the eastern entrance to Baalbek -- look for signs. No set opening times or entrance fee to the site. To visit ancient Heliopolis, look for signs within Baalbek pointing to ""The Ruins""; open 8:30 a.m. until 30 minutes before sunset; children under eight free, adults $8; guides are hired from around the ticket office, at the southeastern end of the temple complex, and cost around $14 an hour. More information on visiting Baalbek can be found on the Baalbeck Municipality official website.","World's biggest carved monolith found in Lebanon -- beneath a rubbish heap .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- An admitted supporter of terrorism testified in federal court Tuesday about his connection to Syed Haris Ahmed, a former Georgia Tech student who is on trial for similar charges. The FBI says Syed Haris Ahmed took casing video of the Pentagon and discussed attacks on the United States. Zubair Ahmed, who is not related to the defendant, entered a guilty plea in the Northern District of Ohio last January to one count of providing material support to terrorism as part of a plea agreement. The charge carries a 15-year prison sentence, but he said he hopes to get an eight- to 10-year sentence for cooperating with the government. Zubair Ahmed, a 30-year-old Chicago resident, said he traveled to Egypt with his cousin during the summer of 2004 with the intent of eventually entering Iraq or Afghanistan to fight ""violent jihad"" against the United States. Before they could make it out of Egypt, Zubair Ahmed's father found out about his son's whereabouts and traveled to the country and brought him home. Zubair Ahmed testified he met Syed Haris Ahmed on a Web site that discusses Islamic issues. ""We shared the same opinion,"" Zubair Ahmed said. The two eventually met in Chicago where Zubair Ahmed said they briefly discussed ""violent jihad."" The two men often communicated online through coded words or the Urdu language, Zubair Ahmed said. He explained a number system they devised to refer to the stages of their faith: 1st, the ideological phase; 2nd, the logistical phase; 3rd, the fight or battle phase. ""Last time we met we were 1st. Now we are almost 3rd,"" Syed Haris Ahmed wrote to Zubair Ahmed in an online chat session during November 2005, according to testimony. Earlier Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert McBurney presented e-mail and online chat session evidence seized from Ahmed's hard drive by the FBI, showing Ahmed was referred to as the leader by his alleged co-conspirators. FBI Special Agent James Allen testified that coded e-mails spelled out Ahmed's intentions to enter a terrorist training camp during a trip to Pakistan in July 2005. ""The curry place (Pakistan) is our main area for picnic and then spend the night at the mountain hills national park (terrorist camp),"" Ahmed allegedly wrote in an e-mail. Defense attorney Jack Martin argued there is no evidence his client ever had a specific plan. Martin said in Pakistan, Syed Haris Ahmed's family talked him out of attending a camp. ""I talked to my cousins and they put some sense into me,"" Ahmed can be heard saying on a recording during an interview by the FBI. Martin has argued his client is a shy, highly emotional young man. Martin said Ahmed moved to a suburban Atlanta neighborhood with his family when he was 12 years old. He did not have a religious role model and turned to the Internet to find his religious identity as a Muslim, Martin said. Martin said there was never any agreements established with co-conspirators and the actions of Ahmed were nothing more than ""childish fantasies."" Syed Haris Ahmed, 24, and alleged co-conspirator Ehsanul Islam Sadequee are charged with providing material support to terrorists and other conspiracy counts. Sadequee is set to go on trial in August. Ahmed and Sadequee are accused of discussing attacks in the United States that include oil refineries and a military base. Prosecutors say they also made casing videos of landmarks in the Washington, D.C., area.  Watch videos allegedly shot by Ahmed and Sadequee » . The short, shaky videos were allegedly emailed to other co-conspirators and found on the hard drives of at least two men who were arrested on terrorism charges in the United Kingdom. Martin maintains the videos are amateurish and silly, but prosecutors pointed out that the defendant stated during an FBI interview the videos were sent ""to prove that, you know, we are something."" Ahmed waived his right to a jury trial and agreed to allow U.S. District Judge William Duffey decide his case.","Zubair Ahmed testifies he discussed ""violent jihad"" with Syed Haris Ahmed .

"(CNN) -- Nanjing became the third city in China to suspend live poultry trading in the wake of an unusual strain of bird flu that has so far killed six people in the country, state-run media outlet Xinhua reported Saturday . Jiangsu's provincial capital of Nanjing joined Shanghai and Zhejiang's provincial capital of Hangzhou in shuttering the markets, Xinhua said. Four deaths occurred in Shanghai and two in Zhejiang, the agency said. Chinese authorities have killed more than 20,000 birds from a live-poultry trading zone in Shanghai in an effort to deal with the issue. The cull at the Shanghai poultry trading zone came as researchers in the United States said they had started work on developing a vaccine for H7N9. The H7N9 avian flu virus had been found in pigeons. The virus had not previously been found in humans until a series of cases were reported in China this week. As of Saturday evening, China had confirmed 18 human infections of the H7N9 avian flu virus, Xinhua reported. The World Health Organization confirmed 16. One victim, a 64-year-old man, died Thursday hours after doctors had confirmed he had been infected with the virus, Chinese officials said. Two other men, ages 66 and 74, developed flu symptoms late last month and were diagnosed with pneumonia over the past two days, Chinese officials said. A total of 11 people who had close contacts with the two have not shown flu symptoms, officials said. No cases of human-to-human transmission of the H7N9 virus have been confirmed. ""We don't know yet where the humans got their virus from,"" said Dr. Joseph Bresee, who heads the epidemiology and prevention branch of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's influenza division. The virus has not been shown to spread easily between humans, he said. The CDC, based in Atlanta, is working closely with Chinese authorities trying to find the source of the human infections.","NEW: Nanjing becomes third city to suspend live poultry trading .

"(CNN) -- It appears the people on the banks of at least one major river in the Midwest are finally getting a break from rising water. Water levels have peaked north of St. Louis, but the floodwaters from the upper Mississippi River will be slow to recede in the coming days, CNN weather producer Taylor Ward said. And forecasters think the weather north of St. Louis in the next few days should be mostly calm. But rain is expected on Friday and Saturday from St. Louis into Mississippi, Ward said. The peak waters will continue to head south in the coming days but are not expected to be significant south of Missouri. The expected rainfall late this week shouldn't have much of an impact on the anticipated crests of rivers. The residents of Grafton, Illinois, north of St. Louis, will see the worst of the floodwater through Friday as the Mississippi River peaks at more than 11 feet above flood stage, the National Weather Service says. Many along the river's edge decided to evacuate, but Jerry Eller thought he would wait it out. ""I've got water coming up through cracks in the floor, so I have about 3,000 gallons an hour of pumps running down the basement keeping water out, and that seems to be keeping it down to about an inch,"" Eller told CNN affiliate KPLR. Floodwater has ravaged dozens of counties in Illinois, forcing thousands of residents from their homes. On Wednesday, the Missouri and Illinois rivers and parts of the Mississippi River were closed to recreational boats due to debris and fast currents, the Coast Guard said. The statement said conditions had already caused 200-foot long barges to break away from their moorings and sink. The Army Corps of Engineers closed three of its locks to all river traffic until flooding subsides. ""Public safety is our first priority. Rivers are unpredictable and dangerous in a flood,"" said Col. Chris Hall, commander of the Corps' St. Louis District. ""Even if someone has lived along a river his whole life, he shouldn't assume it will behave the same way during a flood. It's not a good time to be on or near the rivers."" Affected by the flooding? Share your images . Widespread flooding . As rivers across the heartland swelled during the past two weeks, rising water was blamed for four deaths. Flooding has threatened rivers in Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Indiana, North Dakota, Mississippi and Michigan, the National Weather Service said. The Mississippi River at St. Louis on Wednesday was above flood stage and expected to remain so through Sunday, the CNN weather team said. The Illinois River at Peoria was experiencing major flooding, which is expected to last through the weekend. Moderate flooding through the weekend is expected for the Des Plaines River north of Chicago. Along the Mississippi River, flood watches stretch south to Louisiana. Although flooding is expected along the river, experts don't expect the catastrophic levels of two years ago, when levees were breached. The flooding was so grave in 2011 that authorities purposely flooded thousands of square miles of Louisiana to spare city centers. Residents in North Dakota are bracing for flooding, too, along the Red River in Fargo. The city has begun a three-day push to truck sandbags into low-lying areas. Police cars are escorting the semitrailer trucks as they head to the locations, affiliate KVLY reported. Volunteer help . In Clarksville, Missouri, some 500,000 sandbags and more than 8,000 tons of sand and rock are being used to keep most of the floodwater at bay. Mayor Jo Anne Smiley said the worst is over, but the city isn't out of the woods yet. Volunteers from around the area played a key role in protecting the town. ""The only way this community in particular survives these kinds of events is volunteer help, because we've had more volunteers in town than we have people who live here,"" Smiley told affiliate KSDK. ""And the people who live here are for the most part aged."" Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency last week after many areas of the state were stricken by flash flooding. ""The sustained periods of heavy rainfall (have) swollen creeks and streams and is pushing the Mississippi River over flood levels, endangering river communities,"" Nixon said. Record floodwater on the Rock River is dampening the mood at Rick Wyffels' Christmas tree farm in Moline, Illinois. ""This is going to be bad,"" Wyffels told CNN affiliate WQAD. ""This is the highest water I've ever seen down here."" The Wyffels family has farmed along the Rock River for more than 60 years. About a quarter of his crop is under water. ""We'll just have to wait and see whether these trees make it or not,"" he said. Back in July, it was a different story for Wyffels as the region was locked in a drought. He lost some 900 trees in the parched soil. Deadly consequences . The rain and flooding caused three deaths last week and a fourth Sunday, local authorities reported. In DuPage County, Illinois, a body was found floating in Salt Creek last week, the local sheriff's office said. Authorities were working to identify it. A woman in De Soto, Missouri, drowned last week after her vehicle washed off a road, KSDK reported. Two fatalities were reported in Arcadia, Indiana. On Thursday, a 64-year-old man died after attempting to cross high water in his car. The water swept him off a roadway and dragged him downstream, the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office said. CNN's Maria White, Mariano Castillo and Chad Myers contributed to this report.","NEW: Areas north of St. Louis should see water slowly recede .

"(CNN) -- The civil war in Syria is morphing into a fight between ethnic and religious factions, the United Nations said Thursday. ""As battles between government forces and anti-government armed groups approach the end of their second year, the conflict has been overtly sectarian,"" the U.N. Commission of Inquiry reported. The commission, tasked by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights to report on Syria, made the assessment in one of its periodic reports compiled from interviews. This review covered the time from September 28 to December 16. The update says government forces and its militias, dominated by Alawites, have been attacking Sunnis -- who are ""broadly (but not uniformly)"" backing the armed groups opposing President Bashar al-Assad's government. And anti-government armed groups have been targeting Alawites. Other minority communities, including some Christians, Armenians, Palestinians, Kurds and Turkmen, ""have also been caught up in the conflict, and in some cases forced to take up arms for their own defense or to take sides."" But the ""sectarian lines fall most sharply"" between Alawites and Sunnis. ""In recent months, there has been a clear shift in how interviewees portray the conflict,"" the report said, describing the conflict in sectarian terms. One person described shelling by government forces in Latakia province as fire from positions in ""Alawite villages."" Another described escalating tension in Daraa province between Shiites and Sunnis. The ""increasingly sectarian nature"" of the fighting is a motivator for proxy groups fighting in Syria. Anti-government armed groups are made up of Sunnis coming from the Middle East and North Africa, the report said. Shiites from other countries are entering the conflict on behalf of Syria. The Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah said its members are fighting. There are reports of Iraqi Shiites coming to fight in Syria and Iran's Revolutionary Guards providing ""intellectual and advisory support."" Christian communities spread across Syria have been under the gun and on the move. Homs, for example, once had been home to about 80,000 Christians, but the commission said most have escaped to Lebanon. ""The dangers are evident,"" the commission said. Entire communities are at risk of being forced out of the country or of being killed inside the country. With communities believing -- not without cause -- that they face an existential threat, the need for a negotiated settlement is more urgent than ever."" More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict, including at least 85 on Thursday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. In a Palestinian refugee camp, a possible breather . Government and rebel negotiators at the Palestinian Embassy forged an agreement to end the fighting in the ethnic powder keg of Yarmouk, a densely populated Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus where fighting has raged. Abu Mohammed, a spokesman for the pro-rebel Palestine Refugee Camp Network, said representatives for Syrian forces and the Free Syrian Army rebels decided that all armed groups, including the army and the rebels, should withdraw from the camp and leave it as a neutral zone. Also under the agreement, the pro-government Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command is to be dismantled and its weapons surrendered. The camp is to be managed by the independent Freedom Organization and the Islamic Jihad. But, he said, ""the implementation of the truce has been problematic"" because of ""intermittent"" government shelling on Yarmouk and clashes on the camp's outskirts. The U.N. report referenced the Palestinians as one of the groups hit by the civil war. When Hamas, the movement controlling Gaza, broke with the government this year over its actions, ""divisions within the community hardened,"" and pro- and anti-government groups emerged. Last month, mortar attacks killed 20 Palestinians in Yarmouk, and both sides blamed the other. And a prominent Syrian-born pro-al-Assad Palestinian was killed. Airstrikes on Sunday in Yarmouk killed and wounded residents, damaged a mosque and ""left the camp devastated."" The assault prompted a denunciation of the government from the Palestine Liberation Oraganization. The fighting forced the escape of many people to other places in Syria and to Lebanon, but Mohammed said several thousands have returned and some shops are opening. Many displaced Palestinians have been living for decades in Yarmouk, a nearly square-mile district about five miles from the center of Damascus. Formed in 1957, the urban enclave is the largest Palestinian refugee community in Syria. Russia wants talks but isn't wedded to the al-Assad regime . Meanwhile, Russia, long friendly to the al-Assad regime, is looking past the Syrian government for a solution. Russia's president declared Thursday that its goal is to end the bloody conflict in Syria, not help the nation's embattled president cling to power at all costs. ""We are advocating the solution that would prevent the collapse of the region and the continuous civil war,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin said in Moscow. ""Not retain al-Assad and his regime."" U.S.-Russia ties stuck in the past . To do that, he said, talks between opposing sides are crucial. ""First, people should negotiate, agree on how their participation would be guaranteed ... not first destroy everything and then try to negotiate,"" Putin said. Al-Assad has not visited Moscow much in his tenure, and Russia does not have ""special economic relations"" with Syria, according to Putin. Russia is ""not concerned"" about al-Assad's fate, he said. ""We understand what's going on (in Syria). We know that this family has been in power for 40 years,"" he said. U.S. officials have accused Russia and China of blocking tough efforts against al-Assad by vetoing U.N. Security Council resolutions against the Syrian government.

"(CNN) -- It was inevitable that the debate over same-sex marriage would have a strong religious component. This is partly because it involves such questions as the interpretation of biblical passages that, on their face, condemn homosexuality as a sin. But it also involves squaring the authority of ancient texts with modern theological understanding and developments in biology. And of course, the importance of love and human autonomy as religious values should be considered. Those issues surfaced in the various briefs filed in the Supreme Court, some of which are written as if the court must inevitably choose one religious point of view as the winner and the other as the loser. This is a false choice. The Court can make all winners, or at least avoid allowing one side to suppress the other's deepest beliefs. The U.S. Supreme Court has not been asked -- nor could it possibly answer -- the question of what God or the Bible thinks about same-sex marriage. Religious groups are divided on that question, some supporting and others opposing same-sex marriage. And even if the religious viewpoint were clear, it should play no direct role in deciding whether the Constitution requires the states or the federal government to recognize same-sex marriage. Our government should not act to further one or another religious view of contested moral issues. Opinion: The real 'modern family' in America . Neither the court nor government may referee religious disputes. Under the Constitution, religious groups are free to urge and put into practice their different visions of the good, of moral life, and compete for adherents in the marketplace of ideas. Winners and losers are determined by the ""votes"" of individuals and congregations, of believers and nonbelievers, not by government bodies. Neither can citizens opposed to same-sex marriage demand that the government refuse recognition to such marriages in order to avoid offending their religious sensibilities. Religious liberty, as the American Jewish Committee told the Supreme Court recently in a friend-of-the-court brief, does not give anyone the right to demand that someone else be deprived of the ""right to live the most intimate portions of their lives according to their own deepest convictions."" That some religious groups regard same-sex marriage as an ""abomination"" does not authorize the government to ban such relationships. That is one price we all pay for protecting religious liberty. Conversely, when government does recognize same-sex marriage, it creates a new set of problems for the liberties of religious believers. These extend well beyond the right of clergy or houses of worship not to perform or host same-sex ceremonies, or the right of religious institutions opposed to same-sex marriage to remain tax exempt.

Among other likely questions that will arise are these: . -- Must rabbis, priests and pastors provide religious marriage counseling to same-sex couples? -- Must religious colleges provide married-student housing to same-sex couples? -- Must churches and synagogues employ spouses who are in same-sex marriages, even though such employees would be persistently and publicly flouting the religious teachings they would be hired to promote? -- Must religious social service agencies place children for adoption with same-sex couples? Already, Catholic Charities in Illinois, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia have closed their adoption units because of this issue. Resolving these conflicts will not be easy. In some instances the rights of same-sex couples will unavoidably trump religious liberty rights -- for example, the much discussed question of visits to spouses in intensive care units. But there will be cases where religious liberty will trump, and same-sex couples will have to accept the reality that not everyone accepts their relationships as legitimate. This, too, is a price to be paid for religious liberty. Same-sex couples should not be denied the right to civil marriage; that is the immediate issue in the cases now before the Supreme Court. And when that right is secured, same-sex couples should not, without very good reason, be allowed to force dissenting religious organizations to recognize or facilitate their marriages.

"(CNN) -- I, like millions of Americans, tune in each week to check out the latest adventures of America's favorite ""Modern Family,"" especially Mitch and Cam and their adorable daughter Lily. While their prominence on network television strongly signals Americans' growing comfort with same-sex couples raising kids, my research suggests that, in truth, Mitch and Cam may have more in common with the decidedly un-modern Cleavers of 1950s sitcom fame than most LGBT families in this country. A typical LGBT parent is more likely to be an African-American woman in Mississippi than a white lawyer in California. U.S. Census Bureau data suggest that Americans raising kids as part of a same-sex couple are almost twice as likely to be African-American as are their counterparts raising children in heterosexual couples, and Mississippi is the state where same-sex couples are most likely to have a child. About 3 million LGBT Americans are parents. Surveys suggest that 37% of the more than 8 million LGBT adults in the United States report having had a child. On average, they've had two kids, so it's likely that at least 6 million Americans have an LGBT parent. Evidence also suggests that many of these LGBT parents had their children at a relatively young age. This week, the Supreme Court will consider two cases that will affect same-sex couples, including those who are parents. One case deals with the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibits the federal government from recognizing the marriages of same-sex couples. The other will weigh California's Proposition 8, which prohibits same-sex couples from marrying in that state. Opinion: Will gay rights infringe on religious liberty? As the justices deliberate, they should understand what marriage might mean for America's LGBT parents, especially those in same-sex couples. Most kids being raised by same-sex couples (59%) are reported to be the biological children of one of the spouses or partners. But for kids who don't have a biological link to their parents, the absence of marriage can mean a tenuous or nonexistent legal connection to parents who, in a medical emergency, may not be permitted to make life-altering decisions on behalf of their children. U.S. Census Bureau data suggest that 16,400 children being raised by same-sex couples are stepchildren and 22,500 are adopted. In fact, same-sex couples are four times more likely than other couples to have an adopted child and six times more likely to be fostering a child. With the mix of laws on the books in this country, simply crossing a state border from a state that recognizes the marriage of a same-sex couple to one that doesn't can mean the step- and adoptive-parents can suddenly become legal strangers to them. For many American families, marriage helps to promote stability in family relationships and more efficient allocation of household financial resources. Both of these factors help to explain why children raised by their married parents generally report better health and well-being outcomes when compared to children who experience family instability and more limited financial resources. LGBT families tend to include parents that are younger, more female, and more racially and ethnically diverse than the typical American parent. Unfortunately, all of these characteristics are associated with relatively lower incomes. So it is no surprise that we find a $10,000 difference between the median annual household incomes of same-sex and different-sex couples raising children, $63,900 vs. $74,000, respectively. Same-sex couples raising children are also at a disadvantage when it comes to health insurance coverage for themselves and their children. Many companies do not offer spousal and family health benefits to same-sex partners. And even when they do, they are often more expensive than comparable plans available for different-sex married couples. While more of these families might have access to health insurance after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, right now, among same-sex couples raising biological, adopted or stepchildren, at least one parent or child does not have health insurance in 38% of same-sex couple families. For different-sex married couples, the figure is half that at 18%. Sutter: The county where no one's gay . As evidenced by their majority support for legalizing marriage for same-sex couples in this country, Americans are getting to know their LGBT family members and neighbors (and their kids) better every day. They see that LGBT parents are motivated by many of the same desires as other parents: strong, happy and healthy families. Is it surprising then that many want to get married? Doing so would provide these families, many of whom endure challenging legal climates and economic hardship, with the same opportunities and choices available to all Americans. While marriage is hardly a panacea for economic health, allowing same-sex couples to marry at least gives them the same opportunities for building stable and economically secure families that so many other Americans have. Let's hope that the Supreme Court sees it that way, as well.

"Minneapolis, Minnesota (CNN) -- Ten minutes ago a woman called me and told me she was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer. As I'm standing in the garage, writing her story onto the huge canvas with the others, the only audible sound was my sharpie scraping against the paper, but her voice never stopped spinning in my mind. Telling a story is like an invitation for others to share their stories with you. That's what I discovered at TED when I shared my story about a limitation that held me back from my dream. After delivering my talk, I found myself constantly being stopped by people eager to share their stories, as hearing mine made them reflect on their own struggles, triumphs, hopes and fears. This sharing experience stuck with me, and now two months later, I'm in the midst of receiving thousands of stories through my current art project. I had the idea to crowdsource stories about facing limitations. These stories are written onto the canvas, and collectively they create my current art piece. What started out as connecting with people through a work of art quickly turned into a documentation of our modern culture. If we either rewind or fast forward 1000 years, many of these stories would still be relatable. No matter how individualized our stories are, and no matter how much times have changed, we share the same core human experiences in faith, self-identity, health, addiction, love, loss, etc. TED.com: How I became 100 artists . Here are two stories that have been shared: . ""On paper, I have the perfect life. I'm married to a man who loves me more than I deserve, beautiful, healthy children, and a great career. But I'm in love with someone else that I can't be with and it impairs me every day."" ""I was 14 and my mom and I were in a really bad place. We had just gone through a messy divorce from an abusive marriage. She had also been diagnosed with breast and skin cancer and we were very worried about how we would pay for the medical costs without her job. Our faith was slipping. We were standing in line at a pharmacy, we both had pneumonia. This really nice elderly women was in line behind us and my mom let her go in front of us and the woman introduced herself, and put her hands over us and started praying, right in the middle of the Pharmacy. My mom got a check from the insurance company a few weeks later. A few months after that she was hired at a new job. She is currently in her 8th year of breast cancer remission and her 3rd year of skin cancer remission. My faith has been renewed and we could not be in a better place. My mother is my hero.""

There are also many stories that encapsulate our society and culture at this very moment -- from the first openly gay couple being able to adopt in Florida, to the innumerable amount of people struggling with obesity, to the increasing number of parents raising autistic children. What stands out to me the most is that given the opportunity for anonymity in this project, many people are brutally honest about how lonely they truly are in their experiences, thinking no one could possibly know what they're going through.

I can't help but wonder, what's the cost of becoming our ""edited"" selves instead of our authentic selves? We shouldn't share just gumdrops and butterflies, because the hearty and rocky parts are what help us find our authentic selves.

"(EW.com) -- Chalk it up to the benefit of lowered expectations: Lindsay Lohan guest-hosted ""Chelsea Lately"" last night, and it was one of her best television appearance in the past few years. Of course, that's not saying much. But compared to her Matt Lauer interview/Saturday Night Live hosting gig in March 2012, where it seemed like nerves got the best of her, the actress looked healthy, landed a few good punchlines and, most encouragingly for Lohan fans, appeared genuinely happy to be in front of a camera that wasn't tracking her movements in and out of a courthouse. EW: 'The Canyons' - We saw it so you don't have to . There was a little nervous laughter and stuttering during her opening monologue, which featured Lohan thanking the various people who've kept the tabloids in business while Lohan had been away on a ""Court-ordered vacation in Malibu"" the past 90 days, a.k.a. Anthony Weiner, Kanye, Justin Bieber and the royal baby (played by Chelsea sidekick Chuy, obviously). ""How come when Kanye acts like an idiot he gets a gold record, but when I act like an idiot I get a police record?"" a game Lohan asked the audience. When the show returned from commercial break, Lohan joined comics Brad Wollack, Fortune Feimster, and Jen Kirkman at the table to riff on the news of the day. And while obviously her lines were mostly scripted, she still delivered them with aplomb, and seemed to really be having a good time -- particularly with her crack about One Direction-er Harry Styles possibly having a bisexual relationship with a dj. ""Been there!"" she quipped. One of the high point of Lohan's appearance was -- as is typical for her -- self-deprecating jokes. In addition to laughing at the comics' remarks about her own public issues (""Justin Bieber has been on tour longer than you've been in rehab""), Lohan landed her own jokes about her problems with alcohol. While commenting about gay-rights activists who dumped vodka to protest Russia's new policies, Lohan remarked, ""Waste of good vodka,"" before explaining she was allergic. ""[I can't drink vodka.] I wind up in rehab or jail,"" she said with a laugh, before seriously adding, ""Rightfully so."" EW: Can 'The Canyons' salvage the career of Lindsay Lohan? But while Lohan going the self-deprecating route has become expected, the appearance is noteworthy for her candid goofiness. During a segment about a viral video that had a girl singing into a curling iron before grabbing it like a hairbrush and burning her hand, Lohan sympathized. ""It's so true!"" she explained as she acted it out. But fans shouldn't expect to see anything similar on Lohan's Twitter. ""I would never selfie video myself curling my hair! That's a 'delete' moment!"" she explained with a laugh. It wasn't a hysterical or game-changing joke. But for Lohan sympathizers who are constantly on the lookout for the likable, promising young actress of 2004, her ability to joke around and still be kind of charmingly relatable was the strongest evidence in quite a while that maybe, below the substance abuse issues and the 24/7 drama, that lady still exists.

"Washington (CNN) -- The wedding photo shows the happy couple poised to kiss, ready to begin an adventure that has now taken them to the U.S. Supreme Court. For Karane and Jamelle Thomas-Williams, this is a fight for recognition by the federal government of their legal same-sex union, part of a landmark constitutional appeal over same-sex marriage and ""equal protection."" Their love has united them, but the larger social issue has split the country for more than four decades. The Washington, D.C., couple legally married last October, but not in the eyes of some of their employers or elected leaders. Karane serves her community as a Metropolitan Police officer. Jamelle serves her country in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. But since she is a federal worker, the couple cannot share the 1,000-plus federal perks enjoyed by married heterosexuals: things like joint tax returns, loan programs for veterans, and survivor, pension, bankruptcy, family medical leave and health insurance benefits. Opinion: America is at a crossroads on gay rights . Under the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in 1996, marriage is defined for federal purposes as between one man and one woman. That means the estimated 120,000 gay and lesbian couples legally married in nine states and the District of Columbia are still considered, in the eyes of DOMA opponents, the equivalent of girlfriend and boyfriend. ""As a federal employee and as an airman, you get a constant reminder that you're second class,"" Jamelle told CNN. ""I had to list Karane as my sister just so that someone would call her in the event that I'm killed or missing in action, or I'm hurt on the job. She can't be my emergency contact, she can't receive my remains. As far as my death benefit, I had to list her as 'other.'"" Adding to the confusion is Karane's status as a D.C. government employee. She enjoys the benefits of her relationship with Jamelle because her local government in the nation's capital recognizes same-sex marriage. ""But once we step outside of D.C., it's a whole other ballgame,"" said Karane. In neighboring Virginia, which does not recognize their marriage, the couple says they are viewed as ""legal strangers."" Opinion: Gay people live in 50 Americas . What is the federal government's role in defining marriage? The larger debate over DOMA's intent and impact 17 years after passage has driven a wedge between the executive and legislative branches. Now that debate will be center stage before the Supreme Court, which will hear oral arguments Wednesday, with an expected ruling in late June. At issue is what role the federal government should play when it comes to marriage, something states have traditionally controlled. ""What the court is being asked to decide is whether or not Congress can pass a law that treats same-sex couples, who are already married under the laws of their state, different from opposite-sex couples,"" said Amy Howe, a leading appellate attorney and editor of SCOTUSblog.com. Four federal district courts and two appeals courts have already struck down the law's restrictive benefits provision. And in a rare move, the Obama administration also abandoned its defense of congressional authority, saying DOMA is unconstitutional. 5 turning points in gay marriage debate . That has left House Republicans in the unconventional position of stepping in to argue it should stay in place, at least for now. Traditionally, the role of defending federal law would fall to the U.S. solicitor general's office. But President Barack Obama, in an election-year stunner, said last May he now supports same-sex marriage. The president had already ordered Attorney General Eric Holder not to defend DOMA. That raised the question of whether any party could rightfully step in and defend the law. Besides the constitutional issue, the justices had specifically ordered opposing sides to argue a supplemental question: whether congressional Republicans, operating officially as the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives, have ""standing"" or legal authority to make the case. Opinion: Slowly, GOP shifting on same-sex marriage . ""Let's not confuse the issue of DOMA and the administration's decision that it was unconstitutional,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told CNN. ""It is not their role to decide what's constitutional. DOMA was a law that was passed by the House and Senate and signed into law by President Clinton. In our system of government, the administration doesn't get to decide what's constitutional, the Supreme Court does. And in our financing the lawsuit was to make sure the proper forum was used to make sure that we know what's constitutional and what isn't."" Supporters of traditional marriage agree. ""DOMA's important because Congress said it's important,"" said Austin Nimocks, senior counsel at the legal ministry Alliance Defending Freedom. ""We sent our elected representatives to Washington, D.C., and they chose to say that marriage is one man and one woman for purposes of federal law."" And many conservatives argue the courts should stay out of the larger constitutional issues and let citizens and the legislatures hash it out. Some activists worry nine unelected justices will issue a sweeping 50-state mandate and redefine marriage as whatever personal bond they now think it is. Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network, says nothing in the Constitution tells states whether and how they should ""evolve"" on such an established institution. She said liberty is a fundamental right, but that government also has broad discretion to affirm the idea marriage is mainly about ensuring biological children are raised in a stable two-parent family with a mother and father. Same-sex marriage in the 21st century ""is clearly not what anyone understood as marriage at the time of the framing of the Constitution,"" she told CNN, saying that should be enough to keep the high court out of the current case. Tribe marries same-sex couple but state won't recognize it . Lack of protections, benefits if partner deploys . Jamelle and Karane said they hit it off immediately after they met by chance at a downtown club's Ladies Night, and felt like they had known each other forever. They were together four years before marrying last October. Karane said she went to Jamelle's mother first to ask her daughter's hand in wedlock. Sitting in their comfortable Washington home, they appear blissfully happy being together, but DOMA has put unexpected strains on the marriage because of ""little frustrations."" For one thing, they worry what could happen when Jamelle gets sent overseas in a war zone. ""Technically, I am a single person deploying,"" she said. ""So I don't have any protection for my family. I could deploy tomorrow and there would be nothing in place to help my family. It would be just me. So that's definitely scary. Financially, making sure that the responsibility that we have to each other and to our families is taken care of, and it would be like I'm leaving Karane in a lurch."" Karane added: ""It's like we have to still go above and beyond just to get to where heterosexual couples already are."" Docs: Same-sex marriage benefits kids . They believe they are burdened by a triple social stigma: as women, black, and lesbians. The couple hope to have children someday, but that would create further layers of what they say are discriminatory rules. For now this self-described ""boring couple"" say they look forward to the day their children would be born and raised in a post-DOMA world. But regardless how the Supreme Court rules, they say they will persevere. ""I should be able to walk with my wife hand in hand and live our life. We shouldn't have to sit here on the edge of our seats, waiting for a decision,"" said Karane. ""Are we going to finally be able to just be recognized without any strings attached?... We're humans, we live in a strange society, and we have to work with what we've got."" Same-sex couples take long road to altar .

"London (CNN) -- A mystery portrait donated to a British heritage charity as part of a mixed lot of paintings has been identified as a work by Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn -- worth more than $30 million. The picture, dated 1635, shows the then 29-year-old artist in a black velvet cape and hat decorated with outsized ostrich feathers. It was given to the National Trust in 2010, along with four other artworks. At the time it was thought to have been painted by one of Rembrandt's pupils, but new tests and research by leading Rembrandt scholar Ernst van de Wetering have shown it is more likely to be by the teacher himself. ""Over the years, it has gone back and forward,"" David Taylor, the National Trust's curator of paintings and sculpture, told CNN. ""Decades ago it was thought to be a Rembrandt, and then the experts said no, that it was by someone in his studio instead."" Van de Wetering, chairman of the Rembrandt Research Project, said the painting was last examined in 1968, and that in the intervening years ""we have gathered far more knowledge about Rembrandt's self-portraits and the fluctuations in his style."" He said that X-ray analysis, along with ""newly found circumstantial evidence remarkably increased the likelihood that the painting was by Rembrandt himself,"" and that a recent close look at the picture had confirmed those suspicions. The painting was given to the Trust by the estate of Edna, Lady Samuel of Wych Cross, whose late husband Harold, Lord Samuel of Wych Cross was a keen art collector and philanthropist. ""It was part of a very generous gift, of five top-notch paintings,"" Taylor explained. As well as the Rembrandt portrait, the donation also included two peasant scenes and two maritime scenes. But while the Trust recognized that the portrait was a high-quality work, it was not put on display at Buckland Abbey, in Devon, southwest England, immediately. ""It was in storage at first,"" explained Taylor. ""Though not because it was unloved, more because we were waiting for the right place for it -- we wanted to get the display right."" ""It's amazing to think we might have had an actual Rembrandt hanging here on the walls at Buckland Abbey for the past couple of years,"" Jez McDermott, property manager at Buckland Abbey, said in a statement. ""We never dared think that it might actually be an original, and many of our visitors will have just passed by it, in what is sure to be a real contrast to the attention it is now going to receive."" The self-portrait, the only Rembrandt in the National Trust's huge collection of 13,500 paintings, will remain on display at Buckland Abbey until the end of the tourist season -- where it is expected to attract plenty of visitors -- and will then be sent for further tests to help confirm its new identity. ""It will undergo a full clean, and technical analysis,"" said Taylor. ""It is painted on a beech panel, so dendrochronology [tree ring dating] will allow us to date the panel, and it will be X-rayed to check for under-drawings. ""The paint will be analyzed, so we can see if the pigments match those used by Rembrandt, and when it comes back to us in the new year, we should have the final confirmation.""

"(CNN) -- I can't believe I'm saying this, but George W. Bush is 100% correct -- at least when it comes to immigration reform. And just so it's clear: I was never a Bush supporter. In fact, I made a living during his presidency telling jokes that mocked him, from his policies to his greatest weakness -- speaking English. But Bush's statement this week on immigration reform was right on target. The ex-president told attendees at a naturalization ceremony on Wednesday: ""We're a nation of immigrants, and we must uphold that tradition, which has strengthened our country in so many ways. ""I hope during the debate that we keep a benevolent spirit in mind, and we understand the positive contributions immigrants make to our country. ... But we have a problem, the laws governing the immigration system aren't working. The system is broken."" A majority of Americans think our immigration system is in dire need of repair. Indeed, a recent Fox news poll found that 76% of Americans believe it's important to pass major immigration reform, with 74% favoring a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. Yes, I'm touting not only George W. Bush but also a Fox News poll as well. (Clearly, the apocalypse can't be too far.) So what has Congress done to address the issue? Well, in June the U.S. Senate passed legislation with bipartisan support to overhaul the immigration system. The proposed law would greatly increase border security by requiring the completion of a 700-mile fence along our Mexican boundary, adding 20,000 more border agents and spending more than $3 billion in border monitoring technology. In addition, it would provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants after they fulfill numerous conditions, including waiting 13 years and paying back taxes. With polls showing so much support for immigration reform, you would assume that the bill will soon become the law of the land. But there's one huge problem: The Republicans control the House of Representatives. This week, House Republican leaders made it clear that the Senate bill would not be brought to a vote because it does not have sufficient support of Republican members. House Republicans especially oppose the pathway to citizenship provision. So what's going to happen to immigration reform? Well, House Republicans did say there's a chance of enacting laws that focuses on border security. The GOP truly has an existential question to answer: Will it remain a national political party or just a regional one? That's the stake with immigration reform. Just look at the 2012 election. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney received only 27% of the Latino vote. That is a lower percentage than what Republican presidential candidates received in the past three elections. Latinos make up 16% of our population, and their numbers will only grow. Opposition to immigration reform will likely take a toll on the GOP in upcoming elections. But this is not an issue that concerns only Latino Americans. It also hits close to home for many, if not all, other immigrant communities in America. Why would House Republicans refuse to enact a law that is good policy and good politics? There are many reasons. One is that many House Republicans represent grotesquely gerrymandered conservative districts that give them little incentive to compromise. Two, they are being bullied by loudmouths on the right such as Rush Limbaugh, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and others. Former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin even got into the action urging people via her Facebook post to: ""Join the mama grizzlies who are rearing up tirelessly to swat away false claims that amnesty is a good thing."" (Whenever I'm on the fence about an issue, I will see where Palin stands and then take the opposite view because I know that's the correct one.) Perhaps these words of Bush can inspire House Republicans to do the right thing: ""Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?"" OK, that's not relevant but it makes me laugh every time. Actually, what Bush said this week sums it up: ""We can uphold our traditions of assimilating immigrants and honoring our heritage of a nation built on the rule of law."" Let's hope House Republicans have the courage to stand up to those on the far right of their party and not focus solely on building walls at the border but also on helping America remain the great melting pot that it is.

"(CNN) -- Was the ousting of democratically-elected Mohamed Morsy in Egypt a coup? Answering that question is clear, but not without a very clear qualification. It is a popularly legitimate coup -- and focusing on it is now far less important than what comes next. Of course, there is an argument against calling it a coup, which few seem to be considering at present. A coup is usually understood to be an action that replaces the authority of a civilian regime by a military one. If what happened in Egypt is considered to be a coup, it takes for granted that there was indeed a civilian regime that had absolute authority over the institutions of the state, and a military under complete civilian authority. That assertion in the context of the Egyptian political arena is questionable. LATEST: Egyptian military kills Morsy supporters . The Egyptian political reality, since 1952, has been indelibly imbued with the authority of the military establishment. When crowds took to the streets in 2011, the Egyptian military decided to sacrifice one of their own -- long-time president Hosni Mubarak. Just like all leaders of Egypt after the ousting of the king in 1952, Mubarak came from the military establishment but his continued presence was deemed to be a threat to the stability of the Egyptian state, due to popular pressure. The military was not overthrown in that action -- indeed, it took more of a direct role in the governance of Egypt, which it had hitherto shied away from, preferring to focus on engaging within its own spheres of activities. There are many of those, in different parts of the Egyptian economy, but the armed forces' activity in this facet of Egyptian society didn't mean they didn't have power to intervene elsewhere. READ MORE: Scientists saw Egypt turmoil coming . One should keep in mind that throughout Egypt's modern history, the Egyptian military has had overwhelming public support. That continued through the military transitional governing period of 2011-2012. Even at the height of anti-military sentiment, Gallup recorded that public confidence in the institution remained well over 85%, and at some points exceeded 90%. That figure may be less now, as pro-Morsy supporters may feel resentment towards the military for having removed him from power -- but it is still likely to be at least over 80%. The Egyptian military is an institution in which most Egyptian families have a relative within, owing to conscription, and the historical narrative taught in Egyptian schools is extremely positive, as is the representation of it on state media. This has never changed. READ MORE: When a coup's not called a coup . Over the past year, Morsy and his Muslim Brotherhood movement made many mistakes, and tried to implement some truly abysmal policies that could never be considered to be in the interests of the Egyptian revolution. Indeed, his harshest critics argue that instead of reforming the 'deep state', he simply tried to use it for partisan interests. One of his most strategic miscalculations, however, was to assume that after six weeks of a military establishment, Morsy had managed to place the military under his control. Morsy never removed Field Marshal Tantawi -- the military reconstituted its leadership on its own, appointing General Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi to the helm. The military sees itself as an autonomous establishment, and never considered itself to be under Morsy's control. READ MORE: Why Americans should care about Egypt . As Egypt heads toward an uncertain future, it will have to grapple with these issues against the backdrop of a civilian population that has enduring confidence in its military. The past two and a half years has brought to light some aspects of the military reality in Egypt that few were aware of before -- some relating to the human rights abuses that took place during Tantawi's governing period, and others relating to the military's economic strength within Egypt. Nevertheless, and this must be emphasized, the military continues to be supported by the overwhelming majority of Egyptian citizens. As Egyptians move beyond the startling events of this week, the issues that drove them to streets in 2011 remain. No one will be able to rely on the military to undertake any action in those arenas, as the generals have no interest in being involved in governance. It is likely to regard this entire episode as an unfortunate one, as they would have preferred to remain in their barracks, and not deal with the messy business of civilian governance. WHAT NOW? Anti-Morsy protesters eye next move . In the constitution passed last year by Morsy, the autonomy and preferred status of the military was thoroughly protected and it is unlikely that any political force will be able to muster enough political consensus to change that relationship. Indeed, popular opinion might even be opposed to a change in that regard, for the time being. Corruption remains endemic throughout the state. Morsy never tackled it. Torture continues within the police force. the Morsy government failed to address it. The Interior Ministry in general remains unreformed. Sexual harassment and violence was never taken seriously enough in the past, and dealing with it is even more of a priority now, despite the valiant work of groups such as Operation Anti-Harassment/Assault and HarassMap. Will the new government, being assembled at present, begin to tackle those issues? Will whoever wins the presidential elections, due to be scheduled soon, tackle those issues? PROFILE: Who is Egypt's new president? Those issues of reform remain and they will prove to be the core test of any government that emerges throughout this transitional period. Morsy failed to fulfill the demands of the January 25th revolution, and lost his popular legitimacy with the people of Egypt. The new Egyptian authorities have an opportunity to learn from those mistakes and act accordingly. Will the military be an aid to the fulfillment of those demands, and the production of a pluralistic, genuine democracy? Time will tell. The views expressed in this piece are solely those of H.A. Hellyer.","The Egyptian political reality has been indelibly imbued with the authority of the military, writes Hellyer .

"(CNN) -- A friend of mine who works in advertising recently got called for a job in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Knowing I have traveled in the Middle East, she asked me if she should take it. I said it might be interesting in terms of cultural anthropology, but don't expect to enjoy yourself. The social and legal restrictions on women are rampant. In the end she turned it down, and one big reason was her trepidation about how she would be treated. Western women work in the notoriously misogynistic Gulf States, mostly in PR for governments and doing business with multinationals. But the biggest contingent of foreign women working in those countries -- the millions of Bangladeshi, Indonesian and Filipino servants -- are off the radar. The events of this past week should be regarded as their, and the native women's, silent scream. Marte Deborah Dalelv, an interior designer working in Qatar, reported being raped last year while on a business trip to Dubai. Although her alleged attacker was arrested and jailed, so was she. A court sentenced her to 16 months in prison for having unlawful sex. World outrage at the Kafkaesque situation apparently provoked the Dubai potentate Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum to ""pardon"" Dalelv. She gets her passport back and is free to go home. She told reporters in Dubai she planned to get out soon. The incident should be a wake-up call for any woman, and any man who cares about women, working in or doing business with the petro-cash soaked Gulf States. It is a reminder to us that no matter how many glittery skyscrapers they build, no matter how many jewels of Western culture they attract -- the Sorbonne, Guggenheim and NYU in the United Arab Emirates, for example -- their laws are stacked against women. To convict a rapist in the United Arab Emirates, he must confess or at least four Muslim men who witnessed the rape must come forward. Norway's government helped negotiate Dalelv's release, perhaps motivated by the 72,000 signatures collected by outraged Facebookers. That is not always the case. In 2008, an Australian woman who reported being gang-raped served eight months in jail. In December 2012, a British woman reported being raped by three men in Dubai and was found guilty of drinking alcohol without a license and fined. In January 2010, a British woman reported being raped by an employee at a Dubai hotel. She was charged with public intoxication and having sex outside of marriage. Davelv thanked the emir for pardoning her (for what, exactly?), but royal forgiveness of a rape victim is not enough. We ought to be pressuring the leaders of Dubai, and other Gulf States, all the time, and not just when foreign women are victims. The U.S., incredibly, has had three female secretaries of state in a row who never put this issue on the table despite many meetings with kings and princes. We should be applying much more political and diplomatic pressure on these countries to give women their basic human rights. We should also be supporting the brave women in these countries fighting for change. A slender young Saudi woman named Manal al Sharif has been courageously fighting for women's right to drive in the Kingdom. She's been jailed. The rich and powerful nation where she lives and works forbids women from driving by refusing to grant them driver's licenses and arrests those who do drive. The Saudis' justifications include the risible statements from religious muftis who preach that driving is a gateway activity to promiscuous sex. The real reason women Saudi Arabia forbids women from driving is that the law regards them as children for life. Females remain legally under male ""guardianship"" from cradle to grave in the Gulf theocracies. Mobility profoundly threatens that lopsided intimate power structure. In 2011, our nation's 14 female U.S. senators  signed a letter urging Saudi Arabia to let women drive. Shouldn't there have been 100 senators' signatures -- male and female -- on such a letter? In any other circumstance where biased laws affected men, too, we would see a more coordinated response. What if a nation forbade an ethnic group from driving, forced its members to walk about in blankets in desert heat and criminalized them for being victims of violence? Absolute power, as the saying goes, corrupts absolutely. The abysmal state of gender relations in the theocracies includes girls in their early teens forced into marriage, rampant and unreported domestic violence and -- as in the Dalelvy case -- laws that offer no protection for rape victims but instead make them criminals. The Arab Spring hasn't done much for women anywhere in the Arab world, and least of all in the Gulf States, which have avoided any revolutionary activity by crushing dissent and jailing people without charge. Dubai, with its cool, gleaming skyscrapers, has earned a reputation as a playground for the world's wealthiest people. Al Jazeera, owned by the Qatari princes, is a reputable news organization not just in Arabic but in English as well. The trouble is that these visible advancements are attached to medieval attitudes toward women. And the real victims are not Western women, who can come and go at will, but the millions of powerless women who live in those countries. Dalelv -- blond, First World and educated -- gets to go home to her mother and friends in Norway. How many female rape victims are languishing in the emirs' and sheikhs' jails or ostracized by society for life or suffering in silence for the ""crime"" of having been sexually assaulted? Our silence is a measure of the power of petro-dollars and a powerful signal about where women's human rights rank on the world stage. Until and unless Gulf State leaders start making some pro-female changes, women invited to work in these countries should boycott all job offers. Maybe if the emirs are isolated in their all-male 21st century utopia, they will begin to change. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nina Burleigh.","Nina Burleigh: Case of woman sentenced to jail in Dubai for reporting rape is not unusual .

"(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund recorded an emphatic 5-0 win over second-from-bottom Freiburg on Saturday to improve an already healthy goal difference and stay top of the Bundesliga. Jurgen Klopp's side lost their 100% record last weekend when they drew 1-1 with Nuremburg, but bounced back brilliantly against 10-man Freiburg at the Signal Iduna Park. The rout got underway in the 35th minute when Marcus Reus tapped in after Robert Lewandowski's shot had been palmed away by goalkeeper Oliver Baumann. Read more: Chelsea draw with Spurs as City and United slump . The lead was doubled ten minutes later after defender Fallou Diagne was shown a straight red card for pulling down Lewandowski inside the penalty area. Reus stepped up to convert the resulting spot kick. Lewandowski got in on the act in the 58th minute to make it 3-0 before adding a fourth goal 12 minutes later. Jakub BÅ‚aszczykowski's goal 11 minutes from time ensured Dortmund boosted their goal difference to plus 16 -- four ahead of their Bavarian rivals. Bayern, who put four goals past Schalke last weekend, had to settle for a 1-0 win over Wolfsburg at the Allianz Arena on Saturday. Pep Guardiola's men created chances galore but only one was converted -- Thomas Muller directing Franck Ribery's low cross goalwards in the 62nd minute. Bayern travel to Manchester City on Wednesday for the second round of Champions League group matches. Dortmund host the French side Marseille -- a team they lost to twice in the group stages two seasons ago -- on Tuesday. Bayer Leverkusen kept pace with the leaders with a 2-0 win over fourth-place Hannover. First-half goals from Simon Rolfes and Sidney Sam earned the home side a sixth win in seven matches to consolidate third place, one point behind both Dortmund and Bayern. Elsewhere, Hertha Berlin move up to fifth with a 3-1 over mid-table Mainz, while the game between Hoffenheim and Schalke ended in a 3-3 draw.","Borussia Dortmund thrash second-from-bottom Freiburg to stay top of league .

"Kabul (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said that a rape victim freed from prison after he intervened on her behalf has the right to make her own choice about whether to marry her attacker. In an exclusive interview from Kabul, Karzai told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that the woman's case appeared to be a ""misjudgment"" that had to be resolved. The woman, identified only as Gulnaz for her own protection, was sentenced to 12 years in prison after she reported that her cousin's husband had raped her. But the 21-year-old was freed this week following the president's intervention, and is now staying at a women's shelter in Kabul, with the daughter she conceived in the attack and gave birth to in prison. Her plight attracted international attention when it came out that she had agreed to marry her attacker to gain her freedom and legitimize her daughter. Karzai said he had convened a judicial meeting when he came aware of her case. ""The issue was discussed in detail, and the right inquiries made. We, on advice from the chief justice and the minister of justice, decided that this was a case, perhaps, of misjudgment and that it has to be resolved, and resolved by giving her a pardon immediately. That's what I did."" Asked whether it was appropriate that Gulnaz should marry her attacker, as some in Afghanistan say, Karzai said it was her choice. ""It's up to her to decide who to marry or who not to marry,"" he said. ""And Islam gives her that right."" Looking to the future, Karzai said the West should have confidence in Afghanistan's judicial processes after international forces withdraw. ""It's a country that has been troubled a lot. But it is also an old country, with laws and a penal code and judicial history,"" he said. ""I can assure you that, once the international forces are withdrawn and not as many as there are today, Afghanistan will neither go into a trouble within the country or strife or into miscarriage of justice. I can assure you of that."" After the attack two years ago, Gulnaz hid what happened as long as she could because she was afraid of reprisals. But then she began showing signs of pregnancy and, aged only 19, was found guilty by the courts of sex outside of marriage -- adultery -- and sentenced to 12 years in jail. A key problem is that Afghan law fails to clearly distinguish between rape and adultery, which is a crime under Sharia, or Islamic law. And despite the pardon, Gulnaz's future remains unclear in a conservative society where her ordeal is considered to have brought shame on her family. She told CNN from prison last month that she was willing to marry her attacker in order to end her incarceration, though she did not want that option. Karzai also discusses Afghanistan's future relationship with the United States and his country's efforts to deal with the Taliban in the exclusive interview, to be broadcast Sunday on Fareed Zakaria GPS.","Hamid Karzai: ""It's up to her to decide who to marry or who not to marry""

"(CNN) -- Many were shocked this week when New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and linked to an unsolved double-homicide case from 2012. The tone in the sports community has been muted because this is occurring during the off-season and the impact on the ""game"" is minimal. There are many unanswered questions about the Hernandez case. What does it tell us about the intersection of sports and the violent and sometimes criminal behavior of athletes off the field? With a few exceptions, the National Football League's governance of players' lives is restricted to behaviors that impact the game and the business of the league. Players who violate the law and the rights of others are subject to the much broader laws that govern every citizen. When players commit crimes such as murder, looking to the league for answers is not the solution. The Patriots have quickly cut ties with Hernandez but are faced with a ""dead money"" issue (the ironic name for money tied to a player no longer with the team, that counts against a team's salary cap). On the field, they are left with a more uncertain hole at the tight end position. There's a sentiment that on-field performance is all that we should be concerned with when it comes to sports and athletes. No more was that on display than this past Super Bowl where the most popular player on the field was Ray Lewis, who 13 years ago was in a similar position as Aaron Hernandez is today. Lewis was in jail charged with murder. While he was later exonerated, Ray Lewis has been, in part, redeemed by football. As incidents of violence increase in volume and severity it is becoming more difficult to ignore the social transgressions of athletes simply because they entertain us. The bigger question is: What is the tipping point? The dissonance regarding sports in our society is palpable. The NFL is the most successful and powerful sports entity in the world. For many, it symbolizes the greatest elements of the meritocracy of sports and business. Success is built on sound principle, discipline and character. The NFL's success is not simply due to the popularity of the game itself, but the business of monetizing the game. The players are merely widgets in that business. However, as the NFL continues to grow in revenue and appeal, the off-field behavior of some of the players threaten to tarnish the pristine veneer of the brand. The sport has an esteemed place in our culture by helping to build communities, teaching young people leadership and discipline, and promoting team spirit. But why is it that so many successful athletes -- those who have reached the pinnacle of their game -- seem to lack discipline in their lives away from the game? Why is there such a glaring discrepancy? The problem for the NFL is that there is little the league can do to influence the behavior of its current players. The NFL is not the nurturer of men; it is not responsible for the attitudes and behaviors of the men its teams employ. As the great former UCLA basketball coach John Wooden once said, ""sports don't build character. They reveal it."" While the players on the field are stars of the business, they are not stars because of their depth of character or values and judgment. Their individual moral compass is their own, even if the sport has some influence over their perception of the world. Their stardom lies in the volume of exposure the business affords them. And, like the mega-salaries that make headlines, the business is such that the individual doesn't matter. What matters is that the individual can get the job done in the context of the business. And, in this case, character and discipline off the field have no relevance to success on the field. NFL players are products of our collective society and they take center stage in one of the most successful enterprises of our society. When we hear about Hernandez or Javon Belcher, we shouldn't assume that it's solely an NFL problem. It's a larger societal issue. No child is born to be an NFL player. The young men who grow up and are recognized for their talents need to be more than warriors on the field. The positive influences outside of their athletic lives need to be stronger and at every stage of their lives. The pursuit of excellence can exist in all aspects of a young athlete's life and it should begin with civility before any games are played. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Don McPherson.","Don McPherson: Many are shocked that Aaron Hernandez was charged with murder .

"(CNN) -- A federal agent's attempt to write a book with an insider's account of ""Operation Fast and Furious"" is being blocked by superiors because it could have ""a negative impact on morale,"" the American Civil Liberties Union said. John Dodson, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, was among several agents who claimed whistleblower status in order to provide information to Congress about the agency. The controversial program allowed 2,000 guns to cross Arizona's border with Mexico beginning in 2009 with the intention of tracking them to criminal gangs. Authorities lost track of hundreds of weapons that wound up in the hands of drug cartels and two guns wound up at the scene of a border agent's slaying the next year although it was not clear whether they factored in the death. ""Fast and Furious"" was shut down in 2011 and was the subject of congressional hearings and investigations. Dodson wrote a manuscript of his experience and prepared to seek a publisher, the ACLU said in a letter on Monday to the ATF. But his efforts were blocked by agency supervisors, who have oversight on any outside employment by agents, the ACLU said in the letter protesting the restriction. ACLU lawyers said the ATF's actions on Dodson's publication request are an unconstitutional censorship of his freedom of speech. ""The reasons provided to Agent Dodson were predictions of 'a negative impact on morale' in his field division at Phoenix, and 'a detrimental effect [sic] on [ATF] relationships' with other agencies, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the ACLU said in the letter. The lawyers said the ATF should revisit its decision and change its policies allowing supervisors to block the speech rights of employees for any reason. The ""Fast and Furious"" operation gave rise to more than a year of political controversy for the Justice Department, and eventually to House Republicans to sanction Attorney General Eric Holder for contempt of Congress in a legal dispute over the White House's refusal to turn over documents. Holder has said the tactics used in ""Fast and Furious,"" which allowed weapons to fall into the hands of traffickers, should never have been allowed. Dodson has claimed that Justice Department officials retaliated against him for providing testimony to Congress. ""Given the national attention to both the ""Fast and Furious"" operation and ATF practices more broadly, ATF faces an extremely high burden in demonstrating that its interests outweigh Agent Dodson's right to speak and the public's right to hear his views about 'Operation Fast and Furious,'"" the ACLU lawyers said in their letter which was written on Dodson's behalf. In response, an ATF spokesman cited federal regulations that prohibit individuals from ""writing about issues that arise from his or her duties as a special agent and profiting from his or her experiences while still acting in the special agent capacity.""","Book is being blocked by superiors because it might negatively impact morale .

"(CNN) -- For all its swagger, New York City -- especially its business establishment -- does not particularly like to be the punchline of a national joke. That is why, for months, corporate leaders have been grumbling with dismay about the possibility of Anthony Weiner becoming mayor. With the latest revival of the scandal that drove him from Congress, Weiner runs a real risk of being hounded out of the race by New York's business and civic leaders -- the very circle he would need to lead as mayor. There are 52 Fortune 500 companies headquartered in New York state, with the vast majority based in the city, including brand names such as Verizon, Citigroup, American Express, Jet Blue and Time Warner (the parent company of CNN). The executives who run these firms expect a mayor cut in their mold -- a serious and energetic manager who will keep the city a safe, clean, comfortable place to do business. By admitting he has spent years engaged in frivolous, compulsive misconduct -- made worse by repeated lying about his habit -- Weiner, for many real estate barons and corporate titans, utterly failed a crucial test of leadership. Opinion: Why Anthony Weiner's problem is ours, too . Which is why Weiner has nobody to blame but himself for the waves of condemnation raining down on him from the editorial boards of New York's most powerful newspapers -- the News, the Times and The Wall Street Journal -- which agree on little else but have all decided Weiner should quit the race for mayor. New Yorkers react to scandal . The latest revelation is that Weiner continued sending obscene messages and photos to a 22-year-old stranger more than a year after resigning from Congress in disgrace over exactly the same behavior in 2011. That was a deal breaker for The New York Times. ""He has already disqualified himself,"" the paper wrote in a blistering editorial, accusing Weiner of ""a familiar but repellent pattern of misleading and evasion."" ""He is not fit to lead America's premier city,"" said the New York Daily News in a front-page message about the candidate. ""Lacking the dignity and discipline that New York deserves in a mayor, Weiner must recognize that his demons have no place in City Hall. Having built his campaign on deception, he has badly damaged the process of selecting the city's next chief executive."" And so on. A summer of lies . Politically, it has seemed for months as if Weiner might be able to survive moral outrage over his weird compulsion to send lewd texts and photos of himself to young women. Recent polls ranked him first or second in a crowded field of Democrats running for mayor. The much higher hurdle to overcome is public exasperation over his repeated evasions about what he did and when he did it. In 2011, he went on CNN and other news channels with a preposterous, utterly false claim that sexual messages from his accounts were the work of hackers, a charge he later admitted was a fabrication. More recently, Weiner has made repeated, heartfelt claims that the destructive behavior is behind him, clearly implying the bombshell revelations that drove him from office in 2011 marked the end of his compulsions. It turns out that Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin, were playing a game, posing in People magazine with their child and claiming Weiner was on a path to emotional health and solid family life last summer -- at the same time an unrehabilitated Weiner was sending obscene photos and holding extended text chats and phone sex sessions with a 22-year-old stranger. Opinion: Why does Huma Abedin put up with Weiner? ""Maybe the couple didn't outright lie, but they didn't tell the full truth, either,"" New York Post noted in an editorial. All of this leaves Weiner in a damaged position. His half-dozen rivals for mayor have, until now, carefully avoided directly calling attention to his problems with the truth: In at least one public forum, a crowd booed when a candidate referred to the lying. But the latest revelations, coming less than 50 days before the all-important September 10 Democratic primary, have encouraged candidates to stop pulling punches. ""The sideshows of this election have gotten in the way of the debate we should be having about the future of this city,"" says one of Weiner's rivals, Bill de Blasio. ""Enough is enough."" De Blasio's call is an indirect reference to another candidate -- former Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who is running for city comptroller after resigning as governor in the wake of revelations he hired prostitutes. The national media will continue to have an extended field day reporting on the flaws of the candidates for New York's top two political slots. ""The mayor of New York City should be a leader that all the residents of our city, especially our children, can look up to,"" says Republican candidate John Catsimatidis. ""Anthony Weiner should do what is right for his family and our city and drop out of the race for mayor so we can end this soap opera."" That, by all indications is not going to happen. ""This behavior is behind me,"" Weiner said at a hastily called press conference. Will the voters buy it? We'll find out on primary day, September 10. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Errol Louis.","Errol Louis: Weiner should know New Yorkers hate to be punchline of a national joke .

"(CNN) -- Ancient Egyptians buried their dead with it. In 1848, Americans flocked to California to find it. If you're over 40, your dentist may have filled your mouth with it. And Germany wants their 674 tons of it back from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Yes, we're talking gold. Atomic number 79 in the Periodic Table of the Elements, lustrous metal used for jewelry, valuable substance for electronic circuitry. Where does it come from? New results from studies of a gamma-ray burst -- an extremely energetic, fast explosion, typically from the distant universe -- suggest gold could be created in the collision of two neutron stars, which are kind of like two giant atomic nuclei. CNN: All the world's gold came from collisions of dead stars . Let's pause for a chemistry refresher. An atom is made of a tightly bound nucleus of protons (positively charged) and neutrons (uncharged), orbited by electrons (negatively charged) -- a bit like planets orbiting the Sun, except instead of gravity, the electromagnetic force keeps the electrons orbiting the nucleus. (Also the laws of quantum mechanics are important -- but that's another story.) The identity of an atom is determined primarily by the number of protons it has. Gold has 79 protons, hence, its atomic number. That's one more than platinum, two more than iridium, three less than lead. Scientists think most of the elements lighter than iron (atomic number 26) were forged in the dense cores of stars much heavier than our Sun. At the end of their lifetimes, these stars explode violently in a supernova, dispersing the newly created elements across interstellar space. In fact, most of the elements that make up your body and everything around you -- other than hydrogen and helium, the two lightest elements -- were made by nuclear fusion inside a star somewhere, long before the Earth formed. Physicists and astronomers figured this out in the last century. However, the heavier elements, including precious metals like gold, silver and platinum, or cell phone ingredients like copper, palladium, zinc, beryllium, and, yes, gold, were not made this way. Instead, these elements were forged in stellar explosions, as extra neutrons and protons were propelled into atomic nuclei. Like modern-day alchemists, nuclear physicists can in principle turn lead into gold using particle accelerators and nuclear reactors (although it's easier to turn mercury into gold). But don't get your hopes up. Producing a small amount of gold costs enormously more than it's worth so this isn't any way to get rich. Obviously, nature makes gold, or miners wouldn't find it in rocks and streams. But nature doesn't manufacture it easily. Indeed, a supernova is more likely to turn gold into lead than the other way around. So now Edo Berger of Harvard University thinks he might know where all this gold came from. Scientists have suspected for a decade that some powerful gamma-ray bursts could result from the collisions of two neutron stars. Because neutron stars are incredibly dense collections of neutrons -- basically, like a bizarre, gigantic, atomic nucleus -- smashing them together is bound to create atoms containing many neutrons and protons, including good old gold. Berger thinks the faint infrared light seen by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope from a gamma-ray burst detected last month by NASA's Swift gamma-ray space telescope might come from radioactive decay of heavy elements created in the collision. During the collisions, neutrons captured by lighter nuclei should create such radioactive elements, which can then decay into other elements, producing the infrared light he saw. In addition to lead, thorium, and uranium, one of the (minor) by-products should be gold. Could this be where your jewelry came from, the violent collision of two exotic neutron stars? ""To paraphrase Carl Sagan,"" says Berger, ""We are all star stuff, and our jewelry is colliding-star stuff."" So next time you put on that necklace, admire a gilded painting, or talk on your cell phone, pause to remember that it came from rare collisions of neutron stars in deep space. And figure that the next gamma-ray burst we discover might just have made as much gold as there is on Earth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Meg Urry.","New studies suggest gold could be created in the collision of two neutron stars .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Nearly two years after popular unrest spurred former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's fall, throngs have taken to Egypt's streets again to call for revolution, this time for the ouster of his successor. Tents dotted Cairo's Tahrir Square, just as they did during the 2011 uprising, and clashes between protesters and police were reported Friday in the capital, the port city of Alexandria and elsewhere around the North African nation. Opposition leaders say they are firm in their resolve and, in Cairo's landmark square at least, scores could be seen milling about overnight and into Saturday morning. The focus of their anger: President Mohamed Morsy. On Thursday, he announced that courts could not overturn any decree or law he has issued since taking office in June and, beyond that, in the six months until a new constitution is finalized, his spokesman said on state-run TV. He also fired Egypt's general prosecutor, who has been criticized for the insufficient prosecutions of those suspected in demonstrators' deaths in 2011. Egypt and Morsy proved 'pivotal' in Gaza cease-fire talks . In a country already without a parliament, that means the former Muslim Brotherhood leader seems to have total executive, legislative and now judicial authority, all as a new constitution is being written. ""It's unprecedented, it's unimaginable, it's more (power) than Mr. Mubarak ever had,"" Mohamed ElBaradei, a Nobel laureate and head of Egypt's Constitution Party, told CNN. ""This is the language of a dictator."" ElBaradei, a one-time head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, estimated there were ""millions in the street ... revolting"" Friday. Urging ""civil disobedience,"" he and others who unsuccessfully ran for president signaled that they were unified in their opposition to Morsy. ""Endorsing the position of ElBaradei, (former Arab League chief) Amr Moussa and others, I urge all who voted for me to stand with us against the tyranny of the regime,"" wrote Ahmed Shafik, a former prime minister who received 48% of the vote in this year's presidential run-off, on Twitter. Despite such opposition, Morsy was defiant and insistent Friday that his actions are in the interests of the Egyptian people. ""I have dedicated myself and my life for democracy and freedom,"" he told hundreds of supporters outside the presidential palace in Cairo. ""The steps I took are meant to achieve political and social stability."" Morsy gives himself new powers, orders retrials in protester deaths . The chair of Egypt's Cabinet, Mohamed Refaa al-Tahtawi, brushed back criticisms that Morsy had made an undemocratic power grab, saying the opposite is true and that Morsy ""is not really trying to monopolize power."" ""He is trying to have strong pillars for a steady progress toward democracy,"" al-Tahtawi said. ""A dictator would not try to have an elected parliament as soon as possible."" The Cabinet chief added, ""I assure you that in the coming days, the opposition will fade away and calm down."" But that sentiment was not shared by everyone. Mamoun Fandy, a columnist for pan-Arab newspapers Asharq Al-Awsat and Al-Ahram who heads a Washington-based think tank, predicted that the opposition will continue to swell and lead to Morsy's ouster ""probably (in) a week."" ""These people are united,"" Fandy told CNN. ""The critical mass of Egypt is ... moving away from Morsy."" Tensions were brewing days before the president's moves; protesters have been in Tahrir Square since Monday. Egypt's Morsy: 'Imperial' president or step forward for revolution? The anger had been directed at Morsy and the Islamist movement of which he is a member. The Muslim Brotherhood was banned under Mubarak but has since risen exponentially in stature. There has also been growing turmoil about the constitutional panel, pitting conservatives who want Egypt to be governed by Islam's Sharia law against moderates and liberals pushing for it to ensure basic freedoms, such as for women. In response to Morsy's recent moves, Egyptian judges will meet Saturday to discuss their next steps, including a possible nationwide strike that would halt all trials and court cases in the country, said Judge Fekri Kharoub. (ElBaradei earlier said judges had already decided to strike.) On Friday in Tahrir Square, thousands had Morsy in mind as they chanted, ""Leave, leave,"" and ""The people want to topple the regime."" Nearby, in front of Egypt's parliament building, thousands of protesters threw rocks as police used their vehicles and tear gas to keep the crowd contained. The top floor of an eight-story apartment building caught on fire Friday night, a blaze protesters blamed on a police tear gas canister tossed at demonstrators who were on top of the building earlier in the day. About 215 kilometers (130 miles) north in Alexandria, protesters on Friday stormed the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing and set it on fire, said Ahmed Sobea, a spokesman for the Freedom and Justice Party. Protest turns violent in Cairo . Calling for calm and dialogue, the U.S. State Department expressed concern Friday about the developments, saying, ""One of the aspirations of the revolution was to ensure that power would not be overly concentrated in the hands of any one person or institution."" Dr. Khaled al-Khatib, from Egypt's health ministry, reported at least 140 injuries nationwide in the unrest, including 37 in Port Said and 36 in Cairo, according to state-run EGYNews. Eleven police officers were injured, state TV reported, citing the Interior Ministry. Al-Khatib said there were no deaths, which differs from an earlier report Friday from Health Ministry spokesman Mohamed Sultan of at least one death. ElBaradei said one young man is ""critically dead"" after being shot in the head, with more than 300 people getting treatment at area hospitals because of tear gas. Cameras have been installed on residential and government buildings around Tahrir Square so authorities can ""capture images of those troublemakers and protesters who attack security forces,"" said Interior Ministry spokesman Alaa Mahmoud. Thus far, authorities have arrested 210 protesters, 85 of whom are charged with destroying public property, thuggery and attacking security forces, the Interior Ministry said, according to state TV. Some 44 of those arrested are juveniles who are now back with their families. ""My worry ... is that the while situation will turn ugly, will turn violent if Morsy doesn't rescind (his) decisions (and) engage in dialogue with the rest of the country,"" ElBaradei said, adding he had met with Morsy a week ago and felt blindsided by his moves. iReport: Thousands clash in Tahrir Square . CNN's Reza Sayah, Hamdi Alkhshali, Jason Hanna and Mitra Mobasherat and journalists Ian Lee and Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","NEW: Judges will meet Monday to decide whether to go on strike, a judge says .

"(CNN) -- Thieves have forced the closure of Paris' Louvre museum. But an art heist was not the reason. Instead, the closure came after staff walked off the job on Wednesday in protest against the increasing number of pickpockets operating in the museum. According to a report in The Guardian, the pickpockets work in organized gangs and are targeting both tourists and museum staff with ""increasingly violent tactics,"" including spitting and kicking. Despite increased co-operation with the police and temporary bans on offenders, pickpocketing remains a growing problem for the museum, staff said. The Louvre's press department was unavailable for comment early Thursday but a representative of the museum said the Louvre was ""open as normal, until 5.30 p.m."" When pressed about yesterday's events, the representative declined to comment further and ended the call. The Louvre also closed in 2009 and 2001 as a result of staff protests about industrial disputes and working hours. The protest will be a pressing challenge for new director Jean-Luc Martinez as he takes up the post this coming Monday, taking over from Henri Loyrette. The museum, home to famous works from masters such as Leonardo da Vinci, is the most visited museum in the world with around 10 million visitors last year. Visitors should be mindful of their belongings when at the Louvre; Mona Lisa's eyes may not be the only things following you around the room.

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez arrived in Moscow Tuesday to discuss a deal to spend billions on Russia weapons. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, right, with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Chavez will meet with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Russia's new President Dmitry Medvedev, Russian news agency, Interfax, said . The two countries hope to sign an agreement for Venezuela to buy Russian military equipment, said Vyacheslav Davidenko, a spokesman for Rosoboronexport, Russia's government agency in charge of arms exports. The agreement will allow ""quick deliveries of arms and military hardware in the interests of Venezuela's security with the observance of international obligations and the laws of both countries,"" Davidenko told CNN. Davidenko wouldn't elaborate on the types of weapons that Venezuela wanted to purchase -- or the cost. Previous military-technical contracts had been worth $4 billion, he said. Interfax quoted an ""informed military expert"" as saying Venezuela planned to purchase up to 10 air defense systems, three diesel electric submarines, six more non-nuclear powered submarines and several surface vessels. Venezuela also planned to discuss the possibility of buying certain aircraft, including combat helicopters, the expert said. The Associated Press reported the deal could be worth $2 billion. Venezuela is expected to spend over $30 billion under a program to rearm its armed forces up to 2012, the Interfax source said. According to Russian media reports, Russia could provide a loan of about $800 million to Venezuela to finance the arms deals. Neither the Russian Foreign Ministry nor the Venezuelan Embassy in Moscow were disclosing a detailed schedule of Chavez's visit. In addition to visiting Moscow, Chavez plans to go to the region of Ingushetia, in southern Russia, ""to study its experience in solving humanitarian problems,"" according to the Russian Foreign Ministry. The tiny province of Ingushetia, near Chechnya, has been a hot spot over the past decade. Islamist rebels there frequently attack Russian servicemen and law enforcement officials. During his visit the two nations also planned to sign several agreements related to oil and gas, the Venezuelan president told journalists. ""We need to sign a whole set of documents, including a financial agreements,"" he said, adding that the parties will discuss, in particular, how to set up a joint Russian-Venezuelan bank. Russia and Venezuela must consolidate their efforts to tackle the food crisis, Chavez said. ""We must create a food shield. While some are creating a missile shield, we want to create a hunger shield,"" the Venezuelan president said.","Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez wants to spend billions on Russia weapons .

"New York (CNN) -- A crane's load at a Manhattan skyscraper is back on the ground after a mechanical failure left it suspended more than 400 feet above West 57th Street. The hoisting equipment for a tower crane at the site of One57 -- a future residential building -- malfunctioned Monday morning, according to Kelly Magee, a spokeswoman for New York City's Department of Buildings. A 7-ton counterweight was being lifted when a mechanical failure occurred at the top of the crane, leaving the counterweight stuck 429 feet in the air, according to a spokesman at the Office of Emergency Management. In January: New York crane collapses, injures 7 . The crane failed to get the load it was carrying to the top of the high rise, and as a result, crane operators had to manually bring it back down, according to New York Police Det. Marc Nell. The National Weather Service has issued a tornado watch for the mid-Atlantic region, which includes New York City, until 5 p.m. ET Monday, creating more concern about lowering the hanging counterweight before the storms arrived. Fifty-seventh Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues was reopened shortly after the counterweight reached the ground. One57 is the same site of a separate crane incident during Superstorm Sandy last October, when a crane boom was left hanging.

"(CNN) -- Chilean officials are asking fishermen to help save birds caught in nets after thousands of dead fowl appeared along coastal Chile this week. At least 2,300 dead birds were found along beaches between Cartagena and Playa de Santo Domingo, Chile, said Jose Luis Britos, and environment professor and director of the Museum of Natural History of San Antonio, Chile. Many of the birds, which come from several species, had broken wings and bruising on the outside of their bodies -- injuries consistent with getting trapped in fishing nets, Britos said. He said bird deaths from fishing nets occur every year, but never at this level. In a typical year, about 15 to 20 dead birds are found, Britos said. One hypothesis for the increase this year involves climate. As Chilean weather gets colder this time of year, migrating birds that would normally travel north for warmth are instead lingering to feast on an influx of anchovies and sardines that had fled the coast of Peru in search of cooler waters. Earlier this week, Peruvian authorities say warm waters off that country's coast are to blame for the deaths of more than 5,000 marine birds. The Peruvian National Center for the Study of El Nino said that since February, the Peruvian coast has had an abundance of warm water as a result of marine currents throughout the world's oceans. The warm water has altered the marine ecosystem, it said. The warm water has led fish such as anchovies and other species that live in surface waters to migrate to deeper water toward the south. As a result, pelicans and other birds that feed from the surface of the water died of starvation. ""If these oceanographic conditions persist, it is likely that its impact will spread to other areas of the (Peruvian) coast even during the fall, which could make the numbers increase and affect other marine species,"" the report stated. The Peruvian ministry of environment said seafood is still safe to eat, and encouraged everyone to continue to support local fishermen, according to state-run Andina news agency. Officials in Peru continue to search for the cause of death of almost 900 dolphins since the beginning of the year. The health ministry is awaiting final results from molecular analysis looking for the morbillivirus, which previously has been linked to dolphin deaths. The Chilean agriculture and livestock ministry and staff from Britos' center have called for a meeting with fishermen for Monday. They are asking fishermen to try to save trapped birds before closing their nets. Britos said he worries that until Monday, the number of dead birds could rise significantly.","Warm waters off Peru have chased away fish, a national center studying El Nino says .

"(CNN) -- The Chinese-French painter Zao Wou-ki once told me that painting expresses the thoughts we struggle to put into words. Faced with this challenge, ""It's easier to learn English!"" he joked, his wit shining through, even though Alzheimer's disease had already begun its slow, relentless onslaught on his mind. Zao, widely regarded as one of the foremost Chinese contemporary painters of the 20th century, passed away at his home in Switzerland on Tuesday at the age of 93. Born in Beijing in 1920, he formed part of the second generation of Chinese artists to turn westward in their search for inspiration. Encouraged by the French-educated Chinese artist Lin Fengmian, his teacher at the prestigious Hangzhou National College of Art (today the China Academy of Art), he relocated to Paris in 1948. Although he did not know it at the time, the move would be permanent, due in part to the rapidly changing political situation in China. Apart from brief trips abroad, Zao would remain in France until the year before his death, one of the few Chinese artists from his generation to emigrate to Europe. Embraced by France, he was elected to the prestigious Academie des Beaux Arts society in 2002 and received the Legion of Honor in 2006 from then-president Jacques Chirac. For Zao and his contemporaries, Paris represented the source of modern art. Living there meant direct access to the paintings that he had until then only encountered as black-and-white reproductions in art magazines. An oil painter by vocation, he immersed himself in the riches that surrounded him -- heading directly to the Louvre on the very day he arrived in the city. Meanwhile, with the assistance of his friend and mentor, noted poet and painter Henri Michaux, and blessed with the warm charm and wit that would impress me decades later, Zao cultivated an extensive circle of fellow artists and cultural figures. In just a few years, he established himself as an integral member of the postwar French art world. Zao worked hard to find his artistic voice. At first he made a determined effort to distance himself from ink painting -- the medium most closely associated with the Chinese painting tradition-- and subject matter that might be construed as overtly Chinese. He wished to be appreciated on his own merits and not to fall victim to stereotype. His breakthrough, however, came with his 1954 masterpiece ""Wind,"" a painting that was both his first purely abstract work and a return to his origins: the inky black forms rising in two wavering columns are abstractions of oracle bone characters -- the most ancient of Chinese scripts. In the decades that followed, Zao committed himself fully to abstract painting, rarely using even figurative titles after 1959. Instead, he titled his works with their date of completion, marking their entry into the world. The lyrical qualities that defined him as an artist appeared early on, first in his oil paintings and later in his ink paintings, after his reengagement with the medium in the early 1970s: oscillating planes of color, light, and shade met, collided, and diverged, skidding across the surface of his works. The apparent disorder of his paintings concealed an underlying structure, sometimes described as Daoist in nature, which bore striking parallels to a similar balance between order and chaos found in Chinese traditional painting. In Zao's case, this phenomenon is perhaps best understood as a self-statement: the artist's insistence on his personal and aesthetic identity in the face of the vagaries of borders and time. Zao's given name, ""Wou-ki"" (or ""Wuji"" in the standard Hanyu Pinyin romanization used in China), means ""no boundaries."" No single phrase better encapsulates the union in his person and art of the two often disparate cultures and aesthetic visions of France and China. ""French thought and Chinese thought are not the same,"" he told me. ""It's hard to translate between them. Sometimes you must wear yourself out trying to understand. Painting must express these feelings."" An artist friend once asked about my research. Hearing that I studied Zao Wou-ki, he grew suddenly pensive. ""Zao Wou-ki,"" he mused, ""his work isn't representative of either Chinese or French art."" ""Yes,"" I answered. ""He represents himself, and that is enough.""","Chinese-French painter Zao Wou-ki died Tuesday at age 93 .

"(CNN) -- Powerful winds continued to batter Los Angeles, Las Vegas and other southwestern U.S. locales Thursday -- downing trees, delaying flights and leaving hundreds of thousands without power. Los Angeles County Fire Inspector Quvondo Johnson told CNN that, as of 4:30 p.m. PT (7:30 p.m ET), firefighters had responded to reports of approximately 460 downed power lines over the previous 24 hours. He estimated that the fire service had received ""thousands"" of calls total. Wind gusts stronger than 140 mph -- which would be equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane -- have been measured on the Sierra Crest mountain ridge, according to the National Weather Service. Lower-lying areas also have been hit hard by Santa Ana winds, with 80 mph gusts expected in Southern California. Santa Ana wind is a condition in which strong winds descend to the Pacific Coast around Los Angeles from inland desert regions, according to the weather service. It's all part of a system the federal weather agency called ""the strongest easterly wind event in the past several years."" The National Weather Service has issued high-wind warnings -- which go into effect when there are sustained winds forecast of 40 mph or stronger or gusts of 58 mph or stronger -- for part of southwestern California as well as along the Sierra Nevada range in the eastern part of the state. Similar warnings were in effect for much of Nevada, as well, with wind advisories also having been issued for other parts of those two states. Southwestern California has been especially hard-hit, leading Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich to issue a state of emergency ""to ensure that state and federal financial resources are available to serve county residents impacted by the windstorms."" In a statement, the county noted that Pasadena, Sierra Madre and Monrovia particularly have seen extensive damage, including to private property. The perilous conditions, specifically the strong winds, would likely continue through Friday, the county noted. As of 5 p.m. PT, Southern California Edison was reporting more than 205,000 households without power, a slight drop from seven hours earlier. Hard-hit communities in the utility's 50,000-square-mile service area include Alhambra, Altadena, Arcadia, El Monte, La Canada Flintridge and San Bernardino, San Gabriel. ""Severe winds and debris have been hampering power restoration efforts by SCE crews, and some customers without power should prepare for the possibility of being without service overnight and possibly longer,"" the utility said in a news release. ""High winds have knocked down thousands of trees and strewn debris across wide areas, limiting and, in some cases, preventing access to equipment. "" The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power reported that, as of 9 p.m. Thursday, about 109,000 of its 1.4 million customers did not have electricity. The department added, in a press release, that it has more than 100 crews responding to more than 1,000 incidents thought to be responsible for the outages, touting the fact that about 100,000 customers had already gotten their electricity restored. The utility estimated that customers without power -- most of them in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, except for a smattering in San Fernando Valley -- would most likely get service restored in between 24 and 48 hours. Los Angeles International Airport experienced a partial power outage and significant delays Wednesday night, as well as 20 domestic and three international inbound flights diverted. iReport: Woman injured from felled tree due to winds . As of late Thursday morning, that airport appeared to be operating normally with minimal delays, said Marshall Lowe, a spokesman for the Los Angeles World Airport Response Coordination Center. The same couldn't necessarily be said for some others, with Lowe noting that there was at one point a roughly one-hour delay for flights destined for Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport. Several hours later, around 4:30 p.m., the Federal Aviation Administration's website was still reporting a 49-minute average delay for flights to McCarran due to a ""traffic management program."" But by 7 p.m., no notable delays were being reported. Wintry weather was a chief concern in that Nevada city, where the weather service issued a freeze watch and forecast light accumulations of snow into Friday morning in addition to strong winds. Gale warnings were in effect for some Southern California coastal locales, while heavy snow fell over the central and southern Rockies as part of the same system, according to the weather service. Fire hazards were another potential problem, with the combination of strong winds and moderate-to-low humidity spurring red flag warnings through 6 p.m. PT Friday for Los Angeles and Ventura counties. Downed power lines adjacent to Occidental College in Los Angeles started a 2-acre grass fire and prompted a precautionary evacuation of those nearby, the Los Angeles County fire department said. No one was injured. CNN's Carey Bodenheimer and Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.","Significant delays are no longer being reported at Las Vegas' airport .

"(CNN) -- Three former Penn State University officials -- including ex-President Graham Spanier -- have been charged with conspiring to cover up years of sexual abuse against children by former football coach Jerry Sandusky. Spanier, along with former Athletic Director Tim Curley and ex-Vice President Gary Schultz, each face the same eight counts related to the Sandusky scandal, including perjury, conspiracy and endangering the welfare of children, Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly announced Thursday. Curley and Schultz are scheduled for a preliminary arraignment at Magisterial District Judge William C. Wenner's office at 2 p.m. on Friday, and Spanier's preliminary arraignment is slated for next Wednesday at 9:30 a.m. at the same judge's office, according to a Pennsylvania courts spokesman Jim Koval. Each of the three men is expected to attend his arraignment, said Koval. This is the first time Spanier has been charged in the wake of the scandal, which started unfolding publicly a year ago. Curley and Schultz previously had been charged with perjury and failing to report suspected child abuse. The three men ""essentially turned a blind eye to serial predatory acts"" by Sandusky, Kelly told a news conference in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Jerry Sandusky proclaims his innocence in jailhouse audio recording . ""This was not a mistake by these men. It was not an oversight. It was not misjudgment on their part. This was a conspiracy of silence by top officials working to actively conceal the truth, with total disregard for the children who were Sandusky's victims in this case,"" she said. Spanier's attorneys said ""there is no factual basis to support these charges"" and accused Kelly of acting as a pawn for Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett, who they said ""has made no secret of his personal hostility toward Dr. Spanier."" ""These charges are the work of a vindictive and politically motivated governor working through an unelected attorney general, Linda Kelly, whom he appointed to do his bidding and who will be a lame duck five days from now,"" according to a statement from the attorneys. They also accused Kelly and her staff of ""steadfastly"" refusing to meet with Spanier or his legal representatives ""despite repeated attempts to do so."" Gov. Corbett's spokesman Kevin Harley responded, ""Graham Spanier's statement is the ranting of a man who has just been indicted for covering up for a convicted pedophile. His arrogance reveals a man who has just found out that he is not above the law after all."" As a result of the charges, Penn State said Spanier -- who was removed as president in November 2011 -- will be placed on immediate leave. He had continued to serve as a tenured professor, although he was on a sabbatical. Attorneys blast Freeh report as Spanier speaks out . Penn State said it recently informed Curley that his fixed-term contract will not be renewed when it expires in June. Schultz had retired after he was initially charged last year. The university refused to comment on the charges ""out of respect for the legal process."" Curley's attorney Caroline Roberto said prosecutors didn't give her team any advance notice of the new charges. ""To be clear, Tim Curley is innocent of all charges,"" Roberto said in a statement. ""We are carefully reviewing the presentment and will reserve a more comprehensive comment for a later time."" Roberto filed a pre-trial motion Wednesday, asking to dismiss or suppress Curley's grand jury testimony. The motion alleges a conflict of interest because the woman Curley believed was representing him at the time, was actually representing Penn State University. CNN has reached out to Schultz's attorney Thomas Farrell, who previously said Schultz is innocent of the initial charges and he would fight to clear Schultz's name. Sandusky, 68, was convicted in June on 45 counts of child sex abuse, ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, which were laid out in graphic testimony by his accusers over the course of the less-than-two-week trial. Last month, he was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison, meaning he'll likely die behind bars. Speaking Thursday, Kelly cited as evidence a series of e-mails among Spanier, Schultz, and Curley from February 2001, referring, somewhat in code, to the infamous incident in which assistant coach Mike McQueary walked in on Sandusky sexually assaulting a young boy in a university shower room. CNN first reported in June about the allegedly incriminating e-mails. Ousted Penn State president says he was abused as a child . In July, in a 267-page report commissioned by the university, former FBI Director Louis Freeh blamed the three men and legendary former head football coach Joe Paterno for having ""never demonstrated ... any concern for the safety and well-being of Sandusky's victims until after Sandusky's arrest,"" while the board of trustees failed to perform its oversight duties. Paterno died on January 22. ""I'm not going to speculate or comment on Mr. Paterno's relationship to this investigation,"" Kelly said Thursday. ""He's deceased, and that's the end of it."" In an August interview published in the New Yorker magazine, Spanier ripped the Freeh report. ""It's unfair, it's deeply flawed, it has many errors and omissions,"" the former university president told Jeffrey Toobin, a staff writer for The New Yorker and CNN senior legal analyst. ""They interviewed, they say, over 430 people; many of those folks have spoken to me about their interviews. Many of them describe those interviews to me as a witch hunt."" Curley and Schultz are scheduled for a January trial on the initial two charges. Kelly said she thinks now that Spanier has been charged, the three men should face a joint trial, because of the intertwined nature of the charges. In July, the National Collegiate Athletic Association vacated Penn State's football wins dating back to 1998, the year when allegations that Sandusky was abusing children were first made. That penalty removed Paterno from the top of the list of Division I college football's winningest coaches. Sandusky, Paterno's top defensive assistant for more than two decades, has been placed in protective custody at the State Correctional Institution at Greene in Waynesburg, where he'll serve out his sentence for sexually abusing boys. Penn State review recasts story of football hero Paterno . ""Given the high-profile nature of this individual, coupled with the nature of his crimes, this makes him very vulnerable in a prison setting,"" Corrections Secretary John Wetzel said. He was transferred to the state prison Wednesday from the State Correctional Institution at Camp Hill, where he was physically and mentally evaluated. In the 1,800-inmate prison in Waynesburg, the former coach is being held in a single cell and has additional supervision and an escort when he's out of his cell for the three showers and five hours of exercise he is allotted weekly. All meals and any counseling or medical visits will take place in Sandusky's cell, according to a statement from the state's Department of Corrections. All visits will be ""noncontact,"" the statement said. Sandusky will be allowed to have a television, radio and other personal property as authorized by prison officials. Jurors determined that Sandusky, who retired from Penn State in 1999, used his access to university facilities and his foundation for underprivileged youths to abuse the boys sexually. During the trial, a 23-year-old man identified as Victim No. 4 testified that he was 13 when Sandusky sexually abused him in a university shower. Sandusky is appealing his conviction.

"(CNN) -- Kevin Cordova's family tried cooking hot food to stay warm. They wore their winter coats inside and buried themselves under blankets. But on Sunday, six days after powerful winds from Superstorm Sandy knocked out their power, temperatures dipped so low they couldn't spend another night in their home in Floral Park, New York. ""There's really no amount of blankets that can stop you from being cold in 30-degree weather,"" said Cordova, 28. ""We feel a little homeless right now.

How you can help people recover . Between 30,000 and 40,000 people in New York City could need housing, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Sunday. Officials are working on coming up with a solution, he said, but they haven't yet. ""We don't have a lot of empty housing in this city,"" he said. ""We are not going to let anybody go sleeping in the streets. We're not going to let anybody go without blankets, food and water, but it's a challenge and we're working on that."" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo described it as a ""massive housing problem."" The storm that broke records -- and hearts . ""People are in homes that are uninhabitable,"" Cuomo told reporters. ""It's going to become increasingly clear that they're uninhabitable when the temperature drops and the heat doesn't come on."" In Long Island's Nassau County, where 266,000 customers were still without power Sunday, some people have died while trying to heat their homes with propane grills and other improvised methods, County Administrator Edward Mangano said Sunday. ""We've very concerned about people sheltering in places without proper heat,"" he said. Utility officials warned some residents that it could take until Wednesday for power to be restored, Cordova said. The freelance editor said his family was grateful their house survived the storm, but they're unsure of what to do if their power stays out much longer. On Sunday night, his family planned to stay with friends. ""We're all staying in different houses,"" he said, ""but I don't know how long we can keep that up."" More than 10,000 people across nine states spent Saturday night in shelters, American Red Cross spokeswoman Attie Poirier said. The Red Cross is sending 80,000 blankets to the region ahead of colder weather predicted this week. ""As we move through energy and gasoline, housing is really the No. 1 concern,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who spoke in Hoboken, New Jersey. Live blog: Aftermath of Sandy . ""And we don't even know yet which of the houses are reparable and which are irreparable losses. Those assessments are going on right now, as well as finding temporary housing for individuals who can't move back to their home right away."" As of Sunday, roughly 182,000 people in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York had applied for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has approved more than $158 million in aid. In her apartment in Yonkers, New York, Julie Munn huddled under the covers, watching her breath in the air before she went to sleep. Her 6-month-old cat, Sheldon, got skittish, trying to crawl under things to keep warm. ""It got so cold that I left Saturday morning,"" she said. ""It was the same temperature inside the apartment as it was outside."" Munn, 25, who stayed at her parents' house, got word that her power came back Sunday. But many others were still in limbo. ""People aren't leaving their homes,"" said Staten Island resident Tara Saylor, 25. ""They have no place to go."" Official: Sandy-stricken areas will vote 'come hell or high water' For many, keeping warm isn't simply a matter of turning on the heat, after Superstorm Sandy knocked out gas lines and electricity. More than 1.5 million customers were without power across 15 states and the District of Columbia. Among those still in the dark Sunday was New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who urged patience. ""I know it stinks. I still don't have power at my house. I'm not happy about it ... but it's the way it is,"" he said. Less than a million households in New Jersey were without power Sunday, he said, down from 2.7 million soon after the storm. Sandy wreaks havoc on NYC art . Colder weather is only one concern the region faces, with the presidential election on Tuesday. Election officials in New York City will temporarily relocate or combine some poll sites because of damage from Sandy, the Board of Elections said in a statement Sunday. In New Jersey, Christie ordered early voting sites to offer extended hours through the weekend to encourage voters to make it to the polls. For those who can't make it to their voting precincts, Christie ordered election officials to allow displaced New Jersey voters to cast their ballots electronically by submitting a mail-in ballot application via e-mail or fax. Once approved, the voter will be sent an electronic ballot that can, in turn, be e-mailed or faxed back to the county clerk. Long gas lines test patience . The 900-mile-wide superstorm left a huge swath of damage when it hit the Northeast last week, claiming at least 110 lives in the United States and two in Canada after earlier killing 67 around the Caribbean. Worst-hit New York state suffered 47 deaths, including 40 in New York City, authorities said. Half of those were in Staten Island. Almost a week since the storm hit, Staten Island resident Diana Cristiano is struggling to make sense of its surreal aftermath. She found valuables in the bushes, a generator in the pool and a fish -- still alive -- inside her flooded childhood home. A boat from a nearby canal ended up on a neighbor's lawn. ""It looks like a war zone with people's stuff all out everywhere,"" said Cristiano, 24. Volunteers were on hand to aid in the recovery effort, including hundreds of would-be New York City Marathon runners, reported CNN affiliate NY1. The race, scheduled for Sunday, was canceled for the first time in its history so as not to draw resources and attention away from the response. Extra day of voting possible in New York . Other marathon runners decided to go ahead with the race, ""without any official support from the city and without diverting any resources,"" said CNN iReporter Talis Lin, who sent photographs from the course. As communities grapple with the human toll, the price of the damage is stunning: Between $30 billion and $50 billion, according to disaster modeling firm Eqecat. That far exceeds the firm's pre-storm estimate of $20 billion. Officials said Sunday that relief was in sight for residents facing fuel shortages, with Defense Department plans to deliver generators and fuel to stations that need electricity and gasoline. ""We think things will be getting better. We know what a disaster this is,"" New York Sen. Charles Schumer said Sunday. ""My wife waited two and half hours for gas yesterday and called me every half hour to see what I was doing about it, so this is an answer to her as well as to every New Yorker."" Meanwhile, Bloomberg said he plans to take the subway on Monday, a sign that transit is coming back. Powerless in New Jersey . New York City students will also go back to school Monday, Bloomberg said. Some students will be bused to other locations if their schools have been damaged and cannot reopen. Adding to concerns, a storm is forecast for the region this week. ""As we have this nor'easter coming ... we have to remain extremely vigilant about our neighbors,"" New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said Sunday. While many residents are seeking disaster relief help from federal and state officials, she said, some of the state's seniors may be afraid to leave their homes, even if they don't have heat. And they may not know what resources are available. ""What I'm most concerned about right now are the people we haven't met and we haven't seen,"" she said. 7 health risks in the wake of the superstorm .

"(CNN) -- While we'll never know for sure what he would have done differently, the hallmark of Steve Jobs' genius was that he reacted to changes in the marketplace by forging entirely new territory through powerful design and radical innovation. Apple spent a decade far out in front of the competition through Jobs' almost uncanny combination of vision and showmanship. During that time, buying a new Apple device was always exciting and surprising (even if it was occasionally frustrating). And now, Apple seems to be in danger of becoming a wallflower. Instead of leading, will the company increasingly become a follower? Apple is reportedly testing larger screens for its phones and tablets, partly in reaction to the success of the devices released by its main rival, Samsung. Sure, competition is tough in the mobile devices market. Samsung's Galaxy S4, with its 5-inch screen, has become the fastest selling Android phone in history. Apple's iPhone 5 has a 4-inch screen and its iPad has a 9.7-inch screen. Devices that run the Android operating system come in a range of sizes, most of which tend to be bigger. One can argue that most apps don't need a big-screen experience. In fact, a big part of the mobile revolution was about creating simple experiences that are vastly superior because they were designed to work on a small screen (Google maps and Instagram are two good examples). To put it another way, people may want an SUV because it's bigger, but a sports car would probably give them a smoother ride. Although it's hard to argue that playing games and viewing videos can benefit from a big screen, it's perfectly fine to kill off all the pigs in Angry Birds or finish an episode of ""The Walking Dead"" in the confines of a 4-inch screen. If it's any indication, more than 50 billion apps have been downloaded from the Apple app store in just five years. So if thing are great then why should Apple be thinking about bigger screens? One reason is that Apple's stock has fallen in the past 10 months, with Wall Street feeling nervous about the company's future and its ability to come up with innovative products. On Tuesday, Apple released its quarterly earnings. While sales beat expectations, profits were down. Apple has already put out a smaller iPad, the iPad mini. But every new screen size brings the company one step closer to the riot of sizes and resolutions that have made developing apps for Android devices far more difficult than for iOS devices. We tend to tout changes in technology as a good thing. And like all companies, Apple is looking to make smart changes. Although Apple has modified its stance, it's clear that the iPad mini is not quite the device we would have seen if Jobs was around today. In the hyper-competitive mobile market, two years is a lifetime. Since Jobs passed away in 2011, the current version of iOS already seems dated and stale. Android may not be better in many ways, but it's pulling ahead in innovation, including better meshing of apps, smarter and more interactive icons, and reinventing basic interface elements like the keyboard. In response, Apple is releasing a new version of its operating system in the fall. Despite showing off some bold (and controversial) design choices, it seems more evolutionary than revolutionary. Apple is well aware that innovation is still a key part of its appeal. But without its creative genius at the helm, the company is going head to head with Samsung in the marketplace. That still leaves us waiting for the next big thing. What Apple needs most are bold new ideas, not bigger iPhones or iPads. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Mayer.","Apple's quarterly earnings show profits have fallen but sales have beaten expectations .

"(CNN) -- Fixing the economy has long been at the top of everyone's presidential wish list. Nearly half of all Americans named the economy the most important issue facing the nation today, followed by the deficit and health care, according to a current CNN poll. But there are a lot of hot button issues Americans would like President Obama to address in his second term. CNN iReport challenged people to finish the sentence, ""In his second term, Obama should ..."" and the responses were varied and surprising. Read below and watch the videos to see four of the most interesting. Sworn in again, Obama lingers for last look . 1. Rebuild infastructure . Cherry Davis, who has been struggling in the Los Angeles job market for the past couple of years, believes she knows the best way for the president to create jobs, taking inspiration from President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Davis thinks rebuilding the nation's infrastructure, part of what she terms ""a modern New Deal,"" would be the best thing Obama could focus on in his new term. She voted for Obama this election. ""I believe that our country is behind and it's because we are not rebuilding our infrastructure,"" she said. ""Instead, we are using the same methods that took place after the Great Depression. We need to rebuild our infrastructure from energy to roads to bridges."" ""This would get America back to work building a larger tax base and bringing the middle class back. We need to keep up with technology from a nationwide high speed rail, to our power grid. Updating our nation will create jobs."" Davis said that she would take a job to help rebuild the country's infrastructure if one became available. CNN.com commenter ""Leftcoastrocky,"" agreed. ""Our infrastructure has been neglected for a full generation and is making our economy less efficient and more expensive."" A tale of two terms: Unfinished business and battles ahead . 2. Improve education in the United States . Education ranked fourth on our list of top issues during the election as voted by CNN.com readers and iReporters, so it was less of a surprise to see Obama voter and rising East Carolina University student Tyler Stocks mention this topic. Stocks said he relies on financial aid for his education, as increasing college tuition and textbook prices have been a strain. Costs have risen as much as 8.3% at public universities, according to a 2011 U.S Department of Education study. ""I plan to transfer to a university in the summer but am worried about how to pay for it,"" he said. ""Even with financial aid, education has become a matter of affordability and the whole idea of following your dreams is difficult when you can't afford to. I am hoping that the president can work to ensure that students such as I are afforded with the opportunity to receive a good education.""

"(CNN) -- We have a Department of Justice, not a Department of Social Justice. That is an essential distinction. It is brought into sharp relief by politicized demands that George Zimmerman, having just been acquitted of murder by the state of Florida, be subjected to a second prosecution -- a federal civil rights indictment -- over the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. The Justice Department has earned the trust of the United States courts precisely because it resists the politicization of law enforcement. Its tradition is to ensure the equal protection of law for every American, to evaluate cases strictly on the basis of facts and law, and to recognize its obligations not only to the community but also to criminal suspects. Yet, though Attorney General Eric Holder never tires of reminding us about the due process owed even to foreign terrorists who've confessed to mass murder, the principle does not seem to apply to Zimmerman, an American now acquitted of murder. Even if the Justice Department never files criminal charges against Zimmerman -- which is likely given the implausibility of obtaining a conviction -- it is extremely inappropriate for law enforcement officials, particularly the U.S. attorney general, to engage in a running extrajudicial commentary that taints the jury pool and ratchets up the investigative anxiety for a citizen who is presumed innocent and has been acquitted. Law enforcement officials speak in court -- with public charges, if prosecutors have the evidence to back them up. The justice system is not a morality play. It is not designed to right every wrong, nor has it the capacity to remediate tragedy, such as the indescribable pain the Martin family endures after the loss of their 17-year-old son. In the face of such tragedy, the human instinct to demand some kind of ""justice"" -- social, poetic or cosmic -- is something we all feel. But that is not the justice our legal system exists to dispense. Federal courts prosaically apply established law to provable facts, and they rely heavily on the Justice Department to perform that duty faithfully. When a popular political narrative -- such as the left's portrayal of racism as the root cause of many American ills -- crashes into uncongenial facts, the justice system is the place where the narrative must yield, and the Justice Department is supposed to ensure that it does. Sadly, just the opposite has happened in the Zimmerman case. It has been bereft from the start both of proof that Zimmerman had the requisite criminal intent to sustain a murder charge and of evidence to refute his well-corroborated claim of self-defense. That is why veteran police investigators initially declined to file charges. Yet Holder and his subordinates joined in the effort to induce Florida to file charges, unabashedly making common cause with the likes of the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose metier is racially divisive demagoguery. Attending an anti-Zimmerman rally with Sharpton, Holder saber-rattled about filing a civil rights case. As the attorney general well knew, his inappropriate chatter would be construed as a suggestion that Florida had abdicated its responsibilities by declining to prosecute a purportedly racist murderer. Simultaneously, Justice's Community Relations Service worked closely with anti-Zimmerman activists to pressure Florida Gov. Rick Scott into reversing the police determination that there was no case. Scott finally caved, appointing the compliant special prosecutor Angela Corey, who dutifully lodged a groundless second-degree murder charge. Standard, prudent Justice Department practice has always discouraged commentary on criminal investigations outside the public record. That is for the politicians. Law enforcement is not supposed to speak until the government is ready to file public charges and back them up in court. To the contrary, Holder has engaged in an extrajudicial publicity campaign, and now finds himself in the hot seat: It's been over a year since he promised to file charges if warranted by the facts, and the facts have long been known -- indeed, they've been tried in court. Obviously, it is easier to promise to keep investigating -- and to keep alive a race narrative dear to President Obama's political base -- than to acknowledge that there is no federal case against Zimmerman. The insurmountable proof problems Florida prosecutors faced do not even begin to describe the challenges that would confront a federal case. A civil rights case would require proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman shot Martin out of racial animus. There is no evidence that Zimmerman has ever been a racist -- jurors in the Florida case say race was not relevant to the case, and the FBI, after investigating extensively for months, has been unable to find proof of a racial motivation. Furthermore, a federal prosecution would require proof that Zimmerman was trying to prevent Martin's enjoyment of some statutorily specified civil right -- like attending school, applying for a job, staying in a hotel, going to a restaurant, or participating in a federal program. The Zimmerman-Martin altercation was purely local with no federal implications. Finally, in light of the Justice Department's heavy-handed role in pressuring Florida to bring a case that police originally decided not to charge, there may be a serious question whether the ""dual sovereignty"" exception to double jeopardy -- allowing a federal prosecution despite a state acquittal -- applies. This is not a federal case. If real justice had been served, it would never have been a criminal case at all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew C. McCarthy.","Andrew McCarthy: Justice Department should handle cases based strictly on facts and law .
McCarthy: Attorney General Eric Holder should not have politicized the Zimmerman case .
He says Zimmerman case is not a federal case because civil rights was not an issue .
McCarthy: If justice had been served, Zimmerman case would never have been a criminal case ."
"(CNN) -- In the iconic film, ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" Atticus Finch, a white lawyer defending a black man accused of attempting to rape a white woman in the deep South, is delivering his closing argument to an all-white-male jury: ""In this country, our courts are the great levelers ... in our courts, all men are created equal,"" he says. Like the fictional defendant in the film, black America knows all too well that in this country, the promise of equal justice for all is often a hollow one. That is never more true than in cases where a black man or boy is killed by a non-black. There will be much debate in the coming days about whether the not guilty verdict in the Zimmerman self-defense trial was the right or wrong outcome. Experts will analyze the strategy, tactics and performance of the prosecutors and the defense attorneys, seeking to explain it. This, however, will miss the bigger and more important point: In truth, when black boys and men are killed by non-blacks, more often than not, justice will not be served. Many black parents will try to explain to their children, especially their sons, what to make of the verdict, and they may be at a loss for words. How is it possible that a black child, walking where he had a right to walk, doing absolutely nothing wrong, could be pursued, confronted and ultimately shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer -- and the killer escape punishment? LZ Granderson: Trayvon could have been my son . White America cannot conceive of such a thing happening to its children, nor can it imagine that, were such a travesty to occur, the killer would escape punishment. But for black America, Trayvon Martin is the latest name on a long list of African-American men and boys whose non-black killers escaped justice in America's courts -- a list that runs from Emmett Till to Amadou Diallo to Oscar Grant to Sean Bell. Often, the killers are never even charged and brought to trial, which is precisely the course that the Zimmerman case would have taken were it not for the protests of African-Americans and others across the country. Waldman: Zimmerman case echoes issues of race, guns . There was a time in this nation's history, not so very long ago, when black America looked to the courts, particularly its federal courts, for justice, and received it, most notably in the area of civil rights. The courts, particularly the Supreme Court, were places where black America's rights were validated and vindicated. Now, our courts are places where black America's rights are often eviscerated. Black America's belief in the possibility of receiving justice from our legal system is eroded by every verdict that fails to hold a killer who is not black accountable for the death of a black man or boy. I was at the mall in my predominantly African-American community doing late-night shopping when the verdict was read. Like the Black store clerks who waited on me, I did not expect that Zimmerman would be found guilty, but I did harbor that hope. Brazile: Doing what's right not just about law . Now, my heart is heavy, not merely because Zimmerman was acquitted, but also because we as a nation have yet to make Atticus Finch's words ring true. Until we do -- until our courts are really ""the great levelers"" in which ""all men are created equal,"" African-Americans killed by non-blacks will not find justice in a system that fails to demand accountability for their lost lives. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicole Austin-Hillery .","Nicole Austin-Hillery: Justice in U.S. often hollow, especially for blacks killed by non-blacks .

"ESTEROS DEL IBERA, Argentina (CNN)  -- When Doug Tompkins wants to drop in on his neighbor, the best way to do so -- in fact, the only way to do so -- is to fire up his Cessna 206 and fly across the vast subtropical wetlands that he owns in this remote corner of northeastern Argentina. Doug Tompkins and his wife Kris have dedicated their lives to land conservation in Argentina and Chile. I'm along for the ride with Tompkins, and I must admit, I'm nervous. Not only is this six-seater the smallest airplane I've ever been in, but it's also windy outside -- and storm clouds are gathering. Not to worry, my pilot assures me. ""I've been a pilot longer than you've been alive,"" says Tompkins, 66. And it's true. During the flight we pass a thousand feet over the wetlands, and I watch the landscape change rapidly below: Long, thin lagoons slice through thick fields of brown marsh. Tiny floating islands sit engulfed by lush green prairies. With his keen eye, Tompkins spots a lone marsh deer, knee-deep in water, munching on grass. More than 350 bird species live in the wetlands, which is roughly the size of Belgium. ""It's a hotspot for biodiversity. It's full of creatures. Aquatic creatures. Creatures flying in the air, and on the ground. So its conservation is important: To Argentina and to the world,"" he says. I traveled to the Esteros del Ibera -- which means 'shining water' in the Guarani language -- to profile Tompkins and his wife, Kris, for CNN International's ""Going Green"" series. We are highlighting ""Green Pioneers"" from around the world, and Doug and Kris Tompkins certainly fit the bill. For the past twenty years they have dedicated their lives to land conservation in Argentina and Chile. Their method is simple: Buy up huge swaths of land, restore their eco-systems, slow development, and then donate the land to governments as national parks. Wildlife philanthropy has existed in the United States for more than a century, but here in South America, this type of charity is not common -- and is even viewed with suspicion by some. ""South America doesn't have a long tradition of conservation philanthropy. There haven't been a lot of people from the private sector that have said 'Look, we're willing to buy land and turn it back over to the government and make parklands' -- but slowly it catches up,"" he says. Tompkins made a fortune as the founder of The North Face and Esprit clothing companies. In 1990, he cashed in his shares in Esprit, making millions in the process. Kris soon followed suit, ending her 18-year stint as CEO of the Patagonia outdoor clothing company. ""The fashion business is not the business to be in if you're trying to contribute to diminishing the impact on nature,"" Doug says. Through their Conservation Land Trust and Conservacion Patagonica organizations, the Tompkins have purchased approximately 900,000 hectares in Argentina and Chile, spending $275 million dollars of their own money in the process. They have already helped establish two national parks in the wind-swept Patagonia region: Argentina's Monte Leon National Park and Chile's Corcovado National Park. They are hard at work on several other ambitious projects, including the Esteros del Ibera, which the Tompkins hope to one day turn into Argentina's largest national park. ""Buying land, conserving it and shepherding it towards national park status, yes, it is probably legitimate to call us pioneers,"" says Kris, 59. Still, the Tompkins' conservation work is not applauded by all. There has been fierce opposition to their efforts in both Argentina and Chile by those weary of the growing presence of foreign landowners in South America. In addition to the Tompkins, clothing magnet Luciano Benetton, actor Sylvester Stallone and CNN founder Ted Turner also own huge areas of land in Argentina. As anti-American sentiment has grown here over the past decade, the Tompkins have been accused of many things. ""There were really wild allegations that we were creating a Jewish state, though we don't happen to be Jewish. That we were creating a nuclear waste dump for the U.S. That we were creating a passage for Argentina to finally militarily overtake Chile. All these things are society's ways of beginning to accommodate new ideas,"" says Kris. Just getting to the Esteros del Ibera is a challenge. My journey started with a 10-hour, 700-km overnight bus ride from my home in Buenos Aires to the small town of Mercedes in Corrientes Province. From there, cameraman Eduardo Aragona and I drove two hours on a bumpy, red-dirt road to arrive at the Estancia Rincon del Socorro, the traditional Argentine ranch that the Tompkins operate, and where guests from around the globe come to get up-close looks at rare species of capybara, caiman, deer and scores of birds. ""We are trying to restore the place and bring back the species that were already extinct, like the anteater. And we are working with the Pampas deer, which is a very endangered species. And perhaps in some years we will bring back the jaguar, that is our big dream,"" says Sofia Heinonen, a wildlife biologist who heads the Conservation Land Trust's initiatives here. While the Tompkins are heroes in most environmental circles, some activists and political leaders have labeled Doug as arrogant, eccentric and out-of-touch with the pressing needs of humans. He told me that he does what he does because he feels the need to ""pay rent"" for living on planet earth. ""The reality is that nature doesn't care about human economies, or social justice or whatever problems exists within the realms of human beings. It's just responding to impacts -- and we have to deal with those impacts one way or another,"" he says. Tompkins' way is to use his deep pockets to drive his even deeper commitment to conservation -- one hectare and one animal at a time.","Doug and Kris Tompkins have dedicated their lives to land conservation .

"(CNN) -- When the Battle of Gettysburg was over after three days, the Civil War's bloodiest battle had claimed 51,000 casualties. The Union Army of the Potomac clashed with Gen. Robert E. Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in July 1863. The battle turned against Lee and his invaders on July 3, and Confederate forces returned to Virginia. The ferocious battle, considered a turning point in the war, occurred 150 years ago this week, on land that is now a national military park. Gettysburg anniversary provides a bigger story . With soldiers' graves on the battlefield and near a former hospital site, Gettysburg residents pleaded with state officials to create what is now called the Soldiers' National Cemetery. At the cemetery's dedication on November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln gave his epochal two-minute Gettysburg Address, reminding listeners ""that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."" In 1864, a group of citizens established the Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association to preserve part of the battlefield as a memorial to the Union soldiers who fought there, according to the National Park Service. In 1895, the association transferred its land holdings to the federal government. The NPS took over administration of the park in 1933. This week, the park will continue to mark the 150th anniversary of the battle with a series of commemorative events. At least 25,000 visitors per day were expected from June 28 through July 7, according to the Gettysburg Convention & Visitors Bureau. Park stats: Gettysburg National Military Park welcomed about 1.2 million visitors last year. The nearly 6,000-acre site includes 1,320 monuments and memorials, 148 historic buildings, 410 cannons and the Soldiers' National Cemetery (with 7,756 total interments). (About 3,500 are Civil War burials. The rest came from subsequent wars.) The location: The site is in Adams County, Pennsylvania, about 35 miles southwest of Middletown's Harrisburg International Airport. If you go: There's no fee to enter the park but there is an admission fee for the Gettysburg Museum Experience, the film ""A New Birth of Freedom,"" narrated by Morgan Freeman, and the Gettysburg Cyclorama. (National Park passes are not accepted for entrance to the museum and visitor center.) Visitors can book licensed battlefield guides for private tours for a fee, and reservations are recommended. During the summer months, bus tours are available for a fee. Meet our ranger:  Seasonal park ranger Caitlin Kostic fell in love with the history of the Civil War in the fifth grade, when her teacher played the 1993 movie ""Gettysburg"" as part of a history lesson on the war. ""After watching it, I couldn't get enough of it and bought books and watched specials,"" said Kostic, 24, who lived in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, about 120 miles northeast of Gettysburg. ""As a result, my parents brought me to Gettysburg that summer for a one-night stay. I told my mom that someday I would be giving tours of the battlefield at Gettysburg."" Kostic started interning at the park in college and is working her third summer as a seasonal ranger, having just completed a master's degree in applied history. ""I love getting up every day and coming to a place that is rich in history, and I love spending my time reading, researching and teaching the public about things that are so much bigger than myself. It's a very humbling experience."" For a day trip, don't miss: The battlefield. ""That's the reason we are here."" A basic introduction to the battlefield can take two or three hours, Kostic said. ""You step out onto the field, and you are walking in the footsteps of the soldiers. ""You get a sense of what they saw and their struggles. It gets pretty hot and humid in the summer. You experience that heat and humidity in that terrain, putting yourself in the mindsets of the soldiers who fought here. That helps place (people) back in time. "" During the summer, there are about 20 free park ranger programs each day, every day of the week. Visitors can also purchase an audio CD to help navigate the field, take a bus tour or hire a licensed guide for a private tour. Favorite less-traveled spot: Power's Hill, located on the Baltimore Pike, was part of the Union army's artillery line and the site of Gen. George Gordon Meade's temporary headquarters on July 3. At the time of the battle, the hill was about half-covered in trees, while the other half was bare. Over time, the hill has been completely covered by trees. A park effort is underway to remove some of the trees ""to recapture the historic landscape"" of 1863, Kostic said. ""It's a very strategic part of the field. It's hard on a program to imagine those trees not there,"" she said. ""When the battlefield is rehabilitated, we can give more effective programs."" Favorite historical spot: Soldiers' National Cemetery. Created after the battle, but before the war ended in April 1865, there are 3,500 Union soldiers interred in the cemetery where Lincoln came to deliver his Gettysburg Address. It also contains the graves of soldiers of subsequent conflicts through Vietnam, Kostic said. It was closed to new burials in 1972. ""It shows that sacrifice is a generational thing,"" she said. ""Every generation has been called to sacrifice something. That sacrifice can be linked throughout the years ... and you can capture a lot of American history in that cemetery."" Favorite nature spot: Little Round Top. Part of the Union position on July 2-3 and perhaps the most visited part of the battlefield, the entire western slope of Little Round Top (which is also a hill) is void of trees. ""You can see the entire battlefield from this hill,"" she said. ""You can see the South Mountain range and part of the town, and you get a whole sense of the area. People enjoy going in the evening because they can watch the sunset. ""We look upon these fields as beautiful landscapes, but the only reason we look at them is because of the carnage that took place 150 years ago. At one point these fields were ugly because of the wounded and dead that littered the field."" Most transformative moment in the park: Last year on July 2, 2012, it was the anniversary of the battle. During anniversary days, the rangers give programs in real time, sharing history at the time it was actually being made on the battlefield. Located at Little Round Top, Kostic was giving her first-ever real time program at 4 p.m., at the time fighting had occurred at that spot. ""The actions of the people 149 years ago made the site important [that anniversary day],"" she said. ""Knowing the stories of the men, knowing that many of them were wounded and dying ... it's an extremely humbling experience."" Favorite other park to visit: The National Mall in Washington, D.C. ""I love the fact that there is so much to do, and it's free,"" Kostic said. If she had to pick one site at the mall, it's the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. ""That's my favorite spot at the mall.""","Battle of Gettysburg took place 150 years ago at a site that is now a national military park .

"New York (CNN) -- No one knows whether the tooth fairy will be in attendance, but a tooth belonging to former Beatle John Lennon will go on auction in England on November 5. American comedians have long derided the English about their teeth, but is anyone going to spend thousands of dollars on what could be one of the more unusual pieces of Beatles memorabilia? Karen Fairweather, the owner of Omega Auction house, chuckled when asked why anyone would want to buy the molar and noted that some have expressed interest, while others think it's gross. ""We get a lot of people buying memorabilia as investments,"" Fairweather said. ""Or it could just be a fan that really, really wants a part of John Lennon."" The molar, which has some discoloration and a cavity -- probably why it was removed by a dentist -- will be available with a reserve bidding price of just under $16,000. Lennon gave the tooth to Dorothy ""Dot"" Jarlett when she worked as his housekeeper at his Kenwood home in Weybridge, Surrey, according to her son Barry. Jarlett, who was employed between 1964 and 1968, developed a warm relationship with Lennon, her son said. ""She was very close with John, and one day whilst chatting in the kitchen, John gave my mother the tooth (he had been to the dentist to have it removed that day) and suggested giving it to my sister as a souvenir, as she was a huge Beatles fan,"" he said. ""It has been in the family ever since."" With the exception of the last two years, the tooth has been in Canada for 40 years after Dot Jarlett's daughter married a Canadian. Barry Jarlett, who said his mother is now 90 years old, said it was the right time to pass it on rather than to risk the tooth getting lost. Fairweather said that the tooth is too fragile to conduct a DNA test but that she has no doubt about its authenticity. ""Because it's coming directly from Dot, we don't doubt the provenance of the item,"" she said. Some fans will sink their teeth into anything if they feel it's worth plunking down thousands to get closer to their idols. A clump of hair believed to have been trimmed from Elvis Presley's head when he joined the Army in 1958 sold for $18,300 in 2009 at Chicago's Leslie Hindman auctioneers. Jarlett said Lennon gave his family many gifts over the years. He plans to keep a leather wallet, and his mother still has a pearl necklace Lennon gave her when he returned from Japan.","The son of Lennon's former housekeeper is selling what he says is the singer's tooth .

"(CNN) -- The father of Bradley Manning, the soldier responsible for the largest leak of classified information in U.S. history, says he believes his son didn't do it. He doesn't see how he could have done it, Brian Manning told CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 in an interview that aired Tuesday night. ""Logistically, I can't understand -- because knowing computers as well as I do -- how you could get that much data out of a room with three other people in there, you know, sitting in close proximity, where everybody could see what everybody was doing,"" he said. ""I can't understand how that could be done."" His son, a former Army intelligence analyst, was convicted last month of stealing and sending a trove of classified data to the website WikiLeaks. What's next for Bradley Manning? He was acquitted of the most serious charge he faced, aiding the enemy, which could have put Manning in prison for life without the possibility of parole. Now, he faces a maximum possible sentence of 90 years. When he entered guilty pleas on the lesser charges this year, Manning spent more than an hour in court reading a statement about why he had leaked the information. He said that the information he distributed ""upset"" or ""disturbed"" him, but none of it, he thought, would harm the United States if it became public. ""I believed that if the general public, especially the American public, had access to the information ... it could spark a domestic debate on the role of the military and our foreign policy in general as it related to Iraq and Afghanistan,"" Manning said, according to a statement from his lawyer. Is the Snowden case Manning, Part Two? Asked about those comments, Brian Manning said that he thought his son was posturing. ""Yeah, I think he was grandstanding,"" he told CNN, adding that if his son was, in fact, responsible for the leak, he had no excuse for his actions. ""I mean, I can't fathom any reason to myself why he should be -- that I should forgive him for doing something like that because it's against my creed, or code of honor,"" he said. Brian Manning alluded to his time in the military, saying that he never spoke about what he did and wished his son had the same character. Authorities say the younger Manning delivered three-quarters of a million pages of classified documents and videos to the secret-sharing site WikiLeaks, which never confirmed the soldier was the source of its information. The material covered numerous aspects of U.S. military strategy in Iraq, gave what some called a ground view of events in the Afghanistan war and revealed the inner workings of U.S. State Department diplomacy in leaked cables. ""It's my country as well, and leaking information that's going to damage my country, and the soldiers in our military, you know, that would be very upsetting,"" Brian Manning said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Less money means less military, the nation's armed forces chiefs told Congress on Wednesday. The heads of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines explained -- again -- to the House Armed Services Committee that their services will be unable to meet their strategic responsibilities if forced budget cuts in coming years take effect as planned. The forced cuts, known in Washington-speak as sequestration, affect the military and other discretionary government spending except for entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. At Wednesday's hearing, the military chiefs all said sequestration cuts in coming years would leave their forces without the resources needed to fulfill the requirements of the Obama administration's strategic defense guidance for the military through 2020. ""These reductions will put at substantial risk our ability to conduct even one sustained major combat operation,"" Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno told the panel, adding that it was ""imperative that Congress not implement the tool of sequestration."" Calling himself a realist, Odierno said the end result would be an 18% cut in total Army forces over seven years. ""There are some who have suggested there will be no land wars in the future,"" Odierno said. ""While I wish that were true, unfortunately there is little to convince me that we will not ask our soldiers to deploy again in the future."" Past reductions in military readiness showed that ""the full burden of an unprepared and hollow force will fall directly on the shoulders of our men and women in uniform,"" he added. ""We have experienced this too many times in our nation's history to repeat this egregious error again,"" he said. The hearing came amid another budget war in Congress, with threats of a government shutdown in less than two weeks without a compromise. One issue in the budget debate is whether a new spending plan should contain the sequestration cuts forced by a 2011 budget deal. Both Democrats and Republicans say they don't want sequestration, but they cannot agree on a new spending plan. Republicans insist on holding overall spending to the level that included the sequestration cuts, while Democrats generally want to provide some more funding while adjusting spending levels.

"(CNN) -- He's been a principal figure in German football for decades, winning the 1974 World Cup as a player before becoming Bayern Munich's club president, but Uli Hoeness' world could come crashing down after being charged with tax evasion on Tuesday. The former Bayern star, who won three European Cups as well as a European Championship title with West Germany in 1972, could end up in jail for his transgressions. After a months-long probe which has attracted considerable interest in Germany, the 61-year-old has been charged following an investigation into unpaid taxes on a Swiss account in his name. The news comes just two months after Hoeness presided over an unprecedented feat as Bayern became the first German team to win a league, cup and Champions League treble. In a statement, the superior regional court in Munich said it must now decide whether the case brought by the local prosecutor's office will go to trial. German law states that Hoeness' defense lawyers now have four weeks to respond to the charges, whereupon a judge will decide whether he can dismiss the charges or allow the case to proceed. ""Due to the volume of the investigation files as well as the fact that a defense request to delay answering to the charges for one month was granted, a decision of the court on starting a trial is not expected before the end of September 2013,"" court spokeswoman Andrea Titz said in the statement. Tax evasion over and above one million euros ($1.33m) carries the threat of both prison and a financial penalty. After his arrest in March, the former Bayern forward had offered to temporarily stand down as club president only for the team's board to decide that he should stay in office as they monitored the case. Hoeness had been released on bail for $6.6 million. After joining Bayern as an 18-year-old in 1970, Hoeness -- who could play either in midfield or attack -- became a key player for the club, winning three league titles and three straight European Cups between 1974-1976. His playing career was cut short by a knee injury at the age of 27, whereupon he joined the club's staff at a time when Bayern were heavily in debt. After nearly three decades working as the club manager, he replaced former international and club colleague Franz Beckenbauer as Bayern president in 2009. Nowadays, Bayern are one of the most successful clubs in Europe, with a turnover in its millions, but it is unclear how the tax probe will affect the standing of the powerful club president. The revelations sparked huge controversy in Germany in an election year, with opponents of Chancellor Angela Merkel accusing her of being weak on the issue of tax evasion by wealthy individuals. The Chancellor has previously expressed her disappointment in Hoeness' conduct. As former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola took charge for the first time in a competitive game, Bayern started their season in disappointing fashion on Saturday when losing the German Super Cup to Borussia Dortmund, the team they beat at Wembley in May. They begin the defense of their Bundesliga title when taking on Borussia Monchengladbach at the Allianz Arena on August 9.","Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness charged with tax evasion by a court in Munich .

"(CNN) -- Miracles do happen. Like this week, when Amanda Berry, Georgina DeJesus and Michelle Knight escaped their captor after being missing for a decade. It turned out they were locked away and alive the entire time. Their fortuitous escape is like a ray of light and reminds us that sometimes good things do happen. A cry for help came out from the walls of silence, and a member of the community responded, aiding in the rescue. The selfless act of a total stranger only reinforces that the public will help when needed. But their story is unusual. Many missing persons who have been missing for a long time are still not found. We should urge all communities to play an integral part in assisting law enforcement in investigations about missing persons. We live in a world filled with powerful technology that has enabled us to communicate faster and better, yet we seem to lack the simple face-to-face meeting that must take place when searching for clues and information in any type of investigation. At-a-glance: Still missing in the U.S. The old ""knock and tell"" method remains an effective tool today. It must be used when searching for our missing persons. When you talk to someone in person, you can read them better by registering their expressions, gestures and other factors. Sometimes, those things could yield clues. This door-to-door technique can make the difference in finding someone in hours, days or years. There's no doubt that trying to find missing persons requires a tremendous amount of work. Classifying cases as ""runaways"" or ""walk-aways"" does nothing to help the outcome of any given case. If anything, it could hinder and slow the process. The general public normally will not have a heightened sense of concern for those believed to have left on their own. The sense of urgency and hitting the ground running from the start could be the difference in many missing person cases. A case can be misdiagnosed upon closing; this is when we confirm that the labeling provided a wrong direction. The word ""missing"" should be enough and important; the alert(s) system in place such as the Amber/silver provide an additional emergency notification seeking the public's help. The myth of ""a waiting period"" to report a missing person still lingers, and many families are turned away by officials and forced to begin their journey on their own without any direction or support. Due to heavy caseloads, law enforcement officials are frequently not afforded the continuous training and education that could help them in the search for a missing person. Abused but alive: Lessons from survivors . All too often, information is not provided to victims suffering a missing loved one in the onset, such as where to file the report and what agencies can provide support services and help with advocacy and on-the-ground services. These are all key issues that need to be addressed as we move forward to bring home those missing in our country. Cold cases and unidentified persons need to be revisited and reopened. All cold cases need to be updated and looked at again with a keen eye on what can be done to aid in a recovery. As we rejoice in the happy ending for the three women and their families and friends, we need to be reminded that there is still much work to be done in the world of the missing. We need to remember that there are thousands of people who are still seeking resolution and waiting for answers concerning their loved one. As a community, we need to come together, take notice and become aware of what happens in our homes, neighborhoods, towns and cities. And we need to always remember that ""every missing person is somebody's child.""

"(CNN) -- The rest of the world is probably asking what's in the drinking water here in New York, where ex-Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who resigned in 2008 when his hiring of hookers came to light, surprised everybody by announcing a bid for city comptroller. Spitzer, dubbed the Love Guv by the city's tabloids, leaps back into the political arena less than two months after former Rep. Anthony Weiner (who'd resigned after texting obscene photos to strangers) announced a run for mayor. Which raises the admittedly uncomfortable possibility that the city's top two elected officials will be two nationally-known, high-profile married politicians with less than honorable sex-related behavior on their resumes. But that's as far as the similarities go. Spitzer and Weiner have very different histories, committed fundamentally different offenses and will face dramatically different odds in the few weeks left before voters head to the polls in the all-important Sept. 10 Democratic primary. Has the road to political redemption gotten shorter? Start with the crimes. Weiner, whose scandalously bawdy texts and photos never involved actually physically meeting up with a woman, spent a week lying about the incidents on any number of local and national television outlets, claiming that his House of Representatives account had been hacked. That, in turn, led to calls for an FBI inquiry, after which Weiner's tower of lies collapsed. Spitzer, by contrast, simply admitted that he'd hired hookers, apologized for his misbehavior and quit. He now campaigns without the baggage, which Weiner still carries, of having lied to the public and press repeatedly. When it comes to the record each man brings to the campaign trail, it's not even a close call. In more than eight years as state attorney general and 14 months as governor, Spitzer compiled a string of high-profile wins in battles with Wall Street and prosecutions on behalf of low-paid workers. He also implemented a historic increase of state funding to local school districts and appointed the state's first Latina secretary of state. Spitzer seeks return to politics -- as NYC comptroller . Weiner's tenure in Congress was notably skimpy on tangible wins. A recent New York Times story noted that, over a 12-year career, Weiner wrote exactly one bill that got enacted. He was a visible, effective voice on key issues, but not the kind of politician who immersed himself in the machinery of government or coalition-building. But the biggest distinction between the two men, and the most politically relevant, involves their respective paths to victory. Weiner, running in a crowded 6-candidate race, is leading in the polls and, under New York rules, could get into a Democratic runoff pitting him against one of his rivals. He is currently grinding his way through a seemingly endless series of public forums and debates. By Spitzer leaps into an all-but-empty race for comptroller that had been largely conceded to Scott Stringer, a longtime political insider who'd spent two decades in the legislature and eight in the relatively powerless position of borough president of Manhattan. Spitzer, who is funding his campaign using his family's personal fortune, hopes to use his money, celebrity and impressive record to blow past his opponent to victory. Polls suggest that about 40% of New Yorkers think Weiner's offenses disqualify him from office altogether; a comparable number may think the same of Spitzer. That leaves plenty of room for our city's famously tolerant population to decide if they can, or should, elect a pair of soiled, but talented, politicians to run the nation's largest city. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Errol Louis.","Errol Louis: Spitzer making new bid for NYC comptroller; he joins Weiner in arena .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama will travel this week to Copenhagen, Denmark, to make a big push for holding the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Chicago, Illinois, the White House said Monday. President Obama, center, hosts a White House event on September 16 to push Chicago's bid for the Olympics. Obama will join other administration officials and first lady Michelle Obama in pitching Chicago to the International Olympic Committee on Friday, spokesman Robert Gibbs said. The IOC will vote on the host city the same day. No other U.S. president has ever attended an IOC vote. Obama, who lived in Chicago and represented Illinois in the Senate before becoming president, will be on official business representing the bid by the United States to host the Olympics, Gibbs said Monday. ""I don't think there's any doubt that the president is enormously proud of Chicago and would be enormously proud of ... the city hosting the bid,"" Gibbs said, later adding: ""I think you'll hear directly from both the first lady and the president about what they think the Olympic Games mean and how Chicago hosting the Games fits with what we all believe the Olympics means."" Chicago is vying for the Summer Games against Madrid, Spain; Tokyo, Japan; and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Leaders from Brazil, Spain and Japan are expected to also make in-person pitches. The United States has hosted four Summer Olympic Games. The games were held in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1904; in Los Angeles, California, in 1932 and 1984; and in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1996. The last U.S. city to host the Olympics was Salt Lake City, Utah, which was the venue for the 2002 Winter Games. In April, the U.S. Olympic Committee chose Chicago over Los Angeles as the U.S. bid city. Earlier, three other U.S. cities were in the running: Houston, Texas; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and San Francisco, California. Obama held an event at the White House earlier this month to rally for Chicago as the host city. ""I may live in Washington these days, but I've called Chicago home for nearly 25 years,"" Obama said. ""It's a city of broad shoulders, big hearts, and bold dreams. A city of legendary sports figures, legendary sports venues and legendary sports fans. ""We want these games!"" Obama exclaimed, drawing applause. While in Denmark, the president and first lady will meet with Queen Margrethe II and her husband, Prince Henrik, the White House said in a release. Obama also is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen. Obama will leave Thursday night and return Friday afternoon, the White House said.","Chicago, Madrid, Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro are finalists to host 2016 Summer Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Police in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang have arrested 139 people for spreading religious extremism online, officials and state media said, amid a wider crackdown on internet rumors. A spokesman for the Xinjiang government, Luo Fuyong, said that local police had gathered around 900 pieces of evidence of online rumor spreading and arrested at least 256 people. Of those, he said 139 had spread rumors about jihad, or Muslim holy war, mainly through posting videos that showed violent terrorist attacks or taught viewers how to create bombs and explosive devices. ""Jihad and terrorists are the enemy of all human races,"" Luo said. The report did not say whether those arrested were Han Chinese or Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking predominantly Muslim ethnic group. The arrests were made from June 26 to August 31 following an outbreak of violence in the remote township, about 250 kilometers southeast of the regional capital Urumqi, that left 35 people dead. Frequent outbreaks of unrest have hit Xinjiang, a resource-rich region where the arrival of waves of Han Chinese people over the decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs. They complain of discrimination and harsh treatment by security forces, despite official promises of equal rights and ethnic harmony. Beijing has found it useful to portray such tensions as the result of outside interference, attempting to cast separatists as part of a global terror network since the 2001 World Trade Center attacks, said Nicholas Dynon, a researcher at Macquarie University in Australia. This strategy undermines sympathies at home and abroad for legitimate grievances of the Uyghurs, he added. ""Conflating international terrorism with domestic separatism is way for Chinese authorities to leverage support for their own issues."" The arrests in Xinjiang come amid a nationwide crackdown on online rumors that critics have said is a way for the government to squash dissent.","Police in Xinjiang arrest 139 people for spreading religious extremism online .

"(CNN) -- An Irish woman and a Scottish woman accused of trying to smuggle 25 pounds of cocaine from Peru to Europe pleaded guilty to the charges, the court handling the case said. Michaella McCollum, 20, from Ireland, was arrested alongside Melissa Reid, 19, from Scotland, by Peruvian national police at Jorge Chavez International Airport in Lima on August 6. They were stopped as they tried to board an Air Europa flight from Lima to Madrid after authorities found 11.59 kilograms (25.5 pounds) of cocaine in their luggage, hidden inside food packets. Their final destination was Palma de Mallorca in Spain. When they were arrested, the two women told police they had been coerced into carrying the cocaine. But the law firm representing McCollum said in a statement Wednesday that the investigating judge had interviewed her at Sarita Colonia prison in Lima and that she had accepted the charges. Sentencing in the case is due Tuesday. Lawyer Peter Madden said, ""I intend to travel to Lima next week to attend the sentencing hearing, and after the sentence is handed down by the judge, it will be possible (to) make further comment."" Reid also pleaded guilty to the charges, according to a statement from the court. The pair said they regretted their actions and have cooperated with investigators by elaborating on their role and the contacts who coordinated the smuggling attempt, the statement said. ""I feel very bad for the pain this has caused my family,"" Reid said, according to the statement. ""I assume full responsibility."" The women's sentences could range from eight to 15 years in prison, the court said. Since their arrests, the women have received consular assistance from their home government, a UK Foreign Office spokesman said. There is a prisoner transfer agreement between Peru and the United Kingdom, which means that individuals can apply to serve their sentence back in their home country, the spokesman said. Peru is the world's top cultivator of coca, the plant whose leaves are used to produce cocaine. It overtook Colombia for the dubious honor.

"(CNN) -- Ten military police officers in Brazil are accused of torturing and killing a 47-year-old brick layer -- and then hiding his corpse. The incident was allegedly committed by members of Brazil's Pacifying Police Unit, a team assembled to address crime before the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games comes to Brazil. The incident dates back to July 14 when Amarildo de Souza was taken to police headquarters in Rio de Janeiro by officers, state broadcaster Agencia Brazil reported. Souza was never seen again. Police said that Souza had been brought in for questioning and was released. But a prosecutor said there was no evidence from security camera footage that Souza ever left police headquarters, Agencia Brazil reported. There was evidence, the state news agency reported, that two security cameras were turned off or burned. Investigators believe Souza was tortured, killed and his body was concealed somewhere. Prosecutor Homero de Freitas plans to file a complaint against all 10 officers, Agencia Brazil reported. One of the 10 accused is a unit commander for the new Pacifying Police Unit. The military police team was created some years ago to clear the Rio de Janeiro slum, called a favela in Portuguese, of drug traffickers. The Pacifying Police Units are tasked with living and working in the favelas they protect.

"(CNN) -- Former Liberian President Charles Taylor will be transferred to the United Kingdom to serve a 50-year sentence for aiding war crimes in neighboring Sierra Leone, the U.K. Ministry of Justice said. No date for his transfer was provided by the ministry. The announcement comes two weeks after United Nations-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone ruled to uphold the sentence, rejecting an appeal. Another country like the United Kingdom had to offer to enforce the sentence against Taylor because the special tribunal doesn't have a prison facility. Taylor, 65, was found guilty last year of supplying and encouraging rebels in Sierra Leone in a campaign of terror, involving murder, rape, sexual slavery, looting and the conscription of children younger than 15. He was also convicted of using Sierra Leone's diamond deposits to help fuel its civil war with arms and guns while enriching himself with what have commonly come to be known as ""blood diamonds."" Both the defense and prosecution lodged appeals after the court convicted the former president of all 11 counts against him, following a trial lasting nearly four years. Taylor's defense appealed the court's judgment and sentence on multiple grounds, arguing that the trial chamber had made mistakes in evaluating the evidence and in applying the law. But the appeals judges rejected those arguments, saying that the trial chamber had ""thoroughly evaluated the evidence for its credibility and reliability,"" and that its assessment of Taylor's criminal responsibility and liability was in accordance with international laws. The appeals judges also dismissed defense claims that Taylor was not given a fair trial. The defense also argued that the 50-year sentence handed down was ""manifestly unreasonable,"" while the prosecution had argued that it should be increased to 80 years to adequately reflect the gravity of his crimes. The appeals judges dismissed both claims, saying the sentence was fair and reasonable. Rights group Amnesty International welcomed the ruling, saying it sent a clear message to leaders around the world. ""The Court's landmark ruling underlines that no one is above the law,"" said Stephanie Barbour, head of Amnesty International's Centre for International Justice in The Hague. ""The conviction of those responsible for crimes committed during Sierra Leone's conflict has brought some measure of justice for the tens of thousands of victims. The conviction of Charles Taylor must pave the way for further prosecutions."" Role in atrocities . Taylor was the first former head of state to be convicted of war crimes since the Nuremberg trials that followed World War II. The trial chamber heard that rebels from the Revolutionary United Front, which the former president backed, committed horrendous crimes against Sierra Leone civilians, including children. Some were enslaved to mine the diamonds used to fund the rebels' fight. The presiding trial judge described Taylor as responsible for ""aiding and abetting as well as planning some of the most heinous and brutal crimes recorded in human history."" But Taylor said during his sentencing hearing in May 2012 that his role in the conflict was much different than represented. ""I pushed the peace process hard, contrary to how I have been portrayed in this court,"" he said. A pivotal figure in Liberian politics for decades, he became president in 1997 and was forced out of office under international pressure in 2003. He fled to Nigeria, where border guards arrested him three years later as he was attempting to cross into Chad. The United Nations and the Sierra Leone government jointly set up the special tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities. The court was moved to the Netherlands from Sierra Leone, where emotions about the civil war still run high. Opinion: Do war crimes trials really help victims?

She said she hopes the Yemeni opposition will get international support -- if not necessarily the military intervention that NATO gave Libya's revolutionary fighters. ""The support we need is sanctions against Saleh and boycott of Saleh's regime and acknowledgment of Yemen's (opposition) national council,"" she said from Sweden, where she fled in the face of threats in Yemen. ""I hope that Ali Abdullah Saleh and his regime learn a lesson from what happened to Gadhafi and his government,"" said Mohammed Abulahoum, head of Yemen's opposition Justice and Development Party. ""Saleh must understand that the only scenario left for him, other than stepping down, is what happened to Gadhafi."" Regional expert David Hartwell agreed that Gadhafi's death could have ""ripple effects"" in the region, spreading the way the Arab Spring did. ""I think what we've seen in the past is that Tunisia had the effect of emboldening the opposition in Egypt,"" he said. ""That has ripple effects out to Yemen and Libya itself."" Yemen is closer to a change of power than Syria, he said. ""Saleh is already edging toward the door anyway. This could have the effect of pushing him through it,"" said Hartwell, senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at IHS Global Insight in London. ""Syrians may come to see that Libyans removed a dictator who was completely entrenched,"" he said, ""(but) we're not at that point yet, though there have been defections from the army. ""There are local factors in Syria that are going to make it much more difficult to have an effect -- the middle classes in Syria have yet to really throw their lot in with the opposition,"" he said. ""The situation is going to go along for the foreseeable future,"" he said. Radiating out from countries already in turmoil, more changes could be in store for the Middle East in the next few years, he said. ""Further down the line you may see disturbances in other countries,"" he said, adding that ""Bahrain has been postponed rather than resolved ... Iran, when there are presidential elections in two years -- but for the moment it's Syria and Yemen.""","""This is a lesson for all dictatorships,"" a Syrian opposition leader says .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- After spending nearly 28 years in an irreversible coma, heiress and socialite Martha ""Sunny"" von Bulow died Saturday in a New York nursing home, according to a family statement. She was 76. Sunny von Bulow is pictured during her 1957 wedding to Prince Alfred von Auersperg. Von Bulow was subject of one of the nation's most sensational criminal cases during the 1980s. Her husband, Claus, was accused of trying to kill her with an overdose of insulin, which prosecutors alleged sent her into the coma. He was convicted of making two attempts on her life, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. He was acquitted in a second trial. His retrial in 1985 received national attention. ""We were blessed to have an extraordinarily loving and caring mother,"" said the statement from Von Bulow's three children -- Annie Laurie ""Ala"" Isham, Alexander von Auersperg and Cosima Pavoncelli -- released by a spokeswoman. ""She was especially devoted to her many friends and family members."" Martha von Bulow was born Martha Sharp Crawford into a wealthy family. She inherited a fortune conservatively estimated at $75 million, according to an article on the von Bulow case posted on truTV.com's Crime Library Web site. In her early years, she drew comparisons to actress Grace Kelly. She became known as Princess von Auersperg with her first marriage, to Prince Alfred von Auersperg of Austria. That marriage produced two children: Alexander and Annie Laurie. The von Bulows married in 1966 and had a daughter, Cosima. On the morning of December 22, 1980, family members found Martha von Bulow unconscious in the bathroom of the family's posh Newport, Rhode Island, home. She never regained consciousness. She had been hospitalized a year earlier after lapsing into a coma but recovered, according to the Crime Library site. Doctors had diagnosed her with hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. Prosecutors accused Claus von Bulow of twice attempting to kill his wife by injecting her with insulin. The case also led to a major motion picture, ""Reversal of Fortune."" Actor Jeremy Irons won an Oscar for his portrayal of Claus von Bulow. Famed defense attorney Alan Dershowitz, who won Claus von Bulow a new trial on appeal after his conviction, said in a statement Saturday that Martha von Bulow's death is ""a sad ending to a sad tragedy that some members of her family tried to turn into a crime. We proved overwhelming[ly] that there was no crime and that the coma was self-induced. We saved his life, but could not save hers."" Claus von Bulow's defense team maintained that Martha von Bulow's alcohol use, among other factors, caused her coma. Dershowitz said he had spoken with Claus von Bulow, who now lives in London, England. Claus von Bulow was saddened by his former wife's passing, Dershowitz said. The family statement said Martha von Bulow is survived by her children, their spouses and nine grandchildren. Alexander von Auersperg and Ala von Auersperg Isham, who had sided with prosecutors against Claus von Bulow, filed a civil suit against their stepfather after his acquittal. The case was settled out of court in 1987, according to a 2007 article in the Providence Journal newspaper in Rhode Island. Claus von Bulow had agreed to waive his claim to his wife's money and to a divorce in exchange for the suit being dropped. The von Bulows' daughter, Cosima, sided with her father. Vanity Fair writer Dominick Dunne, who covered the von Bulow case, told the New York Daily News in 2007 that Sunny von Bulow was moved from Columbia Presbyterian hospital to a private nursing home in 1998.  Watch Dunne recall case » . Ala von Auersperg Isham served for a time as president of the Sunny von Bulow Coma and Head Trauma Research Foundation, according to the Providence Journal. An offshoot of that organization, the Brain Trauma Foundation, still operates in New York, the newspaper said. The family statement notes that Martha von Bulow actively supported the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Opera and the J.P. Morgan Library in New York and the Preservation Society of Newport, Rhode Island. A private memorial service will be held for family and friends in New York in the coming days, the family statement said Saturday, along with a private burial.

"(CNN) -- A radical leftist terror group has claimed responsibility for Friday's suicide bombing at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, Turkey, which killed a Turkish guard and wounded a television journalist. In a statement on its website, the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party, or DHKP-C, said ""E. Alisan Sanli has become a martyr after accomplishing the action on the American Embassy in Ankara."" The governor's office on Saturday confirmed his identity through forensic testing. Authorities have since detained three people for questioning over the attack and continue to investigate, according to the semi-official Anadolu new agency. ""We are going to build the future with sacrifices,"" said the militant group, which denounced U.S. foreign policy and criticized Turkey for its Western ties in a lengthy and at times rambling statement. Sanli received bomb-making training somewhere in Europe in the mid-1990s, according to Hasan Selim Ozertem, a security expert at the International Strategic Research Organization in Ankara. Turkish officials say that as a result of counterterrorism operations on Turkish soil, DHKP-C -- often described as having a Marxist-Leninist philosophy -- became increasingly active among the Turkish diaspora in Europe. Sanli returned to Turkey in 1997 and was subsequently involved in attacks on the Istanbul police headquarters and senior military officials using anti-tank weapons. After being arrested, Sanli went on a lengthy hunger strike and was released from jail in 2002 because of a neurological disorder. The blast killed spurred security clampdowns at diplomatic facilities in Turkey, plus messages of condolences and solidarity. Turkish Prime Minster Recep Tayyip Erdogan called it a strike ""against the peace and welfare of our country."" The violence reverberated well beyond Turkey's borders, especially in the nation whose embassy was targeted. The spotlight on U.S. diplomatic installations was already intense after violence last September in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, where Ambassador Christopher Stevens was one of four Americans killed in Benghazi.

"(CNN) -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner was told to take a month off work after doctors diagnosed her with a subdural hematoma. The diagnosis and the doctor's recommendation mean Fernandez will be out of commission during the critical campaign season for congressional elections on October 27. Spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said Saturday the president will suspend all her activities. A subdural hematoma is a blood clot on the brain's surface beneath its outer covering, called the dura. Often, in people over 60, a brain trauma can cause the blood vessels in the brain to tear, and blood to clot. In August, Fernandez, 60, suffered a cranial trauma, for which doctors conducted a brain scan and found normal results with no symptoms at the time, Scoccimarro said. Doctors at a Buenos Aires hospital discovered the hematoma on Saturday after a neurological evaluation, he said. According to Argentina's constitution, the vice president would assume the presidency temporarily in the president's absence, but officials have not said if that will occur in this situation. Fernandez's health made headlines when she underwent surgery in January 2012 to remove her thyroid, after doctors said they detected cancer in the gland. A few days later, a spokesman for Fernandez said she did not actually have cancer and that doctors had discarded their original diagnosis.","Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has a blood clot on the surface of her brain .

"(CNN) -- They do daredevil stunts on the nation's highways and byways, popping wheelies even while standing on the seat, swarmed by a vanguard of other bikers as if they've taken over the road. Their motorcycles aren't the Harleys of old. They're called ""crotch rockets,"" a high-performance motorbike allowing drivers to ride on one wheel for blocks, with legs spread-eagled. It's like the X Games meet street bikes. And their stunts are captured by cameras on their helmets, posted online with hip-hop music. This is the world of stunt bikers, whose road conduct is at the center of a national debate after a violent, videotaped confrontation between them and a family in a Range Rover on a New York City highway. At least six motorcyclists -- including an off-duty undercover officer riding with the biker club -- have been charged in the September 29 attack on the SUV driver, who was dragged from his car and beaten. Car drivers, some law authorities and critics portray this new breed of stunt bikers as reckless motorists imperiling the public. But the bikers, their families and attorneys dispute the outlaw characterizations and say the vast majority are law-abiding enthusiasts -- not hellions on a hog as depicted in the TV drama ""Sons of Anarchy."" ""Pop culture has driven this image"" of lawlessness, said Stephen Stubbs, a Nevada attorney for 43 motorcycle clubs. ""The big problem here is this: Motorcyclists are second-class citizens. That's a fact."" But the co-founder of an annual bikers gathering in St. Louis, Missouri, says he foresaw disaster in stunt biking years ago. He quit the theatrics, especially after his biker rally grew out of control. The Ride of the Century began as a meeting of about 250 bikers in 2001, said Dennis Cardwell. Now 2,000 bikers show up, and police say the motorcyclists' high-speed stunts are now a major traffic hazard, CNN affiliate KSDK reported. The bikers even blew through a police roadblock on Interstate 70 two years ago, which was captured on YouTube video, the station said. At this year's event in August, police confiscated dozens of motorcycles and arrested several bikers, the affiliate said. What began as bikers filming themselves to make money off their skills and doing it safely 12 years ago turned into something distressing for Cardwell, he told CNN. ""It became a monster,"" he said. Prosecutor: Off-duty officer 'terrorized' family as SUV driver was beaten . He worried about younger, inexperienced riders doing stunts beyond their ability. Cardwell and friends would be ""scared out of our mind about what might happen,"" he said. He feared for his own safety amid scores of cyclists he considered reckless. He also worried about car drivers near them. ""I've seen some scary stuff,"" Cardwell said. Sometimes riders will carry batteries in their pockets, and ""if the car does something to make them mad they'll throw them at the window,"" Cardwell said. Cardwell said the video recording pushes the stunt bikers to do death-defying tricks. ""There's kids that want their 15 minutes of fame or that quick glory,"" Cardwell said. ""I guess you'll get some bad seeds in the bunch every so often that they think cutting cars off and just basically taking up the whole highway with no regard for anyone else is the way to do that, to impress their friends."" The 35-year-old married father of three no longer owns a street bike -- just a dirt bike. He gave up street riding in 2006 about when his first child was born. He now feels stunt riding should be kept off the street. ""If you are going to do (tricks), go to a parking lot,"" he said. But current organizers of the St. Louis biker event took exception with Cardwell's remarks and said his comments are ""NOT the opinion of Ride of the Century or Streetfighterz,"" the Ride group said on its Facebook page. Streetfighterz is an affiliate of the event and ""one of the original stunt groups to help launch this crazy and exciting industry,"" its Facebook page said. Streetfighterz describes itself as a street-bike freestyle stunt team founded in 1999 in St. Louis, and its website sells several black T-shirts and hoodies, including one bearing the legend: """"Kill it All: Highways, Streets, Lots."" New York police: Bikers stomped on SUV driver . ""We are of the opinion that riders ride for their own reasons and passion, and to comment on NATIONAL TELEVISION about an incident that happened thousands of miles away is irresponsible and disrespectful to the riders and families involved,"" the Ride of the Century group said in a statement. ""Just wanted to make clear his lack of judgment and uneducated comments were not representative of ROC or Streetfighterz."" The wife of one motorcyclist injured in the New York confrontation also disputed portrayals of the bikers as a lawless swarm. Dayana Mejia said her husband was trying to help the driver of the Range Rover when it ran him over, breaking his spine in two places and fracturing multiple ribs. Edwin Mieses is now paralyzed, Mejia said. Mieses, 32, a father of two children, isn't a member of any gang and just loved riding his motorcycles with dozens of friends, his attorney added. ""I can't blame anyone. I can understand why he was scared,"" Mejia said about the driver of the Range Rover. ""But at the end of the day, my husband parked his vehicle on a kick stand to get off, to try help the situation. Told everyone to move on, let's just go, let's get away, let's just move, ignore him,"" referring to the driver of the SUV, she said. Gloria Allred, a Los Angeles attorney representing Mieses, said her client wasn't even driving his motorcycle when the Range Rover struck him. He was encouraging everyone to return to riding and move along. ""He was doing everything lawfully,"" she said. Mieses was run over and crushed as his back was turned to the SUV and its driver, Alexian Lien, according to Allred. ""Whether one likes people who ride motorcycles is not the issue,"" Allred said. ""Are people so blinded by their fears and prejudices in this case that they cannot see that before anyone laid a hand on Mr. Lien, that Edwin Mieses was run over and left severely injured? Where is the justice in that?"" But a retired Nassau County, New York, police officer told CNN that his review of the recorded confrontation showed the driver had no option but to run people down. In the beating, Lien suffered two black eyes and cuts on his face and side, requiring stitches, a police detective's criminal complaint said. ""In my opinion, he was in fear for his life. He had a baby in the car. I don't think that he believes he has any other option,"" said Lou Palumbo, who now runs a security business. The real issue, he asserted, was ""the volume of motorcycles."" If car drivers ever find themselves in such a situation, he said, ""Call 911, No. 1, and just basically try to yield right of way to these bikes."" Opinion: In attack, can bikers get a fair shake .

"(CNN) -- Travel through the southern Rockies into the central Plains ""will be dangerous, if not impossible"" Tuesday, forecasters warned, as a winter weather system blasts broad swaths of the West and Midwest. Blizzard warnings stretched from southeast Colorado through western Kansas, the Oklahoma panhandle and far northern Texas, according to the National Weather Service. ""Blizzard conditions with wind chill temperatures below zero are expected,"" the agency said. Warnings that had threatened northeast New Mexico, however, had expired by late Tuesday morning. Still, winter storm warnings stretched farther across that state, Colorado and into Kansas. Heavy snowfall was reported in eastern Colorado and western Kansas on Tuesday, along with freezing rain and sleet across south-central Kansas. Blustery winds of 20 to 50 mph were also reported. But ""it appears the heaviest snowfall with this system has ended, as the disturbance tracks toward eastern Oklahoma,"" the National Weather Service said. Snow across the Rockies was expected to end late Tuesday morning, but will continue across the central Plains until late in the day, the weather agency said. But areas such as Pie Town, New Mexico, and La Junta and Springfield, Colorado, have already seen more than 15 inches of snowfall since Sunday evening. Interstates and highways were shut down Monday night as at least five states contended with heavy snow, fierce winds and ice. Visibility in parts of western Kansas and southeast Colorado was less than a quarter-mile, said Ariel Cohen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. New Mexico State Police shut down Interstate 40, a major east-west artery, from Albuquerque to the Texas state line, saying there was zero visibility because of blowing snow. Interstate 25 was shut down from just north of Albuquerque to the Colorado state line because of the blizzard conditions, which included snow-packed and icy roads. Are you there? Tell us about it. The state police also shut down U.S. and state highways in the northeast corner of the state. Texas authorities closed I-40 westbound in the Texas panhandle at New Mexico's request Tuesday morning but had reopened it by mid-afternoon. ""Our biggest concern is ice coming out of Amarillo,"" said Gabriel Medrano, a spokesman for the state's Department of Public Safety. ""We had several calls for stranded motorists. We had troopers and National Guard assisting, pulling people from their vehicles."" Vehicle crashes were reported around Amarillo, which lies along I-40 in the Texas panhandle, he added. Medrano said his office had received ""dozens (of) calls for assistance,"" though most of them came from people ""west out of Oldham County."" His agency and the Texas Department of Transportation said motel rooms had filled in Tucumcari, New Mexico, the first major town on I-40 across the state line, because drivers weren't allowed to travel any farther on the highway. Meteorologists call the storm system a strong one that is producing ""very hazardous"" conditions. And while such storms typically occur around winter, the large area of strong winds combined with the snow is considered unusual. Texas Gov. Rick Perry activated the Texas Military Forces as a precaution to provide help on the roads, his office said. Snow accumulations of up to 6 inches were likely, with higher accumulations expected across the northwest Texas Panhandle, Perry's office added. Flights were canceled at Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport for Tuesday morning, spokesman Patrick Rhodes said, but normal operations have since resumed. To the north, in the Oklahoma panhandle, U.S. highways were closed and transportation workers were salting the roads, according to Michaelann Ootean of the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. Roads and highways were ""completely snow-packed"" or covered with ice in much of western Kansas on Monday, according to the state's Department of Transportation. They included Interstate 70, which crosses the state from west to east, and Interstate 135 through Salina. U.S. highways 50 and 54 were shut in southwest Kansas. The DOT said U.S. 50 was closed because of blizzard conditions and ""multiple accidents"" in Colorado. The Colorado Department of Transportation shut down highways across the southeastern part of the state because of snow and icy conditions. Interstate 25 was shut southbound from Pueblo to the New Mexico state line, and the DOT said lodging was unavailable south of Colorado City. Northbound I-25 remained open. CNN's Nick Valencia, Tracy Sabo and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","NEW: Authorities reopened I-40 westbound in the Texas panhandle .

"(CNN) -- At least one person died and others were reported missing after a train pulling more than 70 tankers of crude oil derailed and burst into flames in eastern Canada near the U.S. border, CNN affiliates reported, citing authorities. The train jumped the tracks in the small town of Lac-Megantic in the province of Quebec, officials said Saturday. The inferno spread to nearby homes, and authorities evacuated the center of town and a home for the elderly, CNN affiliate Radio-Canada reported. Thick fuel spilled into the Chaudiere River. ""Words cannot tell the damage that had been done,"" Quebec provincial police Sgt. Gregory Gomez del Prado said, according to CNN affiliate CTV. ""Many, many buildings have been damaged. It's a catastrophe for the town of course, but also for the whole province."" The sergeant declined to say exactly many people were missing. ""We have several people we are looking for. We do expect casualties,"" he told CNN on Saturday night. The train was parked and secured late Friday in Nantes, just west of Lac-Megantic, a company representative said, CTV reported. Joe McGonigle, a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, was quoted as saying the train ""came loose"" early Saturday and ""started rolling down the tracks."" The Nantes and Lac-Megantic town centers are about 12 kilometers (7 miles) apart. McGonigle said the train's engine was found near the site of the inferno. McGonigle said police were questioning the train's conductor, who was at a hotel in Lac-Megantic when the train derailed. CNN affiliate CTV referred to the crash site as a ""war zone"" and it said no other injuries have been reported. Emergency officials say some people may have been away when the derailment occurred. Authorities were investigating. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train derailment and subsequent fires,"" Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said. ""We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest assured that our government is monitoring the situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by the province."" Firefighters from the United States helped Canada fight the blaze. Five of the trucks deployed from the United States, after the sheriff's office in Franklin County, Maine, issued an ""all call"" for help to U.S. fire departments near the border. Flames welling up stories high into the night sky were caught on camera and uploaded to YouTube. The video appears to reveal an explosion. Thick black smoke billowed into the air. A ""nauseating"" odor spread through the town, Radio-Canada reported, and environmental emergency services dispatched a mobile lab to check for airborne toxins. The radio station said that the oil shipment was on its way to the United States.

"Washington (CNN) -- A short-term spending measure to fund the federal government into next week won approval Thursday from the U.S. House and now goes to President Barack Obama's desk. The measure was part of a bipartisan agreement intended to end a dispute over disaster relief spending that threatened to cause a partial shutdown of the government when the current fiscal year ends at midnight Friday. Congressional approval of the measure keeps the government funded through October 4. The House will then have to consider a more comprehensive measure that would keep the government funded through November 18. With most House members away from Washington on a one-week recess, Thursday's approval took place at a ""pro forma"" session involving just three House members using a procedure known as ""unanimous consent."" Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and John Culberson of Texas conducted the House business, including the request for the chamber's unanimous consent of the spending plan, while Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland kept an eye on the proceedings. The Senate approved both measures Monday. Together, they would fund the federal government for the first seven weeks of the new fiscal year. The spending proposals contain an additional $2.65 billion in disaster relief needed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to replenish coffers depleted partly by the federal response to Hurricane Irene, Tropical Storm Lee, and a series of tornadoes and wildfires this year. The new emergency disaster funding will kick in Saturday. Democrats and Republicans had been at odds over a GOP demand to cut spending elsewhere to offset increased disaster relief funding in the current fiscal year. FEMA ended that standoff Monday when it indicated that it has enough money to get through the final few days of the current fiscal year. If Congress had failed to reach a new spending agreement, a partial government shutdown would have occurred with the onset of the new fiscal year on Saturday. Government shutdowns were also threatened during budget talks in the spring and the debt ceiling debate over the summer. The short-term funding measures were necessary because Congress has failed to complete its full budget appropriations process in recent years due to a sharp partisan divide over government spending issues. The November 18 extension expected to win final approval next week was intended to provide time to debate and pass appropriations bills for the remainder of fiscal year 2012. However, it's been more than 15 years since both chambers of Congress passed the full range of appropriations bills. Instead, they have relied on other ways to extend spending authority, such as continuing resolutions or omnibus measures that bundle together multiple appropriations bills. CNN's Tom Cohen and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","Just three House members attend the pro forma session .

"(CNN) -- There's something about growing up in a small town. Don't get me wrong, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago are all great cities with their own identity and appeal, but if you spent your formative years in a burg where traffic lights were few and far between; where watching freight trains was a welcome distraction; where after school, kids waste time at the nearest lake, river or abandoned quarry, then count yourself as lucky. This kind of small-town adolescence is uniquely American, and it's a lifestyle that's rapidly vanishing. Brian Kimberling perfectly captures this experience in his debut novel, ""Snapper,"" available Tuesday. Kimberling grew up in Evansville, Indiana, and the book makes the most of its Hoosier setting. In it, narrator Nate Lochmueller is an affable young ornithologist, earning just enough money to live on by studying the songbirds of Indiana. Not coincidentally, Kimberling also worked as a bird researcher when he was a student at Indiana University. ""Snapper"" follows Nate through a series of mostly aimless adventures as he travels across the state in a glitter-festooned truck dubbed the Gypsy Moth. Nate spends a good part of the book in the wilds of Indiana, where he beautifully describes tracking and observing birds like the Summer tanager and wood thrushes, as well as warblers, chickadees and Acadian flycatchers. There are also some hilarious anecdotes involving a dive-bombing bald eagle, a German shepherd with a knack for digging up human bones and a snapping turtle with a taste for thumbs, hence the title. But this is more than a bird book. There are plenty of poignant moments as Nate tries to figure out his place in the world's pecking order. There's his on-again, off-again love affair with a free-spirited beauty named Lola and a colorful cast of characters including Nate's parents, an aunt and uncle from Texas with some questionable views on race, a small group of childhood friends and a few shiftless roommates. Kimberling writes about all of this in a voice part John Audubon, part Holden Caulfield but uniquely his own. The book's pace is leisurely, the mood is sometimes melancholy, and readers will finish the final page feeling thoroughly satisfied. Perhaps surprising to readers, Kimberling no longer lives in Indiana. After wandering the globe, he now makes his home in England with his wife and son. CNN recently spoke to him about the novel and whether he misses the U.S. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: What was the spark behind ""Snapper""? Brian Kimberling: Some friends and I used to build fires on Indiana train tracks at night and sit around with a bottle of something purloined from someone's parents. I told this to an English friend who knew nothing about Indiana and who began imagining and describing a romantically desolate sort of place, forsaken by commerce and industry -- that's how we knew no trains would come through -- a place where there were no girls to talk to and no drugs worth taking, so adolescent boys played hobo together or whatever it was we thought we were doing. That is a very English way of viewing Indiana. It is also absolutely right, or it used to be. That conversation was a spark. I ran with it. CNN: Had you always wanted to be a writer? Kimberling: I don't know when I began writing. I won a national award in high school for a short story about a character named Maudlin Lackey who commits suicide. I have since learned some restraint. I had been writing regularly for a couple of years already at the time. It's always been important to me, though, to do other things besides write -- to be something other than or in addition to a writer. So I've worked as a Web developer and an English teacher and an editor and a frozen pizza stacker and so on, in the Czech Republic and Mexico and Turkey and England. CNN: Where did the title come from? Kimberling: My editor and I did kick around alternative titles for a while. The problem was that other titles (such as ""Audubon, Indiana"") seemed to restrict the book's scope somehow and that the snapping turtle in the book has symbolic value. In the end, it was a case of, well, it can't be called anything else, can it? ""Snapper"" is a digressive, meandering book that invites readers to make connections and interpret things as they will. A more descriptive title (say, ""Birding in Indiana"") wouldn't do that justice. Also, ""Snapper"" is a snappy title. CNN: You write with great admiration about Indiana's songbirds. Do you have a particular favorite from your days as an amateur ornithologist? Kimberling: I like the wood thrush, as does the narrator, Nathan, and as did Audubon and Thoreau, both. It's probably not humanly possible to listen to the wood thrush attentively without some emotional response. Whereas the Acadian flycatcher is pretty boring. I think ""birdsong"" and ""songbird"" are both misleading words. Lots of songbirds just chirp. I was a research assistant for a major study of songbirds for two years, starting at 5 a.m. six days a week. I especially enjoyed running into non-birds. Foxes, raccoons, opossums, all finishing up the night shift at around the time I started. Their collective expression was: ""Hey, you're human. Either shoot us or leave us alone. Stop coming around every day."" CNN: You seem to have a love/hate relationship with Indiana, is that correct? Has your feeling for your home state changed since you've lived abroad? Kimberling: I love it from a great distance. There are many things in Indiana that I appreciate more for having lived abroad. Turoni's Pizza in Evansville tops the list. Bloomington and Brown County are outstanding, and the Ohio is the most beautiful river in the world, as Thomas Jefferson observed 200-odd years ago. Not sure what the beautiful-river criteria are, but it's true. I think a lot, in a possibly European-inflected way, about the cultural heritage of southern Indiana (five words that do not often appear in that sequence).

"(CNN) -- The freak snowstorm that pounded the eastern United States late last week, cutting power to hundreds of thousands of people, killed at least 22 people, officials said Thursday. In Massachusetts, at least six deaths were related to the storm, and a seventh was under investigation, said Peter William Judge, public information officer for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. Four of the deaths were linked to carbon monoxide poisoning; one person was electrocuted by a downed power line and one person died in a house fire blamed on the storm, he said. In New Jersey, eight storm-related fatalities were tallied, including three people who burned to death in house fires, one person who died when a branch fell on him, another who died when a tree fell on him, and three people who died in motor vehicle accidents. A ninth death was under investigation. In Connecticut, eight people died, four of them from carbon monoxide poisoning, said Gov. Dannel Malloy. In all, 91 shelters and 111 warming centers were to be open in the state Thursday night, he said. An estimated 831,000 customers lost electricity during Saturday's storm, according to Connecticut Light & Power officials and the attorney general's office. The storm dropped at least a foot of snow in a band from West Virginia to Maine. By Thursday afternoon, power had been restored to slightly more than half of the affected customers, said Dave Radanovich, a CL&P spokesman. He predicted power would be fully restored by Monday morning. The utility -- using workers from 20 states -- deployed 867 line crews composed of two or three workers each to repair downed transmission lines; another 628 tree crews and 550 support crews were aiding the effort, Radanovich said. President Barack Obama has signed emergency declarations for New Hampshire and Connecticut, clearing the way for federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts. Connecticut's attorney general called Thursday for regulators to investigate CL&P, the state's main electric utility, over its handling of the storm. Attorney General George Jepsen filed the request with the state's Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, which is already investigating CL&P over its response to power outages during Tropical Storm Irene in September. ""The heavy, wet snow weighed down on the trees,"" Radanovich said. ""Limbs were holding two times their normal weight,"" because the state's trees still have leaves on them. In addition, CL&P had less time to prepare for Saturday's storm by bringing in out-of-state crews ahead of time, according to Radanovich, since the storm hit with little notice. ""Forecasts for this storm initially predicted only 6 inches of snow, but on Friday that jumped to a foot,"" he said. CNN's Andy Rose, Dan Verello, Hussein Saddique and Logan Burruss contributed to this report.","NEW: 6 storm-related deaths in Massachusetts .

"La Paz, Bolivia (CNN) -- A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck Bolivia Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The quake's epicenter was about 185 kilometers (115 miles) south-southeast of Santa Ana, Bolivia, the agency said. It struck at a depth of about 530 kilometers (330 miles). The shaking was felt in the country's capital, La Paz, about 350 kilometers (215 miles) away. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. The state-run Bolivian Information Agency said residents of various La Paz neighborhoods, particularly in the city's center, reported feeling the quake around 3 p.m. Some evacuated their homes, particularly those who live in taller buildings, the agency reported. Preliminary estimates put the magnitude at 6.7, but authorities later revised the number.

"London (CNN) -- In 2011 UK Business Secretary Vince Cable lamented that a bunch of ""right-wing nutters"" was holding the American government and the world economy to ransom by refusing to agree the usually routine increase in America's legal debt limit. World leaders might avoid the blunt description used by Cable but their thoughts are probably very similar. The U.S. is, once again, having another political gunfight over public funding and debt issues. Internationally, America's fiscal shenanigans could be particularly harmful for eurozone countries trying to get their own public debt problems under control and strengthen their economic recovery. Instability in the world money markets is the last thing that the likes of Greece, Ireland, Spain and even France need. And with the UK economy excessively dependent on its financial sector, the storms in Washington could turn into a tempest for the City of London. If the U.S. imbroglio results in a debt default next month, it will serve as a very bad example to eurozone countries undergoing austerity to remedy their indebtedness. READ MORE: How austerity kills . One political consequence of this may be the growth of nationalist/populist parties in Europe who seize on America's conduct to legitimize calls for default on their own countries' public debts. Nothing new . There is nothing new in the standoff between the Republican House and the Democratic Senate over agreeing a budget to fund government operations for the 2014 fiscal year, beginning October 1. Whether single party controlled or not, Congress has failed to pass a budget by the start of the new fiscal year annually since 1994. However, it has always approved a Continuing Resolution to fund government operations until a budget is agreed. If this is not settled by midnight today, the U.S. government will experience a partial shutdown that will hit ""non-essential services"" (including federal payment of government contracts, social security benefits and the like). There have been ten such shutdowns since 1981. All but one of these only lasted a weekend when most government offices were closed anyway. The exception, in late 1995-early 1996, went on for 26 days. READ MORE: 10 ways a shutdown will affect you . We may be re-entering the same territory because Republican insistence on defunding Obamacare as part of any budget deal is staunchly opposed by the Democrats, reinforced by the threat of a presidential veto if any such measure were enacted. All this may look like a local infighting but the possible consequences could be global in scope if the stand-off continues until mid-October, when the U.S. is scheduled to raise its debt limit. The ceiling for borrowing was actually reached last May. The U.S. Treasury has been shuffling money from government accounts to pay America's creditors ever since, but the pot is now close to empty. The U.S. is looking down the barrel at the first default in its history. If this happens, the very least of the consequences will be a reduction of its credit rating by Standard & Poor's ratings agency, along with others. The fact that U.S. government creditors are mainly foreign governments and central banks may prevent panic on the money markets, but there will still be serious repercussions and dislocations stretching throughout Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Global money flows . Even with a brief default, the U.S. government will probably find it more difficult thereafter to sell short-term Treasury notes at low interest to fund its operations. The likely consequence of this would be greater reliance on medium- term and long-term borrowing that could require higher interest rates to be attractive. READ MORE: What happens at the White House? At a time when the Fed is still operating an easy money policy to boost recovery from the Great Recession, it may have to raise interest rates contrary to its expansionary preferences, with harmful consequences for the American and global economies. If U.S. interests rate interest rates go up, America could become a magnet for global capital, leaving the European countries, in particular, short of credit needed to sustain their own economic recovery. The more likely scenario is that a default will be avoided, but the fear that one was imminent and the worry that it could easily happen again this time next year is bound to make the money markets nervous. Foreign creditors willingly lend to the U.S. because it is a safe bet in an uncertain world. But if its dysfunctional politics makes it look unsafe, they may look elsewhere. The U.S. is fortunate that the euro is not a reserve currency in waiting, as it looked a decade ago, and the Chinese renminbi is nowhere near ready to challenge the dollar. But what the world needs now is more certainty from its largest borrower and owner of its reserve currency. Without this, there could be very damaging repercussions for global economic growth.","The U.S. is facing up to yet another battle over its public funding and debt .

"(CNN) -- Delta Air Lines CEO Richard Anderson said Friday he objects to the federal Transportation Security Administration's move this week to allow small pocketknives on airplanes. ""These items have been banned for more than 11 years and will add little value to the customer security process flow in relation to the additional risk for our cabin staff and customers,"" Anderson said in a letter to the head of the TSA. TSA Administrator John Pistole said the move brings the United States into alignment with international rules and are keeping with his ""risk-based security"" approach. Under the new rules, knives with blades no longer than 2.36 inches (6 centimeters) and less than a half-inch wide will be allowed in airline cabins as long as the blade is retractable and does not lock into place. Razorblades and box cutters are still prohibited. The rules also allow passengers to carry two golf clubs, toy bats or other sports sticks -- such as ski poles, hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks and pool cues -- aboard in carry-on luggage. Knives on a plane? Really? Kip Hawley, who oversaw the TSA from 2005 to 2009, said the search for knives interferes with the search for objects such as bombs and toxins that can threaten aircraft. But others have sharply criticized the change, which was announced this week. They include the Flight Attendants Union Coalition, a nearly 90,000-member group that has launched a campaign to reverse the TSA's decision. Former flight attendant Tiffany Hawk is ""stupefied"" by the move, ""especially since the process that turns checkpoints into maddening logjams -- removing shoes, liquids and computers -- remains unchanged,"" she wrote in an opinion column for CNN. And Veda Shook, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said the move is ""completely unnecessary"" and ""makes no sense."" Rather than freeing up time, she predicted that security officers will get more bogged down testing and measuring the knives to see if they meet the criteria. ""How big is this knife? is it long enough? is it wide enough? Does it lock? Does it not lock? That is going to create confusion at the checkpoint,"" Shook told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday night. ""... We're all better off, and we're all safer, without weapons on board the aircraft."" The Delta chief is among those critical voices, saying that he and his airline's flight attendants ""share (the same) legitimate concerns."" ""If the purpose is to increase security checkpoint flow, there are much more effective steps we can take together to streamline the security checkpoints with risk-based screening mechanisms,"" Anderson said. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: A flight attendants union president says the move ""makes no sense""

"(CNN) -- Toronto's rush hour Monday turned into anything but -- as a deluge from a summer storm inundated the city, swamping commuters whether they traveled by rail or by road. Passengers on a double-decker Go Transit train found themselves dead in the water when a flash flood submerged the line, leaving them ankle-deep in the murky mess and in need of rescue. ""These trains are capable of carrying quite a large number of passengers,"" said transit spokesman Mark Ostler. Evacuations lasted into the early hours of Tuesday as passengers shimmied out train windows and into rescue boats. ""(S)tranded passengers on board ... were safely removed and taken to a place of safety,"" police said. The heavy rain quickly overwhelmed Toronto's storm sewers, sending the Don River out of its banks. Almost 5 inches of rain fell at Pearson International . Airport, breaking a record set in 1954, according to Environment Canada. Nearly 4 inches fell in the heart of the city. The Don Valley Parkway looked more like a parking lot than Toronto's main north-south artery as drivers abandoned their vehicles while the waters lapped at their headlights, CNN affiliate CTV reported. The thoroughfare was closed in both directions overnight. A pricy Ferrari was one of the casualties, left by its owner to soak in the bumper-high pool of an underpass. The storms also caused power outages and flooding across the city. Toronto flooding was like 'end of the world' At the storm's height, Toronto Hydro reported some 300,000 residents were without power across the greater Toronto Area, according to CTV. ""My power outage lasted for about five hours, but luckily, my neighborhood didn't have any flooding issues,"" said Angie Filipowich in neighboring Mississauga. ""So much rain in so little time. I don't ever remember seeing all this flooding here ... ever."" Are you there? Share photos, video, but stay safe .

"(CNN) -- A report released this week tells us that the international war on drugs is failing. That comes as no surprise as a growing number of policy experts, pundits and politicians have reached that conclusion, including former Secretary of State George Shultz, former Mexican President Vicente Fox, and former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Among other findings, the report documents that inflation-adjusted and purity-adjusted prices of marijuana, cocaine and heroin have all decreased dramatically since 1990 in as geographically diverse areas as Europe, the United States and Australia. In other words, illegal drugs are plentiful and cheap around the world. So now what? The report's policy recommendations are relatively tepid. It emphasizes the need to shift from a strategy of eradication and interdiction of drugs to one focused more on drug abuse prevention and treatment. Although that shift away from law enforcement to a ""harm reduction"" approach would be an improvement on the current futile, counterproductive strategy, it is not nearly sufficient. Moreover, the report too readily accepts the conventional wisdom that drug use is largely responsible for a host of social pathologies. The reality is that the strategy of drug prohibition, not drug use itself, is responsible for many of those pathologies. Drug abuse is certainly a major public health problem, and its societal costs are considerable. But banning the drug trade creates ugly social and economic distortions. Because certain drugs are illegal, there is an enormous black-market premium (by most estimates, up to 90% of the retail price) associated with them. Moreover, people who are willing to traffic in an illegal product often do not have many qualms about violating other laws. Prohibition enables the most unsavory, violence-prone individuals and organizations to dominate the commerce. Drug prohibition leads inevitably to corruption and violence -- to a disturbing extent in the United States and even more so in drug-source or drug-transiting countries. The problems caused by the war on drugs are even more damaging to societies than those caused by drug use per se. Opinion: Legalized pot would mean more addiction . In Mexico, for example, about 60,000 people have perished in armed conflicts among the various drug cartels and between the cartels and the Mexican authorities over the past 6Â½ years. Another 20,000 people have gone missing. That turmoil has found even more fertile soil in the smaller, weaker countries of Central America. Today, Mexican-based drug cartels control major swaths of territory in both Honduras and Guatemala, and they pose a growing threat to the authority of governments throughout the region. As the report notes, the international drug trade is a $350 billion-a-year industry. There is no realistic way to suppress such an economic juggernaut. We can only determine whether the trade will be in the hands of honest businesses or ruthless criminals. The quixotic U.S. crusade against alcohol in the 1920s and early 1930s demonstrated that a prohibition strategy empowers and enriches odious criminals. When alcohol was outlawed, the commerce fell into the hands of gangsters like Al Capone and Dutch Shultz. Bootleggers bribed and corrupted elected officials and police personnel throughout the country. There were shootouts on the streets of Chicago, New York and other American citiesâ€”just as we have gunbattles between drug gangs in large cities today. Once Prohibition ended, legitimate business provided consumers with the beverages they sought, and the carnage and corruption subsided. Today, suppliers such as Gallo Wines, Coors Brewery, and Jack Daniels Distillery dominate the trade. Ending drug prohibition is not a panacea. Under a legalized system for alcoholic beverages, we still have to deal with drunk driving, alcoholism and other social problems. Yet no rational person would advocate returning to Prohibition with all its ugly consequences. The folly of alcohol prohibition was confined to the United States. Thanks largely to Washington's pressure -- drug prohibition is a global folly. We should learn from history and do more than make modest shifts in anti-drug strategies. We need to bite the bullet, accepting the reality that our second fling with prohibition hasn't worked any better than the first. Change should begin with the comprehensive legalization of marijuana, not just incremental, partial legalization as voters in Colorado and Washington approved last year. We also need to begin a serious discussion about how to deal with harder drugs within a framework of legalization. Whatever the specifics of a new policy, there needs to be recognition both in the United States and around the world that prohibition is an unsustainable approach. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ted Galen Carpenter.","Ted Carpenter: It's no surprise that a new report says the global war on drugs is failing .

"London (CNN) -- Global mean temperatures this year might not have scaled the record-equaling heights of 2010, but it's been another tumultuous 12 months. According to the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) provisional status report, issued at the United Nations climate talks in Durban, 2011 was the 10th warmest year on record and warmer than any other year with a La Nina event. La Nina -- an opposite weather pattern to El Nino which cools surface waters in the eastern and central Pacific -- occurs two to three times a decade on average, says climatologist and scientific coordinator of the WMO statement Blair Trewin. This most recent one -- which started in the second half of 2010 and continued until May this year -- has been one of the strongest in the past 60 years, says the WMO, and was ""closely associated"" with many of the regional weather events that have dominated the headlines throughout the year. January saw floods in northeast Australia -- the worst in Queensland's capital, Brisbane since 1974 -- and deadly landslides caused by a deluge of rain in Brazil. The appalling disaster in a mountainous region around 60 kilometers north of Rio de Janeiro claimed at least 900 lives, according to the WMO, making it the single most deadly weather event of the year. Heavy rains also caused many regions of the world to flood in 2011 including parts of southern Africa, Central America and southern states of Europe. But is was major flooding in Southeast Asia that dominated the news as the year came to a close, wiping out more than 650 lives in Thailand, and dozens more in neighboring Myanmar and Cambodia. Rainfall during June to September's monsoon season in northern and central Thailand was up to 80% higher than the seasonal average, says the WMO. The situation came to a head in October as already inundated natural waterways combined with high tides to swamp the Thai capital Bangkok. Among the other more notable extremes of weather in 2011, says Trewin, were the huge weather disparities experienced in the U.S. The WMO reported 14 separate climate events this year in the U.S. which they estimate caused losses upwards of $1 billion. Heavy snow fell across southern and Midwestern states -- including Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri in February. April and May played host to one of the most active tornado seasons on record, according to the WMO, and the Mississippi River suffered its worst floods in nearly 80 years. But 600 miles west in Texas a drought was taking hold and wildfires raged. Summer temperatures in the Lone Star State averaged 30.4 degrees Celsius (86.7 degrees Fahrenheit) -- 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than the long-term average, according to the WMO and the highest-ever recorded in any American state. All the while, many northeastern states and parts of southern Canada were experiencing their wettest year on record -- the most severe flooding coming in the wake of Hurricane Irene in late August and Tropical Storm Lee which followed quickly on her heels. Elsewhere, the Horn of Africa endured a terrible drought which put up to 12 million people at risk of starvation until October's rains eased the threat. But such was their intensity -- Wajir, northeast Kenya received more rain in six weeks (402 millimeters) than the annual average -- it led to crop damage, says the WMO. The general warming trend -- 13 of the warmest years have occurred in the 15 years since 1997 -- was highlighted by summer sea ice melt in the Arctic. The WMO reported that the seasonal minimum, reached on September 9, was 35% below the 1979-2000 average and the second-lowest on record with both the Northwest and Northeast passages ice free for periods during the summer. ""Our science is solid and it proves unequivocally that the world is warming ..."" WMO secretary-general Michel Jarraud said on publication of the provisional report. Human activities are to blame, Jarraud says, and temperatures are ""rapidly approaching"" a level which scientists believe could kick-start ""far-reaching and irreversible"" climate change. Final figures for 2011's weather will be published by the WMO in March next year.","2011 was the 10th warmest on record according to World Meteorological Organization .

"(CNN) -- Its art collection is the envy of galleries the world over, but until now the Vatican has been better known for Renaissance masterpieces rather than hip modernist artworks. That may be about to change: the home of the Catholic Church has announced it will exhibit at the ultra-fashionable Venice Biennale for the first time later this year. In a bold move away from the works of Michelangelo, Rafael and Giotto for which it is renowned, the Holy See picked Italian new media art collective Studio Azzurro, Czech-French photographer Josef Koudelka, and Australian-born U.S. painter Lawrence Carroll to interpret its chosen theme. But the subject itself is one of the oldest and most traditional: the pavilion, inspired by Genesis, the first book of the Bible, is entitled ""In the Beginning."" Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, president of the Pontifical Council for Culture, said the stories of Genesis were ""fundamental for culture and for Church tradition,"" and had inspired some of the greatest works in the history of art. Ravasi said the book -- and the artists' works it had given rise to -- examined ""the mystery of man's origins, the introduction of evil into history, and our hope and future projects after the devastation symbolically represented by the Flood."" Antonio Paolucci, director of the Vatican Museums, said Studio Azzurro's installation explored the theme of ""Creation"" using ""the immaterial image, light, sound, and sensory stimuli."" Paolucci said Koudelka had selected a ""specific and extremely evocative sequence"" of his photographs to examine the idea of destruction, or ""Un-Creation,"" ""[exposing] an abandoned, wounded world."" He said Carroll had used salvaged materials to form a meditation on ""Re-Creation"" and the ""continuous and cyclical action of recovery and erosion... forcing fragility and monumentality to coexist."" Ravasi said the result was ""a vital, rich and elaborate dialogue,"" which he hailed as a sign of the Vatican's ""renewed, modern patronage"" of the arts. Paolo Baratta, president of the Venice Biennale, welcomed the Vatican's debut at the show, hailing it as ""an event of great importance."" The Venice Biennale is one of the world's best-known contemporary art exhibitions; founded in 1895, it is held every two years. The work of leading artists is showcased in national ""pavilions"" across the city's Castello district. The 55th Biennale will take place from June 1 to November 24, 2013, and will feature works by Ai Weiwei, Jeremy Deller, Carl Andre, Mark Manders and Miroslaw Balka. Among the other countries taking part in the event for the first time in 2013 are Angola, Bahrain, the Bahamas, Kuwait, Paraguay and the tiny island nation of Tuvalu.

"(CNN) -- Emergency contraception known as the ""morning-after pill"" can be sold over-the-counter to minors, a federal appeals court in New York decided on Wednesday. A generic two-pill version could soon be available without a prescription or any age restrictions, according to an order by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. But the three-judge panel separately blocked unrestricted sales of a newer, different Plan B one-pill version, until it can further consider the matter. The Obama administration has been criticized by some women's rights groups for trying to stop contraception sales to underage females. Some of those groups applauded the court's order. ""Once again, the message from the courts is clear: Emergency contraception must be made available over the counter for all ages, and the burdensome practice of requiring girls 16 and under to obtain a prescription and all others to show an ID must end,"" said Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law Center. The Justice Department appealed a ruling in April by U.S. District Judge Edward Korman, who directed the Food and Drug Administration to make the morning-after birth control pill available to females ""of child-bearing age"" without a prescription. The key ingredient in Plan B is the synthetic hormone levonorgestrel, which can prevent fertilization or prevent an egg from embedding in the uterus if it has been fertilized. Korman's ruling responded to a lawsuit launched by the Center for Reproductive Rights. The group sought to expand access to all brands of the morning-after pill over the counter, such as Plan B One-Step and Next Choice, so that females of all ages would be able to purchase them without a prescription. Supporters of the district court ruling called it a landmark decision, while opponents raised concerns about safeguards being eliminated. The government now has 14 days to decide whether to challenge the order before the full appeals court or directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the order is not appealed, reproductive rights groups say the two-pill contraceptive could be available at pharmacies in about a month. Plan B One-Step is an updated one-pill version. The FDA said last month it was changing its regulations, allowing sales by a private pharmaceutical firm, Teva Women's Health, to those 15 and over without a prescription. Only those 17 or older were previously allowed to buy the contraceptive. Korman had criticized what he called ""nonsensical"" government rules that he said unfairly favored the single pill version over the cheaper, generic two-pill version. Under current policies, prescriptions are still need for the generic version for those under age 17. The FDA announced two years ago there would be no limits on over-the-counter sales of morning-after pills. But Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius unilaterally ordered the age and prescription restrictions put in place. That prompted the lawsuits. Emergency contraceptives are intended for use within 72 hours after sex but are most effective if taken within 24 hours. Many developed countries require a prescription for oral contraceptives, including Canada and most of Europe, but other countries sell the pill without a prescription even formally or informally. There was no immediate reaction to the order from the FDA or the Justice Department. The case is Tummino v. Hamburg (13-1690).","Appeals panel approved sale of one version, but blocked another pending further review .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- The ""Dream 9,"" five women and four men, say that they are ""undocumented and unafraid."" Don't believe it. I bet they were afraid. Who wouldn't have been? The nine -- Claudia Amaro, Adriana Gil Diaz, Luis Leon Lopez, Maria Peniche-Vargas, Ceferino Santiago, LuLu Martinez Valdez, Mario Felix-Garcia, Marco Saavedra and Lizbeth Mateo-Jimenez -- spent more than two weeks in a federal immigration detention facility in Eloy, AZ. Martinez Valdez and Peniche-Vargas--had been put in solitary confinement for what was supposed to be 15 days. All because they wouldn't take ""go"" for an answer. Some of these ""Dreamers"" had been deported to Mexico by the Obama administration, though President Obama has repeatedly said that his administration is not looking to deport Dreamers--the name taken by young immigrants who are in the U.S. without papers. Three of them who were on this side of the border -- Saavedra, Martinez Valdez and Mateo-Jimenez -- ""self deported"" to Mexico to join the other six. Then, on July 22, all nine linked arms and marched across the border into the United States. The idea was to draw attention to the administration's repressive immigration policies. The nine asked for humanitarian parole. When that was denied, they claimed asylum. Opinion: Let's deport Rep. Steve King . Now, they have been set free. Earlier in the week, federal officials found that all nine have ""credible fear"" of persecution or torture in their birth countries and thus cannot be removed without a hearing before an immigration judge. Pending those hearings, the nine have now been released into the waiting arms of family members within the United States. It's a major victory for the Dreamer movement. For many, this is a heartwarming story about the power of the individual who is brave enough to make a stand. For others, it is major inconvenience. It's a story that the White House wishes would go away. Ditto for immigration reformers who are split between those who back the Dream 9 and those who want to sacrifice them for political expediency. David Leopold, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, callously dismissed the Dream 9 action as a ""publicity stunt"" and a distraction. He also said it was unlikely that the three Dreamers who voluntarily left the United States would qualify for asylum. So far, Leopold has been spectacularly wrong. All nine will get asylum hearings. And the Dreamers got more warmth from Congress. Thirty-five lawmakers signed a letter asking Obama to use his discretion to release the young people from custody. The letter -- signed by Reps. Mike Honda, D-California, Raul Grijalva, D-Arizona, and Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas, among others -- describes the activists as ""victims of our broken immigration policy"" who ""deserve to come home to the United States."" Immigration reformers were bound to lose confidence in this administration. A president can't deport nearly 2 million people in under five years, split up hundreds of thousands of families, detain thousands of undocumented children without giving them access to legal counsel, and expand Arizona-style immigration enforcement nationwide through the maniacal program known as ""Secure Communities"" without raising a stink. For many, what happened to the Dream 9 was the last straw. Searching for the American Dream in Mexico . Martinez-Valdez and Peniche-Vargas were in solitary confinement because, according to authorities, they started a ruckus in the dining hall. Of course they did. Didn't Obama say that the Dreamers were Americans except for legal status? This is how Americans behave. We're ornery, courageous and defiant. We yell ""freedom"" at the top of our lungs. These kids are Americans, all right. The next thing you know, a bunch of Dreamers will dump tea into Boston Harbor. Besides, Obama made quite a show -- before the election -- of announcing that his administration was sparing Dreamers deportation by offering deferred action and temporary work permits. Nearly 300,000 Dreamers have been awarded the special accommodation so far. There's not room for nine more? Some might not be eligible for deferred action, some might be. Let's find out. Maybe there would be more compassion on the Potomac if these young people hadn't embarrassed Obama, put the lie to the fairy tale that this administration has been compassionate toward immigrants, divided self-serving organizations such as the lawyers group AILA, and pitted one group of immigration reformers against another -- those who want to protect the Dreamers versus those who want to protect the president. I've had my differences with the Dreamer movement. I think that many of these young people have a sense of entitlement, like most young people in the United States. I didn't think it was a good idea for Dreamer activists to disrupt congressional hearings on immigration reform, or occupy the offices of reform advocates like Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois. And I think much of what drives Dreamer activists within the United States is a look-at-me narcissism fed by social media and a culture where young people are told they can become the next American Idol. Opinion: House, knowledge economy needs immigrants . But I never questioned their sincerity, or dismissed anything they did as a stunt. I wouldn't presume to tell people who put their freedom at risk along the U.S.-Mexico border that the difficult decisions they're making are the wrong ones. And I certainly wouldn't do it to protect an administration that doesn't deserve protecting. The Dream 9 are back where they belong -- in the United States. But this story isn't over. The fault lines it exposed within the immigration reform movement remain. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Nine Dreamer activists were in federal immigration detention in Arizona .

"(CNN) -- ""Our country has changed,"" wrote Chief Justice John Roberts on June 25, 2013, when five of the nine Supreme Court Justices dismantled the historic Voting Rights Act. Roberts is correct in at least one respect: Today's Republican Party is no longer the party of Abraham Lincoln, as former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens reminded us again in a recent article in The New York Review of Books. Stevens, a lifelong Republican appointed to the court by Gerald Ford, attacked Roberts and his Republican colleagues for usurping the authority of Congress which had overwhelmingly renewed the act in 2006. But 48 years ago this week, the Republican Party supported the cause of voting rights. On August 6, 1965, when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law, he gave the second pen he used to Everett Dirksen, the Republican Senate Minority Leader. Dirksen deserved the honor because he was a major architect of the act. In fact, the bill was written in Dirksen's office as he sat next to Acting Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach. Later, insiders joked that the bill should be called ""Dirksenbach."" Although suffering from emphysema, ulcers and an enlarged heart, Dirksen worked hard defending the bill on the floor of the Senate, successfully defeating Southern efforts to weaken it. Johnson feared that a Southern filibuster would delay the bill until the Senate adjourned for the summer, a dangerous prospect. ""They been doin' that for 35 years that I been here,"" Johnson fumed, ""and I been watchin' 'em do it."" Opinion: 50 years later, civil rights struggle is far from over . Johnson turned to Dirksen for help. The Senator from Illinois persuaded 23 fellow Republicans to vote for cloture, shutting off a filibuster and freeing the Voting Rights Act for an up or down vote. When it came, 30 Republicans joined 47 Democrats to pass the bill and send it to the House for their consideration. After Southern efforts to destroy the bill in the House were defeated and differences between House and Senate versions of the bill were resolved in conference committee, the 1965 Voting Rights Act was passed overwhelmingly by both houses of Congress that August, with Republican support. Soon, however, Republicans began to court white voters in the South and elsewhere who were alienated by the Democratic Party's embrace of civil rights. Richard Nixon first adopted this ""Southern strategy"" in his 1968 presidential campaign, following the advice of Kevin Phillips, a political advisor, who later noted that ""the more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans."" And so it came to be: Blacks, who were affiliated with Lincoln's Republican party after the Civil War and well into the 20th century, moved decisively to join the party of Johnson, and later Clinton, and Obama, while the Republican Party moved sharply to the right and came to mostly represent white Americans. In 2010, after winning control of 25 state legislatures, Republicans enacted a series of laws designed to suppress the votes of those who elected Barack Obama president in 2008. Then, on June 25, 2013, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court bid a final farewell to the party of Lincoln by demolishing the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder. Troubled by this development, John Paul Stevens, a Republican appointed to the court in 1975 by President Gerald Ford, offered his dissent in The New York Review of Books article. Justice Stevens felt strongly that the court had erred in taking the case, since Congress had thoroughly investigated and found evidence of racial discrimination in voting in 2006, resulting in the act's near-unanimous reauthorization that same year. He argued that the chief justice's opinion had failed ""to explain why such a decision should be made by the members of the Supreme Court,"" and not the Congress. After all, the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibits interference with voting on the basis of race, color, and condition of previous servitude, clearly gives the Congress the right to pass legislation to enforce that amendment. ""The members of Congress, representing the millions of voters who elected them, are far more likely to evaluate correctly the ...issue...,"" Stevens concluded. Conservatives on the court were guilty of the judicial activism they had long decried. Veterans of forgotten voting war count the cost . In a final ironic twist, Stevens quoted Antonin Scalia's dissent in the Defense of Marriage case, which Stevens thought applied at least as well, if not better, to what the court had done in Shelby County v. Holder: ""We have no power to decide this case. And even if we did, we have no power under the Constitution to invalidate this democratically adopted legislation. The court's errors on both points spring forth from the same diseased root: an exalted conception of the role of this institution in America."" Stevens' dissent, coming as it does from the man who served longer than any other Republican appointee on the Supreme Court, testifies to how far that party has strayed from its origins. With the gutting of the Voting Rights Act, Republicans throughout the South are again passing voter suppression laws (and, in North Carolina, legislation which would damage women's reproductive rights). It is no longer the party of Lincoln or Reagan. It has become the party of Jefferson Davis. Whether the American people wish to turn the clock back to 1861 remains to be seen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gary May.","Gary May: Roberts court gutting Voting Rights Act, recalls that GOP no longer party of Lincoln .

"(CNN) -- Jim Furyk has won a major and was in the top 10 in the rankings for about a decade but lately he's been known for near misses instead of big titles. He couldn't maintain his advantage heading into the final round of this year's PGA Championship and also blew a lead at last year's U.S. Open. Furyk, however, didn't falter at the BMW Championship on Friday as he became only the sixth man on the PGA Tour to card a 59. He must like competing in Illinois, since he captured the U.S. Open 10 years ago in the same state. Furyk struck 11 birdies and an eagle in his second round. Although he cooled after firing a 28 in his first nine holes, Furyk birdied the ninth -- a short putt -- to tie the record that was last matched in 2010 by Paul Goydos and Stuart Appleby. The crowd at Conway Farms roared its approval and Jason Dufner was one of those rooting for Furyk. At the PGA Championship it was Furyk who congratulated Dufner, the winner. ""I just told myself on nine, 'How many opportunities in your life are you going to have to do this ever again?'"" Furyk said in a televised interview shown by Sky Sports. ""It'll sink in later,"" the 43-year-old added. ""I'm excited. The second part of that is I'll have to calm down later on tonight and realize I've got myself in contention in a golf tournament. I'll enjoy this one for a few hours at least and have fun with it."" Indeed based on his first-round showing, there was no hint of what was to come. Furyk, now the world's 15th-ranked golfer, struggled Thursday, carding a one-over-par 72, and he was nine shots behind overnight leader Brandt Snedeker. Now he is tied for the lead with his fellow American. The highlight of Furyk's round had to be an eagle on the 15th. ""I watched the gallery and they started standing up and the arms went up, and that's how I knew it went in,"" said Furyk, who won the last of his 16 PGA titles in 2010. ""Usually on Sundays I don't ever sleep, whether I play good or poorly. I'm always running back the moments of the day I could have improved -- there's not much I could have improved today so I think I'll sleep well."" Furyk and Snedeker hold a three-shot lead over Zach Johnson while world No. 1 Tiger Woods is seven shots behind. Rory McIlroy's poor season continued as he's in 70th -- last place. But with no cut, he is guaranteed two more rounds.","Jim Furyk becomes the sixth man on golf's PGA Tour to shoot a 59 .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday will sign an executive order outlining standards that companies operating critical infrastructure should follow to protect from cyberattacks, a source informed of the planning told CNN. The order will also include an information-sharing provision to enable data exchange between the private sector and the government, the source said. Obama has been considering such an order since last year, after Congress failed to move forward on cybersecurity legislation. Administration officials have said that the failure to pass legislation has given the executive branch the incentive to fill in the gap with an executive order. The administration still wants the Department of Homeland Security to regulate critical infrastructure and for Congress to pass legislation, the source said.","The order will provide standards for companies operating critical infrastructure .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama's surprise visit to Afghanistan on Tuesday included an extraordinary admission: ""Our goal is not to build a country in America's image, or to eradicate every vestige of the Taliban. These objectives would require many more years, many more dollars and many more American lives."" Obama pledged to continue American support for a sovereign, peaceful state in Afghanistan. He also committed to withdraw all American combat soldiers by 2014 and diminish direct American efforts at nation-building. The president declared that the defeat of al Qaeda was ""within reach,"" but he did not promise any specific political outcomes in the country where Americans have fought for more than 10 years. The speech and the strategic partnership agreement that the president signed begin the rapid withdrawal of American forces from the region. The White House has given little public attention to Afghanistan in the last two years, and it has continually lowered expectations. A recent upsurge in violence, homicidal acts allegedly by an American soldier and the offensive burning of Qurans in Afghanistan have turned whatever hope some might have had for the future of the region into despondence. The Obama administration has clearly determined that it cannot succeed in bringing security and stability to Afghanistan. The United States will leave as quickly as it can, providing vague and limited assurances of support for Hamid Karzai's government and new national institutions. This is not a victory or a vindication for American efforts. It is not an admission of defeat either. Obama is indeed correct that al Qaeda's capabilities in Afghanistan are largely diminished, thanks in part to vastly expanded American drone strikes in the last three years. The president is also accurate when he explains that some Afghan institutions, especially the Afghan Security Forces, are more effective than they were before 2009. Direct American talks with members of the Taliban have shown, according to the president, that some former supporters of that horrible regime now see a future for themselves in the new pro-Western government. These are all conditions that make Afghanistan far less threatening to its neighbors and the United States than it had been a decade earlier. Washington has accomplished that limited goal. Protecting this modest accomplishment while withdrawing American forces will drive policy in the next few months. Obama's speech signals that he wants to assert that he has done enough and now must focus on other strategic priorities, including the weak U.S. economy. He will continue to try and keep Afghanistan out of the news, and he will quickly seek to reallocate precious financial and military resources from the region to other locations, especially East Asia and the Persian Gulf. The White House is rebalancing away from Central Asia. The promising opportunities for the United States are in the Arab world (now dominated by the Arab Spring), not Afghanistan. This strategy will work to keep the United States safe from another major terrorist attack planned and executed on Afghan territory. American efforts will not, however, bring peace and stability to the region. Karzai will remain the president of Afghanistan, running a corrupt and incompetent government. Local warlords will continue to dominate politics outside Kabul, siphoning capital from productive uses to their personal enrichment. The Taliban will maintain its low-level insurgency, with support and shelter from Pakistan. In all of these ways, and others, Afghanistan will remain a failed state. Soon it will become a failed and ignored state, as it was in the years before September 11, 2001. A failed Afghan state that does not threaten the United States marks neither a victory nor a defeat for the Obama administration. The president correctly avoided the use of either word. As with other issues, Obama has found a pragmatic middle ground that protects core strategic needs, reduces risks and appeals to war-weary voters. He has placed safety for Americans above other worthy goals: democracy, human rights and development. Afghanistan will continue to suffer from violence, disunity, corruption and governmental collapse. These sources of instability will spread to other countries, especially neighboring Pakistan, and they will undermine long-term American interests. For the next year or so, however, the United States can withdraw and solidify some security gains. That is enough for Obama. It might not look like nearly enough a few years on. A strategic retreat in Afghanistan makes sense, but Afghans and Americans will pay a price. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeremi Suri.","Jeremi Suri: Obama's speech represents start of rapid withdrawal from Afghan war .

"(CNN) -- Missy Franklin rewrote swimming's record books with a sixth gold medal at the world championships in Barcelona Sunday. The 18-year-old American swam the backstroke leg as the U.S. won the 4x100m medley relay on the final day of competition. Franklin surpasses Tracy Caulkins of the U.S. and Australia's Libby Trickett, who both won five golds at a single world championship in the women's competition. Only the great Michael Phelps has won more events at the championship, taking seven golds in 2007 in Melbourne. Swimming the backstroke leg, Franklin gave her team a healthy lead with Jessica Hardy, Dana Vollmer and Megan Romano finishing off the job as the U.S. won by nearly two seconds from Australia with Russia third. Dubbed ""Wonder Woman"" by an Australian rival earlier in the championships, Franklin has lived up to the tag with other golds coming in the 4x100m freestyle relay, 100m backstroke, 200m freestyle, 4x200m freestyle relay, 200m backstroke. Fourth in the 100m freestyle final and withdrawal after qualifying for the semifinals of the 50m backstroke have been the only blemishes on her record in Spain. She will now head to the University of California in Berkeley to continue her studies, but more importantly for now, prepare for the 2016 Olympics in Rio. Franklin won four golds at the 2012 London Games and will be hotly tipped to improve that tally four years later, given her current dominance. The success of the women's medley relay team came after their male counterparts were disqualified for an illegal handover after finishing first. France were awarded the gold. The other dominant swimmer of the championships, China's Sun Yang, won the men's 1500m freestyle gold to complete a hat-trick of long distance events, having won the 400 and 800m titles.

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Officials from six countries gathered Monday in Turkey and signed a deal to build a U.S.-backed pipeline, aimed at breaking Russia's near-monopoly on natural gas supplies to Europe. The proposed pipeline could end Russia's near monopoly on gas supplies to Europe. The proposed Nabucco pipeline would run from Turkey's eastern border, through Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary, to a key gas terminal in Baumgarten, Austria. Germany is also a partner in the deal, which is being signed in the Turkish capital, Ankara. Russia controls the current network of pipelines that supply Europe with natural gas. To challenge the Nabucco proposal, Russia has proposed a competing natural gas pipeline to southeastern Europe. The South Stream pipeline would pass under the Black Sea and connect with Bulgaria. Russia and Italy would each control half of that pipeline.  See map of pipeline » . However, Nabucco got a boost after Russia turned off the gas to Europe in January, during the latest in a series of price disputes with Ukraine, according to industry analysts. The Nabucco project is budgeted at €7.9 billion (about $11 billion). Since the idea's inception in 2002, plans for Nabucco have languished amid disagreements among consortium partners and lack of commitment from natural gas suppliers. Turkey had demanded to retain 15 percent of the gas passing through the pipeline for consumption and export, which its European partners rejected. The energy minister of Azerbaijan is expected to attend Monday's signing, a top Western government official said. Gas from Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz 2 field will be a crucial component of the project. European officials have raised hopes that other gas producers, such as Iraq and Turkmenistan, also might contribute to the pipeline. Big hurdles remain for the pipeline project named after an opera by Verdi. Consortium members must raise billions of dollars for the Nabucco project. Construction has not begun, and gas is not projected to be pumped through until 2014. Still, industry analysts called Monday's intergovernmental agreement a significant development. ""It's one of those steps that moves Nabucco out of the possible column and into the probable column,"" said John Roberts, an energy security specialist with Platts. ""My own guess is roughly by the end of the year, it will be pretty clear that Nabucco will be built.""","Nabucco pipeline would run from through Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary .

"(CNN)  -- What does it mean when 86 percent of the Americans surveyed last week by CNN/Opinion Research Corp. say they believe that their system of government is broken? It probably means, Michael Kazin says, that Americans are behaving like they always do. A repeated theme in American history, says Kazin, a historian at Georgetown University, ""is Americans believing the country is in decline and then finding ways to rebound from both the fear of decline and the problems that gave rise to that fear."" There is reason for optimism, says Kazin, who specializes in populist movements and is the editor of The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History. For one thing, populist movements similar to, for example, Tea Parties, have reared up repeatedly in American history to rail against social inequities and faltering financial systems. But rather than heralding the end of the republic, he says, they ""often spur politicians to make changes that in the end make the country stronger."" What optimism? For another view, click here . Americans apparently understand this: Of the 86 percent in the survey who thought the government was broken, 81 percent say that it could be fixed. ""Most Americans are still optimistic about the future of the country,"" Kazin says, ""and even of politics."" Kazin's most recent book is ""A Godly Hero: The Life of William Jennings Bryan."" He is also co-editor of Dissent magazine. He talked to CNN.com last week (the interview has been edited for length). CNN: You have said that the United States is doing rather well, and that what is in decline is a myth that America will always be richer, freer, and superior to other nations. So the country is not in decline? Kazin: I think we are in trouble, but that's not the same as saying we're in decline. We have an economic crisis, unsolved problems, our political situation is deadlocked, many Americans are unhappy with the government. But we've been there before. In the 1930's there was such a period: the Great Depression. And what came afterward was victory in World War II and then the greatest sustained economic boom in American history. One of the continuing themes in American history is Americans believing the country is in decline and then finding ways to rebound from both the fear of decline and the problems that gave rise to that fear. I see no reason to believe that won't happen again. CNN: Why do some people think America's greatness is waning? Kazin: Many Americans believe that the United States is immune from history, that we have always been the greatest nation and are destined always to be the greatest nation -- and if we aren't living up to that promise, our politicians are doing something wrong. But the United States is doing well from the perspective of most of the rest of the world. If decline means that we are not the mightiest economy in the world by a long shot, then we might be declining. But it's also quite possible that what we're evolving into is being part of an interdependent world economy, which includes several powerful economic centers --including Europe, China, Japan -- and if we can all get along together, it's quite possible that it'll be better for Americans rather than worse."" CNN: How would it be better? Kazin: We would specialize in certain goods and certain services and other countries would specialize in others. That's the way a world economy is supposed to work. We have tended to see our position vis-á-vis the rest of the world as a zero-sum game: if we are in decline, then the other countries must be gaining on us and that means we're worse off, that our economy will decline and we'll be vulnerable to threats from abroad. There have been periods in history where several powerful nations have been able to prosper together. [For example] roughly the period from the 1870s to World War I. That was also known as the Age of Empire, so the U.S. and European nations were conquering other peoples. But history doesn't produce eras of unambiguous joy or unambiguous sorrow, it's always more complicated than that. CNN: Can you talk about periods in history that resemble this one, but in which the country has miraculously pulled itself together and become better? Kazin: There was a lot of fear of decline in the 1890s: a nationwide railroad strike, small farmers in the south and west joined the People's Party; the populist movement was gaining large numbers of adherents who accused the powers that be of a conspiracy against the interests of the common people. CNN: What happened? Kazin: What happened was the depression ended and prosperity returned, and the United States soon became the most powerful industrial nation on earth. CNN: And what about the People's Party? Kazin: Some Populists rejoined the mainstream political system, but the populist movement was very beneficial in pointing out problems that needed to be addressed. The Populists helped build support for national regulation of the financial system -- which resulted in the Federal Reserve System -- as well as the income tax and the Tillman Act of 1907, which banned direct corporate contributions to candidates."" CNN: Why do most of the fears of America's decline seem to come from the political right wing and not as much from the left? Kazin: Barack Obama is in power and most people on the left supported him and so they are ambivalent about opposing him now; if he fails, they will have failed. The whole idea of a populist movement is rail against the establishment, in this case, the party in power. Conservative ideas have been the dominant ones over the past 40 years, the way liberal ideas were dominant from the Great Depression to the late 1960s. The left doesn't have institutions that can generate mass protests right now. Just as with the original populists and the labor insurgency of the 1930's, the actual demands that are raised by the populist movements don't usually get met but the issues that are raised by those movements often spur politicians to make changes that in the end make the country stronger. CNN: So do you discern this vibe of pessimism in the culture -- a population beaten down by wars, a lousy economy, joblessness, etc.? Kazin: Not beaten down. I think people are worried -- as they are in any recession, as they are when the political system seems not to be delivering solutions to problems people know exist. But there are a lot for ways in which the nation is quite strong. First of all, we have a very vibrant culture that is popular all over the world -- in sports, in entertainment -- our universities are considered the best in the world, people come from all over to study in the United States. And this is still the country to which most people would like to emigrate. Millions of people aren't trying to get into Russia, or Nigeria, or Japan. We're not going to return to manufacturing inexpensive goods anytime soon -- but at the same time we'll still produce high-tech goods, we have service industry that we export around the world -- people who build things. We still have some of the best engineers in the world, and I think once we realize that we have to produce green technology, we'll be exporting that around the world. This recession was fairly deep and millions of people are still suffering. But compared to the Great Depression it's been rather mild and short. I think the stimulus plan helped, I think bailing out the investment firms and the auto companies was also necessary. Morally, those huge Wall Street bonuses are reprehensible. But, absent a government takeover of the financial sector, keeping Wall Street in business was essential to any recovery. In every downturn, the government has stepped in to help stabilize things, and in every downturn, it's worked."" CNN: And you think that will be the case again. Kazin: The one thing I point to as decline is the gap between the richest Americans and average Americans has increased quite a bit. There are a lot of reasons for that, but in a society where most people consider themselves to be middle-class that we are ""one people,"" that gap should be troubling. It helps to generate a certain kind of populist rage--about those bonuses, for example. Few Americans want an equal distribution of income, but most do believe in economic fairness, and so they get angry when one group seems to be gaming the system. Will this mean decline? Not for the nation as a whole, but it may increase cynicism that there's nobody able to solve our problems.","Michael Kazin says Americans' worry about U.S. decline is repeated through history .

"(CNN) -- ""I cannot tell you how excited I am that later today we will be playing football on my grandmother's lawn. One warning, though: if anyone breaks a window, you can answer to her."" The Duke of Cambridge was speaking just before the first official football match at Buckingham Palace. Prince William, the heir to the British throne, is President of the English Football Association (FA), a role he says is an extension of a personal passion: . ""The beautiful game has changed an awful lot during the queen's reign, but it remains the most loved game in the country, most probably the world,"" he said. He describes football as ""a chance to escape with friends and family and enjoy its virtues -- teamwork, competition, endeavor and, more occasionally on my part, skill."" On Monday he had a chance to show off those skills on the specially prepared pitch at the Palace. Wearing boots given to him by Manchester United and England star Wayne Rooney, he joined members of the queen's household team in a training session. Prince William is a fan of English Premier League side Aston Villa but he chose two teams from lower leagues to play a full 90-minute match on the royal grounds to mark the 150th anniversary of the FA. Civil Service FC is the only surviving member of the FA formed in 1863, and Polytechnic FC was formed slightly later in 1875. But the day was really about rewarding the unsung heroes of the national game: ""Grassroots football thrives on the support of its volunteers week after week,"" he said. Many of those volunteers were invited to the palace to see the match. There was nothing but praise for the royal groundsmen who spent weeks getting the garden match-fit. Watch: Max Foster interviews Prince William . This is a space normally graced only by family members and the odd garden party. It has its own unique challenges for a city center garden. The park-like space is a flourishing habitat for wildlife including a large gaggle of geese whose droppings litter the entire space at this time of year. The groundsmen spent much of the morning cleaning up the football pitch with a vacuum cleaner. They then swept away the carpet of leaves away with wooden brooms. But the fact the Queen was away did provide one advantage: ""There shouldn't be any corgis running on to the pitch,"" Prince William joked. Now the historic match is over (Polytechnic won 2-1) the corgis and geese have their garden back.","Prince William shows off his football skills .

"Idlib Province, Syria (CNN) -- At first glance, it looked like movie night at the neighborhood mosque. Dozens of teenage boys sat mesmerized on the carpeted floor, staring at a screen mounted on the wall. But the show wasn't a comedy, a cartoon or a Hollywood action film. Instead, the boys' attention was captured by a locally produced instructional video demonstrating how to provide first aid to people who had abdominal injuries and appeared to be shot. ""You have to check for entry and exit points,"" a narrator explained in Arabic, as a medic used gauze to wipe away fake blood from a volunteer's bare stomach. Not all of the demonstrations were simulations. In one segment, a male nurse narrated as he cleaned and stitched the hole in a man's scalp, the result of being grazed by a soldier's bullet. ""I have operated on six similar cases [over the past year],"" said the nurse, who asked not to be identified for his own safety. ""In my 30 years as a nurse, I've never seen injuries like this."" The video was part of a first-aid course that activists and local medical workers have provided for free to hundreds of men, women and children in this opposition-controlled town in Idlib Province. (In order to protect people interviewed for this story from reprisals, the exact location is not being identified). In between lessons on how to bandage wounds and carry unconscious victims, the presentation included snippets of amateur activist video, showing bleeding, badly wounded demonstrators being carried down Syrian streets. According to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists, more than 8,000 people have been killed since the Syrian security forces began their crackdown on anti-government protests 11 months ago. The cycle of violence in Syria has been so deadly for so long that opposition activists have taken matters into their own hands. In addition to trauma treatment lessons, they have established what could be described as a parallel shadow system of health care for their communities. Several doctors told CNN they operated secret clinics to treat patients wounded in clashes with security forces along with invalids suffering from common ailments. Doctors in Homs struggle to save wounded children . The underground medical networks sprang up because many residents deemed it too dangerous to travel through government checkpoints to the main provincial hospital in the nearby city of Idlib. That contested city periodically echoes with bursts of heavy gunfire as rebels and government forces engage in deadly skirmishes. But doctors and residents also say they have seen a pattern of government reprisals that seemed to target health workers. ""I have to hide my medical bag because what if they (Syrian authorities) find them? They would shoot me,"" said a Syrian dentist in another town in Idlib province. He had ample reason to be scared. As the number of protests and subsequent casualties grew last year, the dentist began using his small dental clinic as a first-aid station for wounded activists and bystanders. Instead of drilling teeth, he struggled to save men suffering from gunshots to the stomach. Then, one day last summer, he said Syrian soldiers knocked at the door of his clinic. ""As soon as I opened the door, the soldier took a Kalashnikov [rifle] and hit me in the face with it,"" the dentist said. He said he was beaten, blindfolded and dragged out to the street, where three other doctors were being beaten. Later, captives were dragged to a car, where the dentist said a soldier sat on top of three doctors and put out cigarettes on the prisoners' hands and backs. ""I thought, they must be from another country. They couldn't treat their own people this way,"" the dentist recalled. The dentist spent the next 45 days in a prison unit built for 60 people but crammed full of 130 prisoners. Every couple of days, he said, he was taken in for interrogation and torture, which included beatings, near-drownings in buckets of toilet water, and electric shocks to his genitals. ""They started beating me and asked me, ""Who did you help?'"" he recounted. ""I said, 'I helped an old lady.' Then they started beating me even harder."" According to a recent report by the humanitarian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), the dentist's case is not an isolated one. ""The Syrian regime is conducting a campaign of unrelenting repression against people wounded in demonstrations and the medical workers trying to treat them,"" the report concluded, adding, ""Medicine is being used as a weapon of persecution."" The Syrian government has repeatedly denied accusations that it is targeting civilians. It insists that its forces are fighting in self-defense against ""armed terrorists."" But doctors who have seen their colleagues arrested and tortured for treating wounded people disagree. ""The regime knows no humanity. Bashar [al-Assad] is a doctor in name only,"" said one young doctor, who volunteered as a quick responder with the Syrian Red Crescent. He was referring to the Syrian president, who trained as an ophthalmologist in Britain before being propelled into the presidency by the death of his father, Hafez al-Assad, in 2000. Aid group calls for cease-fire to treat wounded . In the case of the dentist, 45 days of detention and torture in prison appeared to have only pushed him further into the Syrian opposition movement. ""When I was released, the whole town was waiting for me in the street -- children, adults and old people,"" he said in an interview with CNN. ""I immediately forgot all about the torture. And that confirmed one thing for me: that I have to help the people even more."" He no longer uses his dentist's chair to treat the wounded. Now, the dentist was working with a small, secretive network of other health-care professionals to set up a network of underground field hospitals in their town in the event of a military assault. They also had gathered hundreds of first-aid kits equipped with serum, gauze and bandages and quietly distributed them to hundreds of homes in their town. ""We are preparing for the threat of a battle,"" said the Red Crescent doctor. ""This is something natural after what we saw in Homs."" Rebels in Idlib province fear that after the Syrian military destroys rebel neighborhoods in Homs, the regime could turn its attention to opposition enclaves in the north of the country. Videographer killed in Homs . One group of doctors told CNN they were preparing for such an emergency by setting up their own underground blood bank. They have little other choice. According to Doctors Without Borders, all of Syria's blood banks are under the control of the Ministry of Defense. So in one rebel enclave, activists have compensated by compiling a list of potential blood donors, who have all been tested for blood types and to ensure they carry no blood diseases. Even the most careful planning, however, ran up against the obstacle of shortage of medical supplies. The activists had only succeeded in securing 100 blood container bags for a community of tens of thousands. ""There's not enough medicine,"" said the dentist. ""I've been trying to stockpile medicine. But when I treat one sick person I use almost all of it up. ... if there is a battle here and 100 people are wounded, what will we do?""","Opposition has effectively set up a parallel shadow health care system .

"(CNN) -- An employee at a New Jersey chocolate processing plant died Wednesday after falling into a vat of hot chocolate, according to a spokesman for the Camden County Prosecutor's office. Vincent Smith II, 29, was dumping raw chocolate into the vat for melting when he fell in from a nine-foot high platform. He suffered a fatal blow to the head from the vat's agitator, a paddle-like mechanism used for stirring the chocolate. According to the Camden County prosecutor's office, three other people were on the platform at the time. One was able to shut the machinery off quickly, but it was too late to save Smith. The facility, owned by Cocoa Services Inc., is managed and operated by by Lyons and Sons. The rectangular vat, which was 8 feet deep, 14 feet long and 6 feet wide, was churning a batch of chocolate for Hershey's when the accident occurred, the prosecutor's office said.

"(CNN) -- Bob and Mike Bryan kept U.S. hopes alive in their Davis Cup semifinal against Spain in Gijon on Saturday with a hard-fought victory over Marcel Granollers and Marc Lopez. The world No.1 pairing ran out 6-3, 3-6, 7-5, 7-5 winners to record their 20th Davis Cup win in three hours 38 minutes. The result means the match score is now 2-1 in the host's favor heading into Sunday's singles matches, and U.S. captain Jim Courier concedes his team face a daunting challenge against the defending champions. David Ferrer will play John Isner in the first reverse singles match with Nicolas Almagro taking on Sam Querrey in the second match, if required. ""Ferrer is such a warrior and a great competitor and John's going to have to play better than he did yesterday to stand a chance. He's a little bit more physically taxed than David is for sure,"" Courier said. Spain, who are without the injured Rafael Nadal, are bidding to reach a sixth final in 10 years. In the other semifinal, Argentina's hopes of winning a first Davis Cup suffered a setback in Buenos Aires as Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic beat Carlos Berlocq and Eduardo Schwank in the doubles match on Saturday. The Czech pair coasted to a 6-3 6-4 6-3 victory in two hours 37 minutes to stun the home crowd at the Parque Roca stadium. ""It's very loud in here and we knew that when we were coming to this place. It was always going to be like that so we concentrated only on our half of the court,"" Stepanek said. The Czechs, who are looking for a first win in the competition for 32 years, will take a 2-1 lead going into Sunday's deciding singles where Argentina will be without Juan Martin del Potro. Team captain Martin Jaite said the world No.8's niggling wrist injury has forced his withdrawal.

"(CNN) -- Zambia lifted the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time after beating the Ivory Coast 8-7 in a dramatic penalty shootout in Sunday's final in Libreville. Ivory Coast captain Didier Drogba missed a penalty in the second half of regulation play as the match ended scoreless after extra time. Both teams were successful with their first seven penalties of the shootout, including Drogba, until Manchester City defender Kolo Toure saw his effort saved by Zambia goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene. Rainford Kalaba then missed the chance to clinch the game for Zambia when he shot over. With the tension almost unbearable, Arsenal forward Gervinho blazed his penalty wide, and this time Zambia's Stoppila Sunzu made no mistake to give his side an emotional victory. It was a fairytale triumph for Zambia, who returned to Gabon 19 years after the plane crash which claimed the lives of the team's coach and 18 members of their squad. The Copper Bullets finally won Africa's top football prize after losing in two previous finals, while the favored Elephants suffered a shootout defeat again after a similar heartbreak against Egypt in 2006 -- when Drogba also missed a penalty. Zambia's French coach Herve Renard was overjoyed. ""This represents something enormous, something which appeared unrealizable before the competition began,"" he told AFP. ""I know we're not the best but we have a strength and force that animated our team."" But for Chelsea striker Drogba and his star-studded team it was a bitter disappointment after not conceding a goal in open play in their six matches in the tournament. Clear-cut chances were few and far between in wet conditions, but Ivorian goalkeeper Boubacar Barry had to make a brilliant early save to foil Nathan Sinkala. Drogba set up Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure for his side's best chance of the first half, but the African player of the year fired wide. Ivory Coast's 72nd-minute penalty came after Gervinho was pushed over, but Drogba's effort never threatened the goal. His Zambian counterpart Christopher Katongo hit the woodwork in extra time before the drama of penalties and victory for the underdogs.","Zambia win Africa Cup of Nations in Libreville .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Hundreds of Israelis on Monday bid an emotional farewell to Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, 93, the former Sephardic chief rabbi of Israel. The spiritual leader died at Jerusalem's Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital after medical complications from a stroke he suffered at the beginning of the year. Yosef was considered the leading authority in religious rulings in the realm of Jewish law. He was revered by many Israelis, both secular and religious, in particular those of Eastern origin. This popularity led him to play a unique role in Israel's nation-building. He will be remembered for his pivotal influence in Israeli politics after he formed the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party in 1984. Since its founding, the party has almost always been part of the governing coalition, and the rabbi had been a confidant of Israel's prime ministers. In September 1993, Shas, under Yosef's leadership, played an integral role in Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's peace initiative that led to the forming of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza. He interpreted the Halakhic, or Jewish religious law, principle of Pikuach Nefesh to mean that lives that are endangered by the Arab-Israeli conflict can be saved by overruling the commandment to settle the land. His interpretation was taken as the religious endorsement of the two-state solution, which calls for an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. The rabbi's political weight in the party's move to the right was reflected in his opposition to the Israeli government's decision to disengage from Gaza in September 2005. This time, his interpretation of Pikuach Nefesh led him to conclude that a unilateral withdrawal would threaten the lives of Israelis, and thus the state should abide by the commandment to settle the land. Today, Shas' political influence wanes as it sits in the political opposition. Controversial statements . In a 2001 sermon, according to Israeli media, he referred to ""evil and damnable"" Palestinians, adding: ""You must send missiles to them and annihilate them."" And in August 2010, Israel Army Radio quoted Yosef as saying that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ""and all these evil people should perish from this world. ... God should strike them with a plague -- them and these Palestinians."" He was denouncing then-upcoming direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians in Washington. The Palestinian government condemned his statement, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said: ""These things do not reflect PM Netanyahu's approach nor that of the Israeli government.""

"(CNN) -- Last Monday, only a few people knew about an obscure anti-Islam video produced in the U.S. Today, people around the world are aware of it. The video sparked protests worldwide, starting in Egypt and Libya, and then spreading to other countries. Tragically, some of the protests turned violent and took the lives of Americans, Libyans, Tunisians and Yemenis. The protests have subsided for now, it seems. In assessing what happened, we have to be cautious and ensure that we do not point fingers in the wrong direction. As things become clearer, it seems that the video was created and promoted by members of the American Coptic Christian community -- a community with its roots in Egypt. It is understandable that Muslims worldwide were deeply offended by the video. The United Nations called the video ""hateful"" and the Obama administration called it ""disgusting."" But, there were other elements at work in the some of the protests; there are those who used anger at the video to promote their own agendas. For example, the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya was likely a terrorist operation that took advantage of the protests. In the midst of all this, it is not surprising that some people looked to assign blame and demand apologies. These people within the Arab world began blaming the Coptic community -- a community whose very name means ""Egyptian."" In response, the Coptic Church, both in Egypt as well as in the United States, insisted that it has nothing to do with the video. It also said that the video does not in any way represent the view of the Coptic community. I do know a Copt who was involved with the promotion of the video. I met Morris Sadek earlier this year. Sadek's personal actions have nothing to do with the Coptic Church or the Coptic-American community. Virtually no Coptic Christian I encountered had heard of him before. They know about him now. And in response, he received a volley of shoes from outraged members of the Coptic community for his promotion of bigotry. It is a mark of Christian value for the Coptic Church to condemn the video and its filmmakers. But the Coptic Church should never be placed in the position of having to apologize for the actions of a few of its members. The same applies to Muslims. From the local representatives of Muslim communities in America, to the religious establishments of Egypt and Libya, to the leadership of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which represents all Muslim countries, we have heard apologies and condemnations for the violence. The Muslim community at large is not responsible for the violence, and it should not be expected to apologize for the actions of some of its members. The violent actions of a comparatively small number of individuals do not represent all Muslims, just as the video does not represent the views of all Coptic Christians. Neither group needs to apologize, but both should be recognized for their solidarity in condemning the violence. At some point, there do need to be levelheaded discussions about hate speech (which is legal in America, unlike most other countries), the roots of widespread anti-Americanism in the Middle East and elsewhere, and what different cultures consider as sacred. Before that can take place, we should be careful about whom we hold accountable. It should be those who have been directly fanning the flames of intolerance not just over the last few months, but over the years. The video did not appear in a vacuum. There is a well-organized network that thrives on promoting anti-Muslim bigotry within the U.S. It provided an ideological base for Anders Breivik, recently convicted of mass murder in Norway. Similarly, there are those within the Muslim Arab world who also push for a hateful agenda, to devastating effect. The last few days are just a reminder of how important it is to confront such promoters of hate. Whether it's through legal channels or social pressures, they must be dealt with. Their aim, simply, is to engineer cultural wars between non-Muslims and Muslims. That must not be allowed to happen. The least we can do now is to make sure not to blame the wrong people for the vile actions of a few individuals. That is, after all, precisely what they want -- for us to do their dirty work for them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of H.A. Hellyer.","An anti-Islam video that sparked protests seems to have involved Coptics .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Gunmen targeted the car of the Italian consul general in Benghazi, Libya, on Saturday as he was leaving the consulate, the latest in a series of attacks targeting foreign missions and security officials in the eastern city. Consul General Guido de Sanctis was in an armored car pulling out of the garage when the gunmen pulled up alongside the vehicle and opened fire, the diplomat told CNN. No one was injured. Libyan police arrived immediately to secure the scene, said de Sanctis, who was unsure of who was behind the attack. ""It is difficult to make conclusions ... but if you look at the past months, some people are trying to send all the foreigners away,"" he said. ""The British, the Red Cross and unfortunately the Americans -- now us? I was not sure we were on the list. I did not expect it at all."" The attack comes amid an ongoing investigation into the September 11 assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. De Sanctis said security was reinforced at his consulate following the attack on the U.S. mission, but the building is not heavily fortified and is relatively open to the public, fielding as many as 40 visa requests from Libyans daily. Italy's Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi called the attack ""a vile act of terrorism,"" and said Sunday it was ""an attempt to destabilize the institutions of the new Libya."" Benghazi has been shaken by such attacks in recent months. A pro-al Qaeda group claimed responsibility for an attack on the International Red Cross Office in the city in May. The next month, the same group claimed responsibility for detonating an explosive device outside the U.S. Consulate. Bomb attacks also occurred last year on a U.N. convoy as well as a convoy carrying the British ambassador. In November, unknown gunmen assassinated the city's temporary security director.

"(CNN) -- A roadside bomb killed 14 people and wounded six in northwest Pakistan on Sunday, a government official said. The blast targeted a passenger van in the Lower Dir district near the village of Bunr, said Hussain Ahmed, the official. The bomb was remotely detonated, he said. Details about the van's occupants were not available. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. The bombing in the Lower Dir district is the latest violence to strike Pakistan's tribal region that borders Afghanistan. The district is one of 24 that make up the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. It was formerly known as the North West Frontier Province, a name assigned during the British colonial rule. The ruling party changed the name to reflect the province's majority Pashtun population. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is rife with Islamic extremists and has been the site of recent clashes between Pakistani security forces and militants. On September 3, an explosives-filled car slammed into a U.S. Consulate vehicle in the provincial capital, Peshawar. The attack took place in an area of the city where several international agencies have offices. In addition to the U.S. Consulate, the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, is in the area. In May 2011, a remote-controlled car bomb targeted a convoy of U.S. Consulate vehicles in Peshawar, killing one person and wounding 11. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. In April 2010, three explosions went off in rapid succession near the consulate.

"(CNN) -- Normally, you might think that a controversy over whether the Kennedy Center, one of the nation's leading performing arts organizations, is overlooking the contributions of Latino artists, actors and musicians would be a real sleeper. Until you heard that, during a recent telephone conversation between one lover of the arts and another, one claims the other told him to ""F--- yourself."" Ok, gentlemen, you have my attention. It all happened very quickly. On Sept. 14, Felix Sanchez, chairman of the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts, and Michael M. Kaiser, president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts talked. In multiple media reports, Sanchez said that Kaiser took none too kindly to him expressing his concern over the constant omission of Latinos from the annual list of Kennedy Center Honors recipients. Since 1978, the Kennedy Center has chosen only two Hispanics among more than 170 honorees: Spanish tenor Placido Domingo and U.S.-born performer Chita Rivera, who is of Puerto Rican descent. Both these breakthroughs happened during Michael Kaiser's tenure, which has lasted nearly 12 years. In 2012, Latinos are nearly ubiquitous. You'll find them in corporate America, professional sports, music, entertainment, politics and the media. At 50 million people, America's largest minority is everywhere. Except, for some reason, on the annual list of Kennedy Center Honorees. Opinion: Why Latinos are key in election . What accounts for the discrepancy? It is a familiar story. In fact, it has become something of an annual tradition, like Cinco de Mayo and Day of the Dead, that, when the list of Kennedy Center Honorees is announced each year, there won't be a single Latino name on it. And this tradition of omission continued this year when the 2012 honorees were announced. The seven artists set to receive the honor are actor Dustin Hoffman, musician George ""Buddy"" Guy, late night TV host David Letterman, ballerina Natalia Makarova and John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, all of rock band Led Zepellin. Sanchez has had enough. As a Latino who loves the arts and believes that his community has contributed mightily to it, he is raising a ruckus. It's the American thing to do. When we see something that isn't right, we speak up. We protest. We boycott. We raise hell until our concerns are addressed, and the wrong is made right. That's what Sanchez is doing. I commend him for it. While Kaiser refused to share with reporters the exact words he used, he did admit to the Washington Post that he used ""strong language"" during the call. He claimed it was because he thought he was being labeled a bigot. ""I've spent much of the last 20 years working with organizations of color in this country, African American, Latino, Asian American, Native American,"" he told the Post. ""This is a real part of who I am, and so when someone insinuates that I am a racist, it gets me extremely upset."" Still, Kaiser said, he regretted his choice of words. Sanchez says the whole racism thing is a dodge, and that he never insinuated any such thing. ""That was his interpretation,"" he told POLITICO. ""The issue I presented was: how can you continue to exclude Latinos from the Kennedy Center Honors...He took that to mean I was calling him a racist."" Sanchez suggests that what really set off Kaiser was being challenged and questioned. What if Sanchez did mean to imply that? So what? Kaiser would still be out of line. If he doesn't like being challenged or questioned, he should go into another line of work, one further removed from the public. According to Sanchez, the Kennedy Center receives tens of millions in operating funds every year, paid for by public tax dollars. And its ex officio board members include the first lady. This is not a private enterprise. Two weeks after the phone call, Kaiser finally did something he should have done much earlier. He sent a written apology to Sanchez for the call and the ""unfortunate choice of words"" he used ""in frustration."" In America: It's immigration, stupid, say Latino voters in Nevada . Amazing. With Kaiser, everything comes with a qualifier. He was frustrated? That implies that there was something that Sanchez did wrong to frustrate him. If he thinks he's frustrated, imagine how frustrated Latinos are to constantly have their achievements, talent, and contributions ignored by cultural elitists who think only in terms of black and white. Kaiser owes all Latinos a symbolic apology, and he can express that by showing that he understands what Sanchez was upset about in the first place and proving that he is committed to addressing this disgraceful pattern of omission. Sanchez is scheduled to meet with Kennedy Center chairman David Rubenstein soon to discuss his concerns, which are shared by as many as 30 Hispanic organizations who have signed onto the cause. If Latinos don't get satisfaction, and more importantly some respect, we should turn the TV channel and not watch the broadcast of the Kennedy Center Honors on December 2 and not buy the products of any advertiser that sponsors the show. It's time to take the gloves off. This tempest will probably run its course, but the underlying problem remains. The Kennedy Center needs new leadership. The people at the top need to be let go and replaced with folks who have not just an appreciation for the arts but a firm grasp of the country they're living in -- and the century.

"Washington (CNN) -- If federal safety advocates get their way, collision avoidance systems that warn drivers about hazards -- and even automatically hit the brakes -- will become as commonplace as seat belts and air bags. The National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday that the federal government should mandate the systems as standard equipment in all cars and commercial vehicles. Many of the systems are already available as options, typically in luxury cars. But the NTSB said the time is ripe for the federal government to require the systems in all vehicles, saying their ""full life-saving and crash-avoidance potential will not be realized"" until the government mandates the systems and sets standards for their performance. ""We know that hundreds of lives can be saved and hundreds of thousands of injuries can be prevented if the technology improves and we can avoid these run-off-the-road, rear-end and also the side lane departure collisions,"" NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman told CNN. The safety board called for the change in its updated ""Most Wanted List"" of transportation safety improvements. Six of the 10 issues on the annual list address highway travel, as the board shifted focus to the 35,000 people who die on the nation's roadways every year. The board also added ""eliminating distraction in transportation"" to its list -- highlighting a concern that has grown as the number of cell phones and other digital devices has proliferated. Meanwhile, the board removed ""fatigue"" from its list. Fatigue, which has been on the list since it was first created in 1990, was removed largely because the board feels the issue is being addressed, a board spokesperson said. The independent NTSB has no authority to enact transportation policy, nor to force the federal government to make changes. But it makes recommendations to governments, industry and the public and uses its ""Most Wanted"" list as a soap box to affect change. Hersman said collision avoidance technology can help address driver fatigue and distraction. ""People are distracted. People are fatigued. People aren't paying attention,"" Hersman said. ""Technology can really be an aid to prevent you from running into the car ahead of your or running off the road."" The board specifically endorsed the use of lane departure warning systems, which provide an audible or visual warning, or both, when a car drifts out of a lane when the turn signal is not used. It also mentioned automatic braking, electronic stability control and adaptive cruise control, which reduces a car's speed when appropriate. And it endorsed tire pressure monitoring, speed-limiting technology and, for commercial truckers, onboard monitors, which track drivers' performance. Tests of existing crash avoidance technology have shown mixed results, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an organization funded by insurance companies. Forward collision avoidance systems, particularly those that brake autonomously, along with headlights which shift direction as the driver steers, show the biggest crash reductions, the IIHS said. Lane departure warning ""appears to hurt, rather than help, though it's not clear why,"" they said. And other systems, such as blind spot detection ""aren't showing clear effects on crash patterns yet."" In a statement, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday that it is continually working to reduce crashes. The administration ""already has work underway to help address bus safety issues... combat impaired driving... discourage texting and other distracting behavior behind the wheel"" and is evaluating crash avoidance technologies. ""We've already taken aggressive action to address a number of issues identified by the NTSB,"" the agency said, adding, ""We look forward to continuing our work"" with the board.

"(CNN) -- Small cars on the U.S. market are gaining traction with consumers, but some new models have more work to do to catch the Honda Civic, designated by a respected safety group as an industry leader. The 2013 two- and four-door Civics turned in a ""good"" performance -- the highest score -- in a new type of tough front crash test earlier this year to earn the highest accolade from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Four other cars, including the Dodge Dart from Chrysler and the Ford Focus, more recently posted acceptable ratings in the same IIHS test. But that was good enough for them to earn top overall status as well from the organization, even though the Civic did better. But three models, including the Chevy Cruze produced by General Motors, and the Volkswagen Beetle, posted marginal results and fell short of the loftiest rating for comprehensive safety, which also factors in results from other IIHS front, side, rollover and rear crash tests. The Nissan Sentra and two other vehicles made by Kia fared poorly in the test. A premium on fuel efficiency . With half of the 12 tested models qualifying for IIHS best performance -- called Top Safety Pick Plus -- consumers have more vetted choices when weighing safety, the group said. Automakers trying to meet government and consumer demands for better fuel efficiency have in recent years jump-started production of small cars. Buyers have responded positively, especially to U.S. manufacturers, which for years relied on sales of gas-guzzling SUVs and pickups. Car companies designed models to perform better in the latest frontal and other tough crash tests, but some still need to address concerns. ""Manufacturers need to focus on the whole package,"" said David Zuby, the Insurance Institute's chief research officer. ""That means a strong occupant compartment that resists the kinds of intrusion we see in a frontal crash like this, safety belts that prevent a driver from pitching too far forward and side curtain airbags to cushion a head at risk of hitting the dashboard or window frame."" The latest institute test measured vehicle strength and occupant protection when only a quarter of a car's front end hits a tree, a pole, or another vehicle at 40 mph. The collision occurs outside the structural areas of the vehicle designed to manage crash energy. This increases the risk of severe damage to the car and possible injury to the driver and passengers, the insurance group said. The test is also important for testing seat belts and air bags and measuring how well vehicle designs prevent injuries to feet and lower legs, according to the IIHS. Tesla aces its first crash test . Automakers respond to test results . The redesigned two- and four-door Honda Civic posted ""good"" or top marks in the so-called overlap front crash test. That equaled the performance of some larger cars, which makes the result more impressive for Honda. The Dart, Focus, Hyundai Elantra -- all new this year -- and the Toyota Scion tC2014 all posted acceptable ratings. The 2013 Cruze, Beetle and Chevy Sonic scored marginally, while the Sentra, the Kia Soul and Forte 2014 turned in poor marks. ""The small cars with marginal or poor ratings had some of the same structural and restraint system issues as other models we've tested,"" Zuby said. ""In the worst cases, safety cages collapsed, driver airbags moved sideways with unstable steering columns and the (test) dummy's head hit the instrument panel. Side curtain airbags didn't deploy or didn't provide enough forward coverage to make a difference. All of this adds up to marginal or poor protection in a small overlap crash."" Automakers take special note of the IIHS trials because the group is backed by the insurance industry. The federal government conducts separate crash tests and posts its own safety ratings. It does not perform the overlap test, however.

"(CNN) -- A five-eyed monster under the bed isn't what worries most kids. Experts say young people fear a lot of what's in the news -- from kidnappings to murders to salmonella. It's good for teens to fear the negative consequences of risky behavior, one expert says. A study on more than 1,000 children and adolescents in grades 2 through 12 found that some of the 20 most common fears include ""terrorist attacks,"" ""having to fight in a war,"" ""drive-by shootings,"" ""tornadoes/hurricanes"" and ""drowning/swimming in deep water,"" based on self-reports of how scary each of 98 events or concepts seems. The study was published in a recent issue of the Journal of Counseling and Development. Study author Joy Burnham, associate professor at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, collected data from November 2001 to April 2004 in 23 schools in two southeastern states. The most common fears closely aligned with those found in previous studies on youth, and the pattern of findings has persisted in studies on fear for the past 30 years, she said. By 8 years old, children know the difference between fantasy and reality, so they are more likely to be frightened by televised news coverage of events such as kidnappings, murders and terrorism, said Joanne Cantor, professor of at University of Wisconsin-Madison, who was not involved with the study. Before age 8, they express fears of fictional scenarios and characters but also worry about hurricanes and drowning, she said. A lot of children's fears have to do with where they live, said Nancy Weisman, a psychologist in Marietta, Georgia, who was not involved with the study. In the Atlanta, Georgia, area, many children express fears of tornadoes, she said, prompted by the storm that sliced through the city March 14, 2008. Dawn Huebner, a psychologist in Exeter, New Hampshire, who sees children ages 6 to 12, agreed that weather-related events make some kids anxious to the point that they don't want to go outside if a storm may be coming. Several psychologists agreed that abduction or kidnapping is a fear among many children today. One of Weisman's patients became terrified of kidnapping after learning about slain Florida toddler Caylee Anthony, she said. Children also fear diseases. In a separate analysis, when Burnham looked at data on fear by age, she found AIDS among the top five fears for ages 7 to 10, 11 to 14, and 15 to 18. Complexity of teenage fears . Two of the top fears in Burnham's study -- ""being raped"" was No. 1 overall and ""my getting pregnant or getting my girlfriend pregnant"" was No. 19 -- were presented only for students in grades 7 through 12 because of fear content, the study said. The teenage years are also when young people begin to understand and fear larger world issues such as terrorism and war, Cantor said. Moreover, some teenagers become anxious about issues of global injustice but have the same divorce-related fears as young children, said Lawrence Balter, professor of applied psychology at New York University. Moreover, young people are not immune to fears about finances during the current economic downturn, he said. ""Almost everyone is affected by it, and there might be a fear that they're going to lose their house or that their parents are going to lose their jobs,"" he said. Some fears have a good role to play in helping to promote caution, Weisman said. The negative consequences of risky behaviors -- for example, getting sexually transmitted diseases or becoming pregnant -- should make teenagers wary of taking unnecessary risks. Burnham agreed that fear, like anxiety, can be a motivating tool. ""It is a natural process that occurs, and we all have fear,"" she said in an e-mail. ""However, if it rules someone's life, it gets in the way, and that would be the unhealthy side."" About 400 study participants also wrote their own ideas about what makes them or people their age afraid, scared or fearful. Responses included safety issues such as ""abuse,"" ""scary movies and scary characters from movies,"" ""snipers at school,"" ""heights"" and ""driving."" Other self-reported fears related to animals or reptiles, spiritual or religious concerns, school, people (such as ""clowns""), death, relational issues or social adjustment, sex-related issues and health or medical issues. Movies and television, including news, can inspire fears that can last for years, said Cantor, who runs the Web site yourmindonmedia.com. Clowns, for example, inspire fear because of their presence in film. ""I've got lots of examples from research where college students and older say, 'I feel uncomfortable in a certain situation, and I trace it back to news or movie,' "" she said. How parents can help . Many experts said parents should limit their elementary-school-age children's exposure to local news to reduce anxiety about tragic events depicted on television. Young children do not understand that when a news clip about an event such as a kidnapping is repeated, it is not a separate instance of a kidnapping, Huebner said. Children should seek counseling when anxiety leads to sleep disruption or difficulty falling asleep, Weisman said. They may also present physical symptoms, such as stomach pain and headaches, that relate to anxiety problems. ""By definition, anxiety is being afraid without really having a target to the fear,"" she said. ""There's a difference between being anxious and being cautious."" Parents should not tell children that events such as kidnappings and murders could absolutely never happen, because the children won't believe that, Weisman said. Instead, parents should focus on the probabilities, she said. ""The parents need to tell kids that the chances are very, very remote that these things are going to happen,"" she said. When a disaster strikes, don't show it to young children on television, Balter said. Instead, assure them that the grownups are doing everything possible to make things OK. ""Allow them to talk about their concerns; don't trivialize and make believe that nothing is wrong,"" he said.","Study: Most common fear among young people in grades 7 to 12 is being raped .
Terrorist attacks, having to fight in a war, shootings, murders were also common .

"(CNN) -- China's President Hu Jintao called Tuesday for a ""prosperous and harmonious"" Xinjiang province during his first visit to the country's western Uyghur region since last month's deadly riots, state-run media reported. President Hu Jintao said Xinjiang's development will be ""better and faster."" ""The key to our work in Xinjiang is to properly handle development and stability,"" said Hu. Hu, calling for reform, development, ethnic unity and stability in the region, expressed gratitude to the armed forces, militia and police for their work in quelling the July 5 ethnic riots in Urumqi, the capital of China's remote northwestern Xinjiang Autonomous Region, Xinhua news agency said. The riots were between Uyghurs, who are predominantly Muslim, and ethnic Han Chinese, the majority group in China. Reports of deaths range from around 200 to many more. Hu, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, said Xinjiang must focus on economic development, maintaining social stability, and promoting ethnic unity and common prosperity. During a tour that began Saturday and ended Tuesday, Hu visited villages, farms, communities, factories and barracks in the largely Uyghur area of Aksu; Changji, a land port between China and Central Asian nations; Karamay, an oil base; Shihezi, the headquarters of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps; and the regional capital of Urumqi. Hu met with military personnel, hospital workers, local officials and religious leaders and with the widow of a policeman who was killed July 5 by rioters in Urumqi. He promised her family members government help if they should need it. Hu told villagers and herders that ethnic minorities would be supported through ""more efficient measures."" ""In the future, Xinjiang's development will be better and faster,"" he said, according to state-run CCTV. ""The improvement of people's lives will be even more remarkable; let's work together to create an even better future."" He said the central government ""attaches great importance to the well-being of ethnic groups"" and called the riots ""a serious criminal act masterminded by separatist forces at home and abroad."" Hu added that all separatist forces are doomed to failure, and said the central government would support social and ethnic development, CCTV reported. Reports on Monday from state-run China Daily said that more than 200 people charged in connection with the riots could be tried this week. Problems in the region began in late June, after two Uyghur migrant workers at a toy factory in Guangdong province were killed in a brawl between Uyghurs and Han. Uyghurs protested in Urumqi, hundreds of miles from the toy factory. Uyghurs and Han reportedly attacked each other.","Hu Jintao makes first visit to country's western Uyghur region since last month's riots .

"(CNN) -- The debate on how to reduce health care costs that are out of control seems more polarized than ever. Many Republicans are recommending that Medicare be privatized or even abolished since Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program accounted for 21% of the federal budget in 2011, or $769 billion, and even more in 2012. Many Democrats are advocating raising taxes and letting the deficit increase in the near term. There's not much common ground when the issues are framed in this way. Here's an alternative: Let's address the underlying causes of what make us sick and what make us well. This is a radical approach ""Radical"" comes from the Latin word meaning ""root."" When we address the root causes of a problem, we are more likely to solve it. We can make much better health care available for more people at far lower costs when we treat the causes rather than the symptoms. So what are the root causes? They are the lifestyle choices that we make each day: What we eat, how we respond to stress, whether or not we smoke, how much we exercise, and how much love, intimacy and social support we have in our lives. Opinion: U.S. manages disease, not health . Currently, over 75% of the $2.8 trillion in health care costs are due to chronic diseases, such as coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes, that can be largely prevented by making comprehensive lifestyle changes. We don't need to wait for a new drug or laser or high-tech breakthrough; we simply need to put into practice what we already know. For example, one study of 23,000 people shows that walking for just 30 minutes every day, not smoking, eating a reasonably healthy diet, and keeping a healthy weight prevented 93% of diabetes, 81% of heart attacks, 50% of strokes and 36% of all cancers. Bigger changes in diet and lifestyle can do even more. In another of study of 30,000 men and women in 52 countries in all seven continents, lifestyle factors accounted for almost all of the risk of heart attacks in both sexes and in all ages. Think about it: Heart disease and type 2 diabetes, two of the biggest killers in the United States, are completely preventable by making comprehensive lifestyle changes. Without drugs or surgery. In addition to preventing chronic diseases, comprehensive lifestyle changes can often reverse their progression. My colleagues and I first proved that lifestyle changes alone can reverse even severe heart disease. At any age. We also found that the same program of comprehensive lifestyle changes can reverse type 2 diabetes and may slow, stop, or even reverse the progression of early-stage prostate cancer. CNN special report: 'Escape Fire' When comprehensive lifestyle changes are offered as treatment (not just as prevention), significant cost savings occur in the first year because the biological mechanisms that control our health and well-being are so dynamic. For example, Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield found that overall health care costs were reduced by 50% in the first year when people with heart disease or risk factors went through our lifestyle program in 24 hospitals and clinics in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Nebraska. In another study, Mutual of Omaha found that it saved $30,000 per patient in the first year for those who went through our lifestyle program. At a time when the power of comprehensive lifestyle changes to prevent and reverse chronic diseases is becoming better documented, the limitations and costs of high-tech medicine are becoming increasingly clear: . -- Recent studies have shown that angioplasties and stents do not prolong life or prevent heart attacks in stable patients, costing $60 billion per year. -- Type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes will affect half of Americans in the next eight years at a projected cost of $3.3 trillion. Lowering blood sugar with drugs does not fully prevent the economic and human costs of diabetes (including heart attacks, strokes, amputations, impotence, kidney failure, and blindness), but lowering blood sugar with diet and lifestyle prevents all of these human and economic costs. -- Only 1 out of 49 men treated for prostate cancer lives longer because of the surgery or radiation treatments; the other 48 often become impotent, incontinent, or both. Because of this, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended that men not even be screened for prostate cancer, since there is such pressure to undergo treatments that, for most men, do not benefit them but may cause them harm in the most personal ways. But intensive lifestyle changes can be an alternative solution. Changing your lifestyle can change your genes. It turns on genes that keep you healthy, and turns off genes that promote heart disease, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and diabetes. People often tell me, ""Oh, it's all in my genes, there's not much I can do about it."" Knowing that changing lifestyle changes our genes is often very motivating -- not to blame but instead empower ourselves. On March 16, tune in to CNN at 8 p.m. or 11 p.m. ET to watch the extraordinary documentary film ""Escape Fire: The Fight To Rescue American Healthcare,"" which vividly highlights what's broken about our health-care system and what can be done to help rescue it. Our work about the power of lifestyle changes is featured in two segments in the second half of the film. If you're a doctor, you can even receive continuing medical education credit by watching it. Medicare is now covering ""Dr. Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease"" after 16 years of review. This had bipartisan support. Why? Because these are human issues that affect all of us and transcend our polarized political process, enabling us to find common ground. For Republicans, this approach appeals to their core values of empowering the individual and taking personal responsibility. For Democrats, it appeals to their core values of making better health care available to more people at lower costs. It's a win-win situation. And the only side-effects are good ones.

"(CNN) -- Jazz great George Duke, a visionary keyboardist, producer, composer and arranger, has died in Los Angeles. He was 67. The Grammy-winning artist was known for blending jazz with rock, funk, R&B and Brazilian sounds, creating music that moved beyond boundaries. Over the course of his lengthy career, which spanned nearly 50 years, the prolific musician collaborated with notables such as Miles Davis, Michael Jackson, Anita Baker and Frank Zappa. According to a statement from his record label, Duke was being treated for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. ""We are all devastated by the sad news of George's passing,"" said Mark Wexler, general manager of the Concord-Telarc Label Group. ""He was a great man, a legendary, one-of-a-kind artist; and our hearts go out to his family. George will be missed by all."" A California native, Duke was inspired to play the piano after catching a Duke Ellington performance as a child. In 1997, he told USA Today he remembered ""seeing this guy in a white suit, playing this big thing, which I later found out was a piano. He had all these guys around him, and he was waving his hands conducting, and he spoke very intelligently and seemed to be having a good time. ... I told my mom, 'I want to be him.' That moment in time set the stage for me."" An alum of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and San Francisco State University, Duke would become renowned for his skills with the keyboard, and according to Rolling Stone magazine had released more than 40 albums. ""I was in a rock band, I played with a bunch of Brazilians, I played R&B with Parliament-Funkadelic and all of that,"" he said in an interview, according to the New York Times. ""I mean, I've done jazz with Miles Davis and Cannonball Adderley. It's a goulash. It's a gumbo."" His most recent album, ""DreamWeaver,"" was composed following the death of his wife, Corine. It was released on July 16, and debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Contemporary Jazz Chart, according to his record label. Several stars in the entertainment industry, from Quincy Jones to Janelle Monae, have mourned the loss of the jazz giant. ""Rest in Peace to my brother and collaborator George Duke,"" Jones tweeted. ""A great musician, a greater friend."" ""#GeorgeDuke merits the highest praise,"" added Questlove of The Roots. ""Frank Zappa (beyond genius Genius) loved & respected Duke. that means somethin.""

"London (CNN) -- Greece's banking sector is being snubbed by its European peers as the country's recession deepens. And even as immediate fears about the country's exit from the eurozone fade on the latest austerity deal, the impact on Greece's banking sector -- deeply intertwined with the fate of the country itself -- will be long-lasting.

Piraeus Bank, the country's fourth-largest bank, last month bought Geniki Bank from French bank Societe Generale. The sale price was 1 million euro, with Societe Generale also committing to expenditure of 444 million euros through an advance to Geniki and a subscription to a Piraeus Bank bond.

French bank Credit Agricole also offloaded its Greek subsidiary, Emporiki, to Alpha Bank at a loss of 1.96 billion euros in October, a deal that then contributed to its third-quarter loss of 2.85 billion euros. Alex Manos, managing director of Piraeus Bank, said banks' departures from Greece were driven by shareholder pressures. He told CNN: ""They want out and want some quiet time, and will reconsider their options."" Read more: Euro crisis: Should I cancel my vacation?

"(CNN) -- Condemned for his self-confessed belief in fascist ideals, yet congratulated for acts of admirable sportsmanship. Revered for feats of amazing skill, but reviled for violent outbursts on the pitch. Perhaps not surprisingly Italian Paolo di Canio's rollercoaster career has guaranteed the Italian has occupied the front and back pages of British newspapers since he first came to the United Kingdom. His appointment as manager of English Premier League strugglers Sunderland has thrust this divisive character back into the spotlight once more, with the north east club scrambling to justify his appointment following its sacking of the Italian's predecessor Martin O'Neill on Saturday. The Italian's arrival at Sunderland has already prompted the resignation of one of the club's board members -- MP David Miliband, who recently decided to stand down as MP to work for New York based charity International Rescue. ""In the light of the new manager's past political statements, I think it right to step down, "" Miliband, a former British secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs for the traditionally left wing Labour party, wrote on his own website. Fiery temperament . Born in Rome and raised through Lazio's youth ranks, the first half of Di Canio's career included stints with some of Europe's most famous clubs -- and plenty of rows with some of Italy's most respected coaches. The playmaker clashed with Giovanni Trapattoni at Juventus before incurring the ire of Fabio Capello at AC Milan and then heading to Scotland in 1996 where he flourished during one season with Celtic. If there was fire in his belly it was accompanied by sublime skill. When he was at Napoli Di Canio scored one breathtaking solo goal against AC Milan, running almost the length of the pitch before firing home. It was after swapping Scotland for the English Premier League's Sheffield Wednesday in 1997 that the complexity of Di Canio's character was laid bare. The Roman became front page news in September 1998 when he shoved referee Paul Alcock to the ground after being sent off in a match against Arsenal. An 11-match ban followed, as did his exit from Wednesday with a move to West Ham United just four months later. During four years at Upton Park, Di Canio left an indelible mark on West Ham and the Premier League. In March 2000 he scored a stunning volley against Wimbledon -- widely regarded as one of the finest goals in Premier League history -- but it was his conduct in a game at Everton in December of the same year which drew global admiration. With Everton goalkeeper Paul Gerrard lying on the ground injured, Di Canio elected to catch the ball rather than head it into the unguarded net. His actions were met with immediate applause from fans and a Fair Play award from world football's governing body FIFA, citing a ""special act of good sportsmanship"". ""It was sportsmanship of the highest merit,"" Harry Redknapp, West Ham manager at the time, said of Di Canio's act. ""Paolo thought the goalkeeper might have a broken leg and refused to take advantage."" Values of civility . But with Di Canio, the good and the bad must be measured against the ugly. After returning to Lazio in 2004, Di Canio made remarks which he has refused to clarify following his appointment at Sunderland. ""I am a facist, not a racist,"" Di Canio once told an Italian news agency. Since his appointment at Sunderland, Di Canio has insisted that he doesn' want to talk about politics, though in 2005 he was willing to aim a straight-arm salute at Lazio's fans which, he claimed, was directed at ""my people"". Was that a political or just a sporting gesture? ""I will always salute as I did because it gives me a sense of belonging to my people,"" Di Canio told journalist Gabrielle Marcotti in the player's autobiography. ""I saluted my people with what for me is a sign of belonging to a group that holds true values, values of civility against the standardization that this society imposes upon us."" Who Di Canio's people are is the subject of much debate, but in his autobiography he described himself as ""fascinated"" with Italy's former fascist leader Benito Mussolini, who enacted anti-Semitic laws and oversaw the deporting of thousands of Italian Jews to concentration and death camps. Di Canio is not the only Italian footballer or manager to express sympathy with Fascism or flirted with the ideology, notably Daniele De Rossi, Christian Abbiati, Gianluigi Buffon and Alberto Aquilani. As a club, Lazio has been punished for racism offences four times this season. A statement issued by Sunderland following Di Canio's appointment declared that to suggest he held fascist or racist views was to question ""the integrity of the club"". ""I'm not in the Houses of Parliament, I'm not a political person, I will only talk about football,"" the 44-year-old manager told reporters at his unveiling on Tuesday. While Di Canio faces scrutiny off the pitch, on it his new team are sinking without a trace. Sunderland are without a win in their last eight matches, with Saturday's 1-0 defeat to Manchester United -- the final act of O'Neill's managerial reign -- leaving the team one point above the relegation zone. As always, Di Canio plans to meet his latest challenge head on. ""The press call me the mad Italian but I would confidently bet everything I have on Sunderland remaining in the top flight,"" declared Di Canio. Over to you, Paolo...","Sunderland defend appointment of new manager Paolo di Canio .
Italian is proud of his fascist beliefs and is an admirer of Benito Mussolini .
""I'm not in the Houses of Parliament, I'm not a political person, I will only talk about football,"" says Di Canio.

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid's dismal start to the La Liga season continued on Saturday as the reigning champions slumped to a 1-0 against Sevilla at the Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. German international Piotr Trochowski scored the only goal of the game in the second minute to lift Sevilla to third in the table with eight points and leave Madrid languishing in 10th with four -- their worst start to a season since 2001-02. Cristiano Ronaldo's attempts to get Madrid back in level terms were thwarted by Andres Palop in Sevilla's goal before the break and Jose Mourinho's double substitution at halftime -- new signing Luka Modric and Karim Benzema replacing Angel Di Maria and Mesut Ozil -- made little impact. ""Right now I have no team. We are a team without concentration. At halftime, I changed two players and wanted to change six,"" Mourinho said. To make matters worse, arch rivals Barcelona recorded their fourth straight win of the season on Saturday -- running out 4-1 winners against Getafe -- to open up a gap of eight points over Real. Brazilian full-back Adriano opened the scoring for Barca in the 32nd minute before Messi, who came on as a substitute in the 59th minute, bagged two goals in the final quarter of the match. The first came from the penalty spot in the 74th minute -- after Pedro had been brought down by defender Juan Valera -- before he side-footed a second goal four minutes later. David Villa -- who also came on as a substitute -- rounded off a resounding win for Tito Vilanova's men with a injury-time strike. The only downside was the early departure of Carlos Puyol, who limped off in the 57th minute. ""The most important thing is we have 12 points from 12, we tried to control the game and we could have scored a few more. We'll see tomorrow how long Puyol will be out, it's a problem, he gives us a lot of organisation at the back and is very important for us,""Vilanova said. In Saturday's other fixtures, Malaga are up to second after beating Levante 3-1 while Valencia recorded their first win of the season with a 2-1 win against Celta Vigo.","Real Madrid record worst start to La Liga season in over a decade .

"(CNN) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said Saturday he is committed to resolving the crisis in his country as long as peace efforts are conducted in ""neutrality and independence,"" state media reported. He addressed the conflict during a meeting in Damascus with Lakhdar Brahimi, the new international envoy to Syria. ""The success of the political work is linked to pressing the countries which fund and train the terrorists, confiscate weapons into Syria to stop such acts,"" the president said, according to SANA. Brahimi, who recently replaced Kofi Annan as the U.N. and Arab League point man for the conflict, highlighted the need for both sides to find a resolution and reiterated that the Syrian people are his first priority. ""I believe that the president is more aware than me of the scope and seriousness of this crisis,"" Brahimi said after his meeting with al-Assad. U.N. envoy Angelina Jolie visits Syria refugees in Iraq . For now, Brahimi said he has no plan for bringing an end to the Syrian conflict. ""We, however, will set the plan that we will follow after listening to all internal, regional and international parties, hoping that such a plan will manage to open channels towards ending the crisis, and will be also accompanied by a clear strategy,"" he said. Brahimi plans to open an office in Damascus, and al-Assad told him the government will enable him to carry out his duties. The initial talks came on a day when at least 164 people were killed across Syria, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees. It blamed Syrian security forces for the deaths. Brahimi also held ""candid and comprehensive"" talks with Foreign Minister Walid Moallem, the United Nations said in a statement. ""Mr. Brahimi emphasized that, as he said before, he would spare no effort to help find a solution to the crisis,"" the statement read. ""His only masters in this endeavor were the Syrian people, whose welfare and security were his prime concern."" Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister and U.N. envoy to Afghanistan, plans to meet opposition figures and other groups during his visit.

"(CNN) -- A pair of blasts in Lebanon, the magnitude of which have not been seen since the 1980s, is raising fears of heightening sectarian tensions. The two powerful explosions ripped through neighborhoods near mosques in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli on Friday. At least 27 people died and 600 were wounded in the bombings, Lebanese Red Cross head George Kettanah said. State media reported that the toll could be much higher. The death toll of these explosions is high compared with the political assassinations that have occurred in the past eight years in Lebanon, but the bigger fear is that civilians could become targets anywhere in the country. While the motive for the attacks was unclear, the state-run National News Agency said they appeared to target mosques run by imams with ties to Syrian rebels. Lebanon has been the scene of increasing sectarian violence recently, including battles between supporters and opponents of the regime in Lebanon's neighbor to the east, which is currently torn by a bloody civil war. Interactive map: Syrian civil war isn't just about Syria . The first blast occurred near the Sunni al Taqwa mosque, the National News Agency said. The second occurred minutes later near al Salam mosque, another Sunni mosque that is close to the residence of acting Prime Minister Najib Mikati, as well as Samir Al-Jisr, a Sunni member of parliament, and the former head of the country's Internal Security Forces, Ashraf Rifi. Rifi is despised by Hezbollah and Lebanese politicians friendly to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. It was unclear whether any of those figures were targets of the attack, but the news agency said the mosques' two Salafist sheikhs were unharmed. Mikati is not in Tripoli, the National News Agency reported. The second blast produced a crater 5 meters (16.4 feet) across and damaged six nearby residential buildings, the news agency said. More than 60 cars were incinerated, the news agency said. Eyewitness video posted to YouTube purporting to be of the al Taqwa blast showed thick smoke, flames and what appeared to be burning vehicles. Another video posted to Facebook showed a large plume of smoke rising into the air near what is said to be the mosque site. CNN could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the videos. Mikati issued a statement via Twitter condemning the bombings. ""We urge our children and brothers in Tripoli to practice self-restraint, and we pledge to them that we will always stand by them, especially during these critical times,"" he said. ""Tripoli and its residents he will prove once again that they are stronger than the conspiracy and will not allow the strife to undermine their resilience and their faith in God and the homeland,"" the acting prime minister tweeted. Tammam Salam, the man designated to become Lebanon's next prime minister, cut short a private trip to Greece after the explosions. ""The crime of Tripoli is further evidence that the situation in Lebanon reached a very critical stage and requires us to be on high alert on the political, national and security levels in order to eradicate the internal strife, and we have to deal with the political decisions in the country with the highest degree of national responsibility,"" he said in a prepared statement. The U.S. Embassy in Beirut also condemned the violence and called on Twitter for ""calm & restraint."" Hezbollah also condemned the attacks, saying in a statement that the explosions were part of a ""criminal scheme aimed at sowing seeds of strife among the Lebanese."" Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite group, is active in southern Lebanon and has been sending its fighters to Syria to help the government there. A car bombing in a southern suburb of Beirut this month rocked a Hezbollah stronghold, killing at least 22 people and injuring hundreds. CNN's Nada Husseini contributed to this report.","At least 27 dead, 600 wounded in blasts, official says .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- For anyone who wants to make a serious play for the Latino vote -- and not just go through the motions -- here's what you need to know: Latinos are single-issue voters. The issue is respect. Or, as we say, respeto. Nothing else matters. If you want the votes of Latinos, show some respect. Or we'll show you the door. I know what you're thinking. What's so special about this constituency? Three things: Size, geography and unpredictability. In 2008, about 10 million Latinos voted; the 2012 figure could be higher. Latinos are well represented in ""battleground"" states (i.e. Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico). And, in the case of the Mexicans and Mexican-Americans who make up about 66% of the U.S. Latino population, they're in play because they have shown a willingness to vote for moderate Republicans even though most are registered Democrats. Polls show that Latinos are just like other voters in that they care about education, jobs, the economy and health care. But their antennae go up when they see politicians using the immigration issue to scare up votes -- and, in the process, treating them like piÃ±atas. That is disrespectful. And while neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney has gone that far, there is still a problem. Neither of these candidates seems to respect Latinos, as evidenced by their cynical attempts to manipulate the immigration issue and take gimmicky shortcuts to get Latino support. This is why both are having trouble with Latino voters. ""Trouble"" is defined differently for each candidate. In polls, Romney is having trouble getting as much as 30% of the Latino vote. Political observers note that a Republican presidential hopeful needs at least 35% to win. Obama has more than twice that level of support but his problem is that there's an enthusiasm gap and, if Latinos don't turn out for Obama, Romney will win. Romney took a wrong turn when he lurched to the right in the Republican primaries to pander to the nativist wing of the party. He portrayed illegal immigrants as takers and usurpers of public benefits and giveaways. He knows better. He is well aware of the fact that illegal immigrants -- most of whom come from Latin American countries -- are lured here by jobs offered by U.S. employers. Romney should have learned this lesson when it came to his attention, during his stint as governor of Massachusetts, that he had hired a landscaping company that employed illegal immigrants. Romney claimed that he didn't know the workers tending to his lawn were in the country illegally. Nonetheless, the experience should have illustrated for him the law of supply and demand: Without a demand for illegal immigrants, there would be no supply. Obama is not much better. Raised in a black and white world, the president doesn't know much about Latinos. And he hasn't seemed all that interested in learning. Our most important institution is the family. One good way to get on our bad side is to divide hundreds of thousands of families by deporting more than 1.2 million people in three years. And when you accomplish that feat by roping local police into the enforcement of immigration law through a program like Secure Communities in ways that invite ethnic profiling, this isn't going to win you any friends among Latinos. Finally, when you get caught in the act and these things come to light, it's not a good idea to insist that most of the folks deported were criminals, when criminal activity has been cited as a reason for deportation in only 17% of the cases last year. So far, in 2012, that figure is down to 14%. Who makes up the rest? It's likely that the answer is gardeners, housekeepers and nannies who pose no threat to society. Naturally, neither Romney nor Obama wants to talk about immigration. When Romney spoke to a Latino business group recently, he talked about education but didn't say a word about the DREAM Act, which would give legal status to undocumented students who go to college or join the military. When administration officials recently invited a group of Latina bloggers to the White House, the main topics of discussion were education and health while immigration was conspicuously left off the agenda. Guess what? Immigration came up anyway, when the bloggers asked about it during the question and answer session. That's the thing about immigration. Unless it is dealt with head-on, it seeps into the discussion of other issues. It happened during the health care debate, when what consumed many conservatives was the question of whether illegal immigrants could access benefits under ""Obama-care."" Gentlemen, you can run but you can't hide. You have to talk about immigration. Until you clear the air, admit what you've done wrong, and try to make it right, you can't expect Latinos to listen to what you have to say on any other subject -- or if they do, to believe what they hear. Gov. Romney, stop pandering to racists and nativists in the GOP base by portraying illegal immigrants as takers; acknowledge that the only thing that lures them here are jobs provided by U.S. employers who need to be held accountable; stop proposing simplistic solutions like saying that all illegal immigrants should ""self-deport""; and take up the cause of American businesses who can't find U.S. workers to do jobs that immigrants wind up doing because parents are raising their kids to feel entitled to avoid hard work. President Obama, stop saying you don't have the executive power to stop deportations when it has been established by a slew of legal experts, including nearly 100 law professors who recently sent a memo to the White House, that you do. Stop deportations of college-age students who would have been eligible for legal status under the Dream Act and the parents of U.S.-born children; stop portraying Republicans as singlehandedly preventing immigration reform, and take your share of responsibility for not getting it done; and propose to Congress a specific plan for comprehensive immigration reform. Do all that, and we'll be able to get past immigration and move onto other topics. Jobs. The economy. Education. The environment. Whatever you want. But immigration comes first, because it lets us assess your character. Or lack thereof.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- It was about time. It was about time for CNN to broadcast a regular series on China -- a deeper, intelligent look from inside the country itself. And the interest is out there. Anyone who watched the second U.S. presidential debate this week between incumbent Barack Obama and Mitt Romney saw the China sparks fly both on air and online. So much so, Twitter's government and politics team pointed out that President Obama's barb to Romney, ""You're the last person to get tough on China,"" generated some 198,619 tweets per minute. It was the second-most tweeted moment of the debate. More: Full show times . There's been so much chatter about the Chinese trade advantage and even a so-called Chinese century. But on major Western TV news networks, there's been no regular programming on Chinese politics, industry and society. From ""Face the Nation"" to ""State of the Union,"" the U.S. has itself well covered with programming recorded from inside the Beltway. But what about a regular series on China broadcast from inside China's borders? ""On China"" is a new monthly show shot on location at the historic Hullett House in Hong Kong. In each 30-minute episode, I sit down with thought leaders from China as well as astute observers of this world power for a roundtable discussion about what's really driving the country. The topic may change month to month, but the goal will be the same -- to engage, inform, and ultimately narrow the gulf of misunderstanding about China. There are no quick-edit sound bites. No populist posturing. No swooshes. Just straight-up analysis and insight from some of the strongest China watchers out there. For the first episode, three unique voices joined me for a focus on the Chinese Communist Party ahead of China's rare leadership transition. They included leading publisher and influential blogger Hung Huang, former top official in the Chinese Foreign Ministry (and English interpreter for the late Deng Xiaoping) Victor Gao, and award-winning journalist and China commentator John Pomfret. On the structure of the Chinese Communist Party, Hung likened it to a company. Think: China Inc.. ""It's like a corporation,"" she told me. ""The board as the Politburo names the CEO, and then you have middle management which are the ministers and the various commissions, directors and so on. So, for me, it's really like a corporate town."" As for how Xi Jinping rose to the top as China's presumed next president, Victor Gao pointed to Xi's political pedigree as well as his military links. ""He had a very unique career path,"" said Gao. ""He literally has experience in four provinces and cities -- Hebei, Fujian, Zhejiang and Shanghai -- in addition to his extraordinary experience at the Central Military Commission."" ""In addition to that, when he was in a civilian position, Mr. Xi Jinping has kept his associations with the Chinese military through various ways -- serving in the reserved forces and taking up leadership of the provincial garrison. That sets him apart from all all the current civilian leaders in China."" John Pomfret said Gao's points about Xi's ties to the military are significant, as they have been largely ignored by the Western media. Pomfret also said Xi will come to power at a time of remarkable instability for the Party. ""We're entering a new period of uncharted waters, where China's facing an enormous amount of challenges -- challenges from very charismatic and populist figures like Bo Xilai, challenges from the bottom up from people demanding more predictability in their lives, a legal system that will protect their property, a good school for their kids, clean food for their children and clean air to breathe."" How the new leadership manages the Party's political fractures and the people's growing demands will be a gripping drama to watch unfold in the years ahead... and to cover on CNN's ""On China.""","China and its so-called trade advantage has even dominated the U.S. presidential debate .

"(CNN) -- Joss Whedon has picked one formidable villain for The Avengers team to battle in the sequel to last year's mega-grossing blockbuster. But sentient super-bot Ultron also presents a challenge for the film's screenwriter too: How to make a machine that can do just about anything into an interesting on-screen character. Joss Whedon on his past, present, and future (hint: 'Agents of SHIELD') Created by a scientist in the Marvel comics, Ultron is a self-aware robot who develops a lust for power. He has a laundry list of abilities â€” super-human strength, speed, stamina, durability, flight, mind control, a coma ray and a genius intellect. For ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" Whedon reveals to Entertainment Weekly in this week's cover story that he's stripping back some of Ultron's abilities and will find a way to humanize â€” to some degree â€” the angry bot. ""I knew right away what I wanted to do with him,"" Whedon says. ""He's always trying to destroy the Avengers, goddamn it, he's got a bee in his bonnet. He's not a happy guy, which means he's an interesting guy. He's got pain. And the way that manifests is not going to be standard robot stuff. So we'll take away some of those powers because at some point everybody becomes magic, and I already have someone [a new character, Scarlet Witch] who's a witch."" Whedon adds that he has to be careful ""to ground [the character] while still evoking that guy."" And like a certain giant green Avenger hero, it sounds like large doses of rage will be key to his personality. ""As a character I love [Ultron],"" Whedon says, ""because he's so pissed off.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- This wouldn't be L.A., folks, if there wasn't a manufactured drama behind the drama that's Carmaggedon. So, two CNN producers decided to hold a cross-town race (after all, they are a competitive bunch) and see who could finish first. One took a plane: A $4 flight under a special Carmaggedon deal offered by JetBlue Airways. The other drove a car. The distance was 37.3 miles -- by car -- between the airports of Burbank, California, and Long Beach, California. The obstacle to this CNN Great Race was potential gridlock from this weekend's closure of Interstate 405, due to an ongoing $1.2 billion expansion project. Which would win, car or plane? On a typical day, it would be a fair race, given Los Angeles' notoriously clogged highways. But on Saturday, the ""Carmaggedon"" yielded to a ""Carmaheaven"" as motorists stayed home. That favored four wheels over two wings. The automobile beat the airplane by 47 minutes. In fact, the producer who drove the car was returning home by the time the plane arrived. ""This went so smoothly, you can't believe it,"" Paul Vercammen reported from behind the wheel. His time: ""54 minutes in an absolute piece of cake."" And that included time lost on taking a wrong ramp, getting some water and messing with camera equipment, he said. ""I would say that if traffic was like this all the time, people would be happy to take such adventures on a Friday,"" he added. While the car may have been king on this day, the airplane had the better party. ""Even though Paul won,"" said producer Lindy Hall, ""we are having more fun. I know it. There has been huge receptions at every gate. Tons of food. There's a convivial atmosphere everywhere."" And, she added: ""When's the last time you got a gift bag"" on a flight? Maybe one reason the plane lost was because it took the scenic route. ""We flew over the 405, and it was completely empty,"" Hall said. She added how passengers on the plane even had a bird's eye view of crews tearing down the Mulholland Drive bridge over the 405. Mulholland Drive is often featured in Hollywood films. The race began at 11:20 a.m. PT, because that's when Hall arrived at the Burbank's Bob Hope Airport, one hour before flight time. The sold-out Flight 405 (that number is correct) of JetBlue departed at 12:20 p.m. PT, for a trip lasting 45 minutes gate-to-gate, to Long Beach Airport. But Vercammen enjoyed a fast start, reporting from his vehicle that Los Angeles' highways were a ghost town, relatively speaking. ""I'm getting on the (Interstate) 5 freeway. I believe that most everyone has been intimidated by this Carmaggedon talk,"" Vercammen said at about 11:30 a.m. ""I don't know how fair this test is going to be,"" he added. Shortly after noon, Vercammen was victorious, easily defeating the airplane. His time was 54 minutes, compared with one hour 41 minutes for Hall. ""While I may be losing this battle, I'm having way more fun,"" Hall said from the plane shortly before takeoff, describing refreshments and a cake with a depiction of a car-choked 405. On the plane, passengers found on their seats a gift bag that included cookies saying ""405,"" chips and water. As a longtime Angeleno, Vercammen waxed poetically about the 405, a sentiment shared by many in town: ""I avoid the 405 like poison oak, or wild-eyed people you randomly meet on story shoots who want you to pitch their product. ""The 405 is a time bandit, a concrete thief that steals hours as you take agonizing drives in awful traffic."" But not today.","Two CNN producers race across Los Angeles during Carmaggedon .

"(CNN) -- Police pressed their case Friday against a Missouri man who, they say, tested positive for HIV in 2003, then had more than 300 sexual partners -- saying later he didn't tell them about his condition because of his ""fear of rejection."" Dexter, Missouri, police Det. Cory Mills said he filed a probable cause statement Friday for two more alleged victims who wish to seek charges against David Lee Mangum. This could lead to more counts against the 36-year-old Mangum, who is already facing a felony charge accusing him of exposing one of his former live-in partners to HIV. The scope of what happened and what's to come remains to be seen -- both in terms of the breadth of legal trouble Mangum will face and the hundreds of lives he might have forever altered, directly and indirectly. To the latter point, authorities in the rural southeastern Missouri county where Mangum lived are urging anyone with reason to suspect they could have been infected to stop their sexual activity and get tested. ""Due to the initial exposure containing 300 or more individuals over an extended period of time, each of which could themselves have multiple sexual partners, this situation should be a serious concern,"" Stoddard County Prosecuting Attorney Russell Oliver said in a statement. Oliver added it was especially important action be taken by anyone in the area who had met for a sex act through the Craigslist website's ""men seeking men"" section. That's how the victim said he first connected with Mangum in October 2012, according to a criminal complaint obtained Friday by CNN. The pair then had unprotected sex -- though only after the victim told police he ""specifically asked if (Mangum) had any disease and Mangum replied no,"" the document says. The next month, Mangum and the younger man moved in with each other. Except for a 16-day stretch in December, they remained live-in partners in Dexter, a city of about 8,000 people some 160 miles south of St. Louis, until June 2013. It was then the younger man, now 29, told police he ended the relationship ""because he discovered Mangum was cheating on him."" Sometime later, according to the complaint, that man got a call from a woman who had lived with Mangum in 2011. She told him that Mangum revealed to her he'd been HIV-positive since 2003. After that, the victim took a test at the Stoddard County Health Department that showed he also had the virus. The suspect confirmed he had tested positive in Texas to the victim and later to police, officials said. That diagnosis didn't stop Mangum from having hundreds of sexual partners -- including 15 to 20 instances of unprotected intercourse, sometimes involving a third man, with the victim tied to the charge issued this week -- according to the criminal complaint. The same day he talked with the victim, Dexter police detective Mills found Mangum, who agreed to be interviewed and waived his Miranda rights. The suspect confirmed what his former partner had said, saying he didn't tell those he had sex with about his HIV diagnosis because of ""fear of rejection,"" the complaint says. While authorities have tracked down some of Mangum's sexual partners -- 50 to 60 of whom lived in Stoddard County -- ""countless others remain unknown,"" Oliver said. Mills said the suspect may not be of much help, because Mangum ""usually only knew his partners' first names."" Many of them were in the Dallas area, where Mangum spent some time, according to the Dexter police detective. ""Mangum indicated all his sexual partners were white males,"" Mills noted. Knowingly exposing someone to HIV without their consent is a felony under Missouri law that can bring a prison term up to 15 years. Infecting someone can bring a life term. Mangum's bail was set at $250,000 during his arraignment Thursday in Stoddard County. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.","NEW: Police file probable cause statement on behalf of 2 more alleged victims .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- My first memory of anything to do with a U.S. presidential election lurks in the mists of my Athenian childhood. It was a warm June evening. My mother had taken me for a walk around the ancient stadium where the first modern-era Olympics were staged in 1896. Suddenly I saw her eyes fill with tears after hearing a newsboy screaming, at the top of his voice, that someone called Bobby Kennedy was dead. It was 1968, a year into the dark ages of our military dictatorship. I still recall her explanation of those tears: ""He was our last chance,"" she lamented. When in the months and years that followed members of my family were arrested by the secret police, when the streets of Athens caught fire following the student uprising of 1973, when, indeed, war broke out over Cyprus in 1974, it was not hard to imagine that our calamities must have had something to do with the fact that three well aimed bullets had kept a good man out of the White House. Jerusalem postcard: Mitt Romney walks fine line . It was 1976 again when a U.S. presidential campaign snuck into my then-teenage imagination. I recall my schoolmaster's enthusiasm for a certain Mr. Carter -- who would, in his estimation, put human rights on the map, impose an arms embargo on Turkey and, thus, reward the recently re-democratised Greece with the bargaining power it craved so as to reverse Cyprus' occupation, and thus liberate us Greeks from the need to spend an unseemly portion of our national income on defence. While the embargo was indeed introduced, it was not long before my schoolmaster and every other Greek I knew were deeply disappointed by the president from Georgia. Looking back, every U.S. election of that past few decades incited expectations amongst my fellow Greeks that were, quite quickly, dashed -- although this was more a reflection of our unrealistic expectations than on anything that occurred in Washington. Thankfully, this pattern seems to have been broken. Today, no one I know casts a longing eye on the White House. Even though Greece is needier than it has been for a long while, Greeks are not looking to Washington, D.C. for rays of hope. Havana postcard: Should U.S. raise fist to Cuba? If anything, Greek public opinion is wary of what might happen after the election is over, fearful that Germany and the European Central Bank may be delaying any attempt to amputate Greece from the eurozone until after the political dust has settled in the United States. My hunch is that Greeks have the impression that America no longer has either the interest or the capacity to influence our modus vivendi. They saw the contempt with which the inane European finance ministers treated Tim Geithner, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, in the fall of 2011, when he visited them in Poland to impart advice on how to address the euro crisis. From this and other sad incidents, Greeks have surmised that the U.S. no longer holds sway over our European destiny; at least not the way it used to. Delhi postcard: Why India longs for U.S. election . Where once we would intensely study every little sign coming from Washington for clues of what might befall or grace us, now the Greek antennae are trained anxiously toward Frankfurt, Berlin and Paris. While these lines are being written, my wife and I are preparing for our move to America; in effect, postmodern refugees from our hideous crisis. A job offer as chief economist for a video game company, and a visiting professorship at University of Texas, at Austin, plus an opportunity for my artist wife to work and exhibit in the West Coast, offered us escape pods from the misery of Greece, indeed from Europe's inanity. As we prepare, our friends, strangers who stop me in the street, waiters in restaurants, everyone asks us about America. And most have something to say about the presidential election. The Greeks I speak to would rather Mr. Obama won. But they do not fear a Mitt Romney administration. Interestingly, they tend to think of the U.S. as a country which, powerful as it may still be, is just as impotent in the face of the forces of global recession as we are. More: Get latest updates at CNN's Election HQ . And here lies the difference from the past: Athenians exhibit a new and unexpected form of national unity when discussing the U.S. election! Whereas in the past we were divided between Left and Right, between pro- and anti-Americans, nowadays America is being seen by almost everyone here as a kindred spirit; a nation that understands what the Greeks, the Irish, the Portuguese etc. are going through in the hands of a German-dominated austerian Europe; a continent that has lost its way. Greeks even seem to have developed a sophisticated feel about the divisions within the United States, between those struggling in the current recessionary climate and the notorious 1% who have never had it so good. And they can map these divisions onto the divisions that are burgeoning in Europe between the ""core"" and the '""periphery."" Paradoxically, it may be that the crash of 2008 simultaneously robbed America of much of its global authority and endowed my fellow Greeks with a better feel of the Americans' struggle to keep democracy alive in troubled economic times.","Greeks believe U.S. has no sway over Europe's economic crisis, says Varoufakis .

"London, England (CNN) -- As a style journalist for over ten years, I've made it my business to scour the world in search of fresh and innovative fashion. And since launching ARISE, I've honed my sights on Africa. The position has afforded me an unparalleled opportunity to travel around the continent meeting designers and going behind the scenes of what is fast becoming an influential and meaningful industry. Whereas previously Africa was only seen as a source of anthropological inspiration for international brands, now its homegrown talents are standing up and being counted too and riding the wave of interest in Africa's broader cultural and economic ascension. Established names such as Duro Olowu in London, Xuly BÃ«t in Paris, Kofi Ansah in Ghana, Jewel By Lisa in Lagos and Marianne Fassler in Johannesburg are inspiring younger talents while more and more African fashion weeks, magazines, websites, boutiques and schools are blossoming. I find it a hugely exciting field of fashion that is finally having its moment to shine. ""New African Fashion"" is a celebration of this moment. The coffee table book charts the long history and reverence of adornment on the continent, heralds African fashion's early pioneers and profiles the best designers, models and street style photographers prospering today. Here are five of my favorite. Gloria Wavamunno . ""I am in love with my continent right now,"" says Ugandan designer Gloria Wavamunno. ""My art is African and I am extremely proud of where I come from."" These sentiments are apparent in her autumn/winter 2011/12 collection entitled 'Not A Dream, My Soulmate.' Cute jackets made from Ugandan bark cloth are worn with full pleated skirts, hot pants and cropped trousers in shades of gold, black and blue. Debuted at London Fashion Week, the show also featured slogan T-shirts -- one was emblazoned with 'I'm Responsible For My Africa' while another had the words 'Live Aid' crossed out and the word 'Trade' printed underneath. Wavamunno was born in London in 1985, where her parents had relocated to in order to escape civil war back home but the family moved back to Uganda shortly after her birth as peace returned under President Yoweri Museveni. She studied fine art at the American Intercontinental University in London and interned at Ozwald Boateng before launching her label in Kampala in 2009 with her first collection called L.O.V.E. She's since opened a boutique, shown at African Fashion Week in Johannesburg. Maki Oh . With her label Maki Oh, Amaka Osakwe explores her thirst for African textiles to create intricately constructed, sensual pieces that simultaneously preserve and evolve traditional dress practices. She was brought up in Lagos, studied fashion at the Arts University College in Bournemouth, UK, and returned to Nigeria to launch her label with autumn/winter 2010/11's 'Everything In Proportion.' Sheer tops were embellished with a calabash jigsaw, voluminous shorts were made from adire (indigo-dyed patterned cloth), baggy trousers suggestive of men's agbada suits used antique aso-oke (loom woven fabric), and jersey dresses came covered in symbols suggestive of the intimate female form beneath. ""I wanted to make Nigerians aware of their own handmade fabrics which are infused with meanings that have been passed down through generations,"" she says. Web boutiques bring African fashion to world market . Black Coffee . Jacques van der Watt's highly conceptual brand, which values the form and functionality of clothing over the frivolity of trends, has for over a decade helped forge a contemporary identity for South African fashion. He studied both English and Japanese pattern-cutting techniques at Leggatts Design Academy (his graduate collection was all reversible) and worked as a costume designer before launching Black Coffee in 1998. ""At the time designer fashion was considered only for occasion wear. Black Coffee was part of the new guard,"" he says.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When Maia Stack returned to the pagoda, or tower, where she had been abandoned as a baby she was overwhelmed by what had happened there 11 years earlier. ""I remember thinking, 'Wow, I wonder if my birth family hid behind those bushes or something'"" said Stack, now 18 years old, on returning to Hangzhou, China. ""I felt very disengaged throughout the entire process. I kind of removed myself from the situation because it was too emotionally challenging."" Stack is one of tens of thousands of children -- 95% percent of whom are girls -- who have been adopted from China since its government ratified international adoption in 1992. In 1979, Chinese officials introduced the one-child policy requiring that couples have only one child to slow the country's massive population growth. Could China's one-child policy change? With only one chance to pass on the family name, many Chinese couples are unhappy having a girl and either abort the pregnancy or abandon the baby. Because of this, China is one of the easiest countries from which to do an international adoption, according to ACC, a U.S.-based adoption agency that specializes in China. The process takes around two years and costs between US$19,000 and $23,000. Many of those adoptees eventually visit China to experience their heritage first-hand. Being Chinese helped to define Stack's childhood growing up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She and her sister, who is also adopted from China, attended a Saturday school to learn Chinese language and culture while other children were playing soccer or baseball. Stack was home schooled until partway through high school and attended a group of students that never treated her differently. However, when she started attending a charter school where she was the only Asian in a group of 40 students things changed. ""I did feel much like an outsider. I had the darkest skin, the only head of black hair in a sea of blond and brown,"" she said. ""As the 'representative Asian,' the kids fed back to me the typical stereotypes about Asians -- super smart, good in math, short ... While they didn't mean harm, it did hurt."" Spending four-and-a-half months in Beijing in 2011 studying Mandarin changed her outlook. ""I feel very proud to be both Chinese and American,"" she said. ""I know that those things will always be a part of me whether I live in China or in America."" Today, Stack is a board member of China's Children International -- an organization founded by high school girls to bring together Chinese adoptees around the world. Amy Cubbage and her husband, Graham Troop, adopted their daughter June from China when she was two years old. After deciding they wanted children, the couple chose to adopt internationally because of the positive experience Cubbage's sister had adopting children from Russia. They applied for a non-special needs adoption in 2006, Cubbage said. But after nearly two years and no match, they put their names on the list for special needs children -- meaning the child requires some form of medical treatment. Finally in the fall of 2008, the couple was connected with June, who had been born with a cleft lip that has been repaired. As she grew older, June enjoyed attending Chinese cultural events so much that, at the age of five, she asked her parents if she could visit China. ""We were going to take her back eventually,"" said Troop, a librarian in Louisville, Kentucky. ""I was a little surprised because it was a little early, but we felt that if she was asking to go she must have a need to go."" The family made the trek to China last month visiting the Great Wall, Beijing's Tiananmen Square and June's orphanage in Guangxi province, among other sites. ""She was joyful the whole time,"" Cubbage, a lawyer, said of her daughter. ""It was clear that she had a large connection to the place."" Upon visiting with the foster family that tended to their daughter June's parents were overcome with emotion. ""We could see the love that they had on their faces for her and the sadness that they didn't have her anymore,"" Cubbage said. ""I know they are happy that she was adopted but it was easy to see that they were sad too."" Six-year-old June already shows a great deal of interest in her Chinese heritage, but it's not always easy to explain. ""She asks why her parents couldn't take care of her and we try and answer that as best as we can. It's hard,"" her father said. ""(Hearing about her adoption) is sort of a comfort to her. She likes to hear her story told."" The family plans to return to China regularly. ""The bottom line for us is that we chose to do an international adoption. She didn't. She didn't have any other choice,"" Cubbage said. ""So I feel as a mom it is my responsibility to teach her."" Jenna Murphy* and her husband are taking their five-year-old daughter to China in September -- something they decided before they even brought her home. ""We're doing it in stages. She won't go back to the province where she was born this time,"" Murphy said. ""We will just go to the major cities and the touristy, lovely places."" When they picked their daughter up from the orphanage, she was 10 months old and could barely sit up, but after bringing her home to Australia her development quickly improved. Murphy said she wants her daughter to have a positive opinion of her birth country despite the challenges she has already faced in life. ""I don't want her to think 'they didn't want me'... or for it to be even in the realm of possibility,"" Murphy said. ""I want her to see China as a good thing."" As for Stack, the high school senior said she wants to take a year off before college to volunteer in a Chinese orphanage. ""I'm so blessed to have been adopted,"" she said. ""I feel compelled to go back to China and volunteer and give back to the kids that weren't adopted."" *Name has been changed to protect her from South Australian law prohibiting adopted children from being identified in the media.","Thousands of girls are adopted out of China each year, ending up in homes around the world .

"(CNN) -- Rejection -- even repeated rejection -- doesn't have to mean defeat. That, it turns out, is the lasting lesson of the Chuck Ross story. You may recognize the name; two Sundays ago, I wrote about J.K. Rowling, the spectacularly successful author of the Harry Potter books, and about how she has published a detective novel under the name Robert Galbraith. In the column, I recalled what a young and frustrated writer -- Chuck Ross -- did in the 1970s. To briefly recap: Ross had written a mystery novel that had been turned down everywhere he sent it. So, as an experiment to see how the publishing business really worked, he retyped a National Book Award-winning novel -- ""Steps,"" by Jerzy Kosinski -- and submitted it to 14 major publishers and 13 top agents. But he didn't put a title on it, and he didn't put Kosinski's name on it. Every publisher and every agent turned it down. None recognized that they were rejecting a book that had already been a bestseller and had already won the National Book Award. So much for talent being judged on its own merit. A fine and funny tale, some 35 years ago. But what happened to Chuck Ross? ""When I was in my 20s, I had been selling cable television subscriptions door-to-door in Santa Monica, California,"" Ross told me the other day. He is 61 now. He had written his mystery novel in his spare time. ""I taught myself to touch-type,"" he said. What really bothered him about his mystery novel being turned down by every publisher to whom he sent it was not just that the various editors claimed not to like it -- but that they hadn't bothered to give it a thorough reading. How did he know that? He was a highly creative young writer; to set his manuscript apart from all the others that authors send in, he had thought up a gimmick. He had put a little seal on the last few pages of the manuscript -- the pages that were the payoff to his story. It was intended to be a clever enticement; when the editors at the publishing houses got to the end, they would remove the little seal to read the climax of the book. But when every publisher sent the manuscript back to him, with letters telling him why they didn't want his story, he noticed something: . The seals on the last few pages had not been broken. Not on any of the manuscripts. No one at the publishing houses had read the book all the way through, or even flipped to the end to see how Ross had wrapped up the story. ""Rather depressing,"" he told me the other day. That's when he got the idea to send Kosinski's prize-winning book in without Kosinski's name on it. He wanted to see if even a proven bestseller, without a well-known byline, would get a fair shake. He found out. The repeated rejection of that book, he said, didn't depress him the way the rejections of the mystery novel had: ""With the Kosinski book, it wasn't my work they were rejecting -- it was his."" (J.K. Rowling, in her younger days, probably could have identified with all of this. Her first Harry Potter manuscript was rejected by a number of publishers -- some reports say it was as many as a dozen -- before one house decided to take a chance on it.) I asked Chuck Ross: When the news of his Kosinski ploy got out and was widely publicized back in the '70s, did any of the publishers and agents salute his ingenuity, and offer to take another look at his own mystery novel? ""No."" Did they encourage him to send them future work? ""No."" But, despite that, Ross triumphed. ""I'm an optimistic guy,"" he said. ""I wake up on the sunny side of the bed."" He wrote a terrific piece about the Kosinski stunt for New West magazine, which at the time was very popular in California. The story got a good reception, and he received more assignments from the magazine. On the strength of that, he realized that he might be able to make a living as a writer. He was able to quit the door-to-door cable-subscription-selling job, and went on to staff writing and editing jobs at a series of publications. He worked for the Hollywood Reporter, served as a reporter on the television beat for the San Francisco Chronicle, went to Inside Media, became an editor and reporter for Advertising Age, was named editor of the trade publication Electronic Media, became that magazine's editor and publisher when it was renamed TV Week, and, when it went online-only, was named its managing director, the job he has today. In short, after those initial rejections -- both of his mystery novel and of the retyped Kosinski book -- he has managed to make a lifelong career out of the written word. Along the way, he got married and has four children. ""I have no regrets at all,"" he said. He never did have a book published; he's certain that the mystery novel he wrote in the '70s is stored in a box or trunk somewhere -- ""I don't throw things away"" -- but he hasn't seen it in years. It doesn't matter. He wanted to find a good life as a writer, and he did. And the initial turn-downs are what, in their own unexpected way, helped him to find it. ""Sometimes,"" he said, ""it takes a little luck."" And sometimes, things have a way of working out. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Chuck Ross became famous for stunt he pulled on publishing industry .

"Washington (CNN) -- The current Congress has worked just as many days as its legislative predecessors. It just has a lot less to show for it. According to a CNN analysis of congressional records that looked at bills that became law and the number of days lawmakers worked, members of the House have spent more than 150 days and Senate just over 140 days in session so far, comparable to previous Congresses at this point in the term. But of the thousands of measures introduced, only 132 passed both. About one-fifth of those measures were to approve official names for post offices. In the previous Congress, the House worked 286 days and the Senate worked 349 days. That Congress passed 383 bills, according to Library of Congress records. Each Congress spans a two-year cycle. The logjam means important pieces of legislation -- such the transportation funding bill and measures to address high student loan rates and, yes, even the budget -- haven't passed. It wasn't always this way. Leaders on both sides of the aisle point to the split nature of the current Congress -- with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats the Senate -- as the source of partisan showdowns that have further slowed legislative progress. However, the 107th Congress, which spanned 2001 and 2002, was a period in which the Senate majority changed three times while Republicans maintained control of the House. It was also a time of political unity after the 9/11 attacks. During that Congress, lawmakers enacted the No Child Left Behind Act, created the Department of Homeland Security and authorized the use of military force against Iraq among other pieces of legislation. In all, that Congress passed 377 measures. The 111th Congress in 2009 ""was exceedingly productive. It was a time of unified government,"" said Thomas Mann, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and co-author of ""It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism."" ""If you look at major legislation passed, it ranks with the most productive in modern history."" That year, the Democrat-controlled Congress passed the health care reform law. The controversial measure's passage ushered in a new era of tea party-backed Republican freshman and gave the GOP control of the 112th House in 2010. Those freshmen vowed to repeal the health care reform act and crack down on government waste and abuse. But in helping slow what they see as a runaway freight train of federal bills, they've also helped slow the pace of government, political experts say. Obama, Truman and the 'Do-Nothing' Congress . Take for example, last year's government shutdown battle over trimming the national debt. Tea party freshmen, true to their word, pushed hard against any compromise, demanding debt reductions only be offset by spending cuts, not revenue increases. ""The Republican majority in the House, it has been one of the least productive in modern history, not surprisingly,"" Mann said. There are also fewer measures being sent over to the respective chambers for votes. For example, during the politically split 107th Congress, the House sent the Senate 346 measures and the Senate sent the House 199. In this Congress, the House has so far sent the Senate 198 bills and the Senate has sent the House 58. The legislative year isn't over. They still have nearly six months left, minus any vacation days, the August recess and home-visit days. Congress has passed a number of measures extending federal funding as well as free-trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. But barring a mathematical miracle, it is unlikely this Congress will make up the legislative shortfall, especially during an election year when the focus is on campaigning and getting re-elected. Both parties are quick to assign blame for the legislative slowdown. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, recently called on House Speaker John Boehner to nix additional recesses, although some saw it as more of a political move. ""Instead of recessing yet again, the House should remain at work and pass critical legislation that will create jobs for the middle class that will actually be signed into law. Republicans must not run out the clock on the economy,"" Pelosi wrote Boehner in a letter. The House recessed anyway. CNN reached out to Boehner's office for comment, but the office referred questions to other representatives. Other Republicans have made similar complaints about Democrats. Could Congress go from bad to worse after election? Last month, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Democrats are ""irresponsible"" for failing to pass a budget. ""If you're looking for a simple, three-word description of the Democrat approach to the problems we face, it's this: duck and cover,"" McConnell said on a day of heated budget debate. At this point, the foot-dragging and finger-pointing is all about embarrassing the other party, Mann said. ""It is about generating blame for something, about trying to put the other side in a difficult political position.""","CNN analysis: Current Congress least productive of past few sessions so far .
Of the thousands of measures introduced, only 132 have passed both houses .
About one in five measures were to name post offices .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government is stepping up its involvement in the Syrian crisis after allegations of chemical weapons use -- with its top military official making plans to respond quickly, and its top diplomat reaching out to Syria's foreign minister and others in the wake of the report. On Saturday, a senior State Department official said that Secretary of State John Kerry had talked Thursday -- the day after the attack -- with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem. The purpose of the call was to make clear that if the Syrian government had nothing to hide, it should have allowed immediate access to the site -- rather than continuing to attack the area to block access and destroy evidence, the official said. Meanwhile, the U.S. military was busy in its own right. If claims that Syria used chemical weapons this week are true, a speedy response will be needed to prevent another such attack, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Friday. A senior Defense Department official has told CNN that military planners have updated Syrian target lists. And it was disclosed that a fourth U.S. ship armed with cruise missiles has arrived in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. A United Nations team is in Syria attempting to investigate a claim by the nation's rebels that a chemical weapons attack by President Bashar al-Assad's forces outside Damascus killed more than 1,300 people. Hagel addressed the issue aboard a military plane headed to Malaysia. ""We will determine at some point here very shortly what did happen,"" he said, according to an account posted on the Defense Department's website. ""If, in fact, this was a deliberate use and attack by the Syrian government on its own people using chemical weapons, there may be another attack coming,"" Hagel said. ""A very quick assessment of what happened and whatever appropriate response should be made."" Hagel said the American military was providing President Barack Obama ""with options for all contingencies, and that requires positioning our forces [and] positioning our assets to be able to carry out whatever options the president might choose."" He did not provide specifics on what the options were. Obama talked Saturday with British Prime Minister David Cameron about Syria, according to a White House statement. Together expressing ""grave concern"" about the chemical weapons reports, the two leaders will ""consult closely"" on the investigation into the incident as well as ""possible responses by the international community,"" according to the White House. Kerry also has been active, reaching out Saturday to Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal, Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby, a senior State Department official said. Earlier, in a CNN exclusive interview with ""New Day,"" Obama defended his decision not to intervene militarily in the Syrian conflict. But he predicted that American focus on the civil war would be necessary for the fighting to come to an end. ""I think it is fair to say that, as difficult as the problem is, this is something that is going to require America's attention and hopefully the entire international community's attention,"" Obama told CNN's Chris Cuomo. The president has said he does not anticipate using ground forces in Syria. Other military options could include airstrikes by fighter jets or cruise missiles. The Navy destroyer USS Ramage has arrived in the region, a defense official said late Friday. It was intended to replace the USS Mahan, but the Mahan will remain temporarily along with the USS Gravelly and USS Barry. All four are equipped with cruise missiles. So far, the president has authorized a limited amount of military hardware for the rebels in addition to logistical and humanitarian assistance. The senior Defense Department official who spoke to CNN said options for direct military action would include targeting al-Assad's capability to deliver chemical weapons. Target lists could include government buildings and military installations, the official said, but the military must have flexible plans to target forces and equipment which ""continue to move."" Sen. John McCain, an advocate for a more forceful U.S. response to the Syrian conflict, has suggested that American air power could take out runways and planes used by al-Assad's forces that he said are ""dominating the battlefields and the towns and the cities."" McCain also has advocated giving rebels anti-aircraft and anti-missile weapons to establish a ""no fly zone."" But administration officials have cautioned that some Syrian rebel factions have ties to al Qaeda terrorists. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said in a letter to a member of Congress this week that arming rebels requires ""choosing one among many sides."" ""It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor. Today, they are not,"" Dempsey wrote. Chris Lawrence reported from Washington. David Simpson reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Greg Botelho and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.","NEW: Secretary of State Kerry talks with Syria's foreign minister on chemical weapon claim .

"(CNN) -- With her decades-long dream of swimming from Cuba to Florida achieved, Diana Nyad is setting her sights on her next challenge. ""I am through with the ocean,"" she said on CNN's ""New Day"" Tuesday. ""Never going to be seasick again! See how happy I look?"" Still, she's off to do something few other people could or would. Nyad plans to swim for 48 hours in New York City. A special pool will be installed for the October 8-10 event, a fundraiser for people who lost their homes in Superstorm Sandy. ""Then we're going to take that pool to the Boston Marathon at the anniversary of that terror attack, and we're going to swim there to help those people recover,"" she said. After that, she'll travel to Moore, Oklahoma, which was ravaged by a massive tornado earlier this year. It's ""a nice pool with no waves, no jellyfish, no seasickness,"" Nyad joked.

Nyad's nearly 53-hour journey in her fifth attempt to cross what she calls ""a treacherous stretch of water"" ended in victory Monday. Her first effort was 35 years ago, when was in her 20s; now she's 64. After the previous attempts, people had emphasized to her that ""it's the journey, it's not the destination,"" she said Tuesday. ""It's all the self-discovery and the wonderful team. And I agree. But I'll tell you something: This time, the destination really brought me into a state of euphoria."" Not that she has instantly recovered from what the historic swim did to her. The waves were ""tough,"" and a special facial mask designed to protect her from jellyfish stings led her to ""take in a lot of saltwater,"" she said. ""I was very sick."" ""I'm a little beat up,"" she said. She has facial lacerations and effects of saltwater exposure inside her mouth. But ""the emotional high is wiping out any physical problem."" People told her that swimming from Cuba to Key West, Florida, was ""impossible,"" she says. People encouraged her to try friendlier waters, such as the Maldives or Guam. ""But Cuba was in my heart, and when I look at the map, that's what spoke to my imagination. So I didn't want to give up on it. And this time I got lucky."" ""The Gulf Stream was my friend, and usually it's not,"" she said. ""Usually you're out there going in circles, going east of the Bahamas. This time the Gulf Stream went north, right where I was going."" She was surrounded by a team of 35 people along the way ""working like a machine,"" Nyad said. Kayakers helped keep away sharks, and a jellyfish expert was in the water with her, scooping up jellyfish to keep them away from her.

At a news conference later Tuesday morning, a relaxed Nyad thanked her team and joked as she recounted her swim. On Sunday night, she said, she hallucinated she was seeing the Taj Mahal. Recalling a previous attempt, she talked about hallucinating while looking at a streamer of lights that was meant to show her where her support boat was so that she'd know in what direction to swim at night. She remembers telling Stoll, from the water, that she saw people walking on a yellow brick road, singing ""Heigh-Ho."" Stoll responded, ""That's where you're going; follow them."" Nyad said, drawing laughter. The people who have followed her efforts closely for years ""aren't sports hounds,"" she told CNN. ""... They're human beings who are dealing with their own heartaches and their own obstacles in life, and they want to know how to get through."" Nyad said she represents a commitment never to give up on something ""important to your heart -- you look and see what's inside yourself and you find a way."" And her age speaks to baby boomers, she said. ""I think people are looking to me to say, 'Hell no, I'm not old.' ""When I'm 90 I'll get in a rocking chair, look at the sunset.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Afghanistan battle that resulted in a rare fatality for a classified Army unit pitted U.S. troops against waves of insurgents who attacked from bunkers and caves, a U.S. military official said Wednesday. American forces had to be reinforced several times during the two-day firefight in southeast Afghanistan's Paktika province, said the official, who declined to be named because he was discussing the Army's Special Operations Command. The sole U.S. fatality in the attack was Army Master Sgt. Benjamin A. Stevenson, a highly decorated member of one of the Army's special mission units. The death in combat of a soldier from one of these highly trained units is rare, with the last occurring nearly a year ago, the official said. The classified units are sometimes publicly referred to as Delta Force, the Army equivalent of the Navy SEAL team that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in May. In the Paktika raid, U.S. and Afghan troops attacked an insurgent encampment under cover of darkness last week, killing nearly 80 foreign fighters -- mostly Arabs and Chechens brought into Afghanistan from Pakistan, the military official said. But as they searched the site in the daylight, they were attacked by two more waves of insurgents who came out from underground bunkers and caves. Additional U.S. forces were called in several times as reinforcements as the firefight stretched on. Get latest news at Afghanistan Crossroads blog . Stevenson, 36, from Canyon Lake, Texas, was on his 10th tour of duty in the war zones of Afghanistan and Iraq when he was killed Thursday. The military official said he died shortly after being evacuated from the battlefield, but the Pentagon has disclosed no other details. The story behind his death offered a rare glimpse into the work of U.S. special operations units. The target of last week's raid was a camp full of fighters from the so-called Haqqani network, which is responsible for many recent attacks in Afghanistan and is closely tied to al Qaeda. The presence of so many foreign fighters among an insurgent group that typically relies on local Afghan and Pakistani populations for manpower is a worrisome trend, according to a second U.S. military official. ""This is how they are expanding their capabilities,"" the official said.","Afghan insurgents struck from caves and bunkers in the 2-day battle .

"(EW.com) -- Yes, you read that headline right. We now have proof that Marilyn Monroe was the sexiest woman to ever walk the earth: More than 50 years after her death, people are still willing to spend money on her facial X-rays, which are being auctioned off at Julien's Auctions. According to Vanity Fair, six facial X-rays of Monroe's have surfaced. Dated June 7, 1962, they hit just one week after her 36th birthday and two months before her death. So why was she getting X-rays? Monroe had complained of ""tenderness"" in her nose, so she was taken to see plastic surgeon Michael Gurdin.

"(CNN) -- A Spanish pathologist who specialized in a human strain of mad cow disease died Saturday, and officials suspect the disease played a role in his death, officials said. The doctor was head of the anatomy pathology section at the University Hospital Principe de Asturias in Alcala de Henares, outside of Madrid, according to the Madrid regional government's health office. He died Saturday night, at the hospital where he worked, officials said. The doctor's name was not released at the request of his family. Several samples have been sent off for testing, the office said, but results are expected to take a month. The doctor was well known both in and outside Spain for his work in the pathology field. His speciality was the human strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It is not known how the doctor might have contracted the disease, but the health office said it was not thought to be through ingestion of contaminated meat. Authorities are investigating whether the doctor had been exposed to contaminated human tissue through his work. Since 2001, 702 Creutzfeldt-Jakob cases have been reported in Spain, of which 87 have been reported in Madrid. Five people have died.","Spanish pathologist was specialist in human strain of mad cow disease .

"(CNN) -- A suspect has been named in the October 2 beating of a blind man, the Philadelphia Police Department said Friday. Mustafa Guyton, 29, is accused of aggravated assault after he allegedly kicked and stomped the 33-year-old man in Philadelphia's Southwest Germantown neighborhood, a police news release says. The assault was caught by a surveillance camera, and the Philadelphia Police Department said they released the video in an effort to identify the suspect. The victim was walking down the street around noon on October 2 when the attacker looked in his direction, police said. The grainy video shows the attacker laying down his backpack near a corner shop after he spots the victim. The video goes black, and in the next moment, the victim is pushed to the ground and then repeatedly punched, stomped and kicked as witnesses watch. One man is crosses the street mere steps from the beating, and continues walking. After the attacker finishes, he picks up his backpack and walks away, leaving the victim helpless on the ground with injuries to his head and face, police said. Officer Tanya Little, a Philadelphia police spokeswoman, said it was not clear whether the attacker knew the victim was blind. The victim told police he did not recognize his attacker's voice.","Mustafa Guyton, 29, is accused of aggravated assault .

"(CNN) -- A California jury on Thursday rejected claims that Toyota was responsible for the death of a woman in a 2009 crash that resulted from a sudden and uncontrollable acceleration of one of its cars. The Los Angeles Superior Court jury returned the verdict after more than four days of deliberations. The case was one of a large number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts against the automaker over claims of unintended acceleration in its vehicles. ""We are gratified that the jury concluded the design of the 2006 Camry did not contribute to this unfortunate accident, affirming the same conclusion we reached after more than three years of careful investigation -- that there was nothing wrong with the vehicle at issue in this case,"" Toyota said in a statement posted on its website. Calling the case a ""bellwether,"" Toyota said it believes the verdict also set a ""significant benchmark"" that its vehicles are safe with or without a brake override system. The family of driver Noriko Uno says that she was driving her 2006 Toyota Camry in Upland, California, when it suddenly and unexpectedly accelerated to more than 100 mph despite her pressing the brake pedal. The car eventually struck a telephone pole. Toyota maintained throughout the trial there was no defect, and that Uno's car was equipped with a state-of-the-art braking system. The automaker has long maintained that claims about its vehicles' unintended acceleration are ""wholly unsubstantiated."" The controversy has already proved costly for Toyota. The company announced in December it would take a charge of more than $1 billion to settle claims from drivers who say their vehicles lost value as a result of the alleged acceleration problems. Toyota said at the time that it settled simply to bring an end to the litigation, and denied wrongdoing. Toyota was forced to recall more than 8 million vehicles in 2009 and 2010 because of gas-pedal-related issues. Of that total, 5.8 million were flagged over the potential for their accelerator pedals to become stuck in floor mats. Some 4.5 million were recalled because of the potential for their gas pedals, after wear, to become sticky. More than 2 million vehicles were subject to both recalls. Uno's 2006 Camry was not subject to these recalls, though her family's suit claimed her model was also defective, and that Toyota failed to include a brake override system to guard against sudden and unexpected acceleration. CNN's Karan Olson contributed to this report.","Jury returns verdict after more than four days of deliberation .

"(CNN) -- Sorry, Edward Cullen. Catch you later, Damon Salvatore. And all of you Walkers can take a hike. After several years of success with vampires, zombies and (to a lesser extent) werewolves, Hollywood now can't seem to get enough of witches. Lifetime debuted its high-profile series ""Witches of East End"" on Sunday night, and tonight comes the premiere of the third season of ""American Horror Story,"" also focusing on witchcraft, subtitled ""Coven."" On the big screen this year, Mila Kunis, Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz bewitched James Franco in the smash hit movie ""Oz the Great and Powerful."" Even the CW's much-hyped ""Vampire Diaries"" spinoff, ""The Originals,"" focuses on spell-casters in a big way. And this is all taking place while there is a Halloween season surge in popularity for Disney's ""Hocus Pocus,"" celebrating its 20th anniversary. What's behind this interest in witchcraft on the big and small screens, right as we approach the 50th anniversary of ""Bewitched,"" no less? ""Witchy women with magical mysterious powers suggest a wealth of storylines,"" said TV critic Ed Bark. ""And since 'Bewitched,' witches have seldom been entirely out of the TV mix. It also helps, of course, if you're a comely, voluptuous witch. Haggard Wicked Witches from the old-school 'Wizard of Oz' mold need not apply."" Bark recalled a line from ""Witches of East End"": ""You only have one superpower, and it's your breasts."" Allison Keene of the Hollywood Reporter noted that Hollywood's modern witches all tend to be uniformly attractive as well. ""The current female witches on TV (there are no high-profile male wizards or warlocks, like a Harry Potter figure) are also really sexy,"" she said. ""So, maybe they're a kind of gendered response to the suave, seductive male vampire figure. Or maybe it's just cyclical, and all of the childhood fans of 'Hocus Pocus,' 'Sabrina the Teenage Witch' and 'Charmed' are writing for TV now!"" Keene thinks it's a positive trend overall. ""Vampires, zombies and werewolves have all gotten so much attention lately, I think we're definitely reaching a saturation point,"" she said. ""The featured supernatural characters on those shows are usually men, too (not exclusively, but overwhelmingly). These new witch characters are giving women more power and agency to control their destinies, instead of just being objects of desire in need of saving, which is a nice change.""","Witches seem to be the latest trend to take Hollywood by storm .

"(The Frisky) -- Surprise! Before she became Rachel Green, Jennifer Aniston was apparently being courted to be a cast member on ""Saturday Night Live."" On ""Oprah,"" Adam Sandler -- Jennifer's co-star in ""Just Go With It"" -- recalls hoping that he would be spending every Saturday night with Jennifer. ""We wanted Aniston to be on the show with us,"" he said. ""I remember being on the ninth floor where Lorne Michaels' office was, and seeing Jen come in. I was like, 'Oh my God, there's Aniston. Is she about to be on our show?' "" But no, apparently she was worried about ""SNL"" being a ""boys' club"" and so opted to go with ""Friends."" Adam was shocked; ""She said no? She's gonna do that 'Friends'? What is 'Friends?' "" And thus, a million haircuts were launched. When it comes to iconic movies and TV show characters, it seems like the role could only have gone to one person. But the truth is that casting decisions are constantly in flux, depending on who studios want, what actors' commitment schedules look like, and what price they demand. For example, did you know that Jennifer was also considered for Roxie Hart in ""Chicago""? And to play Rose in ""Titanic""? We found a few more casting close calls that would have set some very big stars' lives careening in other directions. The Frisky: 10 super sexy Superbowl spots . 1. Will Smith said ""no"" to ""Neo"" Will Smith was apparently a little uneasy about being a sci-fi star. Initially, he passed on his role in 1997's ""Men in Black"" -- until Jada Pinkett Smith talked some sense into him. Soon after, he was courted for a much more mind-bending thriller: ""The Matrix."" That's right-he was the first choice to play Neo and only when he passed did it go to Keanu Reeves. But Will is happy about how things turned out. ""I would have absolutely messed up 'The Matrix,' "" he said. ""At that point I wasn't smart enough as an actor to let the movie be -- whereas Keanu was."" Instead, Will did ""Wild Wild West."" Oops. 2. Sean Connery lost his ""Lord of The Rings"" paycheck . Speaking of ""The Matrix,"" the original choice to play Morpheus was Sean Connery. Sean, however, turned the role down and Laurence Fishburne eventually got the part. Having apparently not learned anything, Sean also turned down the role of Gandalf in ""The Lord of The Ring"" trilogy because he ""didn't understand the script."" New Line Cinema had supposedly offered him up to 15 percent of the box office take worldwide, which means this was a $400 million mistake. The Frisky: 15 ""what we're they thinking"" ugly tattoos on celebrities . 3. Claire Danes won her star role by being ""awkward"" Claire Danes was so, so perfect as Angela Chase in ""My So-Called Life."" But Alicia Silverstone came very close to being given the role. Producer Marshall Herskovitz explains, ""We had someone looking for us in New York and she said, 'There are two people you should see. They're really special.' The first was Alicia, who was 16 and emancipated. Ed wanted her, and I said, 'This girl is absolutely beautiful, but the Angela I see shivers back and forth between being beautiful and being really -- I mean, Alicia, you know, this is a girl who has been told she's beautiful since she's 5 years old! I just don't think Angela's that girl.' Then in walks Claire Danes. And at 13, you know: From one angle, she's breathtaking; from another, she's awkward."" If Alicia had been cast, ""Clueless"" may not have been nearly as brilliant. But then again, ""My So-Called Life"" might have lasted for more than a single season. 4. Sarah Michelle Gellar could have been ""Clueless"" But ""Clueless."" Guess who was originally wanted to play Cher? Sarah Michelle Gellar. She had to turn it down because of her contract on ""All My Children."" Now to bring things full circle, Sarah was also originally offered the role of Juliet in Baz Luhrman's ""Romeo + Juliet"" and again had to pass because of ""All My Children."" The role, of course, went to Claire Danes. The Frisky: Best and worst cleavage at the 2011 SAG Awards . 5. Eric Stolz changed Michael J. Fox's future . Everyone remembers Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly in the classic Delorean time machine tale, ""Back to the Future."" But, he was not Robert Zemeckis and Steven Speilberg's original choice for the movie. In fact, they filmed for five weeks with Eric Stolz in the lead role and decided to start over again because something wasn't quite clicking. 6. Harrison Ford owes Al Pacino a mini-muffin basket . Harrison Ford has Al Pacino to thank for his career. Al was the originally slated to play Han Solo in ""Star Wars,"" but turned down the offer. Only then did Harrison get a chance. Harrison evidently won again in 1981 when Tom Selleck turned down the role of Indiana Jones in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Just imagine-Indiana Jones might have had a serious moustache. The Frisky: Megan Fox as Steve Buscemi? 8 stars confess who they look like . 7. Sandra Bullock claimed Julia's Oscar opp . Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for her role in ""The Blind Side."" But apparently, the role was originally offered to Julia Roberts. In an alternate universe, Julia Roberts won her second Oscar for the film and got divorced thanks to the evil Oscar Curse, while Sandra is making rom-coms and is still married to Jesse James. 8. ""Pretty Woman"" Julia Roberts was second choice . Speaking of Julia Roberts, I can still picture her laughing in that red dress in ""Pretty Woman."" Studio execs, however, had another lady in mind to play the classic hooker with a heart of gold. Michelle Pfeiffer apparently turned down the role because she wasn't feeling the ""tone of the script."" The Frisky: 10 celebrity moms who love breastfeeding . 9. ""Sopranos"" star lucked out .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A car bomb exploded outside the Swedish consulate in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi on Friday morning, damaging the consulate but injuring no one, the office's chief told CNN. The bomb detonated around 11:30 a.m. Surveillance video shows a driver parking the vehicle near the consulate's front gate and then leaving the car before the blast, consular chief Anders Nilsson said. No one has claimed responsibility, he said. Nilsson said he was in an apartment at the back of the building when he heard the blast. A ""hail of glass flew through the building,"" he said. The building's front is ""entirely black,"" and all the apartment's windows and doors are ""blown out,"" according to Nilsson. ""We found a hubcap belonging to the vehicle inside the consulate,"" he said. Eight people live in the consulate, which is now closed because of the explosion. The eight will remain elsewhere in Benghazi, Nilsson said.","A car was parked in front of the gate; the driver left, the consular chief says .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Prosecutors will recommend that a Spanish court drop its investigation of six former officials in the administration of U.S. George W. Bush for alleged torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Spain's attorney general said Thursday. Investigating judge Baltasar Garzon has the final say on whether to proceed or shelve the case. The claim against the former officials, presented by a human rights group and provisionally accepted last month at the court -- pending an opinion from the prosecutors - threatens to turn the court ""into a toy in the hands of people who are trying to do a political action,"" Attorney General Candido Conde-Pumpido said at a meeting at a downtown Madrid hotel. ""We undoubtedly cannot support that action,"" Conde-Pumpido said. If alleged torture at Guantanamo is going to be investigated at all, that should be done first in the United States, so that the former American officials would have a chance to defend themselves there, Conde-Pumpido added, according to his press chief, Fernando Noya. The prosecutors will inform the investigating judge, Baltasar Garzon, of their decision, and the judge would then have to decide whether to proceed or shelve the case, Noya said. Former Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales and five other ex-Bush administration officials are accused in the human rights group complaint of allegedly sanctioning torture at the Guantanamo Bay detention center. The complaint alleges the six former officials were the legal architects of a system that allowed torture of prisoners at Guantanamo, in violation of international law. The case might still go forward at the court, despite the prosecution opposition, said Gonzalo Boye, a lawyer who filed the complaint for the human rights group. Boye told CNN that prosecutors earlier opposed the court's human rights investigations of ex-Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and, separately, the former military regime in Guatemala, but that those cases went ahead anyway. ""It's up to the resolution of a court as it has always been,"" Boye told CNN. ""Garzon has to decide. This is a jurisdiction decision for a judge, not for the prosecution."" Boye predicted that once Garzon officially receives notification of the prosecution opposition, it could take the judge a few weeks to decide whether to proceed with the case. Boye conceded that it makes the case harder without prosecution support. ""It's a shame the prosecutor is taking this position, but not a surprise,"" Boye said. ""They always obey political orders. They don't want to be in a bad position in front of the Obama administration."" Some analysts and bloggers have suggested in recent days that the case could damage relations between Spain's Socialist government and President Barack Obama's administration. But a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN on Wednesday that a German court once had an investigation of then U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, but that did not hurt U.S.-German bilateral relations. Garzon accepted the complaint from the human rights group because there were at least four Spaniards at Guantanamo who allegedly suffered torture. Garzon then sent the matter to prosecutors at Spain's anti-terrorism National Court, requesting their opinion on whether a crime had been committed. The 98-page complaint, filed in March 2008 by Boye on behalf of the Association for the Rights of Prisoners, names Gonzales, who was Bush's legal counsel when the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba was established as part of the administration's ""war on terror."" Gonzales later became attorney general. The complaint also names five other top Bush administration officials: former assistant attorney general Jay Bybee; former deputy assistant attorney general John Yoo; former Defense Department general counsel William J. Haynes II, former Undersecretary of Defense Douglas J. Feith and Vice President Dick Cheney's former legal counsel, David S. Addington. Lawrence Wilkerson, a former top aide to Colin Powell, who was secretary of state in the early years of the Bush administration, testified before a House of Representatives subcommittee in June 2008 that the six officials ""had a collusion"" to develop a legal rationale for the administration's interrogation policy of detainees. Yoo, the author of a memo which critics say authorized torture, testified before the same subcommittee soon after in June 2008, saying that his role in the administration had simply been to provide legal advice. ""We were functioning as lawyers. We don't make policy. Policy choices in these matters were up to the National Security Council or the White House or the Department of Defense,"" Yoo testified, according to a Congressional transcript. Addington proved difficult to pin down when he testified before the same subcommittee on the same day as Yoo last June. Addington, who by then was Cheney's chief of staff, delivered a flat ""no"" in response to a question from New York Democrat Rep. Jerrold Nadler about whether Addington ""contributed to the analysis or assisted in the drafting of the August 1, 2002 interrogation memo."" But when Nadler followed up with: ""You had nothing to do with that?"" Addington replied, ""No. I didn't say I had nothing to do with it."" Addington never seemed to clarify what, if any, role he had. Garzon is Spain's best-known investigating magistrate who issued the precedent-setting arrest warrant for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1998 while he was in a London hospital. Garzon has investigated human rights abuses of former military governments in Chile and Argentina, Islamic terrorists operating in Spain, the armed Basque separatist group ETA, as well as major drug traffickers.","Spanish prosecutors to recommend dropping case against ex-Bush officials .

"(CNN) -- The odds may have been in the trillions-to-one range, but lightning has indeed struck twice for some lucky lottery players in Israel. The national biweekly lottery draw Saturday led to the astronomically improbable result of the same six double-digit balls being pulled in less than a month. The Miphal HaPayis state game picked 36, 33, 32, 26, 14, 13 and the ""strong number"" 2 as the winning combination. But a quick look at the results caused panic and amazement: the same first six numbers had been picked in exact reverse order and won the lottery on September 21. The only difference was the ""strong number,"" which determines the first prize jackpot. Anyone who played those six numbers on both dates won big -- twice. Lottery officials at first pulled Saturday's result, fearing there was a mechanical error or some sort of tampering with the results. That's understandable as the statistical probability of that six-number combination is normally one-in-2.65 million. But a gaming and mathematics expert interviewed by Israeli website Ynetnews set the chances that the same numbers would hit twice somewhere around four trillion to one. ""Usually, this is the type of numbers they use to describe the probability of life on Mars,"" Zvi Gilula, a professor of statistics at the Hebrew University said. But after investigating the drawing and finding no problems, lottery officials certified Saturday's results, leading to three first-prize winners earning over $1 million dollars each. The lottery's official website cited a statistician explaining, ""this is a rare coincidence of identical results in two different lotteries."" According to Haim Melamed, ""Combinations of such statistics, despite being rare, can occur and hence, a combination that already occurred in the lottery (can) have a chance to rise again ... like every other combination.""","Israel's national lottery produced same six double-digit numbers in less than a month .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Lashing winds and heavy rain pummeled India's southeastern coastline Friday as Cyclone Thane roared onshore killing at least 19 people. The storm uprooted trees, ripped off traffic signals from their posts and sent shards of glass and other debris whizzing through the air. Roads began to flood and communications were tough because of cellular service outages. Thane hit the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu and the union territory of Puducherry. But it took a decidedly southern turn as it made landfall, severely affecting the Tamil Nadu district of Cuddalore, south of the city of Chennai. Winds were gusting in Cuddalore at almost 90 miles per hour. At least 12 people died in Cuddalore, said Amuthavalli, the district's top official who goes by a single name. She told CNN the fatalities were the result of wall collapses and electrocution. No major rescue operations were required. The death toll in the district is not expected to rise greatly, she said. Emergency crews were working to restore power supplies and clear roads of fallen trees and downed power lines, she added. Meteorologists downgraded Cyclone Thane from ""very severe"" to ""severe"" once it came over land and began to lose steam. By lunchtime, it had weakened further to a ""deep depression"" as it moved westward. Fishermen were advised to stay off rough seas throughout the day and coastal residents had been told to evacuate to higher ground ahead of the storm's arrival. Many people in largely agricultural and fishing communities along the coast live in thatched-roof huts that could sustain extensive damage, the India Meteorological Department said Friday. Parts of coastal and inland Tamil Nadu and Puducherry can expect heavy rainfall over the next day, the agency said. Heavy rain is also forecast for parts of Andhra Pradesh, as well as northern Kerala and southern Karnataka.

"(CNN) -- Emergency crews on Sunday recovered the body of the pilot of a vintage military jet that crashed into the icy waters of the Hudson River near Ulster, New York, the day before, an FAA spokeswoman said. Divers worked until sunset Saturday night, but were unable to extract the body of pilot Michael Faraldi from the ice- and mud-encased cockpit until they returned to the scene on Sunday. Faraldi's jet crashed after he made a low pass over the Kingston-Ulster Airport, according to FAA spokeswoman Holly Baker. The plane dropped vertically and hit the ice, she said. Faraldi had taken off from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. New York State Police Captain Patrick Regan said witnesses at the airport told police that they saw the plane climb and then rapidly dive at some point before the crash occurred. Faraldi was apparently headed for Columbia County, New York, when he crashed, Regan said. Divers worked in 8 to 10 feet of water to attach straps to the plane, a 1969 BAC 167 Strikemaster jet, so that a recovery helicopter from a New Hampshire company could try to lift it out of the river Sunday afternoon, Regan said. At least part of the plane remained in the river Sunday afternoon, according to Baker. The plane is registered to Dragon Aviation, a company that performs in air shows, according to their website.

"Hatay, Turkey (CNN) -- Clashes erupted across Turkey on Tuesday after a predawn skirmish between police and protesters left one demonstrator dead in the border province of Hatay. Crowds of demonstrators gathered in the cities of Istanbul, Ankara and Hatay to denounce the death of Ahmet Atakan, a 22-year-old who recently graduated from accounting school. Police in Istanbul dispersed demonstrators using water cannons, tear gas and rubber pellets. Thousands of demonstrators tried to reach Taksim Square, a main commercial area that has been the site of clashes since May. Riot police prevented small groups from congregating in the square. Demonstrators erected barricades, threw stones and shot firecrackers at the police. Crowds of protestors chanted ""Down with the government"" and ""Solidarity with Armutlu"" referring to the neighborhood in Hatay where Atakan was fatally injured. According to the official government broadcaster, TRT, the tear gas around the Taksim area blew into a nearby football stadium where the youth Swedish national soccer team was squaring off against Turkey's national squad. The Spanish referee suspended the game after the tear gas wafted into the stadium, which is named after Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Several days ago, Istanbul lost a hotly contested bid to host the 2020 Olympics to rival Tokyo. Many analysts said the widely criticized use of police force to crush anti-government protests last June may have played in a role in Istanbul's Olympic defeat. Differing accounts of how protester died . There is still controversy over how Atakan, the protester in Hatay, died. In a press release, the Hatay governor's office said Atakan was killed in a fall during a clash between police and demonstrators. Shortly before 1 a.m. on Tuesday, a patrol unit reported that one person ""had fallen to the street from a building"" and an ambulance was sent, the governor's office said. ""However, people at the scene wanted to take the injured individual to the hospital with their own resources, and our citizen Ahmet Atakan was taken to the Antakya Government Hospital, but he lost his life in spite of all efforts at the hospital."" Police released a video taken from atop an armored vehicle that showed the blurry image of a man apparently falling off a street curb into the street. But eyewitnesses insisted Atakan was struck in the head at short range by a tear gas canister fired from the turret of an armored vehicle. Eylem Mansuroglu said that immediately after being hit by the canister, Atakan was grazed by a passing police vehicle. Atakan's blood still stained the pavement where residents erected a makeshift memorial for the dead man. Hasan Akgol, a parliament member from Turkey's opposition CHP party, told CNN he had seen Atakan's body on a stretcher. ""I couldn't believe it, seeing a young kid covered in blood,"" Akgol said. ""He had an injury behind his ear, blood all over his body, scratches on his body."" Atakan is the second anti-government protester to die in Hatay this summer. Neighborhood rises up in protest . Atakan's parents told CNN their son had gone out to the streets after attending a wedding Monday night, to attend a protest sit-in. They said it was a weekly protest in honor of Abdullah Comert, another young man from the same neighborhood who was killed in a clash with police last June, barely 3 blocks from where Atakan was fatally injured. The protest was also against the Turkish government and its strong support for Syrian rebels and a proposed U.S.-led military operation in Syria. Bergen: Syria plunging Mideast into sectarian war? ""My son protested against war so that there would be peace. In Turkey they kill those who want peace,"" screamed Atakan's weeping mother, Emsal, before her son's burial on Tuesday. ""Erdogan's dogs killed my son,"" she wailed. In the afternoon on Tuesday, a procession of more than a thousand people escorted Atakan's coffin to a cemetery, chanting, ""We are all Ahmet. You can kill one but not all,"" and ""Murderer police will answer for their actions."" After the burial, crowds marched to the street where Atakan was injured. Police used water cannons and fired tear gas to disperse the demonstrators. Protestors set up burning barricades and threw stones at armored police vehicles. Much of the neighborhood of Armutlu appeared to be rising up in protest. Women screamed out of their balconies, demanding police stay out of the area. From an apartment building, one resident hurled a potted plant off a balcony at an armored vehicle passing on the street below. A portly woman threw a plate down on to the street. One man carried a toilet out into the road and smashed it onto the ground to build a barricade out of the debris.

"Washington (CNN) -- The good news is that the chances an asteroid big enough to destroy a continent or all of civilization will hit Earth this year are only one in 20,000, a congressional panel learned Tuesday. The bad news is the government needs to spend billions of dollars in coming years for new technology to prevent such a possible catastrophe, regardless of the low probability, experts told the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. ""The odds are very small, but the potential consequences of such an event are so large, it makes sense to take the risk seriously,"" contended John Holdren, who directs President Barack Obama's Office of Science and Technology Policy. Current efforts to detect and analyze possible space threats like the meteor that exploded over Russia last month, injuring more than 1,000 people and causing millions of dollars in damages, have made progress in identifying the threats, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden told the committee.

He said scientists have identified 95% of asteroids more than a half-mile in diameter -- the kind that threaten human existence if they strike Earth, like the six-mile-wide one believed to have wiped out dinosaurs 65 million years ago -- and found none on a collision course with the planet. However, the detection efforts have been less successful for smaller meteors still capable of causing major loss of life and damage, such as the one over Russia. Only 10% of meteors more than 150 yards wide -- dubbed ""potential city killers"" by Holdren -- have been detected, meaning more than 10,000 are out there without our knowledge, he said. If scientists detected a major asteroid headed for Earth now, it would take at least five years to develop an effective defense system to either alter its course or possibly destroy it, no matter how much money was spent, according to Holdren and Bolden. While you were working: An asteroid flew by . Government plans to bolster detection and mitigation capabilities include an infrared sensor that would orbit Venus, as well as a laser system or other method to deflect any threatening meteor away from Earth, they said. ""We really need to have space-borne assets,"" said Bolden of the infrared sensor that would cost more than $500 million. Another NASA goal endorsed by Obama is to send an astronaut to an asteroid for the first time in history by 2025, a project that would cost $2 billion, he said. Asked by panel members about the effects of forced spending cuts this year due to the inability of Congress to agree on fiscal issues, all the witnesses described heavy impacts. ""Just about my every working moment these days is consumed with this topic,"" Gen. William Shelton, commander of the U.S. Air Force Space Command, said about the spending cuts that took effect March 1. He added that ""we are clearly less capable."" Bolden noted that NASA's budget for detecting Near Earth Objects has multiplied in recent years to reach more than $20 million in 2012. Now, he said, Congress needs to at least maintain such funding to prevent stagnation or, even worse, atrophy. ""This is really important and it has to be continuous,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The killings of four people, including two U.S. Navy pilots, in a Coronado, California, apartment early New Year's Day was a murder-suicide, investigators said Wednesday. Lt. J.G. John R. Reeves, 25, put a gun to his own head and killed himself after shooting to Lt. J.G. David A. Reis, 25; Karen Reis, 24; and Matthew Saturley, 31, according to the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. The murder-suicide conclusion was based on the medical examiner's autopsy, the sheriff's statement said. Homicide detectives will not provide a suspected motive for Reeves' actions until more interviews are conducted and evidence is collected, the sheriff's statement said. ""It is anticipated this process, and the crime laboratory report, could take several weeks,"" the statement said. The two Navy officers, roommates in the apartment where the shootings happened, were F/A-18 jet pilots assigned to Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 101, Marine Aircraft Group 11, Third Marine Aircraft Wing, the Navy said. Reeves earned his Navy commission through the ROTC program at Penn State University in 2008, while Reis was commissioned in the Navy after completing the ROTC program at the University of New Mexico the same year, the Navy said. The Coronado Police Department got a call around 2:20 a.m. Sunday about shots being fired inside a condominium in the coastal city, which is just southwest of San Diego. Responding officers found a man's body in the doorway and the other bodies inside the residence, according to a press release from Lt. Larry Nesbit of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.","Police find four bodies in a Coronado, California, apartment early New Year's Day .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela's health had declined so sharply last week that his family was considering whether to take him off life support before his condition improved, a court document released Thursday revealed. The document, known as a ""certificate of urgency,"" was filed on June 26. It stated that the 94-year-old Mandela ""has taken a turn for the worst and that the Mandela family have been advised by the medical practitioners that his life support machine should be switched off."" ""Rather than prolonging his suffering, the Mandela family is exploring this option as a very real probability,"" it added. The following day, however, South African President Jacob Zuma announced that Mandela's condition had improved from critical to critical but stable. Mandela remained critical but stable Thursday, Zuma's office reported after he visited Mandela. It denied reports that Mandela was in a ""vegetative state."" Considered the founding father of South Africa's modern democracy, Mandela has been hospitalized in Pretoria since June 8 for a recurring lung infection -- a legacy of his years of imprisonment under South Africa's now-defunct apartheid regime. Another document filed by his family in a burial dispute described his health as ""perilous"" and stated that fears that his death is drawing near are justified. That affidavit was lodged in court this week as 16 members of Mandela's family battled his grandson, Nkosi Zwelivelile Mandela, also known as Mandla, over where three of the anti-apartheid icon's deceased children should be buried. Mandla Mandela lost his case Wednesday, which meant the return of the remains of the three relatives to the family graveyard in Qunu, Nelson Mandela's boyhood home, could go ahead. They were reburied Thursday in the family compound. But the dispute brought a public chiding from another hero of the anti-apartheid cause, retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu. In a statement carried by the South African Press Association late Thursday, Tutu urged the family not to ""besmirch"" Mandela's name in his last days. ""Please, please, please may we think not only of ourselves. It's almost like spitting in Madiba's face,"" Tutu said, using Mandela's traditional clan name. ""Your anguish, now, is the nation's anguish -- and the world's. We want to embrace you, to support you, to shine our love for Madiba through you."" The remains were removed from the Qunu village cemetery two years ago by Mandla Mandela and then taken to the village of Mvezo. The former South African president was born in Mvezo, but spent his childhood in Qunu. Messages for Nelson Mandela: Hope turns to resignation . The family affidavit lodged at the Mthatha High Court gives new insight into the seriousness of his condition. ""The anticipation of his impending death is based on real and substantial grounds,"" it reads. ""The applicants are desirous of burying their father and committing him to earth in which his descendants lie,"" the affidavit states. Family members called it ""incontestable"" that Mandela wants his three deceased children reburied. ""The applicants do not want a situation to be created in which Nelson Mandela's remains are committed to lie in a burial site, entirely alone and forlorn and absent from the remains of his children,"" the affidavit said. The remains buried in Mvezo were found and taken to a mortuary Wednesday, Eastern Cape police said, according to the South African Press Association. Forensic testing was done before the reburial in Qunu to confirm the identities of the bodies, the news agency said. The three are Nelson Mandela's first daughter, Makaziwe Mandela, who died as a baby in 1948; his eldest son, Madiba Thembekile, who died in a car crash in 1969; and Makgatho Mandela, father to Mandla, who died in 2005, the news agency said. Mandla Mandela issued a statement Wednesday saying he would abide by the court decision but continue ""to fight for his right to put on record his side of the story."" On Thursday, he said his grandfather's health is the chief issue on his mind, the South African Press Association reported. ""My grandfather continues to be stable while in a critical space,"" he said. ""I want to focus on what matters most, being with my grandfather, ensuring I can be with him at this moment that he needs us most."" CNN's Robyn Curnow reported in Pretoria, Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London and Matt Smith wrote from Atlanta.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Four severely burned bodies have been recovered from an Indian navy submarine that sank in Mumbai this week after an explosion and fire on board, authorities said Friday. The Indian government warned that there was almost no hope of finding any survivors among the 14 other sailors who were in the submarine when it was hit by the unexplained blast at a naval dockyard early Wednesday. Navy divers have been searching for the trapped submarine personnel for the past two days. Their task has been complicated by poor visibility inside the stricken submarine's passageways, which are full of oily, muddy water and wreckage. Adding to their difficulties, the heat of the explosion warped some of the hatches inside the vessel, blocking the divers' access to certain areas. The four bodies they found Friday are unidentifiable because they were so severely burned, authorities said. They have been taken to a naval hospital for DNA identification. Searching 'every inch' The state of the bodies and conditions inside the INS Sindhurakshak, a Russian-built submarine, mean that ""finding any surviving personnel within the submarine is unlikely,"" the ministry said. ""The feasibility of locating bodies of personnel in the forward part of the submarine is also very remote, as the explosion and very high temperatures, which melted steel within, would have incinerated the bodies, too,"" it warned. But divers will continue to scour ""every inch"" of the submarine until all the bodies are recovered ""or it can be stated with finality that no bodies remain to be found,"" the statement said. Authorities say they have contacted the families of all the 18 missing personnel and are keeping them updated. The defense ministry has published the names of the three officers and 15 sailors concerned. Worst peacetime disaster . An investigation into the explosion and fire -- the Indian navy's worst peacetime disaster -- is under way. Navy officials say they so far can't pinpoint the cause. Salvage work on the diesel-electric submarine won't begin until the search for bodies is over, the defense ministry said Friday. The Sindhurakshak had only recently returned from an extensive refitting in Russia before the disaster. Observers have described the vessel's sinking as a significant setback to the navy's ambitions. It took place just days after two events hailed as big steps forward for the Indian military's technological capabilities. The Indian navy had last week activated the reactor on the Arihant, its first domestically built nuclear submarine. And on Monday, it launched the Vikrant, a home-built aircraft carrier. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","Navy divers have now found four bodies inside the submarine .

"(CNN) -- Any footballer who holds a passport for a particular country should be allowed to represent them on the football field. That is Juventus president Andrea Agnelli's take on the hot topic that is dominating the build-up to the final round of European qualifiers for the 2014 World Cup. Debate has raged in England after the country's national team manager Roy Hodgson revealed he had been looking at the latest starlet off the Manchester United production line -- Adnan Januzaj. The Belgian-born 18-year-old has starred for the defending English Premier League champions this season and could qualify to play for England through residency rules if he stays in the country until he is 23. Blog: 'Your country needs YOU! But which country?' Arsenal's Jack Wilshere then raced headlong into the debate by telling a press conference while on England duty: ""The only people who should play for England are English people."" Those remarks only served to transcend the dispute across the sporting spectrum as England cricketer Kevin Pietersen, South African by birth but with an English mother, challenged Wilshere's view. The owner of 99 Test caps for England pointed to Tour de France winner Chris Froome and double Olympic champion Mo Farah as examples of sportsmen who competed under the United Kingdom banner but who were born in another country. ""It's very difficult -- we live in a global world, in a truly globalized environment,"" Agnelli told CNN World Sport. ""In a global world when you're entitled to have a passport of a country and you have legislation for that, you should be entitled to play for the national team of that country. ""My wife is English and I've got two kids -- they were born in Italy -- how I should go back home and explain to my wife that they couldn't wear the English national team (jersey)? ""When you think about nationality, are they English? Their mother is English but they were born in Italy. I have other friends who have different nationalities (of parents) and were born in a third country. 2014 World Cup: Is Belgium football's coming force? ""Maybe they were born in a different country just because of a momentary placement for a job but would they represent that nationality or would they feel something different?"" Agnelli has stabilized Italian giants Juventus since he assumed the presidency in May 2010, with the club still dealing from the fall out of the Calciopoli match-fixing scandal that saw them relegated to the second tier in Italy. In the three years he's been in charge Agnelli has overseen Juve's return as Italy's most successful club, winning two Serie A titles in a row, and their move to a new stadium, which has helped strengthen the club financially. Juve are this season gunning for a third straight Serie A crown, matching their achievement of 80 years ago, but he still thinks Italy's top league has a long way to go to match the powerhouse trio of domestic competitions in England, Spain and Germany. ""Serie A is not where it was in the 1980s and 1990s when it was the fabulous destination for every football player,"" he explained. ""I think we have to catch up a lot of ground we have lost in the recent past. ""At the moment we are fourth and we should be more considered about the countries behind, like France & Portugal, from a UEFA ranking point of view rather than catching up with who is in front of us. ""Italy needs to go through a structural reform of the way we run football before we can actually aspire again to clinch third place, then move up the ladder to become number one."" Premier League dream for Bigirimana after 'miracle journey' This week the finest players in Europe are preparing to represent their countries as the final round of World Cup qualifiers determine who makes it to Brazil in 2014. But looming large in the background are the issues that surround the tournament that is still nine years away -- the proposed 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Football's world governing body FIFA last week set up a task force to investigate the possibility of moving the 2022 competition from Qatar's summer to winter, to avoid the searing heat that could affect both players and fans alike. No final verdict will be offered before the latest installment in Brazil has been completed but any shift in date would have huge ramifications for Europe's leagues and clubs. But Agnelli is confident a solution that suits everyone can be settled upon. ""I think the fact there is a lot of chat is good because everyone within the football family wants to make sure the right decision is made,"" he added. ""I think there has been a clear position from the FIFA executive committee which is a decision will be taken following the 2014 World Cup Brazil 2014 -- that should leave plenty of time to make the right decision. ""Moving a World Cup from June or July when it is normally played to a different month is a huge involvement. We tend to speak a lot about the players who actually take part in the competition but that is the minority, you have to think about what the rest of the football family will do. ""We have to understand what the calendar will look like, how we will make the players rest, is it going to be a one year change of calendar. ""What is important is that the clubs' point of view will be listened to and I think European Club Association will make sure that point of view will be well represented within the right bodies."" Agnelli also acknowledged the wider issues involved with shunting the date of one of the most watched sporting events on the planet, including the agreements that would have to be struck with television broadcasters. ""You have to understand the TV broadcasters will have their own say -- every player involved will have a point of view,"" he said. ""You clearly sold to the American broadcasters a product that should be taking place in June or July and you are going to put it throughout the regular season of NFL, NBA and NHL -- will that have the same value? ""There are a lot of players which need to come to an agreement, I'm quite sure with the good will of everybody a good solution will be found in the interests of football itself.""","Juve president says players who have a passport should be allowed to play for that country .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The arrest of a local imam for allegedly lying to the FBI about tipping off a suspected terrorist sent shock waves through the Afghan community in New York. Ahmad Wais Afzali, a prominent imam in Queens who runs an Islamic burial service for the Muslim community, has maintained his innocence in the case. He's charged in connection with a terror probe that revolves around 24-year-old Najibullah Zazi. Prosecutors said Zazi received explosives training with the intent to bomb a high density target in the United States, and that Afzali jeopardized their investigation by telling Zazi that federal investigators were on to him. Afzali's attorney, Ron Kuby, said his client was trying to help investigators find Zazi, whose family attended his mosque several years ago. Kuby said the imam ""consistently cooperated"" with police in previous investigations and now ""feels ill-used."" Afzali, 37, immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan with his family when he was 7 years old. He was released on a $1.5 million bond Thursday. Hours later, he told reporters surrounding him and his wife outside their home in Queens that he'd received many messages of support. ""I am grateful not only to the Afghani community, I am very grateful even to the non-Muslims and the Muslims,"" he said. The Afghan community in Queens is a tightly-knit one, where much of the social interaction centers around religion. It's in that climate that Afzali flourished, establishing himself as a role model to young Muslims who seemed lost, says Abdul Rouzyi, the owner of an Afghan kebab restaurant in the area. ""He's young, good-looking and rich,"" Rouzyi told CNN. ""A lot of people looked up to him."" Rouzyi said he had seen young Afghan and Pakistani kids who were into drugs turn their lives around after being mentored by Afzali. Ahmad Wahidi, a 20 year-old college student who knew Afzali through the local mosque, the Masjid Al-Saaliheen, said the community's anger and shock over Afzali's arrest has been muted by fear. ""Nobody really talks about it because they're scared,"" said Wahidi. Wahidi said the fear is rooted in the belief that Afzali's words were twisted against him. Ahmad Wais, president of the Masjid Al-Saaliheen and a childhood friend of the imam, said this case may have a negative impact on the Afghan-Muslim community's relationship with law enforcement. ""Personally, I feel that the law enforcement, what they did with this guy -- even the people who want to help, now they're afraid to come forward."" Afzali seems to believe the justice system will vindicate him. ""We all are American citizens. I was raised in America. I have been American since I was 7 years old. Before being judged in media, papers and TV, know the facts from fiction.""","Prominent imam Ahmad Wais Afzali accused of lying to FBI in terror probe .

"(CNN) -- In six days, the United States government's borrowing authority will be exhausted. If Congress does not act to extend the debt limit, the Treasury Department will be left with only its cash on hand -- estimated to be about $30 billion -- and whatever revenues it takes in each day. Because the government is running a deficit, available cash will be insufficient to cover the millions of payments the Treasury makes each day -- to men and women in our armed forces, veterans, Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries, federal employees and retirees, businesses that provide goods and services to the nation, and many others. Even if Congress opts to pass a temporary extension, the threat of default will hang over the economy until a longer-term solution is adopted. What does this really mean for the economy, and what does it mean for you? Congress has never in our history failed to extend the debt limit, so no one knows for sure what would happen if, as some Republicans are now advocating, we tried to operate the government with insufficient funds and no ability to borrow. It has long been the view of economists, business leaders and the Treasury Department that such a scenario could set in motion a financial crisis. Presidents and secretaries of the Treasury of both parties have urged Congress never to take that risk. Ronald Reagan himself once said, ""Unfortunately, Congress consistently brings the government to the edge of default before facing its responsibility. This brinkmanship threatens the holders of government bonds and those who rely on Social Security and veterans benefits. Interest rates would skyrocket, instability would occur in financial markets, and the federal deficit would soar. The United States has a special responsibility to itself and the world to meet its obligations. It means we have a well-earned reputation for reliability and credibility, two things that set us apart from much of the world."" Reagan's view is widely held, but some Republicans -- dubbed ""default deniers"" -- now argue that the debt limit deadline can be ignored without serious harm. They have urged the President to continue paying interest on the national debt using available cash and then avoid or delay paying other obligations. Although it's not possible to disprove either theory, the default deniers overlook an important problem: Paying interest on the debt would not protect the Treasury against what's called ""rollover risk."" That's the risk that investors would decide, amid the crisis atmosphere generated by a failure to raise the debt limit, to cash out their maturing Treasury bonds instead of reinvesting (or ""rolling over"") their proceeds into new Treasuries, as they usually do. This would be reminiscent of the famous bank scene at the end of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" only on a huge and frightening scale. About $100 billion in Treasury securities mature each week, so if investors decided to put their money elsewhere, Treasury's available cash would be nowhere near enough to cash those jittery investors out. In those circumstances, the U.S. would default on both principal and interest payments, and the economic consequences would be swift and severe. To the extent that we were able to continue borrowing, investors would demand higher interest rates on Treasuries. (These rates have already begun to rise as the impasse in Washington has worsened.) Since Treasury rates are benchmarks for other lending, loans for homes, cars and other needs would become more expensive, and it would become harder to qualify to borrow. Consumer and business confidence would suffer. As in the last financial crisis, falling confidence would have ripple effects, affecting other markets including the short-term lending used by companies to finance themselves. This would all dampen economic growth, which is still not as strong as we would like in the wake of the last crisis. The stock market would weaken, and retirement savings would dip. And of course unemployment would rise. Meanwhile, the inability to pay the rest of the government's regular obligations in full or on time would be spreading its own hardship across the economy. There is no way to know how bad these conditions would get or how far the financial contagion would spread, but it seems safe to say that no good could come from tempting such a fate. The question is: Why in the world would we ever choose to take that risk? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark A. Patterson.","In six days, the United States government's borrowing authority will be exhausted .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Nine years of blindness almost drove Sharron ""Kay"" Thornton to suicide. Kay Thornton, with Dr. Perez, can see again after surgery in which a tooth was implanted into her eye. In the end, it was one of her teeth and a procedure surgeons said was never before done in the United States that restored her sight. ""It was very embarrassing and humiliating for my daughter to take care of me, and it wasn't supposed to be that way. I'm supposed to take care of her,"" the 60-year-old woman told CNN on Wednesday. ""I thought about suicide, but then I thought, if I did it, I probably wouldn't do it right,"" she said. Instead, ""I just asked God to help me. I couldn't do it by myself. He taught me patience, and I never gave up."" Her hopes were raised when she qualified at the University of Miami Bascom Palmer Eye Institute for a months-long procedure in which an eye tooth (also called canine or cuspid) was implanted in one eye as a base to hold a prosthetic lens. Her bandages were removed over the Labor Day weekend.  Watch how the tooth was involved in the procedure » . Nearly two weeks later, her visual acuity is 20/70 without corrective lenses in the treated eye, said Dr. Victor Perez, associate professor of ophthalmology, and a cornea specialist at the institute. The Smithdale, Mississippi, woman and her doctors planned to meet the media at a news conference Wednesday afternoon to discuss her case. Thornton, a former restaurant manager with three children, lost her sight in 2000 after she was stricken with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, apparently caused by medication she was taking. The illness is described by the Mayo Clinic as a rare disorder in which a person's ""skin and mucous membranes react severely to a medication or infection."" The disease causes ""a painful red or purplish rash that spreads and blisters, eventually causing the top layer of skin to die and shed."" She also lost her hair, all nails and most of her skin. Within a week, Stevens-Johnson syndrome also caused the cells on the surface of her eye to die, and the severe corneal scarring that resulted made her blind. Eventually, everything reversed itself but her blindness. After losing her sight, Thornton said, she especially missed watching television, particularly her favorite show, ""Operation Repo."" When she and her best friend returned to the hotel after her bandages were removed, Thornton quoted him as saying, ""Here's the remote."" ""And I said, 'hot dog!' "" In interviews with CNN, the surgeons at the institute described how they brought back her sight by using what they say is the first surgical attempt in the United States to plant an eye tooth in an eye to hold a prosthetic lens. ""The surgical technique -- modified osteo-odonto keratoprosthesis (MOOKP) -- has proven effective in cases where severe corneal scarring blocks vision, but the eye remains healthy,"" according to the institute. Corneal scarring also can be caused by chemical injuries or burns. The procedure has been done only about 600 times worldwide, surgeons said. Perez led the surgical team who worked on Thornton. To start the procedure, surgeons remove a healthy tooth and part of the patient's jawbone. Perez said Thornton was given a jawbone implant, but she developed a sinus infection, so they removed it. They will try again later. The tooth and bone were then shaved and sculpted, and a hole was drilled into them to hold the prosthetic lens. Then the whole unit was implanted into Thornton's chest and left for several months, allowing the tooth and lens to bond. This was then implanted into her eye. Asked why doctors don't use a piece of plastic instead of a tooth, Perez said that works well when the eye is ""wet and healthy."" But Thornton's eye was too dry. When he first saw her, he said, ""her eyes were covered with skin."" Thornton's case had to be severe for her to meet the strict rules to qualify for the MOOKP. ""The inclusion criteria is strict,"" said the surgeon, now known as ""the tooth fairy."" ""The patient must have end-stage ocular surface disease, and must be able to see and localize light,"" meaning they must be able to describe from what direction light is coming. In addition, ""they have to have a healthy mouth and a good tooth."" Previously, a stem cell procedure had failed to help her, and she was not a candidate for a cornea transplant, he said. ""We used to hear about this surgery with the tooth, and we thought, 'How can people do this?' It seemed to be very far-fetched,"" Perez said. ""Then once I went to Rome and saw the patient results, it was very impressive."" ""It's so frustrating when they've tried other procedures and nothing works. We needed to find something that would work for these patients,"" the surgeon said. ""I'm very excited for this patient. She really worked hard for this. ""What the surgery meant to her is hope. She lost hope of ever seeing again,"" he said, and was especially distressed that she might never see the granddaughter born while she was blind. Not all surgeons are sold on the procedure. Dr. Ivan Schwab with the American Academy of Ophthalmology told CNN he believes the process is too difficult and the result too disfiguring. There are alternatives that are nearly as good, he added. ""We've known about the procedure since the '80s. It's been going on for a while,"" he said. ""We've viewed it with some skepticism. It requires a sizable team and several operations. It seems to be reasonably successful on the small numbers that have been done,"" though it does bring some disfigurement. The complicated procedure ""requires a team of dentists and ophthalmologists,"" he said. ""It's just it's an extreme variation on techniques we're already doing."" But he added, ""In their defense, they are working on the worst of the worst, people with no other alternatives."" There is little evidence, doctors say, for or against the safety of MOOKP, because of the small number of times it has been done. Dr. Christopher Liu at Sussex Eye Hospital in Brighton, England, said the process has long been used in Asia and Europe. He brought it to England from Italy. He said he doesn't believe the procedure will take off in the United States because of its length -- each stage takes hours to perform. In addition, he said, though the person can see again, the eye ""won't be natural looking."" CNN's Elizabeth Cohen, Rich Phillips and Sabriya Rice contributed to this report.","Woman, blinded after illness, has tooth implanted into eye to hold prosthetic lens .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Lebanese authorities Friday raised the death toll from a car bombing the day earlier, saying at least 22 people were killed and hundreds injured in a southern suburb of Beirut. Thursday's bomb rocked an area known as a stronghold of the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah, the Lebanese army said. At least 228 others were injured in the terrorist attack, the Lebanese Internal Security Forces said. There was a heightened security presence Friday in Beirut and other areas of Lebanon, but tensions appeared lower than on Thursday evening. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is due to address a large rally Friday in the southern Lebanon town of Aita al Shaab, close to the border with Israel. It's unclear if Nasrallah will respond to the bombing, which appeared to target Hezbollah, and whether, if so, his words will provoke more anger against the movement and its involvement in Syria's civil war. The previously planned rally is being held to mark the seventh anniversary of Hezbollah's July 2006 war with Israel. Along with Shiite-dominated Iran, Hezbollah is helping Syria's government fight rebels, whose ranks are dominated by Sunnis. After Thursday's blast, a YouTube video surfaced in which three masked men holding weapons claimed they are part of a group responsible for the attack. They stood before a large Arabic sign containing the Islamic creed, ""There is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is the messenger of Allah."" The group, which calls itself the Brigade of Aisha, Mother of Believers, accused Hezbollah of being aggressors. Aisha, the last wife of the Prophet Mohammed, is especially revered by Sunni Muslims. In its YouTube post, the group called Nasrallah a ""pig"" and said he works on behalf of Iran and Israel. ""A message: To our brothers and sisters in Lebanon: Stay away from anything to do with Iran -- whether in Beirut or outside Beirut,"" it said. CNN could not confirm the authenticity of the video or the men's claims. The U.S. Embassy in Beirut tweeted condemnations of the attack. Hezbollah's involvement in the Syrian conflict has angered some in Lebanon, and many Lebanese fear that the group could be the target of more attacks in future. People living near the scene of Thursday's blast told CNN they worried that if a car bomb could be brought into this neighborhood, which Hezbollah tightly controls, then others might follow. Many Lebanese see the attack as another indication that Syria's civil war is spilling over its borders. Lebanon is divided along the same sectarian lines as its neighbor. Lebanon's army said its units responded immediately to the bombing Thursday evening, setting up a security zone and beginning investigations. Civil defense units were trying to rescue some citizens stuck inside their homes due to the fire resulting from the blast, Lebanon's National News Agency reported. The explosion came about a month after a car bomb injured dozens of people in the pro-Hezbollah neighborhood of Bir El Abed in a southern Beirut suburb. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom reported from Beirut, Lebanon. CNN's Yasmin Amer reported from Atlanta.","NEW: Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is scheduled to address a large rally .

"New York (CNN) -- A mother tried to rescue her baby twins from a house fire, but the blaze was too much and she, the twins and a third child perished Friday night, police said. Jennifer Mccusker, 41, and her children -- 2-year old twins Ava and Brendon Mistretta and 7-year old Aiden Tarbell -- died after a fire started at the front of their Long Island home around 10 p.m., according to Suffolk Police. Two neighbors reported seeing flames from the home and called authorities, the police department said in a news release. The neighbors -- one of whom is an EMT -- attempted to enter the home but were unable to because of smoke and heat, police said. Mccusker was found in a rear bedroom where she apparently was attempting to remove her twins from their cribs, police said. Mccusker was able to remove one of her twins and appeared to have been trying to remove the second when she went unconscious, according to a police spokesman at the scene. The oldest child, Aiden, was found in another bedroom, according to police. The mother and her three children were transported to Brookhaven Memorial Hospital where they were pronounced dead. The cause of the fire was not immediately known, and police did not say whether there was anything suspicious about the fire. Shoshanana Alexander, a neighbor, told CNN Affiliate WABC that Mccusker was a ""very good mom."" ""She always loved having people at her house... She was a very sweet person. Very sweet person,"" Alexander told WABC. Autopsies were to be performed Saturday morning.","A mother and her three children were killed in a fire .

"(CNN) -- One year ago, Taliban gunmen in Pakistan boarded a school van and shot Malala Yousafzai, then 15, for speaking out for girls' education. Malala survived the tragedy, and her courageous story of a teenage girl who would not be silenced inspired tens of millions more in the fight for girls' rights. As Malala said in July during her historic address at the United Nations, ""I raise up my voice -- not so that I can shout, but so that those without a voice can be heard."" And as the world marks International Day of the Girl on Friday, it is worth remembering all those young girls, the same age as Malala and some even younger, whose voices go unheard: the millions of child brides around the world robbed of their youth and their rights, including the chance at education. The world will never know the talent it loses to early forced marriages. Most of the world's child brides reside in Malala's home region of South Asia. In her native Pakistan, almost one-fourth of the country's girls find themselves in unions or marriages by age 18. India, Pakistan's neighbor to the east, has more child brides than any other country in the world, with 47% of all of the country's more than 600 million girls married before their 18th birthday. In Bangladesh, 66% of girls end up becoming child brides, the third-highest rate in the world. The tradition of child marriage, reinforced by poverty, instability and a lack of resources, has proven hard to fight even in this era of globalization. Education has proven to be one of the most potent weapons in the fight against child marriage. According to Girls Not Brides, a global partnership to end child marriage, a girl who receives seven or more years of schooling will marry an average of four years later. In Mozambique, around 60% of girls without an education are married by 18, compared with 10% who complete secondary schooling. That number drops to nearly zero for those who are able to reach higher education. When a girl can become a student instead of a bride, her family benefits. A study in Pakistan measuring returns on education showed that extending a girl's schooling by one year led to a 13% to 18% increase in her wages. Data from a Population Reference Bureau study put that number at up to 20%. A baby born to a literate mother is 50% more likely to live past the age of 5. And child vaccination rates quadruple when mothers are educated. When girls become brides, on the other hand, schooling is often not an option. Even if husbands and their families permit the girl to go to school, the immediate push to have children makes girls much more likely to drop out. Pregnancy is the leading cause of death worldwide for girls ages 15 to 19. Child brides have precious few paths to earning an income and to contributing to their family's economic health, leaving girls ensnared in a vicious cycle of poverty. Domestic violence and HIV transmission also increase dramatically when girls marry at a young age, further threatening both the girls and the well-being of their children. For every Malala you meet there are many more whose stories will never be known -- girls robbed of their chance to pursue their dreams and to go to school simply because they are girls. That is not just their loss; it is ours. Girls are a precious natural resource. And we don't have talent to waste.

"(CNN) -- It's the time of year for dashing through the snow to the crowded post office, with arms full of holiday gifts for family and friends. Not to break the atmosphere of holiday cheer, but this Christmas could be the last for the U.S. Postal Service. It is losing $25 million dollars a day and staring down insolvency -- unless Congress steps in to pass a reform package that reduces its costs. With just a few days left in the congressional calendar, there is still some small hope for a Christmas miracle -- maybe the Postal Service can be saved as part of a deal on the fiscal cliff. But with even Hurricane Sandy relief stalled, skepticism is growing. The real question is, what's taken them so long? After all, back in April the Senate passed an imperfect but bipartisan bill by 62-37. It would have saved some $20 billion, cut some 100 distribution centers, and reduced head count by an additional 100,000 through incentives for early retirement, while reducing red tape to encourage entrepreneurialism and keeping Saturday delivery in place for at least another two years. At the time, Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware said, ""The situation is not hopeless; the situation is dire. My hope is that our friends over in the U.S. House, given the bipartisan steps we took this week, will feel a sense of urgency."" To which the House might as well have replied, ""Not so much."" In August, the Postal Service defaulted for the first time, unable to make a $5.5 billion payment to fund future retirees' health benefits. The headline in Government Executive magazine said it all: ""Postal Service defaults, Congress does nothing."" The usual suspects were at fault -- hyperpartisan politics and the ideological arrogance that always makes the perfect the enemy of the good. House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa greeted the news of the Senate bill by calling it a ""taxpayer-funded bailout."" His primary complaint was that the Senate bill did not go far enough. He was not alone -- Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe also expressed disappointment at the scope of the Senate bill, saying that it fell ""far short of the Postal Service's plan."" But Issa's alternative couldn't even get to a vote in the Republican-controlled House. And so nothing happened. Even after the USPS defaulted on a second $5.5 billion payment, the response was crickets. Washington insiders said that action would be taken after the election, when lawmakers would be free to make potentially unpopular decisions. But despite a series of closed-door meetings, nothing has been done. It's possible that the nearly $20 billion in savings could be part of a fiscal cliff deal. Sen. Joseph Lieberman has suggested that ending Saturday delivery, except for packages, could be part of a compromise that could save big bucks down the road. Another aspect of a savings plan could be suspending the USPS' onerous obligation to fully fund its pension costs upfront, a requirement that would push many businesses into bankruptcy. And last fiscal year, the post office posted a record $15.9 billion loss. ""As the nation creeps toward the 'fiscal cliff,' the U.S. Postal Service is clearly marching toward a financial collapse of its own,"" says Carper. ""The Postal Service's financial crisis is growing worse, not better. It is imperative that Congress get to work on this issue and find a solution immediately. ... Recently key House and Senate leaders on postal reform have had productive discussions on a path forward, and while there may be some differences of opinion in some of the policy approaches needed to save the Postal Service, there is broad agreement that reform needs to happen -- the sooner the better."" The urgency couldn't be clearer -- but even at this yuletide 11th hour, signs of progress are slim to none. If Congress fails to pass a bill, we'll be back to square one in the new year, with the Senate needing to pass a new bill which will then have to be ratified by the House. There is just no rational reason to think that lift will be any easier in the next Congress than in the current lame duck Congress, where our elected officials are supposedly more free to do the right thing, freed from electoral consequences. So as you crowd your local post office this holiday season, look around and realize that the clock is ticking. The Postal Service is fighting for its life. And Congress seems determined to ignore its cries for help. ""Neither rain nor snow nor sleet nor gloom of night"" can stop the U.S. Postal Service from making its appointed rounds -- but congressional division and dysfunction apparently can. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","The U.S. Postal Service is bleeding money and heading toward insolvency .
John Avlon: Congress can save the postal service in deal on the fiscal cliff .
He says the urgency is clear, let's hope for a Christmas miracle .

""I feel like, for me personally, I've lost two people: Cory and Finn,"" Michele told the magazine. But even though Monteith's death was devastating, Michele added that she never really considered quitting the show: ""Everyone is asking, 'Is it hard to do this? Is it hard to be back at work?'

"(CNN) -- A well-known West Memphis, Arkansas, physician was in critical condition Wednesday night after he was injured in a bombing that occurred as he was getting into his vehicle to leave for work, police said. Dr. Trent Pierce is well-liked and a pillar of the West Memphis, Arkansas, community, sources say. Dr. Trent Pierce, 54, a family practitioner who serves as chairman of the Arkansas Medical Board, lost his left eye in the blast about 8 a.m. at his home, West Memphis Police Chief Robert Paudert told reporters. Doctors operated on his right eye in hopes of saving it, Paudert said, and also removed shrapnel from Pierce's abdomen. Pierce underwent another surgery in the evening in which doctors were removing more shrapnel from his neck, Paudert said. He was at the intensive care unit Wednesday night at the Regional Medical Center in Memphis, Tennessee, known as the MED. Investigators are not sure whether the bomb was placed on or near Pierce's Lexus hybrid SUV, police said, or whether he was a random target. He apparently was outside the vehicle when the bomb exploded, said Stuart Lowery, assistant special agent in charge for the New Orleans, Louisiana, office of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Watch ATF say the bombing is a criminal act » . The blast, which was heard a mile away, occurred as Pierce was leaving his home at his usual time, Paudert said. His wife was in the house, heard the explosion and ran out to find Pierce lying in a flower bed six feet from the vehicle, authorities said. A passerby called 911. Dr. Scott Ferguson, a friend and neighbor who is serving as the Pierce family spokesman, told reporters Pierce apparently found a spare tire in front of the vehicle Wednesday, and as he was warming up the car, went to move it so he could leave his driveway. As he was doing so, the bomb -- under the vehicle -- exploded, Ferguson said, adding he did not know what role the tire played. Paudert told CNN he had spoken with officials at ATF, which is the lead investigative agency, about the tire, but declined to comment on the issue. No one else was injured, and there was no damage to the home, Paudert said. Aerial footage from the scene showed the white SUV with its hood blown up and extensive damage to its front end. Watch investigators converge on the SUV » . Pierce was stabilized at a local hospital before he was flown across the Mississippi River to the MED, officials said. Paudert credited staffers at the local hospital with saving his life. ""Every one of the surgeons who has come down has been excellent, keeping us informed and telling us what's going on,"" Ferguson said. ""The news has been better with each report."" He said he saw Pierce at the local hospital and initially was not optimistic about his chances, but as of Wednesday evening was ""quite optimistic that he is going to survive and do well ... it's going to be a long process. It's not going to happen overnight, but we are very optimistic and thankful."" A plastic surgeon told family and friends Pierce's burns ""look much worse than they actually are,"" he said. Ferguson said he lives across the street and was in the shower when ""I felt and heard the explosion. I thought a tree had fallen through the front of my house."" But he said he could not see a tree, and by the time he dressed, his phone was ringing telling him to go to the emergency room.  Watch a family friend say Dr. Pierce was targeted » . Lowery told reporters: ""We have no doubt this was a criminal act."" Ferguson said he had no idea who would have wanted to hurt Pierce or why. ""There are crazy people in the world, and what triggers them, I have no idea,"" he said. ""He's loved by everyone,"" said Paudert of Pierce. ""He has a very large practice, particularly of elderly people that depend on him for their health."" He said Pierce had no known complaints or threats against him. ""There is absolutely no motive as to why someone would want to plant a bomb on his car."" Initial indications were that foul play was not involved, Paudert said earlier, and police thought the blast might have resulted from a malfunction of some sort. However, ATF agents were able to find evidence of an explosive device, he said. Eighteen ATF agents from three states were at the scene, Lowery said. But the West Memphis police chief promised to remain involved in the investigation, too. Whoever planted the bomb has ""injured someone that's loved in this community, and my physician,"" Paudert said. ""I'm going to show personal attention to this."" The board was scheduled to meet Thursday in Little Rock, according to its Web site. Little Rock, the Arkansas capital, is about 125 miles west of West Memphis. Paudert said Pierce was scheduled to attend board subcommittee meetings in Little Rock on Wednesday, but police do not know whether that was linked to the bombing. Ferguson described Pierce as active in the community and said Pierce and his wife have two grown children -- one in law school and one who works at a bank. West Memphis and Memphis, Tennessee, are separated by the Mississippi River. West Memphis had about 28,000 residents as of 2006, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Local and federal officials urged anyone with information to contact law enforcement agencies. The ATF tip line is 888-ATF-BOMB.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Hundreds of people were caught up early Saturday in a standoff between Islamist supporters of deposed President Mohamed Morsy and the Egyptian military at a mosque-turned-makeshift morgue, raising fears of a widening violence that will further push the country into chaos. The Al-Fateh mosque near Ramses Square in central Cairo has become the latest flashpoint in the growing crisis after more than 1,000 people reportedly sought refuge following Friday's clashes between protesters primarily aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood and security forces. Protesters took those killed and wounded in the clashes at the Ramses Square to the mosque, where the Muslim Brotherhood established a makeshift field hospital. State-run EGYNews, citing military officials, reported that security forces will provide safe passage for those inside the mosque. But those trapped are afraid to leave because they believe they will be attacked by plainclothes ""thugs"" aligned with the military, citing similar incidents in recent days, a doctor inside the mosque told CNN by telephone. The see-saw allegations have only added to growing tensions between the two sides, which have accused one another of inflating allegations of violence to further their stance. CNN cannot independently confirm the claims by the protesters or the military. The group outside fired at the mosque, breaking a window, and then tried to break down the front door, the doctor and two people inside told CNN. The military has said the women can leave, but the men will be arrested, said the doctor, who asked not to be identified because of security fears. But EGYNews, citing security officials, reports that people are being prevented from leaving the mosque by protesters. Local media purported to broadcast live footage from inside the mosque, showing men and women with their faces covered by medical masks and scarves over fears security forces will fire tear gas. The standoff came hours after thousands of protesters defied a government-imposed curfew, staying put in Cairo's Ramses Square and the streets, while soldiers and armored personnel carriers were deployed around the square and adjoining streets. The military warned it would ""deal firmly"" with anyone who breaks the curfew, raising fears of a repeat of Wednesday's military raids on pro-Morsy protest camps that left an estimated 580 dead and 4,000 wounded. Egyptian state-run Nile TV reported 821 Muslim Brotherhood members were arrested across Egypt on Friday on charges of rioting and creating violence. The same report quoted Interior Ministry as saying authorities seized seven hand grenades, five automatic weapons, pistols and 710 rounds. The clashes began Friday following afternoon prayers, when thousands of Muslim Brotherhood protesters demanding the return of Morsy took to the streets promising a day of rage. Another bloody day across country . Conflicting casualty figures were being reported: A medic at a Muslim Brotherhood-supported field hospital near Ramses Square said 54 people had been killed, according to the official al-Ahram news agency, while state-run Nile TV putting the number at 17 people killed and 40 wounded. In northern Egypt, at least 16 people were killed and 140 wounded in fighting between Morsy supporters and the military in the coastal city of Alexandria, Nile TV reported, citing medical officials. But al-Ahram put the number at 21, citing local health ministry officials. In nearby Suez City, soldiers moved late Friday against a number of pro-Morsy demonstrators attempting to camp out at a square after the curfew, al-Ahram reported. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The casualties have not been limited to Morsy supporters and security forces. A number of bystanders, residents and journalists have been killed as the violence has widened. Fighting also was reported between Morsy supporters and residents in the northeast city of Ismailia and in the Nile Delta cities of Tanta and Damietta during the curfew, the news channel reported. By nightfall Friday, state-run media reported sporadic fighting between roving bands of armed protesters and residents in Cairo, where military helicopters could be seen patrolling from the sky as soldiers fanned out across the streets. Smoke wafted through Ramses Square from a fire that engulfed a nearby commercial building. It was unclear what caused the fire. Earlier in the day, A CNN crew witnessed men in plainclothes standing next to military tanks and firing into crowds. The crew also saw that some in the crowd were armed. Security forces fired tear gas at a mass of people on a major bridge leading to the centrally located Ramses Square. Machine-gun fire was heard in central Cairo as a military helicopter flew overhead. Elsewhere in Cairo, armed groups were reportedly firing from rooftops, attempting to down a military surveillance helicopter, state-run media reported, citing security sources. Armed protesters also attacked a police station in central Cairo, killing the police chief, state-run EGYNews reported. Since Wednesday, 52 police officers have been killed, state television reported. Earlier reports of 64 dead were incorrect. State TV also said 25 police stations and 10 churches have been attacked. The interim government has blamed the Muslim Brotherhood for the attacks. At least 263 people, described by armed members of the Muslim Brotherhood, have been arrested across the country, according to the Egyptian Ministry of Information. ""The struggle to overthrow this illegitimate regime is an obligation,"" the Muslim Brotherhood said on its website Friday, while urging people to protest peacefully. Echoes of violence . The violence echoed the upheaval that preceded the popular uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak from power in 2011. The military removed Mubarak after protests against his authoritarian rule, but not before an estimated 840 people were killed. The generals yielded power to Morsy after elections, but the new president soon was accused of pursuing an Islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government. The military ousted Morsy from office on July 3, a move that triggered massive protests among his supporters. Morsy's supporters say the deposed president wasn't given a fair chance and that the military has returned to its authoritarian practices of the Mubarak era. The government reinforced the comparison by imposing the month-long state of emergency, a favored tactic of Mubarak. Morsy and key members of the Muslim Brotherhood have been detained. The most senior Muslim Brotherhood leader still at large, Essam el-Erian, said Thursday the protests will continue until Morsy is returned to office. ""They can arrest me and 100 of us, but they can't arrest every honorable citizen in Egypt,"" el-Erian told CNN. ""They can't stop this glorious revolution."" Military vehicles were deployed Friday across Cairo and Giza, taking up positions in squares and securing important institutions, EGYNews reported, citing security officials. The news agency said the military increased checkpoints at all entrances to Cairo to prevent the smuggling of arms to protesters. Police will use live ammunition to subdue any attack against police facilities, state media said. Western alarm . The escalating violence has alarmed the West, where leaders have long looked to Egypt as a stabilizing force in the region. French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for a meeting next week of European Union foreign ministers to coordinate a response to the violence in Egypt. The EU's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, called the rising casualty toll ""shocking."" ""Responsibility for this tragedy weighs heavily on the interim government, as well as on the wider political leadership in the country,"" she said. Egyptian authorities rejected criticism from U.S. President Barack Obama and other world leaders on Wednesday's ferocious clashes, which left at least 580 people dead after security forces broke up huge sit-ins in Cairo, according to the Health Ministry. Obama, who has resisted calls to cut off military aid to Egypt and label Morsy's ouster a coup, on Thursday stressed the United States would not support one political faction over another. Even predominantly Muslim nations voiced displeasure, with Turkey recalling its ambassador in Egypt in light of the crisis, a Turkish foreign ministry representative said. CNN's Reza Sayah and Raja Rezak reported from Cairo; Chelsea J. Carter wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Saskya Vandoorne, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Ian Lee, Frederik Pleitgen, Laura Smith-Spark, Greg Botelho, Michael Pearson and Holly Yan also contributed to this report.","NEW: More than 1,000 people are caught up in a standoff at a Cairo mosque, officials say .

"(CNN) -- OK, readers, let's have a debate, one of sports talk's favorites. Who is the best player in the NBA? Is it Kevin Durant, LeBron James or Kobe Bryant? Scroll down to the comments and sound off. Go, now. I'll wait. ... All done? Good. Now, how many of you called me short-sighted (or ""Obama-loving imbecile,"" if you're a troll) for neglecting to include the San Antonio Spurs' Tim Duncan? Not many, I venture, at least not if you're outside the Greater Alamo Area. But how can he objectively be omitted from the debate? ""His game is shrouded in fundamentals and not athleticism,"" said former NBA sharpshooter Steve Kerr, a TNT analyst who will call Saturday's Game 6 between James' Heat and the Indiana Pacers. ""What he does isn't flashy, isn't explosive. He prefers the shadow. He doesn't want to be in the spotlight."" Yet he's a winner. That can't be argued, and with his rÃ©sumÃ©, it's curious he doesn't get more credit -- and that less-talented fellows like Metta World Peace get more press, even if it's because of their antics. Fans profess to yearn for good guys, yet when presented with a stalwart, they yawn or change the channel. The recent news of Duncan's possible divorce from his wife of 11 years is one of the few, maybe only, instances of off-court negative press in his career. Kerr, whose 15-year playing career included four seasons with Duncan and the Spurs, said he can't explain it. ""Why do people watch reality TV? Why do people watch the Kardashians? Just consider your audience,"" he said. ""It's true that there's a fairly hypocritical nature, not just to sports fans but human beings. It's human nature to be fascinated by the bizarre or the crazy or the flashy and not the mundane."" For 16 years, the two-time NBA MVP has averaged a double-double, tallying about 20 points and 11 rebounds (plus more than three assists and two blocks) per outing. James, Durant and Bryant have impressive career stat lines but not double-doubles. Duncan's numbers are a smidgeon higher in the playoffs, which his Spurs have reached in every season since he joined the roster. None of the Trinity has reached the postseason every year. Then there are those rings: four of them, 1999, 2003, 2005 and 2007. James has one, Durant none. Bryant has five, a feat Duncan's teammates hope he will soon match as the Spurs sit at home waiting to learn who they'll face in the NBA Finals after dismantling the Memphis Grizzlies. Why well-rested Spurs have edge in Finals . ""Tim has laid the groundwork for how he wants his NBA career to be handled,"" TNT and NBATV analyst Mike Fratello said, explaining that Duncan has chosen to stay in one of the league's smallest markets, alongside a coach he trusts, Gregg Popovich. Before we delve any deeper, Fratello, who spent a collective 15 years coaching the Atlanta Hawks, Memphis Grizzlies and Cleveland Cavaliers, would like to make one thing clear: Durant doesn't belong in this debate. Not yet. ""It's unfair to compare Kevin Durant with Tim Duncan. Tim Duncan is the model of longevity, consistency and championships,"" he said. ""Is he a top three or four player? Yes, without question, but you can't include him in this conversation. What has he done in the playoffs that puts him in with Tim Duncan?"" Fair enough. Sorry, KD. We'll talk again in five years. Back to Duncan. Are you starting to see why the he'll never be voted prom king? The father of two simply doesn't care about such things -- popularity, ratings. He cares only about Ws, and to many fans, that isn't sexy unless a player makes an ass of himself or talks trash incessantly. Grantland's and ESPN's Bill Simmons, a Boston Celtics fan, posted a rare (for sportswriters) ode to Duncan this week. In it, he called the Spurs power forward the best player of his generation, better than Bryant, a guy who ""probably led the league for 16 straight years just in throwing an arm around a teammate's shoulder."" ""It's the little things that make him special. Offensively, he can destroy you in the low post, he can run perfect pick and rolls with any decent guard and when all else fails, he can just bank that pretty 15-footer. Seriously, does anyone else in basketball have that shot?"" Simmons asked in the video. ""Since 1997, you never heard about Duncan dogging it, calling out teammates, showing up heavy for training camp, complaining about money, asking for a trade, giving himself a nickname. Of course, people found that boring. ... I'm sorry. Since when was winning boring?"" It's a fine question and one that J.R. Wilco, editor-in-chief of the Spurs blog Pounding the Rock, has heard before. After reading a CNN story from last year about the Spurs' supposed inability to tantalize, he handed the rock Thursday to one of his blog's longtime commenters, Lauri (bold and italics imparted by the commenter): . ""...the whole 'Duncan is boring' argument is so effing tautological. No, he's not boring. He's unknown. Because you never feature him. Can he be charming and funny? Of course he can. Is he a fighter and a champion? You best believe it, and if you don't, look up. See those banners? And the emotion he shows on the court is that much more powerful for being rare. You can promote that, you capitalist a-holes, if the money that promotion brings is really all that matters to you about this game. You can promote anything if you come at it from the right angle. But you're lazy, NBA suits, and you like to keep the public lazy, and you take the path of least resistance â€” entertainment over enlightenment."" Wilco also believes the ""boring"" argument overlooks that the Spurs' style of play is by design. It's not that Popovich is averse to the flashy, Wilco said; it's more that he's ""anti-bad play,"" and the path to victory is rarely paved with quadruple crossovers, one-handed alley-oops and no-look-behind-the-back passes. Pop and Duncan also famously avoid the media, a practice that might not jibe well with larger markets like Los Angeles and New York. Wilco recalls one of his contributors, Aaron Preine, telling him last year he saw Duncan actually pump a fist -- a gametime rarity over the big man's career -- after realizing that no reporters wanted to talk to him in the locker room after a playoff game. Even on Duncan's website, there is an FAQ largely about his personal life that, tellingly, hasn't been updated since Duncan was 27, about a decade ago. His milquetoast answers average 4.6 words and include this bombshell: Asked what wish he'd want granted if given the choice, he replied, ""Good health."" As opposed to his own island or a solid-gold Lamborghini Aventador. ""They don't play to the press. That means there's less meat for the marketing machine to chew up and process,"" Wilco said. ""The Spurs' entire organization, they really think it's a distraction. The rest of that stuff is external to their job of winning games."" And since 1997, when the 6-foot-11 Wake Forest grad first donned the silver and black as the NBA draft's No. 1 overall pick, no American sports team has done that job better. it's hard to imagine that's not primarily a product of Duncan's no-nonsense efficiency, though Fratello points out that Popovich and the Spurs' front office -- as well as the personnel it's paired with Duncan -- deserve credit. What will fifth ring mean for Duncan's legacy? To truly appreciate Duncan, you have to take the long view. So where does he rank among players all time? We'll start with Kerr because of his credentials. Sure, Fratello coached greatness in Dominique Wilkins and others, but Kerr won titles with the Spurs and with Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls teams, so he's actually passed greatness the ball. Kerr said Bill Russell, Jordan and Magic Johnson fill out his top three, ""and at that point, you can throw Tim Duncan up against anybody, in my mind."" A fifth title -- should the Spurs dispatch the winner of the Heat-Pacers series -- would elevate Duncan to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar status because of the time between trophies. Abdul-Jabbar won six championships between 1971 and 1988. ""Star players normally don't win until they reach their prime. ... Titles come in a cozy span of six to eight years, not 13,"" Kerr said. ""It speaks to his brilliance over his entire career."" Fratello sees it similarly and puts Duncan in the top five of all time, along with Kerr's top three and Abdul-Jabbar. ""Tim Duncan certainly belongs in that company. It's rarefied air that he's in,"" he said. Wilco said ""the greatest ever"" debates are heavily dependent on ""who's talking, where they're talking and who they're talking to."" He's not sure, as a Spurs blogger, how much mileage he can derive by putting Duncan in an all-time team of players at every position, he said. He and the other contributors to Pounding the Rock, however, confidently call Duncan ""GOAT PUFF,"" an acronym (sort of) for Greatest Of All Time Power Forward. Told of Fratello's and Kerr's assessments, Wilco softened his resistance to ranking his team's perennial all-star. ""I wouldn't disagree with those guys,"" he said. ""The top five is an excellent place for him."" TNT, NBATV and CNN are owned by the same parent company, Time Warner.","Experts: Tim Duncan is often left out of ""greatest in NBA"" debates for no good reason .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- There are a lot of Marys in Mary Jane McGill's extended family, so each one gets a special name. Mary who lives in Roslindale, Massachusetts, is ""Mary Rozy."" Mary from Everett, Massachusetts, is called ""Mary Everett."" And McGill? She's ""Mary Google."" When Mary Nee, back second from left. needed an in-home caregiver, her daughter turned to the Internet. ""I use it for everything,"" McGill says of the search engine. ""My family kids me about it."" One day last week, McGill used Google in a way even she never dreamed of: to find care for her mother, who has Alzheimer's disease and suddenly needed someone living at her house 24/7. Her search quickly turned up a number of the many resources that can help you connect with in-home help for a parent who's aging, ill or both. And this week, Empowered Patient will save you some searching time. Up until last month, McGill's father, Tom Nee, had been taking care of his wife, but then he died of cancer. ""He died sooner than we expected, and we were in a complete state of panic about who would take care of Mom,"" McGill says. ""She can't be left alone. It would be like leaving a toddler alone. But we don't want her in a nursing home, either."" McGill was relieved, then, to receive a phone call from her aunt, who said she knew of a woman who could care for her mother. ""But then she came over, and I interviewed her, and she was horrible. She was like a prison guard,"" McGill says. ""I thought to myself, 'I can't do this. I can't have this woman living with my mother.' "" McGill didn't know what to do. ""I went home and at 1 in the morning, through my tears, Googled 'caring parents Alzheimer's.' Up came this Web site that helps people find caregivers. I input all my information, and by 7 the next morning I had 10 e-mails, all from legitimate places,"" she says.  Watch more on helpful Web sites » . Six days later, a ""loving, wonderful"" caregiver moved in with her mother 24 hours a day, five days a week. On the weekends, McGill and her siblings, who are all working, raising children or both, take turns being with their mother. The older woman is often confused, can't cook and can't drive to get anything she needs in her suburban Boston town. ""I never dreamed I'd find someone on the Internet, because you have to really trust someone who's living in your mother's house, so you can walk away and sleep at night,"" McGill says. ""I never would have thought you'd use such an impersonal tool to find something so personal."" But these days, more and more people are using the Internet to find a caregiver instead of, or along with, traditional methods of finding care, such as asking friends and family. Here, from caregiving experts, are Web sites that link you to caregivers, plus sites that offer other services. 1. To find a caregiver in your area, visit these sites. McGill used Eldercarelink. Another, Home Health Compare, is run by Medicare and allows you to compare home health care agencies in your area.

"(CNN) -- It was on the pages of newspapers and in the coveted aisle seat on television's ""At the Movies"" that the world met Roger Ebert, the passionate lover and sometimes combative critic of film who virtually defined cinema critique for a generation. But in his final years, when cancer had robbed him of his jawbone and whittled away his once ample frame, it was social media, particularly Twitter, that let Ebert not only keep talking, but also interact with his fans, and foes, more freely and personally than ever. ""Twitter for me performs the function of a running conversation,"" Ebert wrote in June 2010, about eight months after he signed up for the site and five years after losing his vocal chords and part of his lower jaw to thyroid and salivary gland cancer. ""For someone who cannot speak, it allows a way to unload my zingers and one-liners."" He wrote that he'd sworn never to become a ""Twit"" -- that he'd been sure nothing worthwhile could be communicated in 140 characters. But, in its way, the site, with its fast-paced microbursts of info, was perfect for a man who had never shied away from snark, whether arguing with professional foil Gene Siskel or ripping gashes into ""Freddy Got Fingered"" or ""The Brown Bunny."" ""Twitter is now a part of my daystream,"" Ebert wrote. ""I check in first thing every morning, and return at least once an hour until bedtime. I'm offline, of course, during movies, and don't even usually take my iPhone. The only tweeting I've done with mobile devices was when our Internet went down one day, and when my laptop was lost in Cannes. But you can be sure that before I write the next three paragraphs I will tweet something."" If Twitter was made for Ebert, Ebert was, in the end, made for Twitter. ""Roger really understood social media,"" said Christina Warren, senior tech analyst with Mashable, a CNN content partner. ""He instinctively 'got it'."" Remembering Roger Ebert: Tweets pour in . Forget the need to continue the long-form journalism that won Ebert a Pulitzer Prize. He had his blog, and his Chicago Sun-Times column, for that. Twitter was where Ebert continued talking about movies, politics, life and the universe the same way he'd once done over mugs of beer at his beloved Chicago ale houses. He had more than 840,000 Twitter followers. But while many Twitter users with a dose of celebrity use the site as a self-promotional megaphone, for Ebert it was a two-way radio. ""The best part about the way Ebert used Twitter was that it wasn't just a one-way conversation,"" Warren said. ""He would debate and argue with his followers. That sort of true interaction is really rare for someone of his stature and celebrity. ... It was a new way to really engage with the community -- and even with new fans -- in a way that was more immediate and more instantaneous."" In the hours after his death became public Thursday, Twitter users recalled their interactions with him on the site. Movie questions he'd answered. Direct messages he would send to compliment a tweet he enjoyed. Even heated debates they'd engaged in, 140 characters at a time. Opinion: What the Internet owes to Roger Ebert . Freed largely from the ""old media"" standard of public impartiality, Ebert mixed it up lustily at times on topics ranging from video games to politics. He was a harsh critic of vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin and the tea party movement, which he decried as a phony cause ginned up by political operatives to manipulate voters. It was that back-and-forth that displayed the Web's ugly side. From dark, often anonymous perches behind their computer screens, trolls responded to Ebert's opinions with hateful mockery of his disease and the toll it had taken upon him. ""I mean honestly. How many pieces need to fall off @ebertchicago before he gets the hint to shut the ---- up?"" one blogger tweeted. It was part of a nasty string of tweets after Ebert criticized some California high-school students who pointedly wore U.S. flag T-shirts to school on Cinco de Mayo. ""You know, @ebertchicago, I'm not as expert on flag etiquette as you,"" went another. ""Tell me, which do I fly when you die of cancer?"" The man who penned the scripts for the bawdy Russ Meyer exploitation flicks ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" and ""Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens"" could no doubt have gone slur-for-slur with them. Instead, he responded with the sort of surprising grace that had always accompanied his brusquer moments. ""Dear TeePee Tweeters making fun of my cancer: You want ugly?"" he wrote, using his own tea party shorthand. ""For that, you have to look at a mind, not a face."" The social-media voice he developed was, in a way, a natural evolution for Ebert. An early investor in Google, Ebert took his work to the Internet much sooner than many of his traditional-media counterparts, scoring a Webby Award along the way. But in a TED talk in 2011, Ebert acknowledged that the full impact of technology didn't fully register on him until his cancer fight began. ""It makes me incredibly fortunate to live at this moment in history ... ,"" Ebert said as the words he typed on a Macbook were broadcast via a text-to-speech app. ""We live in the age of the internet, which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness. And because of it, I can communicate as well as I ever could."" He added, ""For me, the Internet began as a useful tool and now has become something I rely on for my actual daily existence. ... I feel as if my blog, my e-mail, Twitter and Facebook have given me a substitute for everyday conversation."" It served him well to the end. Ebert's final tweet, sent Wednesday, was a link to a blog post announcing that he'd be stepping back from some duties ... taking a ""leave of presence,"" as he put it. The final words of that post? ""Thank you for going on this journey with me. I'll see you at the movies.""","When cancer stole his ability to speak, Roger Ebert went to Twitter for ""zingers and one-liners""

"New Delhi (CNN) -- A grid failure cut power supplies in northern India on Monday, hitting rail and road transport for hours in the country's worst blackout in a decade, authorities said. The outage held up at least 300 trains in the region, Indian railway spokesman Anil Kumar Saxena told CNN. India's Power System Corporation Limited reported the collapse at 2.35 a.m. local time. Officials say it affected seven states in northern India, home to more than 350 million people. Read about a train fire in India that kills 32 . Residents spent overnight drenched in sweat amid humid weather, and many backup power systems had run out by daybreak. Power was partially restored after about six hours, authorities said. ""When the northern grid failed, we started taking power from eastern and western grids,"" Indian Power Minister Sushilkumar Shinde told reporters. ""We will take some power from Bhutan, too,"" he said. The blackout left passengers stranded at train stations, and signal failures caused traffic snarls that choked the Indian capital's already congested roads during office hours. Indians, however, have been no stranger to power cuts, which become more common during summer every year when demand shoots up. But Shinde, who ordered an investigation into Monday's outage, said the last time that an entire grid failed in north India was 10 years ago. Although it's Asia's third-largest economy, India still heavily depends on coal for its expanding energy needs. Of the nation's total installed capacity of 205,340 megawatts, less than 3% comes from nuclear sources, data posted on the power ministry's website show. And according to figures from the Central Electricity Authority, the nation suffered a supply shortfall of 8.6% in June. In a statement, the country's top business lobby, the Confederation of Indian Industry, called for immediate reforms in the power sector. ""The increasing gap between the demand and supply of electricity has been a matter for concern,"" it said as it urged boosting coal availability to the country's power plants. ""Today's outage is an urgent reminder for addressing these issues as a priority,"" it added.","Outage held up at least 300 trains in the region, Indian railway spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- International cricketer Steven Davies has received the support of his England colleagues and team bosses after becoming the sport's first active professional player to announce that he is gay. Davies, a wicketkeeper-batsman with the county Surrey who has played in 13 limited-overs internationals for England, made his revelations in a newspaper interview with The Daily Telegraph published on Monday. ""I feel now is the right time to be open about my sexuality. Those close to me have known for a while and have been nothing but supportive and understanding,"" he told the England Wales and Cricket Board website. ""I'd like to thank Surrey and the ECB, as well as the England players and coaching staff. They have all offered me their full backing from the moment I told them. ""My focus now is to play the best cricket I can for Surrey and get back into the England side. I am still the same person and I want to be remembered as a good cricketer, not a gay cricketer."" The 24-year-old was not selected for the World Cup being played in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, but told coach Andy Flower about his sexuality before the tournament started this month. ""This is something Steve chose to discuss with myself and the squad some time ago. I would like to make it very clear that Steve is first and foremost a very talented cricketer and a valued member of the England set-up,"" Flower said on the ECB website, which also featured a statement from its managing director Hugh Morris. Flower added: ""His private life is his own concern and has absolutely no bearing on his ability to excel at the very highest level in international sport and I have no doubt that he will continue to work hard to regain a place in the England squad. ""Steve has had and will continue to have the full respect and support of the entire squad and everyone involved in England cricket."" It is rare for sportspeople to make revelations about their sexuality while still playing, and the closest precedent in cricket was Alan Hansford, a player with English county Sussex who admitted he was gay after retiring in 1992. Davies told The Daily Telegraph that he had been inspired by the example of Welsh rugby star Gareth Thomas, who revealed his homosexuality two years ago. ""It just showed me it can be done. He was brave enough to stand up and say who he was,"" Davies said. ""It was a very courageous thing to do, so if I can help anyone else like he helped me, then that would be great."" Former England international Vikram Solanki, now chairman of his country's Professional Cricketers' Association, said Davies' sexuality was no secret within the cricket community. ""Many of those he plays with and against have known about this for some time, and none of them regard it as anything other than an entirely personal matter,"" Solanki said. Davies also received the backing of openly gay British actor, writer and television presenter Stephen Fry. ""Brave, charming, modest and inspiring. No big deal yet of course a huge deal. Top man Steven Davies,"" Fry wrote on social networking website Twitter. Meanwhile, the West Indies thrashed the Netherlands by 215 runs at the 2011 World Cup in New Delhi on Monday. The two-time champions bounced back from last week's defeat by South Africa to get off the mark in Group B, posting a total of 330-8 in 50 overs as Chris Gayle top-scored with 80 and Kieron Pollard smashed 60 off only 27 balls faced. Pollard scored the third quickest half-century in the tournament's history. Teammate Kemar Roach then became only the sixth bowler to take a hat-trick at a World Cup when he polished off the Dutch line-up with three successive wickets to end with figures of 6-27 in an innings of just 115. It was a disappointing day for the beaten team, who last week scored 292 before losing against England.","English cricketer Steven Davies makes public announcement about his sexuality .

"(CNN) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad warned Western nations against supporting rebel groups battling his armed forces, predicting the militants will one day strike against the United States and others. In an hourlong interview with Syria state TV network al-Ikhbariya, al-Assad claimed the West is supporting al Qaeda sympathizers in Syria as he says they did during the Libyan uprising. He compared the support of rebels in Syria now to the backing of fighters in Afghanistan during their war with Soviet troops in the 1980s. ""The West has paid heavily for funding al Qaeda in its early stages. Today it is doing the same in Syria, Libya and other places, and will pay a heavy price in the heart of Europe and the United States,"" he said, according to a CNN translation. Al-Assad also spoke harshly of Jordan, saying thousands of fighters were crossing the border to take part in the civil war in Syria. It called it ""illogical"" for Jordanian officials to deny this was happening. He guaranteed victory in the conflict, which began two years ago and which has led to the deaths of more than 70,000 people. according to the United Nations. ""There is no option but victory, otherwise it will be the end of Syria, and I don't think that any Syrian citizen will accept such an option,"" he said. He referred to the rebels as ""thieves"" and ""mercenaries"" who are being paid by Western nations. ""There is an attempt to invade Syria, the forces are coming from outside, from different nationalities, they are using different tactics from what the colonization powers have used,"" he said. On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel ordered up to 200 troops to Jordan. The new deployment will include communications and intelligence specialists who will assist the Jordanians and ""be ready for military action"" if President Barack Obama were to order it, a Defense Department official told CNN. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was going to meet with envoy Lakhdar Brahimi on Wednesday to discuss the situation in Syria. ""The prospects may seem dim, but I remain convinced that a political solution is possible. This is the only way to end the bloodshed and bring about a new and democratic Syria.

"(CNN)  -- China and Vietnam have settled a lengthy border dispute nearly 30 years after a month-long war that left tens of thousands of people dead, state-run media reported. The settlement of the dispute -- which covered the land border between the two countries -- came during a December 28-31 meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam, Xinhua news agency reported, citing a joint statement issued by the two governments on Wednesday. The deal settled the remaining issues from a 1999 China-Vietnam land boundary treaty. Xinhua called the settlement ""a major event of historical significance"" in relations between the two countries. A ceremony marking the agreement and building of land border markers will be held later, the news agency said. The border dispute arose after China, which supported North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, invaded its southern neighbor in February 1979 -- two months after Vietnam invaded Cambodia and ousted the pro-Beijing Pol Pot regime. The 29-day incursion ended with the last Chinese troops leaving on March 19 -- and without having forced the Vietnamese out of Cambodia. During the next two decades, both sides stationed hundreds of thousands of troops along the border until the 1999 treaty. The two sides are still in disagreement over the Spratly islands, a chain in the South China Sea claimed by Vietnam, China, Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines.","Border dispute arose after a one-month war between China and Vietnam in 1979 .

"(CNN) -- In the third act of the opera ""Aida,"" there is an aria, ""O Patria Mia,"" that begins, ""Oh, my country, I shall never see you again."" On January 3, 1985, after Leontyne Price sang those words, the audience at the Metropolitan Opera House stopped her with a four-minute ovation. Price first performed at the Met 24 years earlier, and this night, this performance would be her last on an opera stage. During the curtain call, she was showered with flowers and confetti as the audience applauded her performance, and career, for 25 minutes. She stood there, beautiful, gracious, mouthing the words ""thank you"" to admirers who clearly did not want to see her go. This, ladies and gentlemen, is what a diva looks like. I'm not sure when the meaning of the word went from someone with the talent and life journey of Price to the cast of ""The Real Housewives of (insert city here),"" but I know its erosion epitomizes all that is wrong with pop culture today: Oscar nominations surrendered to actors for carrying a tune, singing competitions judged by people who can't really sing, celebrities who are famous for being famous. Kanye West is ""a creative genius,"" but the fact that he repeatedly needs to tell people that makes him more of an anti-diva. True divas don't need to self-promote. That's what their loyal subjects are for. Price didn't request a 25-minute ovation. Her moment commanded one. ""I'm trying to exhibit good taste,"" Price said of her goodbye. ""I prefer to leave standing up, like a well-mannered guest at a party."" I long for the day when phrases such as ""good taste"" or ""well-mannered"" are uttered, let alone displayed, by the people we refer to as divas today. We've always had bubble gum and fluff and raunch, but we used to recognize those things for what they were. If being a talentless bad girl is what pays the bills, fine ... but we never used to refer to these train wrecks as ""divas."" If it sounds as if I'm blowing things out of proportion, consider this: There is a reality TV show called ""R&B Divas"" with a cast filled with one-hit wonders. It's as if eye-rolling has become the only qualification to be considered a precious gem. The reality is, today's ""divas"" are more likely to be pieces of charcoal: mass-produced, quick to flame out and apt to leave behind a filthy residue on everything they touch. The reason why the notion of a ""diva"" was reserved for the main female singer in an opera company, like a Price or Jessye Norman -- who sings in German, French and Italian and served as the inspiration for the 1982 film ""Diva"" -- is because the level of talent these women possess was thought of as rare and thus made their demanding personalities tolerable. Their recordings, treasured; their presence, captivating; their performances, transcending all others. Think Streisand, Houston, Streep. Today, we use the word so frequently, hardly anyone knows what it means anymore. For example, after this year's Grammys, Buzzfeed listed its 16 greatest divas moments and included the pitch-challenged Taylor Swift -- twice. An ABCNews.com headline actually read: ""Kim Kardashian's Diva Delivery."" Entertainment Weekly once named Rihanna ""Diva of the Year."" The very existence of such an honor should provoke nausea, because there are not enough true divas in the world to sustain such an annual award. Bit by bit, we have replaced art that is meant to be slow-cooked art with that which is microwavable (and forgettable). Thus our movie theaters are dominated by remakes and sequels, best-selling authors plagiarize, belching is considered witty. VH1 Divas is a fundraiser music showcase created to support the Save the Music Foundation. The nonprofit was designed to help restore instrumental music programs in public schools after so many were lost due to budget cuts. In the beginning, the ""divas"" who performed were along the lines of Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, Mariah Carey ... voices that were iconic, even if you didn't particularly care for their music. In the latest installment of the series, Miley Cyrus was among the headliners. Miley Cyrus. Diva. No, I don't think I'm overreacting.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- During the summer of 2009, Egyptians from all walks of life waited in hopeful anticipation for the arrival of newly-elected U.S. President Barack Obama in Cairo. The city spent weeks preparing for the visit. Streets were shut down, buildings lining the route to Cairo University were repainted, and the dome under which Obama was set to give his speech renovated. Egyptians listened to the president's speech with much hope -- and when it was over, local talk shows spent days analyzing his words. American politics had gone on tour to Egypt, a place that has historically watched American politics very closely. But Obama's visit in 2009 is yet another reminder of how drastically different the situation in Egypt has become since the January 25th revolution last year. It is hard to tell there was a revolution in many parts of Cairo just months ago. The rubble is cleared from downtown streets after each new battle between police and protesters, the blood washed away quickly. Deposed President Hosni Mubarak's National Democratic Party building is still standing, but it has been burnt from the inside out. Berlin Wall-style partitions erected by the army block several of the six or so roads leading to Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution. As the 2012 U.S. presidential race heats up and the primaries get under way, many Egyptians are too busy with their own concerns to follow along. It has been more than a year since the uprising started, and while Cairo has cleaned itself up, the city remains mired in turmoil and confusion over the transitional process to its own democracy. Cairo, like many major cities in the world, has historically observed the U.S. presidential election closely and with a great deal of skepticism. But the public mindset, typically littered with guesswork and conspiracy theories, is now one of indifference. In neighborhoods across Cairo, men and women in smoke-filled cafes tune in to daily political talk shows discussing Egypt's own crisis and fears for the future -- a new phenomenon in post-Mubarak days -- on televisions blaring so loud that entire neighborhoods can hear them. In the bars and cafes along the crowded, traffic-choked streets of downtown Cairo, people are too busy making the news to watch it unfold on television. At the Greek Club, or inside the historic Cafe Riche, with its warm amber-tinted windows and walls lined with photos of Egypt's great intellectuals, Cairo's political activists and academics gather over beers to talk about the great issues of the day. We used to talk a lot more about U.S. politics than we do now. Friends of mine, avid followers of the U.S. political scene who used to be able to name various Congressmen and their policies, just aren't paying as much attention this time around. I believe the U.S. election is incredibly important -- U.S. foreign policy affects much of the world, and the president is the chief diplomat. But Republicans have yet to choose a candidate -- they've not found that ace, that someone fresh who can challenge Obama, and that's making it hard for people to pay attention right now. Egyptians watched the 2004 U.S. elections closely because they felt they had a stake in the outcome, especially considering the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, Cairo closely watched as America neared the election of the first African-American president, the candidate of hope and change. Egyptians are viewing the 2012 elections with a certain amount of cynicism. All of the superficial reasons why Egyptians admired Obama have melted away, and what is left in some corners is a feeling that he wasn't as quick to embrace our push for freedom as he could have been. While many Egyptians feel George W. Bush had a clear position on democracy and freedom of speech in Egypt, Obama came to Cairo in 2009 and made promises to the Egyptian people that were not necessarily kept. And recent events have convinced some that the Obama administration is not so keen on fulfilling its promises to supporting freedom, democracy, and civil liberties. Even though Bush is generally regarded negatively for his ""War on Terror,"" it is interesting to hear some engaged political activists say that they miss the Bush days, preferring his support of freedom of speech in Egypt when compared to the Obama administration. One long-time activist said that during the days of Bush, then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice made several visits to Egypt, underlining the importance of democracy and freedom of speech. In 2005, he said, the fruits of that pressure resulted in ""relatively fair"" parliamentary elections, particularly when compared to the second round of parliamentary polls and the 2010 elections. For the first time in recent history, our own political news is the dominant issue, so local media coverage of the race to the White House so far has been dismal at best. And as our revolution continues, so clashes between protesters and security forces and the onset of uprisings in neighboring countries have saturated the news cycle. As the newly elected parliament here delves into its first session, Egyptians for the first time are experiencing their own taste of democracy, with all the troubles that comes along with it. Egyptians are watching the newly elected members of parliament closely, watching as they become household names, waiting to review their performances. In the past, many Egyptians sought out hope and salvation in the actions of foreign governments -- but this electoral season, after a year of real change in Egypt, many Egyptians learned that hope will have to come, or at least start, from within.","Egyptian revolution has diminished normally avid following of U.S. politics .

"Editor's note: Deborah E. Lipstadt is currently Resnick Invitational Scholar at the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Dorot Professor of Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies at Emory University. She is the author of ""History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier."" For more information, read here . Deborah Lipstadt was preparing to give a lecture on Holocaust denial when the shooting began. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- I write this from my office in the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum where I have been privileged to have had a fellowship for the past semester. Up until Wednesday at 12:50 p.m., it had been a perfect visit. Everything a scholar could hope for: exceptional scholarly resources and a magnificent museum staff. When I arrive each morning, long before the doors open to the public, I always marvel at the people waiting to enter. They represent every religion, ethnic group, and nationality. In the past few weeks I've seen hundreds of school groups as well as Annapolis midshipmen, scouts, FBI trainees and police force members. They come to learn about the consequences of hate and prejudice. And Wednesday the entire world was given a graphic reminder of what that hatred can produce when a white supremacist, anti-Semitic, Holocaust denier, entered the building and allegedly shot a guard before being wounded himself. I was on the level below the shooting in a classroom preparing to begin a lecture on Holocaust denial. I was going to speak about those who claim, among other things, that 6 million Jews were not murdered by the Nazis, that the gas chambers never existed, that the ""Diary of Anne Frank"" is a fraud, and that the survivors who claim it happened are psychopaths and liars. They contend that the Jews have made this all up to win the sympathy of the world and to get reparations -- i.e. money -- from the Germans and other perpetrators. It is classic anti-Semitism. As I was about to begin the lecture, we heard the shots. Then came the screams followed by an eerie silence. We locked the door and waited. Soon a staff member told us to exit the building at once. As we walked out of the classroom hundreds of people poured out of bathrooms, classrooms, and other areas to which they had been herded in the moments after the shooting. We gathered on the grassy area across from the museum and within seconds museum staff appeared with signs: 1,2, 3, 4. Visitors were directed to gather in front of the sign for the floor they were on when they were evacuated. This enabled families, friends, and school groups to find one another. Afraid that there might be another shooter lurking about, the police moved us north towards the Washington Monument. Slowly the school groups and other visitors left. Those of us associated with the museum just waited. There was nothing for us to do but there seemed to be a certain comfort in staying together. I stood with a Holocaust survivor who had been at the Visitors Services desk. Someone brought a wheelchair for her. She brushed it aside and pointed at a far younger staff person who had a cast on his leg: ""He needs it more than I."" We soon heard that the alleged shooter was an 88-year-old white supremacist. I quickly said: ""I can assure you that he was not just a white supremacist."" And, as predicted, we learned that he is an anti-Semite, a denier and a racist. It is a jigsaw puzzle which always fits together. In short, he was a hater who needs no rational reason to exercise his hatred. Then we learned of the death of Officer Johns, a really tall man, who always had a smile and a kind word. He would often kid me about all the stuff I seemed to be perpetually schlepping. I had seen him about 40 minutes before the shooting when I passed the entrance on my way to the classroom where I would be lecturing. The lobby was crowded, a normal day at the Holocaust Museum. Now no day that ends here quietly and safely will be normal. I sit in this building surrounded by offices in which computers blink, half filled coffee cups are all over the place, and purses and briefcases sit near people's desks. When the SWAT team reached this floor and evacuated people they were told ""Leave. NOW."" As one of my office neighbors later said to me, ""When men with guns and dogs tell you to leave you don't stop and gather up your stuff. You leave. NOW. "" In the library, laptops are sitting on tables and backpacks are on the floor. All the paraphernalia is normal. Just the people are missing. We who were here have so much to be thankful for: . For Officer Johns who gave his life defending this museum. For the guards who did precisely what they are trained to do and did it so very well. For the fact that this man's hate resulted in the death of ""only"" one man and not of scores more. Above all, we have to be thankful for the existence of this place. It is a place that stands to teach about the consequences of hatred and prejudice. This week it taught that lesson in the most horrifying of ways. Today the building will be full again. There will be staff members and, we hope, people who have decided not to let the haters win. They know that the only way to defeat those who spread evil is by not letting them stop us. Who ever thought that there would be a time when coming to a museum which teaches about hatred, prejudice and anti-Semitism would itself be an act of defiance? That time is now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Deborah Lipstadt.","Deborah Lipstadt: I was about to start lecture on Holocaust denial when shots began .

"(CNN) -- International flights gradually resumed at Kenya's main airport Thursday after a blaze sent orange flames shooting in the air and brought East Africa's largest aviation hub to a standstill. There were no reports of casualties in the Wednesday blaze at Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. A day after the fire started, airport officials said they have set up tents to temporarily service the international area. Several flights, including from London, Thailand and Uganda, landed at the airport as it slowly came back to life, airport authorities said. Other international flights took off from the airport, including to South Sudan and South Africa, the Kenya Airports Authority tweeted.  It also reported departures and arrivals of local flights. The blaze destroyed large parts of the international terminal, leaving the arrivals section in charred ruins and strewn with debris. Chunks of corrugated metal hung from the roof after it caved in. Officials gingerly walked through the ruins, ducking the mangled rubble. No further details have emerged on the cause of the fire, which erupted at dawn Wednesday and raged for hours before it was contained. ""The cause of the fire is being investigated. There is no reason to speculate at this point. There was no loss of life,"" said Manoah Esipisu, a government spokesman. Flights were rerouted to airports in Mombasa and Eldoret, and also to neighboring nations. The fire briefly rekindled early Thursday morning, but officials said it was put out. More international services are expected to resume Thursday, said Michael Kamau, the nation's transportation and infrastructure secretary. The blaze shut down East Africa's busiest airport and was a major blow to tourism, a major source of revenue for the nation. The effects of the fire may also reverberate worldwide -- the nation distributes flowers and agricultural products to Europe thorough the airport. A third of all flowers in Europe come from Kenya, with a special emphasis on rose production. The Kenya Flower Council advised growers to hold back the cutting of their products until airport operations are resolved. Kenya is East Africa's largest economy and has made a big push to carve out its space in the global market. Tea, horticulture and tourism all bring in about $1 billion in revenue each year. The airport also offers connections to Europe, the Middle East and other African nations, with about 16,000 passengers passing through daily, officials said. After a visit to the scene Wednesday, President Uhuru Kenyatta reassured travelers and the aviation industry that the nation is doing everything to ensure a return to normalcy, the government spokesman said. Some witnesses said the fire began in the customs section, while others said it started in the duty-free area, parts of which had been demolished as part of airport construction last week. U.S. President Barack Obama offered America's support to the nation after the fire, which occurred on the 15th anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. In a call to Kenyatta, Obama expressed condolences to the loved ones of those killed and wounded in the terror attacks, and highlighted his commitment to fighting terrorism, the White House said in a prepared statement. In the 1998 near-simultaneous attacks, 224 people died and about 4,500 were wounded. The fire also came days after the United States issued a worldwide travel alert and closed embassies and consulates in large areas of the Middle East and Africa, though Kenya and Tanzania were not among them. CNN's Lillian Leposo and John Defterios contributed to this report.","NEW: Airport officials say they've set up tents to service the international area .

"(CNN) -- The picture has created an uproar in Venezuela. It shows Venezuelan lawmaker Adel El Zabayar, holding an assault rifle and posing with two armed soldiers. What makes the photo particularly striking is that the 49-year-old legislator is in Syria supporting President Bashar Al-Assad. El Zabayar was born in Venezuela, but his parents are from Syria. The lawmaker, who was little known before his trip to Syria, says he's willing to fight for the country of his forebears if the United States attacks the Arab nation. In another picture, El Zabayar appears in the middle of a group of apparent military men. Like most of the others, he's holding an assault rifle. In a recent phone interview with CNN en EspaÃ±ol from Damascus, where he's visiting his ailing mother, El Zabayar called the U.S. government hypocritical. ""It has a double standard when it comes to al Qaeda,"" he said. ""We need to think about that. The world has to start a debate about international terrorism."" El Zabayar is a member of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. He accompanied the late President Hugo Chavez when he met with al-Assad in Syria in 2009. The Venezuelan National Assembly granted El Zabayar a leave of absence to travel to Syria, and President Nicolas Maduro praises him as a hero. ""He has decided to give his life for his land, the land of his grandparents, for the peace and dignity of the Syrian people. Well done, Mr. Legislator. You have followed your conscience,"" Maduro said on Venezuelan national television this week. Venezuela has a sizable population of ethnic Arabs who have significant clout and political power. Tareck El Aissami, who has Syrian and Lebanese parents, is the governor of Aragua state and former minister of the interior and justice. Favored by Chavez, he has remained powerful under the new administration. Just like El Aissami, a large portion of the Arab community in Venezuela has aligned itself with the socialist government. Members of the Arab-Venezuelan Union and the Sheik Ibrahim Mosque in Caracas marched last September to support Chavez's re-election. A group of Venezuelans of Arab origin protested outside the U.S. Embassy in Caracas this week. They chanted ""Long live Syria!"" and ""Down with the empire!"" They were waiving Syrian flags, and one demonstrator displayed a picture of Chavez and al-Assad holding hands up in a sign of victory. Hindu Anderi, one of the protest organizers, suggested the United States has ulterior motives on Syria. ""Enough of wars motivated by oil and energy resources. We don't believe the fairy tale of chemical weapons used against the civilian population in Syria by the government of Bashar al-Assad,"" Anderi said. Maduro also shares that point of view. In a recently published open letter to President Barack Obama, the Venezuelan leader called a possible attack against Syria ""unfair, disastrous and terrifying."" The rhetoric from Caracas, consistently anti-American for more than a decade, may heat up even more if the United States takes action on Syria. El Zabayar, the Syrian-Venezuelan lawmaker, has a rather rosy view of the current situation in Syria, where a popular uprising spiraled into a civil war in 2011. ""Everything is great,"" he said. ""People are out in the street doing their normal things. You have to remember that before being invaded by foreign mercenaries from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Syria used to be known as one of the safest countries in the world."" Journalist Osmary Hernandez in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report.","Venezuelan legislator Adel El Zabayar is in Syria supporting President Bashar Al-Assad .

"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (CNN) -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's husband won't comply with a subpoena issued by state lawmakers investigating her firing of Alaska's public safety commissioner, the McCain-Palin campaign said Thursday. Gov. Sarah Palin has refused to cooperate with an inquiry into the firing of her public safety commissioner. A state Senate committee is scheduled to meet Friday to take statements from the 12 people they subpoenaed last week, including Todd Palin. But McCain-Palin spokeswoman Maria Comella said Todd Palin would not face a ""fair hearing"" before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The campaign has stepped up its attacks on the Legislature's investigation of Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan's firing in the past week, saying the governor won't cooperate with an inquiry that it says is ""tainted"" by partisan politics. In a new twist, Comella said Alaska state law bars ethics investigations of people running for elected office. ""That law was passed to insulate legislative investigations from exactly the kind of political maneuvering we are seeing in this inquiry,"" she said. One Judiciary Committee member said lawmakers would have little recourse if witnesses refused to comply with the subpoenas. Only the full Senate, which does not reconvene until January, can vote to hold them in contempt, state Sen. Bill Wielechowski said. ""It appears that the McCain campaign is now very heavily involved in this, and they're attempting to stonewall the investigation,"" Wielechowski, a Democrat, said just before Thursday's announcement. The law campaign officials cited appears to apply to candidates for state office, while Sarah Palin is seeking a federal job. But another campaign spokesman, Taylor Griffin, said the subpoenas violate ""the spirit of the law, if not the letter."" In addition, state Attorney General Talis Colberg told lawmakers Tuesday that state employees wouldn't comply with subpoenas because the governor ""has declined to participate"" in the inquiry. Colberg said Sarah Palin's refusal puts them in the position ""of having to choose where their loyalties lie.""  Watch how the trooper probe has become political » . The governor originally pledged to cooperate with the state Legislature's investigation of her July dismissal of Monegan. Since his firing, Monegan has accused Palin of trying to pressure him into firing her former brother-in-law, a state trooper who had been involved in an acrimonious divorce from the governor's sister. Palin has said Monegan was dismissed over budget disagreements and denies any wrongdoing. Since becoming Sen. John McCain's running mate, she has argued that the investigation belongs before the state Personnel Board, whose members are appointed by the governor, though its current three members were appointed by her predecessor. The resistance was fueled by remarks made in early September by Judiciary Committee Chairman Hollis French, a Democrat. In an interview with ABC News, French said the investigation -- which had been scheduled to wrap up at the end of October -- could present an ""October surprise"" for the GOP ticket. Palin initially denied that anyone in her administration or family had pressed for action against her former brother-in-law, Mike Wooten, whom she has branded a ""rogue trooper."" But in August, just two weeks before her nomination, she acknowledged that members of her staff had contacted Monegan's office nearly two dozen times about the trooper and suspended one aide whose February call to a state police lieutenant on the matter was tape-recorded. And Todd Palin was a ""principal critic"" of Wooten and had ""many contacts"" with Department of Public Safety officials about his status, Stephen Branchflower, the former prosecutor hired by the state Legislature to investigate the firing, told lawmakers last week. The controversy has led to more scrutiny of Todd Palin's role in his wife's administration. Documents released during the Monegan inquiry suggest that the oil-rig worker and champion snowmobile racer, nicknamed the ""first dude,"" has been copied in on e-mails on numerous issues ranging from public criticism of the governor to meetings with corporate leaders. But Palin spokeswoman Meg Stapleton said Todd Palin's role in the administration ""has not been inappropriate."" ""His role is that he has been in and out of meetings that were appropriate,"" Stapleton said.","Todd Palin won't comply with lawmakers' subpoenas, McCain camp says .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal has been No. 1 in the world rankings before. In two stints, in fact. But it's safe to say getting to top spot for a third time is a little extra special for the Spaniard. When Nadal reached the final of the China Open in Beijing, he was guaranteed of overtaking Novak Djokovic when the rankings are released Monday. The exclamation point for Nadal would be beating the defending champion in Sunday's title match. ""(This is) a great year, one of the best years of my career without any doubt,"" Nadal said on the ATP Tour's official website after Saturday's semifinal opponent Tomas Berdych retired due to a back injury at 4-2 down in the opening set. ""It sure is special be back to the top position of the rankings after more than a half year without playing tennis. I worked hard every day with the right attitude I think, and because of that, I am today in this situation. I am number one today, but it's not (assured) for the end of the season."" Not many, including Nadal, could have seen this coming. Last year, he suffered a shock second-round loss at Wimbledon and went on to miss seven months with a knee injury. There were whispers that he might never return to the tennis tour. He did, however, come back and since then has been almost unstoppable, capturing two majors in 2013 to lift his tally to 13 -- a mere four behind men's record-holder Roger Federer. ""I won't go to sleep tonight feeling that I am the best player of the world. That's something that I never thought, and I don't think that now today,"" said Nadal. ""I played a very complete season, and that's why I am the best in the rankings today."" The 27-year-old's record stands at a dazzling 65-3, meaning he's on course to put together one of the finest seasons ever in terms of winning percentage. Nadal suffered a first-round loss at Wimbledon this year to Steve Darcis amid speculation his famous knees were bothering him again. With his form uncertain heading into the US Open Series, though, Nadal captured the Canadian Masters in Montreal and Cincinnati Masters before finishing his North American road trip with an emphatic win at the U.S. Open. There he downed Djokovic. Whereas the Australian Open champion once owned a seven-match winning streak against Nadal, he has now lost six of their last seven tussles. ""I know tomorrow I going to have a very tough opponent,"" Nadal said. ""I need to play my best, playing aggressive, playing without mistakes, being solid with my serve. If these kind of things are not happening, I will not have chances. ""I know what I have to do but it's very difficult to do it, because the level of the opponent is unbelievable."" The Serbian reached the China final for the fourth time in five years after beating French fifth seed Richard Gasquet 6-4 6-2 in Saturday's second semifinal, and will be seeking to add to his titles from 2009, 2010 and last year. Nadal won the tournament back in 2005, the year after it was reinstated to the ATP Tour calendar. The only major tournament Nadal hasn't won -- apart from his majors, he possesses an Olympic gold in singles and has won multiple Davis Cups -- is the ATP's year-end championships. But he'll likely be the favorite for the November event in London. Although Djokovic relinquished his No. 1 ranking -- he has held it for 101 non-consecutive weeks -- he will lead Serbia when it faces the Czech Republic in the following Davis Cup final. Meanwhile, world No. 1 Serena Williams will face Serbia's Jelena Jankovic in the final of the women's event in Beijing. Williams crushed Polish third seed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-2 6-2 on Saturday, while Jankovic defeated last weekend's Tokyo winner Petra Kvitova 6-7 (7-9) 6-1 6-1. Williams is seeking to add to her 2004 China triumph, with the American aiming to win her 10th title this year -- the best on the WTA Tour since Justine Henin managed the same number in 2007. Former world No. 1 Jankovic, seeded eighth this week, won the Beijing title in 2008 and was runner-up the previous year. She is one of only two active players to have beaten Serena four times or more -- the older Williams sister Venus is the other. ""She's the best player in the world right now,"" Jankovic said of the U.S. Open champion. ""She's in unbelievable form. Even though I have beaten her in the past I think she's the most difficult player to play against.""","Rafael Nadal returns to top spot in the world tennis rankings, overtaking Novak Djokovic .

"(CNN) -- Investigators suspect arson in a fire that heavily damaged a small post office in rural western Nevada Sunday morning, a U.S. Postal Service spokesman said. Investigators found anti-government graffiti on the walls and bullet holes in the building, Capt. Mark Reagan of the Sierra Fire Protection District said. ""It's pretty bad,"" said David Rupert, describing the damage to the Verdi, Nevada, post office, which is located about 10 miles from Reno. The fire began outside of the building, which houses postal boxes for about 800 residents, but water sprayed by firefighters soaked the mail inside, Rupert said. The wet but unburned mail was taken to a postal facility in Reno to be resorted and delivered to customers, he said. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and investigators from the U.S. Postal Inspector's office are conducting the probe, he said. A sheriff's deputy responding to a burglar alarm that sounded at about 4:30 a.m. discovered the fire, Reagan said. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","Anti-government graffiti, bullet holes found in building, fire official says .

"(CNN) -- Brazil wants to give up the rights to stage the 2015 Copa America to neighboring Chile, its football federation confirmed Monday. The tournament brings together the leading South American nations plus two invited teams from the CONCACAF region. Uruguay lifted the trophy in 2011 . A statement on the CBF (Brazil Football Confederation) website said a meeting between its new president Jose Maria Marin and his Chilean counterpart Sergio Jadue had agreed the change. Marin took over from Ricardo Teixeira at the helm of Brazilian football last week and has also taken his place on the FIFA 2014 World Cup organizing committee. With worries that preparations for the World Cup were running behind schedule, Marin said in the statement that it ""made no sense"" to stage the 2015 Copa America when Brazil has also to deliver the 2013 Confederations Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics. Marin also claimed that the 2015 tournament would unfairly disrupt Brazil's domestic league competitions. Brazil has agreed to stage the 2019 edition that was due to take place in Chile, but there is no confirmation from CONMEBOL, the South American Football Confederation, that the proposals will be accepted. Since 1987, the 10 CONMEBOL nations have staged the Copa America in strict rotation with Brazil last hosting in 1989. Brazil president Dilma Rousseff has recently given her government's pledge to assist in making sure that preparations for the 2014 World Cup run to time. It came after FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke complained that ""not a single stadium"" was ready for the competition. 12 venues have been selected, including an ambitious stadium near the Amazon jungle city of Manaus, each hosting at least four matches.","Brazil gives up right to host 2015 Copa America to Chile .

"(CNN) -- As someone who has often worked from home during her career, I've been obsessed with the firestorm Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer ignited earlier this month by demanding that her telecommuting employees get themselves to a bricks-and-mortar office—and soon. Predictably, the blogosphere, TV news shows and critics everywhere blew up. How dare Mayer snatch this benefit out from under Yahoo!'s virtual workers? And how dare she prompt more progressively minded employers to consider doing the same to theirs? Talk about negative trendsetting. Last week, Best Buy's much-heralded ""Results Only Work Environment"" for nonstore employees got downgraded, too. Most of the commentary around Yahoo!'s decision has looked at how telecommuting cutbacks affect working parents—and in particular, working moms, like Mayer herself. I agree that's huge. But what has fascinated me about this telework debate is how almost no one has specifically addressed its impact on those of us without children. Why shouldn't all of us, whether we parent children or not, have access to civilized ways of working that simplify our lives, decrease our commutes, allow us to be more efficient and maintain our sanity at the same time? Or do we have to have kids at home in order to have a valid ""excuse"" to benefit from the 21st century reality of virtual work? Yahoo work-from-home policy riles workers everywhere . Hear me out. Throughout my career, my single and child-free status have certainly benefited my employers and freelance clients, as I was able—and willing—to pick up and move to the other side of the country for long-term work assignments. Even when living and working in France last year, I could take on last-minute writing projects that demanded ""all-nighters,"" as there was no spouse or youngster requiring attention. The fact that I have ""neither chick nor child,"" as one of my Chicago Sun-Times colleagues used to say, allowed me the flexibility of traveling on short notice. These were all choices I happily made. So, if being unattached made me an asset to those I've worked for, should that same status keep me, and millions of others without children, from enjoying flexible work arrangements that few seem to question if you've got children at home? Gallery: Brilliant women in STEM, then and now . Telecommuting works ""because the benefits are so comprehensive. It's not just supporting family balance, but you balance,"" says Cindy Auten, general manager of Mobile Work Exchange. ""It isn't just a perk for one demographic."" Her group is the force behind last week's ""Telework Week 2013."" Sponsored by tech heavyweights Cisco and Citrix, it was the third annual global effort to encourage employees and employers to pledge to telework anytime between March 4 and 8. Last year's Telework Week generated more than 71,000 pledges, helping these folks gain back nearly 251,800 hours into their days and saving $5.6 million in commuting costs, according to Mobile Work Exchange. 2013's Telework Week pledge numbers have almost doubled. A ""2012 National Study of Employers"" conducted by the Society for Human Resources Management and the Families & Work Institute found that 63% of employers allow workers to work at home at least occasionally, up from 34% in 2005. Although telecommuting should benefit all job-eligible employees, often ""working moms and parents tend to get more of a consideration,"" admits Shirley Davis-Sheppard, the Society for Human Resources Management's vice president of Global Diversity & Inclusion. ""Yet, we tell organizations employees shouldn't have to tell you a reason"" why they'd like to telecommute. ""We advocate that you should be managing by results, not 'butts in seats.'"" Opinion: What Mayer misses on work-life balance . In other words, an employee's family situation—or lack of one—shouldn't determine whether they're able to telecommute. ""One, you've got to get your work done and have the conversation with your manager. It's got to work for both the employer and the employee,"" says Sheppard, who's also the co-leader of the Society for Human Resources Management's Workplace Flexibility initiative and holds a doctorate in business and organization management. ""That's what inclusion is all about, and why more and more chief diversity officers like me are on the bandwagon for this. You're not going to be able to engage and retain great talent without having flexibility. But this is not just about telecommuting. It's about compressed workweeks, part-time job options, flexible schedules. Sometimes it might be job sharing."" Pamela Royster, 46, is an independent clinical research consultant who has been home-based since 2007. Single, she's got four college-age kids living away from home. ""I've often thought about taking a job where I have to commute and work in an office, and there's no way I'd do that,"" says Royster, who lives in Washington and worked virtually even when her children were in the house. ""I'm able to cut costs because I'm not having to fill up my gas tank every week. And because I'm self-employed, I'm able to itemize many of my home office expenses. If you need to run an errand, you can do that, as long as you're meeting your deadlines."" Who works from home and how they do it . Working in an office, adds Mobile Work Exchange's Cindy Auten, means ""dry cleaning costs, going out to lunch. With all the work clothes you have to buy, you could put money away and invest it in your 401(k) so you can retire at a reasonable age. It is about money; it's about time. And time is money."" In theory, we can find ways to earn more cash. But the great equalizer is the clock. None of us, whether we're billionaires or flat broke, gets more than 24 hours each day. The quality of life aspect is huge to women like Amalie Drury, a married but childless 34-year-old Chicago editor for PureWow, a lifestyle website for women. ""I'm willing to work for a little bit less because my lifestyle is so much better,"" the recently married Drury says about her full-time virtual work. ""I usually wear workout clothes all day every day, which I absolutely love. When I'm waiting for someone to get back to me or for edits on a story I've written, I try to fit in a workout.

"(CNN) -- There is a one-word subtext to President Obama's trip to Africa: China. After 9/11, the United States became embroiled in more than a decade of wars in Asia and the Middle East. As a result, U.S. engagement in Latin America and Africa largely atrophied. Meanwhile, China saw an opportunity. China has now displaced the United States as the largest trading partners of two key Latin American countries, Brazil and Chile. China's economic rise is particularly marked in Africa; it quietly surpassed the United States as the continent's largest trading partner four years ago. Sino-African trade is now estimated to be $200 billion a year and is expected to rise to $325 billion in the next two years. While the conventional view has long been that Africa is largely a motley collection of economic basket cases, in fact, according to the most recent IMF figures, five out of 10 of the world's fastest-growing economies are in Africa. Indeed, South Sudan, Libya and Sierre Leone are the globe's top three economic hot spots with projected 2013 growth rates of 32%, 20% and 17% respectively. As if to underline the importance that the Chinese see in Africa, within two weeks of assuming office in March 2013, the new Chinese president Xi Jinping visited two of the three African countries Obama will be visiting on his African trip, Tanzania and South Africa. China is the largest trading partner for both of those nations. Read this: Obama 'plays catch up' in Africa . Seemingly as a result of its substantial investments and trade in Africa, China is well liked on the continent. A 2007 Pew Research Center survey found 92% of respondents held favorable views of China in the Ivory Coast and Mali, and between 67% and 81% held favorable views in Kenya, Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Ethiopia. Pew noted that these favorable views of China come at the expense of the United States: ""China's influence is almost universally viewed as having a more beneficial impact on African countries than does that of the United States."" In other words, the United States has considerable catch up to play in Africa. In 2012 then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton toured Africa and made what many assumed to be a not-so-thinly veiled swipe at China, which is heavily involved in African mineral and oil extraction: ""The days of having outsiders come and extract the wealth of Africa for themselves, leaving nothing or very little behind, should be over..."" Obama is likely to avoid any criticism of China but he has chosen to visit Senegal, Tanzania and South Africa, countries that are all relatively functional democracies, and he is likely to dwell on the issues of good governance and respect for human rights in his public remarks, which will serve to subtly remind Africans that these are issues that the United States puts more value on than does China. But the real message Obama will be signaling is that America is open for business with Africa. In Tanzania, the president will have a closed meeting with some two-dozen leading American and African CEOs. And, according to Jennifer Cooke, an expert on Africa at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, ""some 500 business leaders will join the president at various points in his trip to assess the opportunities for themselves."" Perhaps they may conclude, as the World Bank did last year, that ""Africa could be on the brink of an economic takeoff, much like China was 30 years ago, and India 20 years ago."" And if that happens, the United States, of course, would want to be part of this story.","President Obama is visiting Africa after years of little U.S. engagement with continent .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown faces possible jail time after a judge revoked his probation Monday in connection with his conviction in the beating of his girlfriend Rihanna. Brown's alleged failure to hand over his drivers license and insurance information to another driver after a minor traffic crash in May triggered the probation revocation, but the singer will remain free until a trial is held. Brown, 24, was already facing a probation violation trial after prosecutors accused him of not completing the community labor ordered for his 2009 felony assault conviction. A representative for Brown, however, said the singer expects the traffic charges to be dropped and probation reinstated. A lawyer for the other driver said in a court hearing Monday morning ""that his client did not want to press charges, that any damage was ""negligible"" and that Chris did identify himself at the scene and that she was given all of the appropriate insurance information,"" the Brown rep said in a statement to CNN Monday evening. ""We are hopeful that the case will be dismissed next week,"" the rep said. A woman whose Mercedes was allegedly rear-ended by a Range Rover that Brown was driving on a Los Angeles street told investigators that he ""went ballistic"" after the traffic accident and screamed at her. According to the police report on the incident, the other driver, Olga Gure, quoted Brown as shouting at her: ""You are a b---h!"" Brown charged with hit-and-run . The report added more from Gure, who quoted Brown as saying, ""Who do you think you are, b---h? Do you think if you driving Mercedes so got money, b---h? Do you think I am just a black n----r? I got more money than you, beech!"" The trigger for Brown's alleged rage was that Gure took a photo of him and his girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, to document the scene -- since he allegedly refused to show her his driver's license, she said. When Brown tried to grab the camera, Tran screamed ""Don't touch her, don't touch her,"" Gure said. ""I was so shocked, that I was speechless,"" she said. ""Just a moment ago he was a nice guy. After screaming some insulting nonsense for a while longer, he slammed a door and drove away fast and noisy."" A private investigator visited her two days later to give her Brown's name, birthdate and business address and the contact information for Brown's lawyer, Mark Geragos, she said. She was also given an expired insurance card for the Range Rover, she said. A body shop estimate showed Gure's car needed $868 in bumper repairs. Brown was ordered to return to court on August 16 for a hearing to set a trial date to determine if the probation revocation will stand. If it does, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin could order Brown to jail to serve part of the original five-year jail sentence imposed for the attack on Rihanna. Another judge continued the traffic case against Brown during a hearing Monday morning. He is charged with hit-and-run driving and driving without a license. The ever divisive Chris Brown . Brown's Twitter defense . Brown used his Twitter account to protest the traffic charges last month: . ""It's not a hit and run if u get out the car, exchange information (who has NO DAMAGE to either cars).This is really ridiculous"" ""I have a valid drivers license and I gave the woman the right info. She saw cameras and wanted to make a scene."" ""She contacted the cops thinking of a payday from Chris Brown when I followed the proper procedures."" ""My lawyers will be contacting you. I will not stand for this bullying and yellow journalism!"" ""My profile pic is the pic I took of the persons car after ""the hit and run"". NO damage. Just a dirty car. once again, I gotta clear my name"" ""I work my ass off to provide for my entire family. I've made mistakes in the past and have worked hard to be a better person. "" ""19-24 years of age. I don't have all the answers and you can't show me a person that age who has it figured out. We live and grow. Let me live"" Brown totals car with dodging paparazzi, rep says . Another probation violation charge . Brown punched Rihanna inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street, leaving her face bruised and bloody on the eve of the Grammy Awards in February 2009. He entered a guilty plea seven months later and was sentenced to serve five years probation and to spend more than 1,400 hours in ""labor-oriented service"" for the assault conviction. The judge allowed him to serve the sentence in Richmond, Virginia, under the direct supervision of the police chief. In a court filing in February 2013, prosecutors accused Brown of not completing the community labor. The paperwork Brown submitted to show he had completed community labor is ""at best sloppy documentation and at worst fraudulent reporting,"" District Attorney Jackie Lacey said. Brown wasn't in town on some of the dates reported, the motion said. Geragos, Brown's attorney, said the prosecutor's filing was so fraudulent that he would ask the judge to punish the deputy district attorneys involved and call for a contempt of court hearing for filing false documents with the court. ""And I don't mean just false, it is fraudulent,"" Geragos said. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has ""tortured"" Brown during his probation more than any client he's ever had, Geragos said. The prosecutor is asking the judge to order him to restart his 1,400 hours of community service under the supervision of a Los Angeles probation officer.

"(CNN) -- U.S. star Jozy Altidore has said he will ""pray"" for those who subjected him to racist abuse during a Dutch cup game Tuesday. The 23-year-old American international was the target of racist chanting during AZ Alkmaar's 5-0 win at nine-man Den Bosch. Referee Reinold Wiedemeijer suspended the game during the first half following ""jungle sounds chanted at Altidore,"" according to AZ's official twitter feed. But AZ players, including Altidore, persuaded him not to. Wiedemeijer asked host club Den Bosch to put a message over the public address system, warning the crowd he would stop the match if the abuse carried on. The contest was also briefly stopped after the interval after home fans threw snowballs at the linesmen. Time for football to tackle racism epidemic? Altidore was adamant the game should not be stopped and in a post-match interview with Dutch television he explained his stance. He said: ""It's a bit disappointing that these things still happen at this time but what are you going to do? ""You just have to hope that these people find a way to improve themselves. You can only pray for them. ""I feel like as a football player that I have an obligation, to my team, to my club, to my family to not react to things like this. ""I want to show them that club stands better than that and that I was raised better than that than respond to such ridiculous behaviour. ""It's a bit disappointing because you would hope as human beings that humanity can grow from these types of times. ""But at the end of the day, it's still alive racism and all we can do is try and educate ourselves and the young kids coming up to be better than that. ""All I can do is pray for them and hope they become better people."" FIFA ready to hit racists hard . Altidore, who scored from the penalty spot during the contest, also insisted he would not rise to those who had insulted him from the stands. He added: ""I'm not going to fight them. They just have some issues and need some help. You can only pray for them and hope they get better. ""We were in a good rhythm and it was important for us to keep going. I think we started the New Year right and you have to look at the bigger picture."" AZ soccer director and former U.S. midfield player Earnier Stewart, also spoke of his disgust, telling Dutch television's Eredivisie Live: ""It is terribly sad that this can happen for those involved and for lovers of football in the Netherlands. ""You hear that and wonder what on earth is going on.'' Stewart also revealed that Den Bosch officials are ""ashamed'' of the fans involved. The club told fans to stop the chants over the public address system, but that failed to stop a small section of supporters. Alkmaar player Viktor Elm added: ""The fans that misbehaved towards Altidore should be ashamed. ""I, like everybody else, am really disappointed in these supporters. It is a bad time for professional football. It is not something I have experienced in my career before. ""Jozy handled it really well. He has not been tempted to respond. He was emotional after his penalty."" Boateng makes racism walkout vow . Meanwhile, in Italy, Lazio booked its place in the final of the Coppa Italia courtesy of a 2-1 win over Juventus. With the tie poised at 1-1 following last week's first leg in Turin, Lazio took the lead through Alvaro Gonzalez's header. The home side looked set for its first final since 2009, but Juventus grabbed a dramatic equalizer in the 91st minute when Arturo Vidal lashed home. The tie looked destined for extra-time, but with just seconds remaining, Sergio Floccari netted a late winner to take Lazio through. Vladimir Petkovic's side will now face city rival Roma or Inter Milan in the final. Sink or swim for 'Super Mario'? In the English Premier League, Manchester City endured a frustrating night as it was held to a goalless draw by bottom of the table QPR. On a day dominated by speculation linking City striker Mario Balotelli with a move to AC Milan, manager Roberto Mancini might have hoped for a victory to concentrate on instead. But his side was unable to find a way past a stubborn and determined Rangers defense, which managed to hold on for a precious point in its fight against relegation. Instead, Mancini was left to focus on the impending departure of the enigmatic Balotelli, who is set to undergo a medical at Milan Wednesday before completing a move to Italy. Mancini told Sky Sports News: ""He had this big chance to come back to Italy and play for another top club like Milan. ""I hope Mario can continue to improve and show he's always ready because I think he can, if he works hard, continue growing and become one of the best players in the world. ""It's important for Mario to be in Italy with his family. I think that would be good for him."" Aston Villa's nightmare run of form continued with a 2-1 home defeat by Newcastle. Villa, which had suffered consecutive defeats by a lower league opposition in its previous two matches, now sits in the relegation zone. Villa embarrassed by third-tier Bradford . Paul Lambert's team has failed to win a Premier League game since December 15 and has taken one point from a possible 18. On this occasion, it gave itself an uphill task after falling two goals behind early on to a Newcastle team also struggling at the wrong end of the table. Papiss Cisse and Yohan Cabaye both scored within the first 31 minutes to give Newcastle a comfortable halftime advantage. Villa pulled one back four minutes after the interval through Christian Benteke's penalty, but it couldn't prevent Newcastle from claiming a first away win of the league season. In the night's other games, Sunderland held Swansea to a goalless draw while Wigan came from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Stoke.","U.S. star Jozy Altidore suffered racial abuse during Dutch cup game .

"(CNN) -- I wrote a book called ""Every Day is an Atheist Holiday."" Recently I got up at the non-Vegas magical hour of 6 a.m. to do radio interviews all over the country to let people know about it. I did some interviews with atheist and skeptic podcasts, but the 6 a.m. talks were usually morning radio. And morning radio has a lot of theists. My book had just come out that day so even jocks who wanted to read it hadn't had the time to do more than skim. Many of the DJs saw the words ""holiday"" and ""atheist"" and asked me how I felt about ""The War on Christmas."" Fox News is usually credited with spreading the panic about this war on Christmas. Bill O'Reilly talks about atheists and left-wing loons ruining Christmas for children. He also says that Christianity is a philosophy, which might have seemed like a sleek move on live TV, but ... I'm thinking he's noticed by now Jon Stewart is biting him in the butt. O'Reilly finds evidence for the war in atheist groups opposing Nativity scenes on government property and their discomfort with public school students having to opt out when their classes go to a church to see a Charlie Brown Christmas play. Bill is also ticked off by businesses urging their employees to say ""Happy Holidays"" instead of ""Merry Christmas."" He doesn't want the holidays turned secular. He wants his Christmas pure. Pure as the Christian philosophy.But he could learn strategy to win the war on Christmas from the Monkees and their '60s TV show. They're on a reunion tour (sadly without Davy Jones, but miraculously with Mike Nesmith.) I flew across the country to Philly to see them on stage. I had promised my 12-year-old self that I would see them live and I wanted to keep that promise. I owe the Monkees a lot. The Monkees got me started on crazy-ass rock 'n' roll and probably got me started doing my crazy Vegas magic show. The Monkees were on TV. They appealed to the broadest audience possible. The Monkees were sanitized. My mom and dad would watch the Monkees with me, and other than their stupid haircuts, Mom and Dad weren't bothered much by the Pre-fab Four. Opinion: What's really behind 'war on Christmas' Mom and Dad bought me Monkees records. I read Monkees interviews and through them, learned about a guy named Jimi Hendrix who was their opening act in cities I couldn't get to. I saw Frank Zappa of the Mothers of Invention on the Monkees TV show and in their movie, ""Head,"" and soon I'd moved from the innocuous to full blown dangerous rock 'n' roll. Things that are for everyone sometimes suck us into things that aren't for everyone. Think about it, Bill. Many people wanted to keep rock 'n' roll pure. Hardcore fans scoffed at the Monkees. They wanted to ensure electric guitars were only for rebels, but the Monkees got the feeling and beat out there to the children. And some of us, after feeling the beat and digging the feeling, kept going all the way, far out. The Monkees were an entry to rock 'n' roll as rebellious as it could get. ""Happy Holidays"" could do the same thing. If Christian philosophers get together and include all Americans in their holiday, if they don't exclude any children, if they can start with everyone loving the season, maybe the reason for it will sneak in -- like Hendrix's ""Electric Ladyland"" riding the Monkees' ""Last Train to Clarksville."" Maybe the sanitized tiding of comfort and joy will lead people all the way to Christianity. There are many ways to proselytize. You could let the crucified Jesus ride in on Santa's sleigh. Maybe Christians can slalom down that slippery slope. That might be too manipulative and cynical for Bill O'Reilly. He might not want his Christianity philosophy to ride in on anything. Bill might prefer that one becomes a Christian first and then celebrates the season after earning it. I can see that point of view. That's a noble point of view: that Christianity and atheism should compete fairly in the marketplace of ideas. Maybe I should have started with Hendrix and Zappa or not gotten into rock 'n' roll at all. That is the high road and I can respect that. But, wanting all children to enjoy the holiday season, with no child left out of the fun, doesn't seem like a position that's deserving of the term ""war."" How about we spend some time this holiday season wishing that more of our wars will be waged like the atheist war on Christmas? The wars in the Middle East, waged mostly by members of the Abrahamic religions, kill a lot of people. The war on Christmas has killed no one. The war on drugs kills many innocent bystanders and wastes a lot of money putting citizens in expensive prisons. American atheists are accused of a war that injures no one and saves all of us money and seems to promote real American values. Let's either fight all wars like that or use a different term. Couldn't we at least call it ""The honest disagreement about the Christmas philosophy?"" We're too busy singing, to put anybody down. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Penn Jillette.","Fox News' Bill O'Reilly says left-wing loons are waging war on Christmas, ruining it for kids .
Penn Jillette says the Monkees were his entry drug to real, hardcore rock 'n' roll .
Jillette: Could The Monkees be a strategy? ""Happy Holidays"" as entry to ""pure Christmas""?

"Olympic Park, London (CNN) -- The headlines and newscasts that report the events of the Olympic Games to the world invariably focus on the stars of the tournament. From Michael Phelps' record-breaking feats in the pool to Usain Bolt's bid to retain his 100m crown; the column inches, air time and online attention remain fixed to the gold and the glory. But this is only the tip of the true Olympic story. Over two hundred nations have taken part in the modern Olympic Games since 1896, and of them 79 are yet to win a single medal. Most athletes who have traveled thousands of miles across the world to London, and devoted years of their lives to train in a discipline of their passion, are outside bets to win a medal at best. And many, from the nations who have yet to claim a podium place, are looking to overturn a seemingly one-way current of history that keeps them -- or anyone else from their homeland -- from clutching a sacred circle of gold, silver or bronze. But it's not just the Olympic Flame that burns eternally, the hope in the hearts of ""the underdogs"" burns too. Underdogs like Ricardo Blas Jr, a 218 kg judokan from the small Pacific island-nation of Guam. To remark purely on the 25-year-old's size would be a glib oversight of the Olympian he is. Inspired by the judo exploits of his father, Ricardo Blas, who became Guam's first Olympian in 1988, Blas Jr has been a judo player since the age of five. He ""trains hard, four-to-six hours every day"" and studied at a judo college in Japan before qualifying for Beijing and then London. ""In all bar two Olympics since 1988, we've always had a representative from Guam in the judo, and they've usually been from my family: my Dad, my first cousins and now I hope to keep that going,"" he told CNN. ""I was on the judo mat before I could walk, I've never known anything else. I got into it and then it's like 'if you're going to do something then take it all the way', and here I am at the Olympic Games."" No hubris, no hyperbole just honest joy at living his dream. Blas Jr. is one of eight athletes who qualified from a nation that barely covers 200 square miles and has a population of just 180, 000 (figures from the United Nations). And London will live long in the memory because, unlike in Beijing -- where Blas Jr lost in two visits to the mat and exited the tournament -- here, he won his first round bout against Facinet Keita of Guinea. Read more: 'Blade runner' makes unprecedented Olympic debut . It's the first time any judo player from Guam has progressed to the second round of an Olympic event. Ricardo Blas Jr has made history. ""It was a win, at the Olympic Games of all places! It was an amazing feeling and it was the first for Guam as well. I'm happy about that,"" he told CNN just after this victory. Sadly, for his compatriots, the winning streak was short-lived, as defeat followed in the second round to Cuba's Oscar Brayson. It all happened within the space of 45 minutes, but created memories that will no doubt last a lifetime. ""A loss is always bad but I have no regrets because I fought my hardest, I left it all on the mat, so I feel ok. I always wish I could have done better and gone further, but that's now my prep for the future. ""It's gratifying because it shows I've grown since Beijing so maybe I'll continue to grow and get on that podium sometime. My dream will always be an Olympic medal, and if I win one it will show everyone in Guam they can do it."" Away from the judo hall that sits on the banks of London's docklands, in the more comfortable surroundings of the Athletes' Village two sprinters from the Cayman Islands are contemplating the challenge that lies ahead. The Caribbean country of their birth is 164 square miles in size with a population of just over 56,000; a figure that means the entire nation could fit into the Olympic Stadium in London with nearly a third of the arena left empty. It's fair to say their community is tight. ""It's one of those places where everyone knows everyone. Many people think we live in paradise, and it is pleasant, but I like how multicultural the place is too. I wouldn't change it for the world,"" Ronald Forbes told CNN. Forbes, 27, is a 110m hurdler and one of seven athletes to have made the trip to the British capital from Cayman. His childhood friend and teammate is Kemur Hyman, a 100m sprinter who aged 22, and just a few weeks before the 2012 Olympics, became the first Cayman Island runner to complete his distance in under 10 seconds. ""I was picked up at 13 by the national coach after running in an inter-school competition. And then I got serious at 15 because my brother made me jealous traveling to Bermuda to compete, so it all went from there really,"" he told CNN. Both sprinters are now studying in America due to the their athletic talents but remain fixed on their nation's goal ahead of their competitions in London: to win an elusive medal. ""I feel like we're going through a spell, our country is small but we now have five athletes of the A standard so I think there are medals coming, I'm confident here or 2016 it will happen,"" Hyman said. By the time you read this Hyman will be trying his best to qualify for the men's 100m, arguably the most pressurized, high-intensity running race in the world. With the likes of Usain Bolt, Yohan Blake, Tyson Gay et al all vying for places too, he will be up against it. But despite the odds, and the size of the stage, Hyman remains upbeat. ""I get bubble guts and nervous but I've done all the work to get here, I just need to finish it off. My time has come down from 10.7 to 9.9, so I want to put my island on the map (by continuing this)."" Forbes' first race comes on Tuesday 7, after the Bolt-Blake fireworks of the weekend have settled. ""It's simple, keep away from the distractions and get from point A to point B as quick as possible, that's it, period, that's what I learned in Beijing."" Both Forbes and Hyman plan to practice what they preach and bring home a medal at some point during their careers, but even without such tangible tokens of success surely Blas Jr, and the Cayman Island challengers represent what the Games is all about: the challenge of taking part. Baron Pierre de Coubertin can rest easy that his legacy is alive and well ... Complete coverage of the Olympics .","Gold medals and glory is only the tip of the true Olympic story .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Prince Charles visited the Vatican on Monday for his first meeting with a pope since his 1996 divorce from Princess Diana. Pope Benedict XVI is flanked by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla during their meeting at the Vatican. The heir to the UK throne was accompanied by his second wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, who wore the mandatory modest black dress and veil which the Vatican requires for wives of dignitaries who meet the pope. The 20-minute meeting was ""cordial,"" the Vatican said in a statement afterwards. Prince Charles's accession to the throne was likely to be an unspoken subtext of the meeting, an expert on the prince told CNN. ""The biggest thing on Prince Charles's agenda is the preparation for his coronation,"" said Christopher Wilson, author of ""The Windsor Knot: Charles, Camilla and the Legacy of Diana."" Charles would like the pope to attend personally, unlikely as that may be, given the religious divide between London and Rome, Wilson said. ""He will expect a high-profile Roman Catholic presence in Westminster Abbey,"" where he will be crowned, Wilson argued. ""The combined heads of state come from everywhere. Every democratically elected head of state will be invited. It bigs up your coronation if you can get the highest Roman Catholic to come."" The meeting between prince and pope came days after the 500th anniversary of the crowning of Henry VIII, the English king who broke with the Roman Catholic Church and established the Church of England because he wanted to divorce. It was Prince Charles's first visit to the Vatican since he went to the funeral of Pope John Paul II four years ago, and his first meeting with a head of the Roman Catholic Church since 1985. There are multiple factors complicating his relationship with the Vatican, Wilson pointed out. Not only is he divorced, which the Roman Catholic Church disapproves of, but so is Camilla -- and her children are being raised as Catholics because their father is one. A centuries-old British law forbids Catholics or their spouses from holding the throne. The Prince of Wales ""is trying to break down the breach between the Vatican and the House of Windsor,"" Wilson said. ""It's a path-smoothing exercise."" Additionally, he said: ""Prince Charles likes very much to be photographed with heads of state. He's not the head of state himself. It adds luster to his royal presence."" Charles and the pope were expected to discuss issues such as interfaith dialogue and climate change -- subjects to which Prince Charles has devoted himself. The pair exchanged gifts. Benedict gave Charles a gold pontifical medal and an antique engraved copper plate of St. Peter's Basilica dating from the 16th century. Charles gave Benedict a set of 12 porcelain plates with floral design of the plants and flowers that grow at his country estate in Gloucestershire. Afterwards, Prince Charles met Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Tarciso Bertone and Vatican foreign affairs minister Archbishop Dominique Mamberti, while Camilla received a private tour of the Sistine Chapel.

"New York (CNN) -- A New York newspaper is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the ""lowlife"" who defaced a statue of Jackie Robinson outside the Brooklyn Cyclones baseball stadium. Vandals marked racial slurs and symbols on the sculpture of Robinson and teammate Pee Wee Reese sometime between the end of the Cyclones game Tuesday night and 7 a.m. Wednesday, according to a spokesman for the New York City Police Department. A swastika, ""anti-Semitic comments"" and the N-word were written in black marker on the statue and its base, officials said. The NYPD's Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating the matter as a possible bias incident. The Cyclones and police are reviewing security camera video, hoping it will lead them to a suspect or suspects, said Brooklyn Cyclones director of communications Billy Harner. No arrests have been made. The New York Daily News on its front page Thursday kicked off a hunt for the ""lowlife who scrawled epithets"" on the statue. In red, slanted letters it posted a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrator. The statue immortalizes a moment of racial progress in American history in the 1940s, depicting the instant when Reese, who is white, walked over to Robinson and put an arm around him as the first African-American player in the big leagues endured racial slurs from the stands. According to the legend, the crowds fell silent at the show of solidarity. Opinion: The Jackie Robinson biopic and me . The newspaper showed a photograph of the defaced statue, with parts of the epithets blurred. The parks department has already managed to remove the majority of the graffiti, Harner said. ""Almost every Saturday morning I stop by the statue on my bike, and am deeply moved each time,"" U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer said in a statement. ""Defacing the Jackie Robinson statue is a dagger in the heart to everything America stands for, and I hope those who are responsible are caught, punished, and taught why what they did is so disgusting and offensive."" Inner city team honors baseball pioneers . The stadium is just steps away from Coney Island's famous boardwalk. The team is the minor league club associated with Major League Baseball's New York Mets franchise. Robinson was the first African-American baseball player to play with a modern-era Major League Baseball team, the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. His jersey number, 42, was retired in 1997, though it is still worn by New York Yankees closer, Mariano Rivera. The film ""42,"" which was released in April, tells Robinson's story of breaking the color barrier in the sport. Honoring '42' comes slowly to legend's hometown .

"(CNN) -- No American city does unintentional irony quite like Las Vegas. And Las Vegas is always at its most unintentionally ironic during Consumer Electronics Show (CES) week, the January extravaganza that annually draws over 150,000 techno-tourists like myself to the seductively coercive city in the Nevada desert to pay homage to the hottest new electronic products on the planet. This year, the unintentional ironies began as soon as we arrived in town. At Las Vegas' palatial McCarran airport, we were greeted with a gigantic electronic billboard for Best Buy, a generous CES sponsor and the dominant consumer electronics retailer in America. It was a picture of a happy consumer being greeted by an even happier Best Buy sales assistant. Retail nirvana, the electronic billboard advertised; Best Buy, it promised, is the techno-consumer's very best friend. But in Las Vegas, of course, appearance is always the opposite of reality. So let's imagine a rather different picture: Of an unhappy consumer being ""greeted"" by an even unhappier Best Buy sales assistant. Last week, in an article that went so viral that it elicited a panicked rebuttal from Best Buy's CEO, Silicon Valley author Larry Downes explained why he believes the electronics retailer is gradually going out of business. ""Walk into one of the company's retail locations or shop online. And try, really try, not to lose your temper,"" Downes challenged his readers, before describing his own experience shopping there. So how do those 150,000 CES attendees get from McCarran airport to the packed Las Vegas strip? We queue. We queue to catch a cab in improbably long lines that snake around and around the airport's cavernous concourse. And queuing -- or waiting in line, as my American friends like to say -- is the dominant mode of being at CES. We patiently queue for cabs, we queue to get our show badges, we queue for food and beverages, we queue for buses to and from the packed conventional centers, we queue to check in and out of our hotels, we queue to squeeze onto the city's packed monorail system, and, of course, we dutifully queue on our return to McCarran so that we can be x-rayed by the airport's absurdly low-tech anti-terrorist machines. The unintentional irony of all this queuing is twofold. Firstly, the whole message of CES this year was mobility. All the most seductive electronic products on show at CES promised to untether us from the world. Smaller notebook computers, now euphemistically called ""ultrabooks"", were thinner and smaller than ever. New smartphones were even smarter and easier to slip into our pockets. Apps were more mobile, of course. While absurdly light tablet devices could be found on almost every table in every booth. So that's the irony. The whole point of CES is to stand in long, frustratingly slow moving lines to fondle devices that promise unlimited freedom. CES, thus, achieved the impossible: it makes mobility immobile. But it's the second unintentional irony of all this queuing that is even more delicious. You see, the more CES attendees queue, the more they wait in line to see the blob of an exhibition that now spread over several gigantic exhibition halls and casino-hotels, the less there is to see. Yes, consumer electronics might be becoming more mobile -- but apart from this inevitable development, there were very few really memorable new products or technologies at CES this year. The ""next big thing"" this year, supposedly, was that televisions are becoming see-through as well as thinner and more social. But, like a dieting commercial featuring impossibly thin models, CES is always promising impossible thinness, particularly on its latest television screens. ""Plasma schmasma,"" as one jaded East Coast friend of mine repeats himself every year. How much more anorexic can television screens become, I wonder, before they double as gigantic Frisbees or cheese cutters. And a ""see-though"" LCD screen? Yes, that seems about as ""must have"" as goofy gadgets at CES this year such as connected electronic scales for babies or ispeakers for the shower. Meanwhile, ""social"" television has emerged as the ultimate mirage in the Nevada desert. Every year over the last ten years at CES, we've heard that television is going social. And then, every year, we go home from CES to watch our television sets alone via sets that have little, if any, social functionality. Then there's that another perennial mirage at CES -- 3D technology. This year, like every year in distant memory, I dutifully put on the plastic throwaway glasses to watch vertiginous 3D presentations. And this year, like every other year, I came away both dizzy and radically unimpressed with a technology that is neither essential nor affordable. No, the big story of CES 2012 was what was happening elsewhere. While we all waited patiently in long lines to see nothing, the real technology news was being made back in Silicon Valley. Earlier this week, for example, Google launched Search Plus Your World in its attempt to socialize its search engine. Meanwhile, rumors continue to circulate about a radically new iPad from Apple -- the world's leading consumer electronics company that has never and will never attend CES and whose ghost hung heavily over Las Vegas this week. Even Microsoft, a company that has historically invested millions of dollars at CES as a sponsor and participant, made news this year by announcing that this year's event would be the last that its CEO would keynote. So, in future, without Microsoft and Apple (and Amazon, another innovative company that has never wasted its time in Las Vegas), it's hard to avoid concluding that CES will -- like Best Buy - gradually but inevitably go out of business. Like Best Buy, I suspect, CES has stood still over the last 10 years while the world has radically changed. The future of this kind of event celebrating technological innovation is probably far far away from the ubiquitous clanging of Las Vegas' slot machines. Just as all electronic hardware devices are becoming networked, so the future of CES is probably online, in the very networked world which is empowering our increasingly mobile gadgets. There, at least, there won't be any queues.","Andrew Keen says CES has remained the same while the world has radically changed.

"(CNN) -- Juror B37 found it hard to understand what witness Rachel Jeantel was talking about. And after the jurors acquitted George Zimmerman in the death of Jeantel's friend Trayvon Martin, the feeling certainly was mutual. After a trial that divided many Americans by their views on race, guns and self-defense, CNN's exclusive interviews with the witness and the juror Monday night illustrated their starkly different frames of reference. Juror: 'No doubt' that Zimmerman feared for his life . They disagreed about whether Zimmerman racially profiled Martin when he saw him walking through a Sanford, Florida, neighborhood. But much more than race separated their perception of what happened the evening of February 26, 2012. When is it reasonable to suspect wrongdoing by a teenager walking through a neighborhood? Is a neighborhood watch volunteer a helpful member of the community or a ""cracka"" trying to wear the authority of a police officer? Does the jargon of a 19-year-old witness demonstrate her lack of education or an older generation's lack of awareness? Jeantel 'upset, angry' by verdict . The role of race . Race was perhaps the simplest disagreement. ""It was racial. Let's be honest, racial. If Trayvon was white and he had a hoodie on, would that happen?"" the 19-year-old Jeantel asked on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live."" But the juror, who requested anonymity and sat in darkness on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360,"" said the jury of six women -- five white and one an unspecified minority -- never talked about racial profiling. ""I think all of us thought race did not play a role,"" she said. Martin's movement . So why did Zimmerman suspect Martin might be up to no good? The juror sided with Zimmerman's account, and said Martin ""was cutting through the back"" of the neighborhood ""looking into houses."" ""He was stopping and starting,"" she said. ""It was late at night, dark at night, raining. And anybody would think anybody walking down the road, stopping and turning and looking, if that's exactly what happened, is suspicious."" Not to Jeantel. It was shortly after 7 p.m., she said, a time when typically people might be out walking their dogs, not plotting burglaries. And if anyone should have been alarmed, it was Martin, she said. He told her in their now-famous phone call that a man was following him, and she said she warned him it could be a rapist. Parents tell children to fear such people, Jeantel said. Otherwise, ""you're going to see your child on the news, missing person."" She expressed disbelief any of the jurors who were parents would not understand that. Juror B37 did not disclose biographical information in her CNN interview. According to HLN, CNN's sister network, she has been married 20 years and has two adult children. Despite outrage, federal charges uncertain in Zimmerman case . 'Phrases I have never heard' Jeantel testified Martin told her on the phone that a ""creepy-ass cracka"" was following him as he returned home from a convenience store run for a bag of Skittles and a can of Arizona iced tea. In the CNN interview, she said ""cracka"" is a term for someone who wants to act like a police officer. She said it was not the same as calling a white person a ""cracker."" The juror didn't take ""cracka"" as a racial slur but an indication of ""the type of life that they live ... and the environment they're living in."" ""A lot of the times she was using phrases I have never heard before,"" the juror said. Fringe protestors turn violent in LA after verdict . Generational divide? She did not find Jeantel credible, the juror said, but ""I felt very sorry for her. ... I think she felt inadequate toward everyone because of her education and communication skills."" When Piers Morgan played that clip for Jeantel, the teen said she felt upset and also misunderstood. She said she has a speech impediment due to an underbite. And her vocabulary is odd only to older people, she said. The jurors, she said, are ""old-school people. We (are) in a new school, our generation, my generation."" Perhaps they judged her as uneducated, Jeantel said, but she said she felt criticized for being ""too honest."" Her generation uses ""cracka"" and even a variation of the N-word as a non-racial term for any man, she said. ""The jury's so shocked what I said, and they're acting like the generation we got now don't say that."" Now that he's free, can Zimmerman make a living? Impressions of Zimmerman . Not surprisingly, they came to vastly different conclusions about the defendant. ""I think George Zimmerman is a man whose heart was in the right place but just got displaced by the vandalism in the neighborhoods, and wanting to catch these people so badly that he went above and beyond what he really should have done,"" the juror said. Jeantel called Zimmerman ""scary"" and branded him ""weak"" for declining to testify at his trial. ""If you were a real man, you would've stand on that stage and tell what happened,"" she said.","Juror B37 appears in exclusive ""AC 360"" interview .

"Barcelona, CNN (CNN) -- There were no major announcements and no breathtaking new gadgets, but this year's Mobile World Congress did offer up more than its fair share of unexpected uses for digital technology. Here are a few of the stranger sights that were creating a buzz around this year's event in Barcelona. GPS-enabled walking stick . Clearly aimed at the elderly, or anyone with walking difficulties, this prototype from Japan's Fujitsu is a stick fitted with GPS navigation features, health monitoring sensors and Bluetooth and wireless connectivity. The stick, known as Generation, allows relatives, carers or perhaps medics to track the user's real time movements while also recording heart rate. The stick also has the potential to summon emergency services. While the stick is some way off launch, Fujitsu has clearly been putting a great deal of thought about how its technology can benefit senior citizens -- a shrewd move given Japan's aging population. It has also created a phone specifically aimed at the elderly, featuring a large keypad and sound enhancement. YotaPhone . Paddy Smith from Stuff drew our attention to this quirky two-faced device. Here's what he had to say: . A smartphone running Google's Android operating system and a 4.3-inch touchscreen on the front? You might be thinking there's no shortage of those around, and you'd be right, but the YotaPhone offers something none of the others can: a second screen, on the back of the phone. Tell us: What's your dream smartphone feature? This screen uses the monochrome e-ink technology seen in Amazon's Kindle and other e-readers, and uses very little battery power. The screen can be customized to show whatever image you please, but more interesting are the apps that allow it to display Twitter, Facebook and RSS feeds, or a clock or weather report. Sensirion micro temperature sensor . This tiny speck of technology will give mobiles the ability to measure temperature and humidity, opening the door to a whole new realm of applications. Sensiron says its device will give your mobile the ability to ""feel,"" offering all kinds of biofeedback possibilities. At the very least it should enable it to accurately read the weather conditions around you. It could also prove an invaluable healthcare or sports monitoring tool. Next, presumably, we will get phones that can smell and taste. Glove-friendly touch screens . Forget its claims to being the world's fastest phone. Ignore the brilliant touch screen and the powerful 13 megapixel camera. Disregard its slender 8.4mm side profile. What sets Chinese manufacturer Huawei's flagship Ascend P2 smartphone apart is the fact that it can be operated by users wearing gloves. Read more: Gadget show goes soft on hardware . Mitten-ready mobiles aren't new -- Nokia's Lumia 920 also responds to fingers cloaked in fabric -- but for anyone who regularly checks their phone in freezing conditions, any fresh addition is a great leap forward. Robotic balls . A popular attraction in one corner of MWC were robotic Sphero balls that can be controlled using a Bluetooth-equipped smartphone. Sphero's manufacturer, US-based Orbotix, was in Barcelona to launch a new range of augmented reality games, including one in which the robotic ball becomes, in Orbotox's own words, ""a cupcake-munching beaver."" Running, jumping and standing still . Taiwan's HTC, having nothing new to promote beyond last year's showstopping One X, instead decided to offer up a troupe of Parkour athletes who wowed congress-goers with their acrobatics. Why? We have no idea. Barry Neild contributed to this story from London, England.","GPS-enabled walking stick among the usual uses for mobile technology on display at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- Like all online businesses, the marketing industry is being radically changed by the creeping ubiquity of mobile devices. This shift to the smaller screen will inevitably have profound implications on both global marketing companies like WPP and Omnicom as well as on Internet companies like Google and Facebook whose revenue is mostly derived from online advertising. It was no surprise, therefore, that one of the major themes his weekend at Stream, the annual WPP ""unconference"" about digital advertising and marketing, was the growing importance of mobile. Held each September in the delightful Greek seaside resort of Marathon, Stream is distinguished by the audience-generated content from the 400 entrepreneurs, and advertising and marketing executives invited to the event. Talks by participants this year at Stream thus had titles like ""Monetizing social discussion,"" ""Banners are dead,"" ""Mobile payments At scale,"" ""Who will own your mobile wallet"" and ""Unlocking $50 billion in digital brand spend."" Yet for all the talk about mobile, Stream was, in part, characterized by a deep uncertainty about its impact on the industry. As Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP's long-time CEO, said in response to a question about whether Facebook can successfully monetize mobile technology: ""We don't know the answer."" But I had a simpler question for the Stream attendees that I met in Marathon over the weekend. Is it possible, I asked, that the digital marketing industry could be destroyed by mobile? Could the shift to smaller screens actually kill online marketing? ""The small screen will disrupt but not kill the advertising industry,"" Jeff Pulver, a serial American internet entrepreneur and a regular Stream attendee, explained to me. Perhaps. But that disruption, many people at Stream acknowledge, will be deeply challenging. It's a challenge, SessionM Chief Revenue Officer Bill Clifford told me, is to ""create big moments on a small screen."" Clifford describes himself as an ""inventor of new ad models in mobile."" But those new ad models being developed by Clifford at SessionM are still, at best, in their infancy. And as Amy Gershkoff, the Global Director of Analytics at the PR agency Burston-Marsteller, told me, mobile will only successfully monetized when the advertising industry understand that mobile isn't just a smaller screen version of traditional Internet media. ""We need to rethink advertising,"" Gershkoff insists. We need to think about it, she says, as a personal service to mobile users. Many Stream attendees agreed with Gershkoff that both the challenge and opportunity of mobile lies with its intensely personalized nature. ""The days of dumb advertising are over,"" Randall Rothenberg, the President and CEO of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) told me over breakfast at Stream. Bill Clifford's ""big moments"" must then, in fact, be big ""personal"" moments if the marketing industry is to successful transition to mobile media. Perhaps the best description of the challenge was expressed to me in Marathon by the legendary investor and WPP board member Ester Dyson, who said that the advertising industry needed to ""deliver value rather than just describing value."" Because we look at our mobile devices all the time, Dyson told me, this media should be ""every advertisers dream."" But the industry needs to learn to create useful products to consumers, such as Delta airline's bag tracking app, rather than just gratuitously impersonal advertising. Mobile advertisers, Dyson explained, need to distinguish between media as a mirror and a painting. In the old days of television or desktop Internet advertising, advertising was like a painting that we could all admire without seeing ourselves. But today, Dyson says, advertising has a mirror with personalized information unique to us if we are to pay for information or products. Amy Gershkoff sees three promising models for a mobile marketers and advertisers. The first is way in which Amazon is enabling consumers to scan products in stores with their mobile devices to get their online price. The second is Starbucks initiative to enable their customers to pay for their coffee via mobiles. And the third is the geo-targeted and content-targeted advertising that YouTube has developed specifically for mobile devices. No event like Stream would, of course, be complete without the radical optimists -- the ""Unlocking $50 billion in digital brand spend"" crowd - who believe that mobile will trigger a unique cornucopia of opportunities for the advertising industry. But, as the IAB's Rothenberg told me, the funny thing about the advertising industry is its constancy. From 1917 onwards, he explained, advertising has always made up around 2% of US GDP. So, while - to borrow some words of wisdom from WPP's Martin Sorrell - ""we don't know the answer"" to how exactly the small screen revolution will change advertising, mobile probably won't radically alter the size of the industry. The more things change then, the more they stay the same. Which is why it is probably appropriate that Stream is held each year in Marathon - the little town outside Athens that knows all about the unchanging and challenging nature of the long distance race.","Mobile is changing the face of marketing but no one is sure what the long-term impact will be .

"(CNN) -- Many of Europe's leading tech entrepreneurs are meeting at the annual LeWeb conference in Paris this week to celebrate the future - an ""Internet of things"" governed by intelligent devices. But, rather than Paris, the most consequential European meeting about the future of the Internet this week may have taken place in Brussels on Monday. In contrast with the radically transparent networking culture that characterizes LeWeb, the Brussels event was a meeting between two powerful bureaucrats that took place, like all meetings between powerful bureaucrats, behind closed doors. Jon Leibowitz, the Chairman of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) met with Joaquin Almunia, the vice-president of the European Commission to discuss Google - the dominant company on today's Internet. Specifically, they were meeting to discuss potential FTC and EU anti-trust lawsuits against the tech giant, in an attempt to resolve the Google problem. It's a very simple problem. The future may, indeed, have arrived on the Internet. But rather than being run by intelligent devices, it's unfortunately being run more and more by a single company -- Google, which controls over 90% of the search market in several European countries. And the problem, as both the FTC and the commission recognize, is that this dominance may, in part, be illegal. Google has been accused in both Europe and the United States of using its dominant position in search to unfairly promote its own products and services -- from travel and shopping comparison engines to advertising and mapping. These accusations have been well documented and extend from successful American internet companies such as Yelp, Expedia and Nextag to European start-ups like eJustice.fr and Foundem. At a press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, Almunia confirmed that the commission was working ""intensively"" on its probe of Google. Meanwhile, Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt, in a characteristically pugnacious message to Almunia and Leibowitz, told the Wall Street Journal that ""it's time for them to sort of move to one resolution or another. It's not like they don't have a million documents and so forth."" Schmidt is right. Given the speed of technological change, it's time for both the commission and the FTC to decide whether or not to bring their anti-trust lawsuits against Google. The longer both Almunia and Leibowitz wait, the more powerful Google becomes, and the more indecisive and laggardly the regulators appear. Time is, indeed, of the essence. As the future arrives on all our devices and ""the Internet of things"" becomes a reality, it is essential that this Google problem, which is undermining entrepreneurial innovation, is resolved. An Internet of things must be a place of all of our things, not just Google's things. And as Google products such as its self-driving cars and data goggles pioneer this brave new world of intelligent devices, it is essential that the FTC and the commission guarantee that the ubiquitous Google search engine doesn't degenerate into a platform for this increasingly powerful company to hawk its own intelligent products and services. Google's Eric Schmidt spoke at Le Web last year. ""This particular conference is one of the best venues for new entrepreneurs in Europe,"" he said, rightly, of Europe's largest Internet event. But for future entrepreneurs really to be able to innovate, we need fair search which doesn't prioritize the products and services of Google itself. We are thus relying on Leibowitz and Almunia. Let's hope they can make a decision on whether to move ahead with their anti-trust cases by the end of the year. Let's hope they can solve the Google problem. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Keen.","U.S. and EU regulators met in Brussels this week to discuss ""the Google problem""

"(CNN) -- Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Hillary Clinton on Friday accused the camp of rival Sen. Barack Obama of politicizing the death of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Sen. Hillary Clinton says she regrets that Sen. Barack Obama's camp ""would be politicizing this tragedy."" Obama called that assertion ""silly"" and said the Clinton campaign thought that the unrest in Pakistan would work to its benefit. ""What happened is that the Clinton campaign started pushing this notion that somehow, immediately after this happened, that somehow this was going to advantage their campaign. And one of my campaign aides responded,"" Obama told CNN's Jessica Yellin on Friday. The latest battle between the two Democratic front-runners began Thursday when Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, seemed to link Clinton's vote on the Iraq war and Bhutto's death. ""Barack Obama had the judgment to oppose the war in Iraq. And he warned at the time that it would divert us from Afghanistan and al Qaeda, and now we see the effect of that,"" Axelrod said. ""Sen. Clinton made a different judgment."" On Friday, Clinton replied in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer by saying, ""I just regret that [Obama and his chief strategist] would be politicizing this tragedy, and especially at a time when we do need to figure out a way forward."" ""I don't think politics should be playing a role in how our country responds ... to the tragedy,"" she said.  Watch what Clinton says about Obama » . Clinton also called for an independent, international investigation into Bhutto's death, ""perhaps along the lines of what the United Nations have been doing with respect to the assassination of Prime Minister Hariri in Lebanon."" Obama said he doesn't share that view. ""It is important to us to not give the idea that Pakistan is unable to handle its own affairs,"" he said. Bhutto died Thursday after a political rally in Rawarlpindi, Pakistan. Obama's campaign has impled that some of Clinton's foreign policy decisions raise questions about whether she should be president. Axelrod was responding to reporters' questions about the Pakistan situation and whether it enhanced assertions that Clinton's foreign policy experience may make her more fit to serve as commander in chief.  See what candidates say about Bhutto's death » . Axelrod later seemed to back away from his earlier remarks. ""I believe our policies in Iraq have had a direct impact on events in Pakistan and Afghanistan, but I would not suggest there is a straight line relationship between the events of today in Pakistan and anyone's particular vote,"" he said Thursday. ""What I was pointing out was the difference in judgment at the time. Obama thought that the war would have a negative impact in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and that seems relevant right now."" He also said he ""certainly wasn't suggesting Sen. Clinton was complicit. She made a bad judgment on this war, and the war helped exacerbate problems in Afghanistan and Pakistan. And that's certainly something I would stand by."" Obama defended his strategist late Thursday when asked about Axelrod's comments. ""This is one of those situations where Washington is putting a spin on it,"" Obama said. ""He in no way was suggesting Hillary Clinton was somehow directly to blame for this situation."" The senator from Illinois added, ""It's important for us to not look at this in terms of short-term political points scoring."" Clinton said the world deserves answers about the attack on Bhutto. ""I don't think the Pakistani government at this time under President Musharraf has any credibility at all. They have disbanded an independent judiciary. They have oppressed a free press,"" she said. Obama on Friday said that as president, he would pressure Musharraf to crack down on terrorists by suspending U.S. aid to Pakistan and to make sure that Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is not in the wrong hands. The exchange between the Obama and Clinton camps is less than a week before Iowa's January 3 caucuses. Most polls put Clinton and Obama in a three-way tie with former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina. E-mail to a friend .","Barack Obama adviser seems to link vote on Iraq war, Benazir Bhutto's death .

"(CNN) -- Environmental authorities are investigating the deaths of more than 800 dolphins that have washed up on the northern coast of Peru this year. The dolphins may have died from an outbreak of Morbillivirus or Brucella bacteria, said Peruvian Deputy Environment Minister Gabriel Quijandria, according to Peru's state-run Andina news agency. Speaking to CNN, he said he expects test results to be ready within the week. ""Right now, the most probable hypothesis is that it's a virus outbreak,"" he said. Quijandria said Thursday that 877 dolphins have washed up in a 220-kilometer (137-mile) area from Punta Aguja to Lambayeque, in the north of the country. More than 80% of those dolphins were found in an advanced state of decomposition, making it difficult to study their deaths, according to Andina. Earlier last week, the Peruvian government put together a panel from different ministries to analyze a report by the Peruvian Sea Institute (IMARPE). Officials have been able to conclude that the dolphins' deaths were not due to lack of food, interaction with fisheries, poisoning with pesticides, biotoxin poisoning or contamination by heavy metals. ""When you have something this large, my gut would tell me that there's something traumatic that happened,"" Sue Rocca, a marine biologist with the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, told CNN. She floated a number of number of possibilities as to what could have killed the animals, including acoustic trauma, but concluded that investigators just don't know yet. ""More investigation needs to be done,"" she said. The dolphin deaths in Peru are mark the third set of high-profile strandings in about two months. In February, 179 dolphins --108 of which were dead -- washed ashore in Cape Cod, in eastern United States, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare. Marine biologists are still trying to determine the cause of those deaths. In early March, amateur video taken from a beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, showed more than 30 dolphins on shore. In that instance, all dolphins were safely returned to the sea.","NEW: ""More investigation needs to be done,"" says a marine biologist .

"(CNN) -- Egypt goes to the polls on Saturday for a referendum on a new constitution that has divided the country in recent weeks, prompting mass demonstrations reminiscent of those that ousted former president Hosni Mubarak. Thousands of protesters, both for and against President Mohamed Morsy, have taken to the streets over the past three weeks, with tensions occasionally boiling over in violent clashes that have left at least seven people dead and hundreds injured. What's behind the latest unrest? The protests were sparked by a November 22 presidential decree issued by Morsy -- the first freely elected leader of this country of 83 million -- which prevented any court from overturning his decisions until a new, post-Mubarak constitution was passed. The ruling has essentially given him unchecked power, protecting from judicial review any decisions he has made since assuming office. What was Morsy's rationale? Insisting the order is temporary -- it will last only until a new constitution is put in place -- Morsy claimed the move was intended to safeguard the revolution. He said the edict would only apply to ""sovereign"" matters. In particular, Morsy said, the edict was aimed at preventing interference from the courts in the work of Egypt's Constituent Assembly, the body charged with drafting a new constitution. The judges, many of whom were holdover loyalists from the government of Mubarak, are widely viewed as hostile to the Islamists who now dominate the assembly that has been charged with framing a new constitution. Some had threatened to shut down the assembly. Morsy's move, which has concentrated power in the hands of the executive, is a continuation of the power struggles between Morsy's Muslim Brotherhood -- the Islamist movement that is Egypt's most powerful political force and won nearly half the seats in parliamentary elections -- and the remnants of the military-dominated establishment of the Mubarak years. In June, just weeks before Morsy's election, Egypt's military leaders declared parliament invalid and dissolved the body, a ruling which was upheld by Egypt's highest court in September. After his election, Morsy defied the military leadership by calling parliament into session. Morsy's edict ruled out the possibility of repeat interference. In August, the president moved decisively against the military leadership, sending into retirement Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi -- who, as Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, had acted as the country's de facto ruler in the wake of Mubarak's ouster and prior to Morsy's election. What has been the response to the presidential decree? Morsy's decree has sharply divided Egyptians. While the Muslim Brotherhood is standing by their man, holding large rallies to show support, many other Egyptians have seen the order as an alarming and undemocratic power grab -- a lurch back towards an authoritarian style of leadership the country had only recently overthrown. Left-leaning and liberal Egyptians -- who had played a large part in the revolution but were sidelined by the success of Islamists in subsequent elections -- made up a large component of the protestors in Tahrir Square. Many of their chants accused Morsy, the first democratically elected president, of becoming a ""new pharaoh"" and ""dictator."" ""In some ways, the liberal and left-wing forces are trying to stake a claim to the revolution again through the protests,"" Laleh Khalili, a reader in politics at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies, told CNN. The demonstrators, who have been calling on Morsy to resign, also included some of those sympathetic to the military and the old regime, she said. Why has this come about now? Morsy issued his edict the day after the November 21 cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, which he had played a central role in brokering. Khalili said that, buoyed with new found political capital from his successful foray on the international stage, the Egyptian president may have miscalculated, underestimating the level of outrage his actions would provoke. The anger on the streets, she said, also reflected a level of public dissatisfaction with progress made since the revolution in addressing issues of poverty and inequality in a country with an unemployment rate of more than 12%, a median age of about 24 years, and a per capita GDP of $6,500. ""Many of the original grievances behind the revolution were derived from questions around extreme inequality and corruption,"" she said. ""Those issues have not been addressed."" The protests represented ""a perfect storm of many grievances coming to the fore,"" she said, and it was not clear how it would play out. ""It's a fundamental challenge to the legitimacy of the regime."" What else was in the declaration? Other aspects of Morsy's edict are likely to prove popular with many of those who have taken to the streets against him. In his decree, Morsy also announced that all deaths and violence connected to the uprising against Mubarak would be investigated again, with those responsible retried if necessary. This raised the possibility that Mubarak, currently serving a life prison term, could be re-prosecuted, along with a number of regime figures who were previously acquitted. Some Egyptians have expressed disappointment that security forces and officials have escaped punishment over last year's violent crackdown on protestors. Morsy also sacked the prosecutor-general in his declaration, and extended the timeline for drafting the constitution by two months. But while those resolutions may be welcomed by many, the unilateral manner in which Morsy has gone about expanding his powers has alarmed many. ""It's the way he's doing it that has gotten people upset, because it reminds them of the way Mubarak used to govern,"" Peter Jones, a Middle East expert at the University of Ottawa, told CNN. One popular slogan during the current protests has been ""Morsy is Mubarak."" If Morsy's new powers are only temporary, why the outrage? Protesters claim he has used the edict to hijack the process in order to produce a document that reflects his Islamist vision and consolidates his power in the new Egypt. Liberal, left-wing and Christian members of the assembly boycotted the body over concerns that their views were not being given enough consideration by Islamists -- with many of them subsequently replaced by Islamists. What is happening with the constitution now? The Islamist-dominated assembly has now passed a finalized 234-article draft of the constitution, which is due to go for a public vote on Saturday, December 15. But there has been sharp opposition to the document, with critics fearing it could lead to excessive restrictions, and claiming it offers inadequate protection of the rights of religious minorities and women. ""(Morsy) put to referendum a draft constitution that undermines basic freedoms & violates universal values,"" wrote Mohamed ElBaradei, a Nobel laureate and head of the liberal Constitution Party, on his Twitter account. ""The struggle will continue."" Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said that ""moving a flawed and contradictory draft to a vote is not the right way to guarantee fundamental rights or to promote respect for the rule of law."" The draft constitution maintains the principles of sharia as the main source of legislation -- a position unchanged from the constitution under Mubarak. But Mohamed Naeem, a member of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party, said he fears the proposed constitution would open the way for a theocracy by moving the country even closer to codifying sharia law. What is the military's position? Despite Morsy's struggles with remnants of the old regime within the military establishment, the armed forces -- which ruled Egypt for more than a year after the fall of Mubarak -- has largely stayed out of the stand-off. But on Saturday, December 8, it issued its first statement, urging the parties to enter into dialogue to resolve the crisis and vowing to protect public institutions and innocent people. ""Anything other than that will lead us into a dark tunnel with catastrophic consequences, which we will never allow to happen,"" it warned. Will the opposition participate in the referendum? In an apparent attempt to defuse the crisis, Morsy canceled most of his decree on Sunday, December 9, but vowed to press ahead with the referendum. The cancellation of the decree was not retroactive, which meant that any decisions he had made since its announcement still stood -- including the decision to approve the draft constitution. This led to speculation the opposition would boycott the vote. But leading opposition group the National Salvation Front -- a coalition formed of liberal and secular parties -- subsequently urged its supporters to participate if it was not successful in delaying the referendum by a month. The opposition Dignity Party said its members would participate, but wanted assurances that the vote would be fair, while other parties, including the 6 April youth movement, which backed Morsy in the June elections, have urged members to vote against the draft constitution.","Five people have been killed as Egyptians protest a presidential edict and draft constitution .

"(CNN) -- Dani Pedrosa repeated his 2012 success at a sweltering Sepang Sunday but his Honda teammate Marc Marquez took another big step towards the MotoGP world title by finishing a fine second. The 20-year-old Marquez won a thrilling battle with defending champion Jorge Lorenzo for Yamaha to increase his lead over his fellow Spaniard in the championship standings to 43 points. Marquez can wrap up the title next week at Philip Island in Australia, the first rookie to win the MotoGP premier crown in 35 years. He admitted that getting the better of Lorenzo, moving ahead for the final time halfway through the 20 lap race was satisfying. ""It was a nice battle with Jorge. I enjoyed it a lot,"" Marquez told the official MotoGP website. ""The target of this weekend was to finish in front of Jorge,"" he said, . It left Pedrosa to go unchallenged to the finish for this third win of the season and to close within 11 points of second placed Lorenzo in the title standings. He took command in 40 degree Celsius temperatures, taking the lead from polesitter Marquez early in the race. ""It's a great feeling to be back... I came back strong,"" said Pedrosa, who suffered a crash in the last round in Spain after a coming together with Marquez. The incident earned Marquez a penalty point, his third of the season and a warning. Lorenzo's teammate, seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi of Italy, finished fourth followed by Spanish Honda rider Alvaro Bautista. Britain's rising star Cal Crutchlow, who started third on the grid, eventually finished sixth, just ahead of compatriot Bradley Smith. Malaysia is the 15th race of the 18 round season, with Australia next, followed by Japan and the final race in Valencia.

"(CNN) -- As Ramadan has drawn to a close -- and with it, mandatory daytime fasting -- Muslims can breathe a sigh of relief as their diets return to normal. Many, however, will be surprised to find their clothes a little snugger, and their health in a perilous state. Though the month-long season is associated with deprivation, overeating is common practice once the sun goes down. In many hospitals in the Gulf states of the Middle East, the holiday means a sharp rise in inpatients. ""We see a fair increase in digestive-related complaints,"" admits Rabee Harb, a family doctor at Kuwait's Royale Hayat Hospital, who has noticed an uptick in cases of indigestion, gastroenteritis and peptic ulcer disease. ""It's a combination of overeating or binge eating, and reduced immunity due to dehydration and bad sleeping habits,"" he says. Harb also points out the range of medical emergencies during the period that are less directly linked to food. Heat stress due to dehydration, particularly among construction workers, is a particular problem. There is also an increase in traffic accidents, which he attributes to fasting-related drowsiness. ""Fasting and poor sleep aid this. They lead to tiredness and a lack of concentration,"" he says. Read more: Ramadan's Super Bowl effect . Fasting-related illnesses have become an increasing problem in Gulf countries. In 2011, the Hamad Medical Corporation in Doha reported 7,700 cases in the first week of Ramadan alone. Dana Al Shakaa, a dietician at American Hospital in Dubai, acknowledges she treats an extra five to six patients a day during the holiday season. ""They don't always know why they're suffering,"" she says of her patients. ""They come in with headaches, dizziness or nausea, and it will be from low blood sugar."" Al Shakaa also notes that many patients are diagnosed with diabetes during this time. ""There's a surge in uncontrolled diabetes cases during Ramadan,"" confirms Harb. Flare-ups are often aggravated by the fact that many with the disease forgo their medication during this time. ""There is significant non-compliance with medications due to disturbed eating and sleeping habits,"" he admits. In recent years, the region has witnessed an increasing struggle with obesity and diabetes. Last month, a United Nations study rated many Gulf Cooperation Council countries as among the world's fattest. According to Harb, it is only recently, with the advent of high-sugar, high-fat foods in the region, that the season has been met with health dangers. ""The Gulf's diet was severely limited in the past. Sweets, sugar and fatty foods were in short supply and low demand,"" he says. Nowadays, consumption of sugary drinks, like Vimto, has become a Ramadan tradition. ""A cultural shift to take-away food is easily noticeable in Kuwait,"" he says. ""It is reflected in the long lines that form outside of restaurants like McDonald's and Burger King, even very late at night."" Experts agree that fasting itself isn't the problem, so much as how it's practiced. ""If you do it right, fasting can be very effective for weight loss,"" says Alia Al Moayed, a nutritional therapist and health journalist in Bahrain. ""The problem is we do it wrong."" Al Moayed notes that after Ramadan, her client list also fattens up. ""I'd say my business increases 25%,"" she says. ""In the West, Christmas is the time of year people gain weight. It's the same with Ramadan, only it's a month long.""","Thousands in the Gulf region are hospitalized due to fasting-related illnesses during Ramadan .

"(CNN) -- The wonder of travel lies equally with adventure and misadventure -- there is nothing like getting thoroughly lost in a riddling country or culture that is not your own. But it is hard these days, with our ultra-planned excursions, fixers and 4G service, to get properly disoriented. Labyrinths, however, can remind us how it's done. These mazes have appeared in various corners of the world throughout history. One can be found in a petroglyph on a river shore in Goa, India; cut into the stones of Ireland's many medieval churches; and arranged in a contemporary land-art installation at Lands End in San Francisco. Traditionally, they kept evil in and invaders out. They have been used as pleasure walks, meditative journeys and symbolic life-into-death pilgrimages. Classical thinkers Herodotus, Pliny and Strabo each praised the Egyptian maze of Middle Kingdom that Pharaoh Amenemhat III constructed in the 19th century B.C. to protect his Hawara tomb. (Strabo called it a wonder of the world.) Before taking to the high seas, Scandinavian sailors built stone labyrinths to trap sinister winds that might follow them. Daedalus famously used one to trap a minotaur. Literary figures also embraced the labyrinth. Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges's peculiar love of them is well known -- he wrote once of gods who lived in them, encircled by forking paths. Lesser known is Jane Austen's affinity, particularly for the large rambling hedge maze at Sydney Garden in Bath, England (since gone), where she wished to walk every day. Proust once wrote, ""The only true voyage of discovery...would be not to visit strange lands but to possess other eyes, to behold the universe through the eyes of another."" That heightened sense isn't developed so much by traveling the world as by remembering to focus on where we stand. And the wonder of unexpected encounters, the anticipation of what might lie around the next corner, is a charm of labyrinths of all kinds, from the underground city of Derinkuyu in Cappadocia, Turkey, to the overhanging gardens of Marqueyssac in Périgord, France. Departures: World's best sculpture parks . Derinkuyu Underground City, Cappadocia, Turkey . Cut into one of the long, finger-like stone formations that make Cappadocia famous, the underground city of Derinkuyu is an eight-level warren of traps and wrong turns descending about 200 feet into the earth. Believed to have been built in the seventh or eighth century B.C. by the ancient Phrygian people, it was subsequently enlarged by early Christians to foil the armies of various Zealot empires. Nearly 20,000 people could live behind its sealed stone doors for nearly four months, and presumably any soldiers who had the misfortune to pursue them through the narrow passageways would get lost or be squashed by one of the Indiana Jones-style rolling-boulder traps. Göreme, a town that houses one of the best collections of cave churches in the region, is nearby. The more recent chapels are decorated with extraordinary examples of Byzantine Christian painting; don't miss the sinister frescoes at Karanlik Kilise (the Dark Church). Chartres Labyrinth, Chartres Cathedral, France . A rose labyrinth, laid into the floor at Chartres Cathedral, was arranged by a bishop in 1360 for an Easter celebration of the liturgy of Vespers. During the ceremony, a representative walked to the labyrinth's center, killed Satan (known until that time as the minotaur), triumphed over death and illuminated the world with a yellow ball that he tossed to his audience. The Chartres labyrinth is designed as a single path that coils and unfurls, turning back and forth within a 40-foot circle. Now, once a month, chairs that normally cover the display are moved so pilgrims can walk the maze -- replicas of which exist at churches and mediation centers all across the world -- to symbolically move, as at the crypts, toward reconciliation while passing from life into death. Walkers are exhorted to engage fully in body and spirit for true meditation, leaving themselves open to moments of grace. Departures: Stunning library architecture . Hampton Court Palace, Herefordshire, England . Hedge mazes evolved out of the twisting paths of knot gardens popularized during the high Renaissance -- an exercise in ordering nature. Until the era of William III of England (aka William of Orange), hedge mazes were unicursal, following a single path, rather than puzzles riven with wrong turns and dead ends that were meant to disorder human perception. In 1700, William III commissioned the famous hedge maze at Surrey's Hampton Court Palace, and the trapezoidal labyrinth remains the largest and most famous of its kind in England. (Supposedly visitors can get lost for hours.) The palace itself, complete with a great medieval hall where Shakespeare performed and Henry VIII's tapestries still hang, is worth the visit. Capuchin Crypt, Rome . The Roman Catacombs may not be as famous as those in Paris -- they have fewer passageways lined with piles of bones and are less centralized, consisting of hundreds of connecting tombs. But one particular crypt, separate from the rest, far outstrips any bone pile. The Capuchin Crypt, below the Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini church on the Via Veneto, was built when the order relocated in 1631, with 300 cartloads of exhumed friars in tow. The resulting display of skull-pile archways and spine-section ""rose windows"" -- now comprising roughly 3,700 skeletons -- are meant to remind us (according to the Capuchins) of the swift passage of life into death. They also serve to remind us of Christendom's peculiar brand of surrealist acuity. Departures: Top travel apps . Bara Imambara, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India . The fort at Lucknow, in the state of Uttar Pradesh, is known as Bara Imambara (or Asafi Imambara). It was built as a massive labyrinth, or bhul bhulaiya (another of its nicknames), to confuse and delay any invaders who had been able to solve the riddle of its names and locate it on a map. The architecture is early Nawabian, mimicking the Mughal styles, and is the only building in Lucknow without European architectural influence. It was commissioned in 1784 to employ the poor during a drought. Even after its completion, Asaf-Ud-Daula, the Imambara's commissioner and nawab (a person of high status) of Lucknow, spent hundreds of thousands of rupees annually on the hall's decoration. Wandering from room to room through the halls is now its own wondrous indulgence. Haeinsa Temple, South Korea . Since 1398, the Haeinsa Temple complex in South Korea's mountains has housed the Tripitaka Koreana -- the entire Buddhist scriptures carved onto more than 81,300 wooden blocks and said to be among the most accurate in the world. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site 597 years later. Thousands of monks from around the country make the trip there every October to carry the block scriptures on their heads in parade. Each spring, a maze of colored lanterns is arranged in one of the facility's courtyards in a labyrinthine form derived from the swastika, which in Korean Buddhism usually refers to the intersection of truths. Those willing to participate in morning and evening prayer are welcome to do a temple stay (templestay.com) and wander the colored maze or the mountain paths and shrines along the rugged face of Mount Gayasan. Departures: Top private movie theaters . Overhanging Gardens of Marqueyssac, Périgord, France . In Périgord, France, the hundred-year-old boxwoods of the overhanging gardens of Marqueyssac are still handshaped into a delightful hedge maze that recalls equal parts Carrollian Wonderland and Seussian Whoville. Bertrand Vernet de Marqueyssac, counselor to Louis XIV, built the comparatively simple castle just before the French Revolution as a summer home, complete with terraced gardens and walks. In 1860, half a century later -- in a fit of Romantic effulgence that shifted the style from flat-topped, spiraling hedge motifs to whimsical three-dimensional landscapes -- Julien de Cervel began planting the boxwood garden. (Hedge mazes in England at the time were being torn down.) Here, the sole purpose of the intricate walkway -- nearly four miles of paths curl around 54 acres of garden and land -- is pleasure. (Leave it to the French.) Walkers can admire other visitors over the many hedges, not to mention wide views of the Dordogne Valley.

"London (CNN) -- I always thought London 2012 would be a success, but never imagined it would be quite the triumph it has turned out to be. From the brilliant opening ceremony to the festival of music and fun closing it, via mainly lovely weather, some epoch-making athletic events, and a home team performance that exceeded even the most optimistic expectations, the Games have given London two of the most remarkable weeks in a great city's rich history. The question now is where it all goes from here. Do we look back, as the Australians and the Greeks have done after Sydney and Athens, and say: ""Well that was wonderful, but it kind of went downhill from there?"" Australia's relatively poor performance on the field of play suggests they didn't get the legacy right from Sydney -- one of the key challenges for London now -- whilst the Greeks, at the epicenter of the eurozone crises, remind us the attention of the world will quickly revert to the state of the global economy. I remember, on leaving Athens eight years ago, hearing both the public and politicians say this was the starting point for a new and better Greece. A lot has gone wrong since. Even as the Brits were celebrating more gold, Bank of England Governor Sir Mervyn King was giving one of the gloomiest gubernatorial assessments of the future I have ever heard. And we all know that after a party as fantastic as the one we have had, there is bound to be a hangover to come during the lull before the Paralympics open. For the politicians, who have to lead the country through difficult times, capturing the Olympic mood and turning it into something of positive and lasting significance has now been added to their list of challenges. Politics, banking, the media and the church are among many parts of national life that have seen their reputations lowered in recent years. It has felt at times in the past fortnight that sport is filling some of the gaps. Read more: Olympics give London a golden glow . If politicians try too hard to associate themselves with the gold rush, it could easily backfire. They will find it hard to resist demands for more investment in school sport, or tax breaks for sporting clubs and activities, and any number of campaigns backed by a small army of new heroes. I hope they take up an idea I proposed some months ago to raise sport to the Cabinet table, not least for the economic and social opportunities it brings. Yet equally, once life settles back down to something closer to normality, they will find the same pressures from other walks of life too, and the same frighteningly difficult economic sums to add up. But they do have to make decisions and they do now, finally, have to seize the opportunity for a proper sports strategy to build on the success of the Games and the joy and fulfillment sport has shown it can bring. I had a call today from an athletics club organizer saying he had been inundated by kids and parents wanting to join, but worried he didn't have the capacity to give them what they thought they would be getting. But nor should the anti-politics brigade underestimate the role that politics played both in the getting and running of the Games, and in the success of Team GB. Success has many fathers, and President Truman was so right when he said how much more could be achieved if nobody cared who got the credit. While huge credit has rightly gone to LOCOG chairman Seb Coe and his team, John Major's government does deserve credit for setting up the National Lottery which enabled proper investment in elite sport. Tony Blair's government does deserve credit for increased investment and school sports partnerships (which the current government was so wrong to cut) and Blair deserves huge credit for the diplomatic skills he used which swung the last few votes for London against Paris to land the Games. Read more: Wiggins' win brings Games back to the people . Politicians of all parties deserve credit for ensuring that handovers of power both at government and mayoral level have taken place without the stability and success of this enormous project being put at risk. During the opening ceremony, I tweeted that ""Danny Boyle is explaining the Big Society to David Cameron."" Okay, a bit of a cheap shot. But for me the genius of the ceremony lay in capturing not just the greatness of our past, but the insight that, provided we recognize we are now a very different country to what we were, we have the chance for a great future too. Fast forward several days to the greatest night of all when in less than an hour, a black Somali asylum seeker, a mixed-race northerner and a tall, good-looking ginger man won athletics Golds, and you could almost hear the nation saying: ""This is who we are."" The problem with the Big Society was not the idea but its execution. Danny Boyle did give a more coherent vision of it than the politicians have done, and the Games gave a sense of what it could mean in practice. Government setting bold ambitions and finding the team from public and private sector to deliver on them. Liberating people with expertise to deliver on the specific goals for their part of the project. Harnessing the energy and support of businesses and people to make it happen. It has already led to cultural change and we will see soon enough -- with the start of the football season -- if it has any chance of enduring. I have exited hundreds of stadia in my time. But the atmosphere coming out of the Olympic Park in these last few days has been like no atmosphere I have ever experienced before. The first thing you notice is how clean everything is. Cans, bottles, litter -- they seem to be in bins, not chucked to the ground. There are also fewer police officers than you usually see leaving a big event. People talk on the tube to strangers. Read more: Olympic killjoys left out in the cold? The volunteers have been the key to all this. They are everywhere. And they are nice. And they are just having a good time helping others to have a good time. There is such a positivity to these Games that comes not just from sporting success but the scale of the project and the fact Britain pulled it off; the superb venues and the smoothness of the movement of big crowds through them; the transport system working well; the phenomenal support the British public has given at every single venue. But right up there is the role of the Games Makers: Mr and Mrs Britain. These are the real Middle Englanders, and they are the antithesis of the negativity of those newspapers which claim to be the voice of the British people. That same positivity is the reason London Mayor Boris Johnson emerged as one of the political winners of the Games. When so many people and media were talking down the prospects of things going well, he talked them up. By contrast, the government has not managed to tap into the new mood that is so much a part of why these Games have been such a success. Cameron sought to become Prime Minister on the back of a message about ""Broken Britain."" His Health Secretary Andrew Lansley talks down the National Health Service as a way of justifying reforms that were not voted for and appear unwanted by many who run the service. Education Secretary Michael Gove is more at ease criticizing teachers and pupils and talking down success than he is in building it up. A year ago, amid the London riots, people were entitled to wonder if Mr Cameron had a point about Broken Britain. But anyone who has been touched by these Games knows that Britain is anything but broken, that the best of British can in its own way compete with anywhere in the world. We have shown it in sport. But just think to some of the cultural icons on display at both ends of the Games, from Dizzee Rascal to Tim Berners-Lee, and it is clear we show it there too. In their own way, I think these Olympics could be one of the most significant events of our lifetime. They are changing the way British people think about themselves and about their country. We have shown we can do big things well. We have shown we can succeed at anything we set our minds to. We have changed the way many overseas think about us. The challenge for the media, as Lord Justice Leveson deliberates on their future, is to understand this rejection of relentless negativity and Cowell-esque faux celebrities is for real. The challenge for the politicians is to understand that they too must cut back on the ""Everything is terrible"" narrative, set clear directions and be strategic about how they meet them. Cameron's rushed out statement on school and elite sport over the weekend -- when what is needed is a thought through long-term big scale plan -- was not a good start, but we have seen a new mood emerge. The hope now is it can lead to a new media and a new politics too. In addition to the millions being inspired to get more active, that would be quite a legacy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alastair Campbell.","London's Games have been an unexpected triumph, says Alastair Campbell .

"(CNN) -- As a federal air marshal, Robert MacLean typically spent five days a week crisscrossing the country on commercial flights, reading a lot of newspapers and John Grisham novels while keeping an eye out and trying to appear inconspicuous. ""It was a well-paying job with enormous responsibility, yet extremely tedious and mundane,"" he said. ""You did the same thing every day, there was nothing new. You sat in your seat and prayed that nobody would set off an IED or ambush you mid-flight."" Armed with service weapons and usually traveling in pairs, federal air marshals are tasked with detecting, deterring and defeating ""hostile acts targeting U.S. air carriers, airports, passengers, and crews,"" according to the Transportation Security Administration's Web site. If the air marshals are doing their job properly, the public does not learn about the incidents or potential catastrophes they've prevented, Department of Homeland Security spokesman Nelson Minerly said. ""Federal air marshals are trained to operate covertly and to blend in with the traveling public,"" he said. ""They work in the air and on the ground as a last line of defense, but if they're doing the job right, you don't know they're there."" A federal air marshal was not on Northwest Flight 253 when a passenger allegedly tried to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear. But the agency said the incident prompted it to enhance airport screening procedures and put more air marshals aboard flights. The Federal Air Marshal Program has been around in one form or another since the early 1960s, when a rash of hijackings of flights to Cuba prompted President Kennedy to order that federal law enforcement officers be placed on high-risk flights. The Federal Air Marshal Service officially began in 1968 as the Federal Aviation Administration's Sky Marshal Program, and in the 1970s, extortion-type hijackings in the Middle East led to the deployment of some air marshals overseas. In 1985, President Regan expanded the program, increasing the number of air marshals, in response to a series of domestic and international hijackings, including TWA Flight 847, in which a U.S. Navy Diver was killed and his body dumped on the tarmac in Beirut, Lebanon. The terror attacks of September 11, 2001, represented a turning point in the agency's history, when it grew from less than 50 officers to the several thousand currently employed as federal law enforcement officers in the TSA, Minerly said. Law enforcement officers and military personnel made up most of the first recruits to join the agency's replenished ranks in October 2001, said Jamie Smith, a former federal air marshal instructor and current CEO of SCG International, a global security firm. Recruits are trained extensively in tactical operations and law enforcement procedure. ""They go through how to go hands-on with somebody in the tight confines of an aircraft, from how to disable an attacker from a seated position, how to fight if you fall down in the aisle, or how to use different items onboard to subdue and restrain attackers,"" he said. ""They learn how to restrain them using seatbelts -- basically fold the person over and strap them down."" Trainees also learn the rules of engagement, laws related to use of force on airplanes and how to look out for suspicious behavior, or behavioral profiling. ""We'd teach them to look for mannerisms: specific styles of dress, whether they're with a group or trying to peel off from a group, or if a uniformed officer approaches and they shy away -- things like that. We'd teach them what to look for,"" he said. Applicants with backgrounds in law enforcement and the military are given special preference, but the positions are open to anyone with a college degree or three years of professional experience who proves up to the job, Minerly said. ""Our training program is very comprehensive. We have people applying now with limited law enforcement experience and we provide them with the training to get them up to speed with what we expect of a federal air marshal,"" he said. ""Air Marshals are supposed to look like the rest of the traveling public so it only stands to reason we would want recruits from all walks of life."" In the eight years since the Federal Air Marshal Service has been ramping up, only a handful of incidents have been publicly reported, most involving drunk or unruly passengers. MacLean says he never had to make an arrest in five years flying missions as an air marshal. Yet his career ended in controversy, when he was fired for leaking information on cutbacks in the program. Did he ever secretly wish for some action to break up the tedium? ""No way,"" he said, laughing. ""Not when you're 35,000 feet up in the air flying at 500 mph in an aluminum tube with a few hundred people. You really don't want anything to happen.""","Federal air marshals spend a lot of time on commercial flights reading, staying inconspicuous .

"(CNN) -- As Republicans wrestle with how to oppose President Barack Obama, what to do about Obamacare and how to compare the value of fights based on principle versus fights based on clever calculation, there may be some lessons from one of the darkest periods of Republican history. Watergate was a slow-motion disaster for the Republican Party. Richard Nixon, who had just won one of the largest majorities in American history in 1972, was slowly being exposed and driven from power. At the same time, it was discovered that Vice President Spiro Agnew was illegally taking bribes. He was forced to resign. That resignation led to the first vice presidential appointment, that of the House Republican leader, Rep. Gerald Ford. Then Nixon resigned, leading to the second vice presidential appointment, former Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York. That appealed to liberals but enraged conservatives. President Ford then pardoned Nixon, leading to a further firestorm of outrage. The Republicans were badly defeated in the 1974 congressional elections. The election of President Jimmy Carter finished the defeat of the Republican Party. Republicans were shattered by their sudden collapse after the enormous 1972 victory. Republican leaders in Congress were shaken by the defeat of so many of their friends, many after two decades or more in office. In many ways, America was a one-party system by January 1977, and the Democrats seemed totally dominant. Opinion: The Republican implosion . The Democratic Party housed liberals and conservatives, agrarians and urban intellectuals, men, women, young, old, blacks, whites, all creeds, dominated all regions and ruled all debate in America. The Republican Party housed a small group of exhausted defeatists. By January 1977, only 11% of citizens younger than 30 identified with the Republican Party. The party had been on fumes for years, ever since the Great Depression and only challenged the Democrats for national authority when they screwed up, as in 1946 and 1968, or when Republicans nominated an overwhelmingly popular figure, such as Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1952. And with the election of Carter, a smart, moderate Democrat from the South, the prospect for Democratic rule for another generation seemed bright. The party of Andrew Jackson had smothering control of the House, a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate and in the South, there were states such as Mississippi that had almost no elected Republican officeholders. The only state in the country that had GOP control of the legislature and the governor's mansion was Kansas. The other 49 states had partial or complete Democratic control. The old ways of accommodating the establishment by the GOP of the 1930s, '40s, '50s and '60s would no longer work. Something else had to be tried. To conservatives such as Reagan, accommodation was tantamount to capitulation and they asked themselves, ""If we surrender on everything, what is the purpose of having a Republican Party?"" For several years, the U.S. government had been making plans to yield control and ownership of the Panama Canal to Omar Torrijos, the dictator of the Panama. All of the establishment was going along with it, from Lyndon Johnson to Nixon to Ford, Henry Kissinger and by 1977, Carter. Nearly all the editorialists supported the ""giveaway"" of the canal at the height of the Cold War. Control of the canal was vital to American military interests, especially with Soviet control of Cuba and designs on Central America. Opinion: Hilary Clinton, RNC and freedom of the press . Into this void stepped former California Gov. Ronald Reagan, who launched a national campaign to oppose the giveaway. He gave speeches, stumped across the country and testified before Congress. A ""New Right"" rose up and organized a ""Panama Canal Truth Squad"" led by Richard Viguerie, Phyllis Schlafly and Paul Weyrich, among others. Petitions were circulated at the grassroots and delivered to Capitol Hill. In speech after speech, Reagan thundered, ""We built it! We paid for it! It is ours! And we are going to keep it!"" Polling had shown American support for the two Panama Canal treaties, but by 1978, the American people had switched and agreed with Reagan and the conservatives -- and not Carter. In the end, the treaties to declare the canal a neutral zone and eventually surrender it to Panama passed by the barest of margins, only by one and two votes more than the two thirds required in the Senate. The war had been lost but the battle was worth it. Principles had been established and arguments made. It led to Republican victories in the off year elections of 1978 and launched Reagan's third campaign for the White House. Years later, Carter himself acknowledged the potency of the canal issue in the election of 1980, which not only saw the rise of Reagan, but the loss of scores more Democrats who had voted for the treaties. Reagan used to joke that without his principles, without his conservatism, he would have been just another former actor. He knew standing one's ground when one was right was enlightening and empowering. It is a lesson from history that applies today. Fighting for principles and losing is always better than surrendering and in so doing, abandoning one's reason for being. Reagan had called in February 1975 for ""bold colors, no pale pastels."" Opposing the Panama Canal Treaties turned out to be bold colors indeed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.","Craig Shirley, Newt Gingrich: Republicans were devastated by Watergate scandal .

"(CNN) -- Secretary of State John Kerry landed in Kabul, Afghanistan, Friday for talks with President Hamid Karzai. The United States hopes to make progress on a long-stalled security deal with Afghanistan that would leave some U.S. forces in the country beyond NATO's scheduled departure at the end of 2014. U.S. officials say they hope to conclude a deal on the Bilateral Security Agreement, or BSA, in the ""coming weeks"" and before Karzai meets with a council of tribal elders next month. Without a deal, the United States would keep no military forces in Afghanistan once the combat mission ends. In Iraq, all U.S. troops left at the end of 2011 after the two countries were unable to reach a similar agreement. The Afghan negotiations, which started last October, were supposed to be completed within a year. But issues related to Afghan sovereignty and American security guarantees for that country have made a deal elusive. Senior U.S. officials tell CNN the text of an agreement is about 95% complete, but two main issues remain unresolved. The sticking points involve Afghanistan's refusal to let U.S. forces conduct counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda operatives. Karzai wants the United States to hand over intelligence and allow Afghan troops to conduct those operations, something the United States has balked at. Karzai also is insisting on an American guarantee of Afghanistan's security, similar to agreements the United States would have with a NATO ally or a country with a mutual defense treaty. Such a pact might compel the United States to send troops into Pakistan if Afghanistan was attacked. A former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, Kerry has made multiple trips to Afghanistan in recent years. A state department official who briefed reporters on the way to Kabul said they hope Kerry and Karzai will make progress in the negotiations, but they don't expect to close a deal. ""They will of course be discussing where we are and seek to continue to make progress,"" the official said. ""Now negotiations were ongoing before we arrived and they will be ongoing after we depart from Kabul, so that was not the expectation in terms of a conclusion."" The Afghan leader, known for emotional rants against the United States and NATO forces, cast doubt this week on whether a deal could be reached. At a press conference, he issued a sharp rebuke to American and NATO forces in his country over a recent NATO airstrike in Nangarhar province that the Afghan government claimed killed five civilians. ""The United States and NATO have not respected our sovereignty,"" Karzai said. ""Whenever they find it suitable to them, they have acted against it. This has been a serious point of contention between us and that is why we are taking issue of the BSA strenuously in the negotiations right now."" Referring to U.S. insistence on handling counterterrorism operations, Karzai said, ""The United States and its allies, NATO, continue to demand even after signing the BSA they will have the freedom to attack our people, our villages. The Afghan people will never allow it."" In an interview with Associated Press last week, President Barack Obama warned he would keep troops in Afghanistan only if the United States got want it wanted in any agreement. Daniel Markey, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of the forthcoming book ""No Exit from Pakistan,"" says that while the remaining issues are few in number, their importance could hinder chances for a deal. ""These sticking points, even if the differences have been narrowed, are sticky enough that there is some serious question as to whether this will happen before President Karzai leaves office,"" Markey said. ""And the lack of an agreement will be harmful to the potential legacy of a stable and smooth transition,"" he added. ""There are so many other reasons to be worried about Afghanistan: the economy, the election and the lack of progress in dealing with reconciliation with the Taliban. This is one more thing that doesn't need to be added to the mix."" Washington is racing against two clocks -- one related to Afghanistan's election next April, and the other involving military planning. Karzai has suggested his successor should be the one to conclude negotiations with the United States. U.S. officials and analysts have voiced concern that Afghans would take to the polls amid uncertainty about the future relationship with the United States. ""It is easy to see that we become an issue in the campaign, and not in a way that serves the U.S. interests,"" Markey said. ""There could be a competition to show who is least willing to kowtow to the Americans. And then when they negotiate in that way, you never get a BSA. Then you have an Iraq situation, where we have to leave. But for Afghanistan, it's more dangerous. It's even more unstable and the regional consequences are of greater concern to India, Pakistan and even China."" Moreover, the lack of a deal would impact NATO's military planning. The United States wants to give its troops, and those of other countries, enough time to prepare for keeping troops in Afghanistan. Other NATO countries, including Germany, say they will be unable to remain in Afghanistan if the United States and Afghanistan do not reach a deal. A total withdrawal would also put at risk billions of dollars in international aid. ""As a practical matter it will be difficult for us and our NATO partners to deliver on pledges we have made regarding both security and economic programs,"" one senior administration official said.","The United States hopes to make progress on a long-stalled security deal with Afghanistan .

"London (CNN) -- In the week between her death and her funeral, Britons are having an awkward time coming to terms with the legacy of Margaret Thatcher, a prime minister who last held office 23 years ago -- meaning no one under 40 could have voted for her, yet the mix of anger and admiration is spread across the generations. The emotional outpouring in this famously undemonstrative nation is matched in recent memory only by the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, when flowers piled up outside royal palaces and Elton John's mawkish ""Candle in the Wind"" surged to the top of the charts. But while Diana was mourned in unity by millions as the ""people's princess,"" Thatcher's death is being marked in widely different and unpredictable ways. WATCH: Not everyone's mourning Thatcher's death . It has become an overused adjective in the media that Thatcher was ""divisive."" Some countries might put aside political differences and unite to respect the passing of a leader -- especially the first and only female PM, who won three successive general elections. But in the UK debate about Thatcher is raging almost as fiercely as it did in the 1980s over issues like the privatization of industries, the Falklands War, tax and social policy, her close relationship with American President Ronald Reagan and combative stance against the European Union. To many she was the woman who broke the mold, showing the way for others, and the leader who made ""Britain great again,"" according to PM David Cameron. Geri Halliwell, aka ""Ginger Spice"" from the 1990s girl band the Spice Girls, spoke for many when she tweeted this tribute: ""Thinking of our 1st Lady of girl power, Margaret Thatcher, a grocer's daughter who taught me anything is possible...x."" Halliwell later deleted the tweet in the face of online criticism, but went on to regret the move, describing herself as ""weak"" and cowardly. Despite a generation having grown up since she left power, Thatcher's supporters and critics remain passionate and loud -- including many too young to have known her reign directly. On the day her death was announced, impromptu parties popped up in cities across the land -- especially areas that saw unrest three decades ago such as Birmingham, Liverpool and Brixton, in south London, as well as former coal-mining communities devastated by long-term unemployment. The right-wing Daily Mail tabloid newspaper was again outraged, blaming three decades of ""vitriol and hatred from the left."" And as members of parliament gathered in parliament on Wednesday to honor her from the Conservative benches and recognize or revile her from the Labour side, bosses at the state-funded BBC were grappling with a new problem -- whether to air the song ""Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead"" from ""Wizard of Oz"" on its weekly chart show. The song reached Number 2 in the national charts after it was adopted by an anti-Thatcher group on Facebook and Twitter, prompting a backlash in newspapers that supported Thatcher, like the Mail, which denounced the architects of the protest as ""teachers of hatred"" and ""revolting."" In the end, only a 5-second clip of the song was played, a messy compromise that pleased neither side. Meanwhile, soccer clubs, some of which are owned by Thatcher supporters, said it would be appropriate to hold a minute's silence to honor her memory before kick-off at weekend games. But even Thatcher's former Sports Minister David Mellor went on the record to say this was a bad idea. The message between the lines was that basically, fans could not be trusted to show respect. The English Football Association later decided against it, and none were held at any major fixtures. ""A minute silence is to mark and remember football people. Great football people. Or moments of national tragedy where all unite, say 9/11 or Remembrance Sunday..."" explained David Conn, a football writer for The Guardian newspaper. ""It was above politics. They have never had a minute's silence for a political figure. By definition it is divisive."" If the former PM's death alone was not enough to reopen old wounds, her ""ceremonial funeral with military honors,"" planned for next week, certainly has. Like the services for the Queen Mother in 2001, Diana in 1997, and the state funeral for wartime leader Winston Churchill in 1965, the coffin will be transported from Westminster to St. Paul's Cathedral on a gun-carriage escorted by 700 military personnel, including those who fought in the Falklands conflict against Argentina's annexation of the remote Atlantic islands. The service is really a state funeral in all but name; although it is not dictated by parliament there will be plenty of pomp and for the first PM's funeral since Churchill's, Queen Elizabeth II will attend. The Guardian reported on Friday though that Thatcher herself wanted a more low-key funeral (""I'm not Winston,"" she reportedly said) but the current Conservative-led coalition government appears to have over-ridden her wishes. The Daily Mail is not so easily brushed aside though, and at the end of last week was urging its 1 million-plus readers to send off coupons for a full state funeral. In the current climate, police are braced for protests from troublemakers. Why then does Thatcher continue to cause such trouble after her death? In years to come, it may be significant that she died on the same day many of the coalition's austerity cuts started to bite. On April 8, major benefit curbs took effect while the top rate of income tax was cut from 50% to 45% for those earning more than Â£150,000 (230,000), and the coalition government is attracting much flak for its economic policies. The cost of the funeral has also caused a ruckus, with many calling for a more low-key remembrance. ""In a context where there is great ill feeling about her legacy,"" said the Bishop of Grantham, Thatcher's own birthplace, ""we have a situation where we seem to be expecting the nation to glorify that with a Â£10 million funeral is asking for trouble. People with extreme views will use it to promote their political views."" And if Cameron, Thatcher's successor as Conservative leader, had hoped that her death would boost his own fortunes, he'll be disappointed. This week it was revealed that support for the party had sunk to an all-time low. In contrast to his own low personal ratings, his predecessor's death may remind voters that Thatcher was in a league of her own when it came to political charisma. As The Economist pointed out this week, Churchill may have won World War II, ""but he never created an '-ism.'"" The end of the Thatcher-era also comes at a point when many politicians are debating to what extent the neo-liberal economic model espoused by Thatcher is to blame for the economic crisis of the last five years and what direction to take next. And while a scab on the wounds inflicted by Thatcherism communities by Thatcher grew during the years since her downfall in 1990, the death of the ""Iron Lady"" has brought them all back into the open. Those on the right are saying ""What the world needs now is more Thatcherism, not less,"" while those on the left decry ""her demeanor and every discernible action (that) seemed to be to the detriment of our national spirit and identity."" For the next few days, the front line of this battle appears to have been drawn in British pubs, around its dining tables and on the streets of its cities.","Mixed feelings towards the legacy of the ""Iron Lady"" in Britain .

"(CNN) -- For Muslims around the world, Eid al-Adha is a time of celebration, marked by visits from far-flung relatives, gift-giving and elaborate feasts. But this year, the joyous occasion Tuesday was marred by bomb blasts and deaths in violence-plagued Afghanistan and Iraq, and in civil war-wracked Syria. In southern Afghanistan, a member of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force died Tuesday after an attack by enemy forces, ISAF reported. ISAF did not identify the service member or the member's nationality. Later Tuesday, the United Kingdom's Defence Ministry said that enemy fire killed a British soldier who was on patrol Tuesday in southern Afghanistan's Helmand province, northeast of the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah. It wasn't immediately clear whether this was the death that ISAF reported. In the country's east, a bomb placed under a stage killed the governor of Logar province as he was delivering an Eid al-Adha speech inside a mosque Tuesday morning. In addition to Gov. Mohammad Arsala Jamal, the blast killed four others and injured 15 more, the head of the provincial council, Abdul Wakil, told reporters. Jamal, who also had Canadian citizenship, was an outspoken critic of insurgents in Afghanistan. Before he served in Logar, he had been governor of eastern Afghanistan's Khost province. In Iraq, at least 11 people were killed and 26 others wounded when a bomb exploded outside a mosque in central Kirkuk, Iraqi officials said. The bomb went off as worshippers were leaving the mosque, police said. And in Syria, where a bloody civil war continues to claim lives daily, three children were killed in an explosion that anti-government activists blamed on President Bashar al-Assad's regime. A revered observance . Eid al-Adha is considered one of Islam's most revered observances. It corresponds with the height of the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia that annually draws 2 million Muslims. It commemorates when God appeared to Abraham -- known as Ibrahim to Muslims -- in a dream and asked him to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience. As Abraham was about to perform the sacrifice, God stopped him and gave him a sheep to kill in place of his son. A version of the story also appears in the Torah and in the Bible's Old Testament. The four-day celebration is also known as the Feast of Sacrifice, or Greater Eid. It is the longer of two Eid holidays observed by Muslims. Eid al-Fitr, or Little Eid, follows the conclusion of the holy month of Ramadan. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq from Atlanta and journalist Qadir Sediqi from Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.","ISAF service member killed in southern Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- Much has been written about the Twitterfication of the Gaza war. But there's a much more significant war taking place right now on Twitter. It's a war about freedom of speech in our new reputation economy; it's a war about what we legally should and shouldn't be able to say on Twitter. The latest battle in this war is being fought over the Lord Alistair McAlpine case. You'll remember that it was McAlpine who was identified by Twitter users as being the senior Conservative politician whom the BBC Newsnight show said was a pedophile. The BBC, which had never revealed the alleged abuser's name, apologized nonetheless for McAlpine being wrongly implicated. The false rumor then spread on Twitter with, according to McAlpine's lawyers, more than 1,000 libelous tweets and 9,000 retweets maliciously destroying the innocent man's reputation. As a result, Lord McAlpine not only successfully sued the BBC for $185,000, but is also now considering suing prominent Twitter users such as Sally Bercow, the wife of the speaker of the House of Commons, who tweeted to her almost 60,000 followers: ""Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*."" What's significant about McAlpine's ""Twibel"" strategy is his focus on ""high-profile Tweeters"" with more than 500 followers like Bercow, comedian Alan Davies and Guardian journalist George Monbiot who tweeted to his 56,000 followers: ""I looked up Lord McAlpine on t'internet. It says the strangest things."" While McAlpine's lawyers are encouraging many less well-endowed Twitter users who spread the pedophile rumor to donate a small sum to a children's charity, their focus appears to be on going after big names like Davies who, with his more than 442,000 followers, gives him an audience almost nine times the size of the main Twitter account of The Times of London newspaper. Cyber-libertarians like Harvard University's Jonathan Zittrain argue that McAlpine's attack on Monbiot, Davies, Bercow and the other notable Tweeters is ""unwise and uncalled for"" because these individuals don't have the fact-checking resources of media companies. Perhaps. But what freedom-of-speech fundamentalists like Zittrain fail to recognize is that with all this new power should come new responsibility. And if one does, indeed, like Alan Davies, have nearly half a million Twitter followers, then one should indeed be as liable under the libel law as any other large media company. On Twitter's Terms of Service, it tells new users: ""What you say on Twitter may be viewed all around the world instantly. You are what you Tweet!"" But this is wrong. If you have no followers, then what you say on Twitter has, essentially, no significance. So, you aren't what you tweet. Instead, you are the size of your Twitter audience. Size matters. Thus, on Twitter, the reach of one's megaphone should come with commensurate accountability. Welcome to our 21st century reputation economy in which individual brands like George Monbiot or Alan Davies have as much power as 20th century newspapers or television networks. That's why McAlpine's legal strategy is so just. Sure, slap the small Twitter user, that digital peasant, with a symbolic fine for their thoughtless behavior. But the Tory Lord is right to aggressively go after the new media aristocrats, with their enormous audience, who so thoughtlessly sullied his reputation and whom he claims have broken the UK's libel laws. This should be a salutary lesson in our radical new media world. With media power comes media responsibility. And the larger one's audience, the more responsibility one has to get the facts straight. It's almost enough to encourage me to tweet: ""Why are Sally Bercow, George Monbiot and Alan Davies trending? *innocent face*."" But then, with my almost 21,000 Twitter followers, I might get sued myself. So I'll resist the temptation and, instead, maintain a dignified silence in this latest battle in the war about freedom of speech in our Twitter age. But it's a tricky balancing act. Early this year, Twitter announced a new policy giving the company the ability to ""reactively withhold content from users in a specific country -- while keeping it available in the rest of the world."" (Removing a tweet previously meant deleting it from the web entirely.) Critics said the move was a form of censorship, but Twitter promised tweets would be removed only upon request and only if they broke the law -- a system that Alexander Macgillivray, one of the policy's architects, defended as a way ""to keep more tweets up in more places."" The company refused to comply with all six government removal requests in the first half of 2012, but in October Twitter blocked access in Germany to the account of a neo-Nazi group that is banned by the German government, in addition to removing anti-Semitic tweets in France. ""Never want to withhold content; good to have tools to do it narrowly & transparently,"" Macgillivray tweeted. The microblogging service may still be figuring out the kinks of this new policy, but at a time when multinational corporations are caving left and right to countries like China, Macgillivray's principled defense of free speech is vital. ""No one wants a pen that's going to rat them out,"" he told the New York Times. ""We all want pens that can be used to write anything and that will stand up for who we are."" Macgillvray is right. Today's war about online freedom of speech is being fought both with and about the Twitter ""pen."" Let's hope that he Lord McAlpine case encourages powerful voices on Twitter to self-censor tweets that might libel others. But that doesn't mean I'm in favor of censoring Twitter. So, for example, let's also hope that Macgillivray and his team resists calls by the US Israel lobby to ban political groups like Hamas from Twitter. Yes, this is a balancing act. And the future of free expression in our digital age rests on getting it right. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Keen.","Latest battle in Twitter war is being fought over Lord Alistair McAlpine case, says Andrew Keen .

"London (CNN) -- On the streets of London, something strange is afoot. Gone are the blank stares, business suits and gray skies -- in their place: Warm smiles, bright outfits and even the odd glimpse of sunshine. Olympic fever has transformed the city. Nowhere is this feeling more pronounced than at the Olympic Park, scene of some of home side Team GB's biggest triumphs and source of the nation's new-look cheery mood. A few short years ago, this corner of east London was a post-industrial wasteland, blighted by pollution and contaminated ground and scarred by decades of neglect. Now it's a park, packed with wildflowers, public art and world-class sports facilities. And people. Lots of people. Walking to the site, thousands of face-painted, flag-waving, colorfully-dressed sports fans are met by an army of purple and red-clad volunteers dancing, joking and welcoming them. Inside, riverside walkways teeming with flowers, all the colors of the rainbow, lead visitors to the venues: the spiky Olympic Stadium, the sweeping Velodrome and the wave-like form of the Aquatics Center. Gritty East End is London's gold standard . Along the way, officially-sanctioned buskers and street entertainers are on hand to amuse the crowds, and music pumps from speakers -- though it can't drown out the cheers of fans inside the arenas. ""It's just great -- what they've done is fantastic: the venues are stunning and the landscaping looks great,"" said Olympics visitor Bethan Slater. Londoner Slater said she had been lucky enough to see the park during its construction phase: ""The transformation from all the mud and machinery back then is amazing,"" she told CNN. ""The atmosphere is lovely, really friendly and positive, and it feels so well run, everything is so convenient and easy, right down to the fact there weren't even any queues for the toilets."" It's all a far cry from the gloomy pre-Games predictions: Transport chaos, ticketing debacles, security shambles -- and fears of impending sporting disaster. U.S. Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney earned the ire of UK Prime Minister David Cameron and London's Mayor Boris Johnson when just days before the torch was lit, he sounded a note of caution, claiming problems in the run-up to the event had been ""disconcerting."" Lesson from history for Olympic missile row? But former IOC Director Michael Payne said such pre-Olympic jitters were only to be expected, and were common in host countries prior to the opening ceremony. ""In many nations, in the two weeks before the Games, there's a sense of paranoia, that it's not going to work, we're going to embarrass ourselves on the world stage, it'll be a disaster,"" he said. It's a view echoed by Slater: ""I had so many problems getting tickets -- it was farcical -- so I was a bit down on the whole thing beforehand, but once I was there, I absolutely loved it."" Payne said such concerns were quickly forgotten once the Games began: ""It's all paid off, and frankly has gone a lot smoother than they even dared hope."" One Scottish visitor to London said the Olympics were a welcome distraction from less positive national and international news. ""There's a lot of negativity going on just now in the UK and worldwide, with the recession, but this has been phenomenal -- it's brought everybody together,"" he said. And while Brits are always happy to cheer on the plucky underdogs -- wherever they are from -- it is clear that Team GB has benefited from a huge home advantage. Orbit Tower: Olympic Park's red 'roller coaster' Gold medal-winning rower Pete Reed credited the support of the positive crowds with helping him and his fellow competitors make it to the podium in larger than expected numbers. ""Winning in London, doing it in front of a home crowd, was extraordinary,"" he told CNN. ""I always thought it could be big, but I didn't imagine it would be this big -- we were lifted right up from the beginning."" Team GB's medal gold rush has certainly helped the host nation's mood, but so has the sense that the games have done Britain proud. For a few short weeks, the eyes of the world were on London and -- to everyone's surprise -- it went well. The hard graft paid off, and the country can, albeit temporarily, cast off its carapace of cynicism, sit back and simply enjoy the moment. So, will this unexpected good mood last once the torch has been extinguished and the last Olympian has packed their bags and moved out of the village? Will a renewed optimism be one of the legacies of London 2012, alongside the green spaces, the arenas and the thirst for sporting success? Slater is among those who hope the Games will have a lasting impact on the city and its people. ""The levels of happiness and optimism around at the moment may not last,"" she admits. ""But I hope it will neutralize some of the cynicism around, and help people see what is possible when everyone pulls together.""","Olympic fever has transformed London into a sea of cheery smiles and bright outfits .
