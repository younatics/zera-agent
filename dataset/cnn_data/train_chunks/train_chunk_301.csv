"(CNN) -- A Pakistani judicial commissioner has overturned the conviction of a doctor who is accused of helping the United States find Osama bin Laden, and has ordered a new trial, the official's office said Thursday. Dr. Shakil Afridi will remain in prison until the new trial is held, according to the office of Sahibzada Mohammad Anees, the Peshawar judicial commissioner who overturned the conviction. Afridi was sentenced in 2012 to 33 years in prison after a tribal court convicted him of, among other things, running a fake vaccination trial. Pakistani authorities accused Afridi of working with the CIA to set up a fake vaccination campaign in Abbottabad to try verify bin Laden's whereabouts. U.S. special forces killed the al Qaeda leader at an Abbottabad compound in May 2011. Afridi had appealed the conviction. Information on why Anees granted the appeal wasn't immediately available. Afridi's attorney, Samiullah Afridi, said Thursday he expects the retrial to begin within a month. The doctor's family has had no contact with him for nine months, the lawyer said. The vaccination effort, according to allegations in a report filed with a Pakistani appeals court, was meant to collect bin Laden's DNA so the CIA could compare it with samples of bin Laden family DNA it already had, but no one at his Abbottabad compound agreed to be vaccinated. The report alleged that Afridi admitted receiving $75,800 from handlers for the vaccination effort. In 2012, senior U.S. officials told CNN that Afridi worked with the United States prior to the bin Laden raid, but was never asked to spy on Pakistan and was asked only to help locate al Qaeda terrorists posing a threat to both Pakistan and the United States. After Afridi's conviction, then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then-U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called for his release. Clinton said Afridi ""was instrumental in taking down one of the world's most notorious murderers."" CNN's Reza Sayah, Elise Labott and Jason Hanna, and journalist Annabel Symington contributed to this report.","Dr. Shakil Afridi's conviction is overturned; he will be held while awaiting retrial .

"(CNN) -- Two years removed from his disastrous 2012 presidential bid, Rick Perry is fully recovered from back surgery, sporting new glasses, reengaging with the Republican conservative base, and showing signs that he's considering another run for the White House. Immigration policy helped sink the Texas governor's previous bid, but it has now put him back in the spotlight. He met on Wednesday with President Barack Obama, who's under fire over the surge of undocumented minors on the southern border. Obama accepted Perry's offer for a sit-down following a sharp exchange with the White House. Last week, White House spokesman Josh Earnest mocked his message on immigration, saying ""the truth is it's hard to take seriously Governor Perry's concerns."" Perry points to his state's long border with Mexico as ground zero for the crush of mostly children entering the United States illegally. ""My message to President Obama is to secure this border, Mr. President. Finally address this issue and secure this border,"" Perry said last week at a congressional hearing near the border in McAllen, Texas. But he may have disappointed fellow conservatives when he said that he was ""tired of pointing fingers and blaming people."" He added, ""I hope what we can do is come up with some solutions here."" Perry used more muscular language days later when he said, ""this is a failure of diplomacy. It is a failure of leadership from the administration in Washington, D.C."" Jeff Miller, a senior Perry political adviser, told CNN that Perry ""is not saying anything different than what he's being advocating since 2010 -- that 'we've got to secure this border. There's a crisis going on.'"" Obama wants $3.7 billion for immigration crisis . But Miller said the current crisis is giving Perry a larger platform. ""Right now, because of the huge influx of these children crossing the border from Mexico, the media's paying more attention and more of the public is seeing the crisis the governor has been dealing with for years. Not a lot has changed, but now more people are listening to what the governor's saying,"" Miller said. Immigration helped sink Perry in 2012 . While a real front-burner issue in his state, Perry is also seeing political stars align. Immigration was the issue that damaged him more than any other when he ran for president last time, people close to him say. Perry launched his presidential campaign in August 2011, months after former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and the rest of the field of candidates had jumped in. Perry entered with lots of buzz and armed with big bucks and big name backers, and he quickly soared in national polls. But good times were fleeting, as Perry soon ran headfirst into Romney on illegal immigration. In a debate a month later, Perry defended his support for government-funded tuition at state schools for undocumented immigrants. He argued that if you didn't support such a move, ""I don't think you have a heart."" But some of his Republican rivals considered that soft. ""Governor Perry, you say you have got the experience. It's a bit like saying that, you know, the college coach that has lost 40 games in a row has the experience to go to the NFL,"" said Romney at another debate. Rick Perry's busy summer . ""The truth is, California -- I'll say it again, California and Florida have both had no increase in illegal immigration and yours is up 60 percent."" Romney added. Sources close to Perry tell CNN they believe that moment did more to hurt Perry with GOP primary voters than any other. Still, Perry suffered a more memorable blow with an epic gaffe in a November 2011 debate, when he forgot the third of three federal government departments that he had said he would eliminate. Perry's campaign limped on, but he called it quits after a disappointing fourth in the Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary. Political resurrection? Fast forward two years. Perry decides not to run for re-election and is again making his pitch to conservative voters. ""I have a simple suggestion -- It is time for a little rebellion on the battlefield of ideas,"" Perry told the base at this year's Conservative Political Action Conference. And Perry's summer travel plans hint toward a 2016 bid. He recently made his third trip over the past year to South Carolina -- the state the holds the first southern primary. The visit to the Palmetto State precedes upcoming stops this summer in Iowa and New Hampshire. Perry even hosted a group of more than a dozen key New Hampshire Republicans at the Governor's Mansion in Austin a few weeks ago to wine and dine them, CNN is told. When he goes to the Granite State next month, it will be his first trip there since 2012, when he failed to make much of an impression at all on voters there. A veteran New Hampshire Republican ally setting up New Hampshire meetings tells CNN they are consciously doing things differently this time. They're opting for a manner more conducive to the way New Hampshire voters like to be approached, in a series of small, intimate meetings. But the tactical shortcomings from 2012 is not the only thing he's trying to improve ahead of another possible candidacy -- it's also his readiness on a policy level. Perry urges Congress, Obama to work together on border security . Perry sources admit that he simply wasn't up to speed on many of the key issues that confront a candidate, never mind a president. To overcome that, he now has multiple policy briefings a week, every week on issues ranging from economic policy, to education, to the environment to national security. One source tells CNN that if he is traveling and there is a think tank nearby, he will make a point of stopping for a briefing from experts. Perry has also been trying to do more international travel, attending the highbrow annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, going to Israel, and planning a trip later this year to China. But it's firestorm over immigration that may give Perry his biggest opportunity for political resurrection. Miller downplayed any impact from the current immigration crisis on a potential 2016 bid, saying ""to me these are two completely separate issues."" But GOP analyst Ana Navarro, a CNN contributor who's close to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, another possible 2016 GOP presidential contender, said ""Perry embodies an interesting dynamic regarding immigration. ""He's a border enforcement guy with the experience of being a border state governor, but he's also shown compassion towards the human angle of the immigration debate,"" she said. Navarro added that ""If he can somehow walk that tight rope, and be eloquent as to how he defends his position, it can show him as a pragmatist and be helpful.""

"London (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama's plan to expand the military campaign against ISIS terrorists into Syria, and to boost American backing for rebels fighting Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, represents a grave escalation that risks dragging the U.S. and its allies into an open-ended regional war. In his televized speech to the nation on Wednesday evening, Obama argued his proposed strategy of extended air strikes and use of local ground forces (but not American combat troops) against the extremists also known as ISIL and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria was fundamentally different from past White House policies that led the U.S. to fight two Middle East ground wars in as many decades. But Obama, as he has shown repeatedly since 2008, is a reluctant warrior with no particular expertise in armed conflict. No doubt John F. Kennedy felt that he, too, understood the risks when he started sending American advisors to Saigon in the early 1960s. Like JFK, he may be starting a fight he cannot finish, which will run on and on for untold years. Obama, who came to office wearing the mantle of a man of peace and agent of change, has ultimately proved little different in this respect from predecessors such as Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. His tone on television was nationalistic and bombastic. American primacy, he said, was ""the one constant in an uncertain world."" He continued: ""Our endless blessings bestow an enduring burden. But as Americans, we welcome our responsibility to lead."" In Obama's case this sounds slightly disingenuous. Facing a rising, ignorant right-wing clamor about his alleged weakness and indecision in world affairs, the Obama of the ""Yes We Can"" era has slowly and unwillingly been transformed into Barack the Bomber. In 2008 Obama promised an end to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a new deal with the Muslim world, a reset in relations with Russia, and real-time nuclear disarmament. Six years later, his plans mostly lie in ruins, shot down like an unsuspecting aircraft over eastern Ukraine, and he is in danger of going backwards. ""I've spent four-and-a-half years working to end wars, not to start them,"" Obama said last year, explaining his decision not to punish al-Assad for his chemical weapons attacks. Now, in apparent response to his Republican critics, to public outrage over the beheadings of two American journalists, and with one eye on November's mid-term Congressional elections, Obama is stoking a generational conflict. It has the potential to further inflame Syria's civil war, draw in neighboring countries such as Turkey and Iran and allies such as Britain and France, and provoke the very ISIS threat to the U.S. mainland and Europe that Obama admits does not currently exist. Obama's strategy, as set out Wednesday, is full of holes. Attacking ISIS strongholds inside Syria will be portrayed by the Assad regime as vindication of its long-standing claim that the real fight there is against jihadists and terrorists, not a legitimate civilian opposition. Obama is gambling on the notoriously fractious Free Syria Army becoming a much more effective force than it has to date, and on Congress's willingness to underwrite it with up to $500 million in additional funds. Al-Assad, on the other hand, may choose to oppose U.S. intervention -- and he has the aircraft and the air defense systems to do so. What will Obama do if and when an American airman is shot down and captured by the Syrian army? France has already expressed reservations about getting involved in combat in Syria, as distinct from Iraq. There are also familiar questions about the legality of any such action, which will likely be raised by Russia, al-Assad's ally, or others at the United Nations. Ground wars, if they are won at all, are invariably won on the ground, not in the air. Recent proof of that contention may be found in Afghanistan (2001 onwards) Iraq (2003) and Libya (2011). But Obama's forces will comprise, initially at least, an untested, rag-tag combination of Iraqi army troops (who were sent fleeing by ISIS during its spring offensive around Mosul), Kurdish peshmerga, Syrian rebels, Shia militias and, possibly, moderate Sunni tribal groups. The fact that Obama has sent 1,100 American servicemen and women back to Iraq to facilitate the airstrikes and help train local forces, and will now send an additional 475, is not reassuring. They will likely be too few to make a definitive difference. So, as Vietnam showed, the call for more and larger reinforcements may not be long in coming. Obama is relying heavily on the new multi-ethnic government in Baghdad to unite the fractured country behind the effort against ISIS. He sent John Kerry there this week to stiffen its resolve. Leaders such as David Cameron, Britain's prime minister, have made their involvement in air strikes contingent on a coherent and effective approach from Baghdad. But Iraq's new prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, a Shia like his predecessor, Nouri al-Maliki, is not a miracle worker. The country is deeply divided along party, religious and geographic lines. The Kurdish regional government in Irbil, the current good guys in the eyes of the West, has used the ISIS crisis to cement its claim to de facto independence (while seizing additional territory around Kirkuk). Although a new national government has been agreed, the Kurds' secessionist agenda is fundamentally at odds with Baghdad's objectives. The Sunnis remain rightly suspicious of what power-sharing promises may mean in practice. There is no convincing sign as yet that they will launch a mooted Sunni Awakening II, taking on ISIS in the way they took on al Qaeda in 2007 under the tutelage of General David Petraeus. The Sunni fear is that once the dust settles they will be sidelined by the Shia majority once again. Another key part of Obama's strategy -- regional coalition-building -- is unimpressive to date. President George Bush Sr. showed how strong alliances can be built, in the run up to the first Gulf war in 1991, when he brought in Arab armies alongside U.S. and European troops. In contrast, the anti-ISIS ""core coalition"" announced by Obama last week at the NATO summit in Wales contained not a single Arab country and only one neighbor, Turkey. Iran, which has tacitly supported U.S. strikes against ISIS in Iraq, may take a different view of attacks in the territory of its ally, al-Assad -- and set to work to counter them. If it does, this in turn could adversely affect delicate nuclear negotiations between Tehran and the West that reach a climax in November. More recruits to Obama's forces army are promised when the U.N. General Assembly meets later this month. Without overt and practical backing from Saudi Arabia, other Gulf states, and for example, Jordan and Turkey, Obama's bombing campaign to deny ISIS safe haven may begin to look, to Muslims everywhere, like another deeply objectionable intervention by the western powers in the Middle East. Could Obama achieve the impossible and actually create sympathy for ISIS? Given his shaky strategy and his performance to date, nothing can be ruled out.

"(CNN) -- A graphic video played at a hearing Monday to determine whether two California police officers should stand trial in the beating death of a homeless man showed them kicking and punching the mentally ill man as he lay on the ground -- screaming in pain and begging for help. The victim, Kelly Thomas, died five days after the beating on July 5. Manuel Ramos, a 10-year veteran of the Fullerton, California, police department, is charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, while Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli faces charges of involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force in the same case. Both have pleaded not guilty. The black-and-white video was played during a preliminary hearing for the two officers. It begins with Thomas -- a 37-year-old homeless man with schizophrenia -- sitting and being told by Ramos to put his feet out and hands on his knees. The officers were responding to a call about a homeless man looking into car windows and pulling on handles of parked cars. In the video, Thomas is slow to cooperate. Ramos then tells him: ""You see my fists? They're getting ready to f--- you up."" Thomas, who is unarmed and shirtless, stands and another officer walks over. They hit him with their batons and hold him on the ground as he begs for help. ""Ok, I'm sorry, dude. I'm sorry!"" he screams. At one point, Thomas says he can't breathe. The officers tell him to lie on his stomach, put his hands behind his back and relax. ""Ok, here, here, dude, please!"" he says. Other officers arrive. At times, trees block the view of the camera and it's not always clear who is doing what as officers pile on top of Thomas. One uses a Taser stun gun. Thomas cries out for help and. toward the end of the beating, for his father: ""Dad! Help me. Help me. Help me, dad."" His voice gets softer and trails off. By the end of the video, he is lying in a pool of blood as the officers wonder out loud what to do next. One can be heard saying: ""We ran out of options so I got to the end of my Taser and I ... smashed his face to hell."" Thomas suffered brain injuries, facial fractures, rib fractures, and extensive bruising and abrasions, according to prosecutors. The Orange County coroner listed his manner of death as a homicide and said he died after having his chest compressed, leaving him unable to breathe. The FBI is investigating possible civil rights violations in his case. Six Fullerton officers, including Ramos and Cicinelli, were put on paid leave after his death. The case drew widespread attention to the police department of Fullerton, located about 25 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.","Kelly Thomas, the 37-year old homeless man, died days after his arrest .

"(CNN) -- The state senator who wrote Arizona's controversial immigration law conceded defeat Tuesday night in a recall election widely seen as a referendum on tough measures against illegal immigrants. ""I want to thank those people who have stood by me,"" said Russell Pearce, who represented a suburban Phoenix district. ""It doesn't look like the numbers are going my direction ... and I'm OK with that."" The recall petition pitted him against fellow Republican Jerry Lewis, who led with 53.4% of the vote with all precincts reporting. Pearce got 45.3%, election officials said. ""If being recalled is the price for keeping my promises, then so be it,"" Pearce said surrounded by supporters. The heated campaign has included accusations of dirty tricks, with Lewis supporters saying a third candidate who later dropped out but remains on the ballot -- Olivia Cortes -- was intended to siphon votes from him. Pearce, a former Phoenix-area sheriff's deputy known for his tough stance against illegal immigration, sponsored the state immigration law that became the focus of national media and legal attention. ""With Sen. Russell Pearce's defeat in this recall election, everyone who practices the politics of fear and division was put on notice,"" said Rep. Raul Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona. ""It's not a substantive platform, and his own constituents clearly said they demand more from their elected officials. It's a game-changer for the state of Arizona that's going to have serious, and I think very positive, ripple effects all across this country."" Passed in 2010, the Arizona law aimed to ""discourage and deter the unlawful entry and presence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlawfully present in the United States."" Among other provisions, it would require that local police, during the enforcement of other laws, check the immigration status of anyone they suspected of being undocumented. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit said the measure overstepped Arizona's authority, and the state is seeking a U.S. Supreme Court ruling to settle the issue. Pearce contends dozens of other states are trying to pass similar legislation, showing the popular support and need for such measures. Lewis, who says the controversial law has made Arizona a national pariah, said he ran out of dissatisfaction with how Pearce has represented the 18th District. Lewis has called for what he characterizes as a more cooperative stance against illegal immigration, one that seeks solutions in concert with the federal government and other players. The recall petition drive against Pearce collected more than 10,000 signatures. CNN's Tom Cohen and Thelma Gutierrez contributed to this report.","A petition drive forced the recall election for Russell Pearce .

"(CNN) -- On a small tennis court in the Netherlands, love took center-stage. It had all the ingredients of a romantic fairytale -- the nervous suitor down on one knee in front of a crowd of strangers, hoping that months of planning would win the heart of the girl of his dreams. ""I didn't cry once when I practiced it in front of the mirror, it was the nerves that kicked in when I went on the court,"" Martin Emmrich, a doubles specialist seeking to find his life partner, told CNN's Open Court show. ""I was very afraid that I wouldn't find any words."" The German had met his love at the same tournament 12 months earlier -- but apart from that, the venue didn't hold great memories for her. ""She fainted once on that court, had a knee injury on that court,"" Emmrich explains. Fast forward to June 2014, and Michaella Krajicek had just won her opening match of the Topshelf Open, which hosts both men's and women's competitions, when Emmrich made his big move. To her surprise, Emmrich came onto the grass with a microphone in hand. ""I thought, 'Uh-oh it's going to happen now, I can't believe it!' "" recalls the Dutchwoman, younger sister of former Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek. ""I was standing there sweaty and wrapped in a tournament towel ... It was really romantic."" Five months of scheming, having involved the tournament's director three days beforehand, finally paid off as Krajicek said ""Yes."" ""I saw some players with tears in their eyes,"" Emmrich says. ""Everybody came up and said I have big balls. It's a big step, and doing it on such a stage..."" A wedding had been on their minds for a long time -- three months into the relationship, they were already talking about taking home the biggest trophy of their lives. By January of this year, Emmrich was already planning how he would propose to his partner. ""I wrote down three papers, corrected them all, practiced 30-40 times in the bathroom,"" he says. In a moment that Emmrich can only describe as ""magic,"" Krajicek took his hand, hugged him and said yes -- to the cheers of joy ringing down from the stands. Krajicek says she had ""no idea"" how Emmrich and his few accomplices managed to surprise her. They are partners both on and off the court, playing in mixed doubles competitions together. ""I go on court, I still love him obviously, but it's business for me,"" says Krajicek. For Emmrich, who has won three men's doubles titles with a highest world ranking of 35th last year, the chance to play with her adds another dimension to touring life. ""I totally enjoy it. I feel I am playing more free and easy than actual doubles,"" says the 29-year-old. Although their engagement was broadcast the world over, they are in no rush to get married, with their busy tennis schedules taking priority. Immediately after the tournament in Rosmalen they headed to Wimbledon, losing in the second round to a pairing that went on to win the title. ""There's not too many weeks where we are both actually off,"" says Krajicek. The 25-year-old, who has won three singles titles on the WTA Tour and six in doubles, says she has plenty to achieve on-court before starting to think about having a family. A former junior world No. 1 -- she won the U.S. Open girls' title in 2004 -- Krajicek is now ranked outside the top 200 after struggling with health problems in 2012-13, but was as high as 30th at the end of her teenage years. She has recently had more success in doubles, reaching three WTA finals this year -- including Rosmalen. ""For now we just enjoy life and each other, and then everything else comes automatically,"" Emmrich says. Krajicek adds: ""We understand that it's part of it and in five years we will enjoy each other for the rest of our lives, so it's just the way it has to be.""","Martin Emmrich proposed to his girlfriend on court at Dutch tournament .

"Columbia, South Carolina (CNN) -- It's September of 2014, but Bakari Sellers is already getting calls and visits from the small crop of Democrats considering a 2016 presidential bid. Few voters outside South Carolina have heard of him. But he's a young star in the state's Democratic party, and as a key political figure in a pivotal early primary state, Sellers could play an outsized role in electing the next President. When Barack Obama won South Carolina's 2008 presidential primary in blowout fashion, boosting his campaign after a devastating blow in New Hampshire, Sellers, then a 23-year old first-term state legislator, was in the crowd at his victory party, beaming. Sellers co-chaired Obama's campaign in the early primary state, helping the then-senator go from long-shot to history-maker after vanquishing Hillary Clinton in the heavily African-American state. For Obama, having the Sellers name on his campaign steering committee didn't hurt: Bakari's father, Cleveland Sellers, is a civil rights icon in the state, jailed in the aftermath of the 1968 ""Orangeburg Massacre"" in which three black students were killed by police. Today, at the advanced age of 29, Sellers is serving his fourth term in the state house â€” and he's being courted by the small crop of Democrats considering a 2016 presidential bid, including Vice President Joe Biden and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. Hillary Clinton has yet to come calling, but the Ready For Hillary super PAC, eager to co-opt some of Obama's 2008 magic in South Carolina, recently invited Sellers to headline a fundraiser for the group. Related:In South Carolina, Clinton's forces try to tap Obama magic . But before the presidential campaign kicks off, Sellers has his own race to run. He's on the ballot for lieutenant governor this fall, running against Henry McMaster, 67, a former Attorney General and South Carolina GOP chairman. If he wins, Sellers would be the first African-American elected statewide since Reconstruction. But that's a long-shot proposition for a Democrat in this GOP-leaning state â€” and that historic honor will likely go to Sen. Tim Scott, an African-American Republican who is seeking a first full-term this November and is running against token Democratic opposition. Sellers can be unusually blunt when lamenting the lack of support that down-ballot southern Democrats receive from the national party and donors. But he's still in frequent touch with Democratic players in Washington â€” and will be in the 2016 conversation as a key endorser once the presidential primary season is underway.

"(CNN) -- The question may have been lost in translation, but a visibly angry Secretary of State Hillary Clinton bluntly told a town-hall meeting in the Democratic Republic of Congo on Monday, ""I will you tell you my opinion, I'm not going to channel my husband."" Hillary Clinton became visibly angry after a translator asked what Bill Clinton would think regarding an issue. The unscripted moment happened as Clinton spoke to students at a Congolese university in Kinshasa, the Congo capital. A male student rose to ask a question about Chinese financial contracts with Congo. The student asked Clinton what President Obama would think of the deal, but pool reporters in the room said the translator made a mistake, posing the question as what would Bill Clinton think. Clinton looked surprised when she first heard the translation in the headset, and then sharply replied, ""You want me to tell you what my husband thinks? My husband is not the secretary of state, I am. You ask my opinion. I will tell you my opinion; I'm not going to channel my husband.""  Watch Clinton react to question » . At the State Department, Assistant Secretary P.J. Crowley said the question she heard ""struck a nerve,"" that her opinion on the matter was apparently of less interest than that of her husband, the former president. Crowley told CNN that Clinton's answer must be considered in the context of her African trip. ""The secretary of state is going to Goma Tuesday, to draw attention to the plight of women who are victims of rape as a weapon of war"" in Congo, Crowley said. ""She did react to what she heard,"" Crowley explained, but regardless that the interpreter may have gotten it wrong, ""you can't separate the question from the setting."" He said ""If Africa, if Congo is going to advance, women have to play a more significant role. She was in the setting of a town hall, and the questioner was interested in what two men thought, not the secretary of state."" Crowley, who has just returned to Washington after traveling with Clinton during the first part of her trip to Africa, said the State Department has not yet reviewed recordings of the original question, in French, to learn whether the student clearly intended the question to refer to Obama, not former President Clinton. ""She did talk with the student afterward, and they seemed to have reached an understanding,"" Crowley said.","Question at town-hall meeting may have been an error of translation .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- The prosecution and defense have made their cases, and now Judge Thokozile Masipa must decide: Did Oscar Pistorius intentionally kill his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp? Was it murder? She will begin reading her decision Thursday. The judge has to answer several questions to reach her verdict on the murder charge, one of four charges Pistorius faces. First -- and most important -- did Pistorius know Steenkamp was behind the door in his bathroom when he fired four shots through it on Valentine's Day last year, killing her? If the answer is yes, beyond a reasonable doubt, Pistorius knew he was shooting at his girlfriend, then the judge will find him guilty of murder. Later, she'll have to decide whether it was premeditated. If she thinks it was, he could be sentenced to life in prison. In South Africa that means he'll have to serve at least 25 years. If she thinks the murder wasn't premeditated, Pistorius could get a minimum of 15 years behind bars. But if Masipa is not convinced that Pistorius knew Steenkamp was behind the door -- if there is any reasonable doubt of that -- he will not be convicted of murder. Pistorius argues he made a mistake -- that he thought was trying to defend himself from an intruder. If Masipa accepts that as plausible, she will then have to decide if his mistake and his actions were reasonable. If she says they were not, she'll find him guilty of a crime called culpable homicide. There is no minimum sentence for culpable homicide in South African law -- Masipa will decide the punishment herself, taking South African precedent into account. And there's one final possibility. If the judge does not think the prosecution has proved its case -- if she believes there is a reasonable chance Pistorius made a reasonable mistake and responded reasonably -- she will find him not guilty, and Oscar Pistorius could be a free man. Masipa will make her decision with the assistance of two experts known as assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials. Lesser charges . Pistorius faces three other weapons charges in addition to the murder accusation. Two charges are related to allegations that he recklessly fired a gun in public -- once in a restaurant in 2012, and once out of the sunroof of a car in 2013. Pistorius denies both. The maximum penalty for each charge is five years behind bars. If he is convicted of either, he could face a lesser sentence, such as a fine or the loss of his gun license. The final charge is that Pistorius was found to have ammunition without a proper license when police searched his home after he killed Steenkamp. Pistorius says he was storing the ammunition in his safe for his father. The charge is potentially a very serious one.

"(CNN) -- A federal judge spent the night in an Atlanta jail after being charged with misdemeanor battery in an alleged domestic violence incident involving his wife. U.S. District Judge Mark Fuller, 55, of Montgomery, Alabama, was charged with battery physical harm-family violence after Atlanta police responded to the downtown Ritz-Carlton hotel shortly before 11 p.m. Saturday. ""Officers spoke to the victim, who stated she was assaulted by her husband, Mark Fuller,"" an Atlanta Police Department release says. ""Officers observed injuries to the victim. She was treated on scene by (paramedics) but refused to be transported to the hospital. Mr. Fuller was not injured."" The judge arrived at the jail about 2:30 a.m. Sunday. Fuller appeared before Chief Magistrate Judge Stephanie Davis via video conference from the Fulton County Jail on Monday morning, said Fulton County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Tracy Flanagan. Fuller's next court date is August 22 for a probable cause hearing, Flanagan said. There was no plea entered Monday because it was a bond hearing, public defender Melissa Nelson told CNN. Nelson didn't expect to obtain more information on the case, she said, because Fuller is hiring a private attorney, whose name wasn't immediately available. Davis granted Fuller a $5,000 signature bond and he walked out of the jail before noon, Flanagan said. Fuller was confirmed to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama in 2002.","NEW: Fuller enters no plea at his Monday bond hearing .

"(CNN) -- Nothing less than the NFL's reputation is on the line, and possibly the job of the league's commissioner, Roger Goodell. A bombshell video shows Ray Rice knocking out his now-wife on a casino elevator. Another shows him dragging her off. What we don't know for certain is what the NFL knew about the incident and when the league knew it. There are conflicting stories. Critics want answers. Some want Goodell's head. The NFL announced late Wednesday that former FBI Director Robert Mueller will lead an independent inquiry into the league's investigation and how it gathered evidence in the case. Mueller will have access to all NFL records, according to league spokesman Greg Aiello. Two NFL owners who are attorneys -- John Mara of the New York Giants and Art Rooney II of the Pittsburgh Steelers -- will oversee the independent investigation. Mueller was director of the FBI from 2001 to 2013. Appointment not enough . If the league was looking to stem the tide of criticism, it didn't work. The National Organization for Women called Mueller's appointment ""just window dressing,"" saying it doesn't go far enough. ""NOW continues to ask for Roger Goodell to resign, and for his successor to appoint an independent investigator with full authority to gather factual data about domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking within the entire NFL community -- not just regarding the Ray Rice incident -- and to recommend real and lasting reforms,"" said Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women. Rice, who was released Monday by the Baltimore Ravens, and his then-fiancee, Janay Palmer, got into an altercation on an elevator in the casino in Atlantic City on February 15. Rice knocked her out with a punch to the head then dragged her -- face down -- out of the elevator. TMZ Sports obtained two videos from the footage taken from surveillance cameras that night. It posted the first one, which showed Rice dragging his then-fiancee out of the elevator, in February. The in-elevator video showing the violent punch was put online Monday. Goodell told CBS that what he saw on the second video was ""inconsistent"" with what Rice told him when he and his wife met with the commissioner in June to explain what happened. Several other people attended the meeting, including representatives from the players' union, executives from the Ravens and lawyers for the NFL. But on Thursday, ESPN reported that four sources -- none of whom were named -- said that Rice told Goodell he had punched Palmer. A fifth source said Rice described the hit as a slap. ESPN reported the five sources had knowledge of the meeting. One said: ""He told the truth. This is a public lynching of Ray."" A friend of Rice told CNN's ""OutFront With Erin Burnett"" that Rice hasn't hidden from the ugly truth. ""He told everyone that asked, that was in a position of authority -- from the NFL to his bosses with the Ravens -- what he did,"" said Craig Carton, who is a radio co-host with former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason. ""He took ownership of the despicable act and has tried to make it right."" Goodell: NFL couldn't legally get Ray Rice videos . Ravens owner looks back . It was that second video that changed Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti's perception of the incident. Bisciotti, who told CNN affiliate WBAL that he never spoke with Rice, said he didn't realize the blow that knocked Janay Rice out was so forceful. ""The way it was described to us was that he had hit her with an open hand and that she had hit her head (as she fell),"" Bisciotti told WBAL. He told the station that the way he pictured it in his mind Janay Rice was ""wailing"" on her then-fiance when he slapped her and she was close to the wall and hit her head, knocking her out. ""So why did I conclude all of that? Because I wanted to, because I loved him, because he had a stellar record,"" Bisciotti said. He added his thinking was also shaped by the fact that police only arrested the couple for misdemeanors. Ray Rice's charge was later changed to a felony, and Janay's charge was dropped. NFL and the video . The NFL on Wednesday said it is looking into an Associated Press report that a league executive in April received from a law enforcement official a copy of the video in which Ray Rice punched his now-wife in the face. The law enforcement official had a short voice mail from April 9 in which someone calling from a number at an NFL office thanks the official, the AP reported. The caller says of the video, ""You're right. It's terrible,"" according to the AP. The league has denied that anyone in its office had seen the video before Monday, when it was posted online. The AP story said the law enforcement official requested anonymity because of an ongoing investigation and didn't name the NFL executive because that would make it easy to identify the AP's source. The source told AP he sent the video on a DVD to an NFL office. ""The person said he was unauthorized to release the video but shared it unsolicited, because he wanted the NFL to have it before deciding on Rice's punishment,"" the AP wrote. 'This is a huge problem' NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told CBS in an interview aired Wednesday that the league asked for the video on several occasions, but was denied access. ""I understand that there may be legal restrictions on them sharing that with us,"" he said. CNN's Rachel Nichols said the AP report, if true, is extremely damaging to the NFL's and Goodell's reputation. ""This is a huge problem, and not just for the public,"" she said. ""Roger Goodell is either flat-out lying about having seen the video, or he is admitting to gross, gross negligence that this was in his office and he didn't see the video."" In a memo to NFL owners, the commissioner reiterated that position, saying the NFL asked for the videos in February and in May. New Jersey law prohibits their release while a police investigation is under way, Goodell wrote in the memo. The league didn't ask a casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for the video, Goodell said. Opinion: NFL and abuse -- it's not just Ray Rice . 'It was sickening' Rice was suspended indefinitely by the league and is in a pretrial intervention program in the New Jersey legal system that will allow him to avoid jail time. Initially he had been suspended for two games of the 16-game season, a decision by Goodell that was widely criticized. Many commentators have argued the first video TMZ Sports posted was evidence enough for a harsher penalty. But there was a complaint summons that NFL investigators should have had access to as well. The Baltimore Sun posted part of the document back in February. The complaint says Rice was charged with assault by attempting to cause bodily harm, ""specifically by striking her with his hand, rendering her unconscious."" Goodell told CBS that he was sickened by what he saw on the newly released video and that it was the first time he had seen the full scope of the February incident. He also deflected criticism of his handling of Rice's case and his initial lenient penalty for the domestic violence incident. ""What we saw in the first videotape was troubling to us in and of itself,"" Goodell said, referring to another video that surfaced in February after the incident, showing Rice dragging his then-fiancee out of the elevator. ""But what we saw yesterday was extremely clear. It was extremely graphic and it was sickening."" A timeline of key events .

"(CNN) -- Chris Pezzano, a soft-spoken man from Huntsville, Alabama, is passionate about horror. ""I've been into the horror world since I was a kid,"" he said, dressed in full zombie regalia at Walker Stalker Con this past weekend in Atlanta, Georgia. Zombies have never been bigger, evidenced -- or perhaps caused in part -- by the top-rated TV series, ""The Walking Dead."" Thousands of rabid zombie fans like Pezzano swarmed the Walker Stalker Con, hoping to meet ""Walking Dead"" cast members such as Norman Reedus, Steven Yeun and Danai Gurira, and executive producer/special effects makeup designer Greg Nicotero. ""I'm 44 years old, I probably look like I'm 440 years old now,"" said Pezzano who sometimes goes by the name ""Pezzombie."" It's extremely rare for a horror series to gain an audience of this size. The only thing that comes close is ""The X-Files"" at its height. So why exactly has ""The Walking Dead"" infected the country like a zombie plague? ""I think one of the main things very intriguing about the show is it allows you to vent some of your fears and frustrations and gives you an hour of being able to deal with the zombies in your own life,"" said Nashville resident Eric Nordhoff, co-founder of Walker Stalker Con. Nordhoff and his neighbor James Frazier traveled to Senoia to watch the filming of the show. That led to a podcast which eventually led to a full-fledged fan convention. What separates ""The Walking Dead"" from similar shows is that it is character- based, Nordhoff said. ""You're investing in these characters and these people. There's always the threat that someone could die at any moment."" Bite into the new season . Roberto Reyes who traveled to the convention from San Luis Potosi, Mexico. ""Every episode brings new surprises,"" he said. ""You're living the experience with them."" But would some like to go as far as to actually live it? ""I think in the back of some people's minds, they want the zombie apocalypse to happen, with just the thrill of it all,"" said Monique Franceschi of Cleveland. ""They think that's what really happened, that Daryl Dixon (Reedus) will really show up on their doorstep, or Andrew Lincoln."" Then who better to settle this than the series' star, Lincoln himself? ""I think it just seems to have captured people's imaginations,"" he told CNN. ""I've fallen in love with this ragtag group of misfits and I think that's possibly what's happening. People are rooting for the characters that they love every single weekend. It's a real thing for them. They're living through this hell with Rick and the survivors."" Lincoln made a point to attend Walker Stalker Con, to thank the fans in a rare convention appearance. ""The whole point of this is you get a dialogue with the fans. I feel more and more this isn't our show, it's the fans' show."" Fans such as Brandi Benton, a writer from Minneapolis, have certainly made it their own. ""The basis of the show is: 'Who are you gonna be?' "" she said. ""When your world falls apart -- whether it's a zombie apocalypse or life in general -- who are you going to choose to be? Are you going to be a good person and try to do the right thing? Are you going to let your circumstances determine who you're going to be?"" ""The Walking Dead"" will pose more intriguing questions this season, Lincoln said. ""Can we ever come back from the things we've done and seen?"" he asked. ""After the brutality of the things we've perpetrated, Can we be the same people we once were? I think that's a theme interwoven into everybody's character arcs this season, no more so than Rick. A lot of his sacrifices and him pulling back from the brutality and the leadership role is because of his son. That relationship is certainly one of the most interesting relationships this season."" Suffice it to say, the fans at Walker Stalker Con -- from those covered in zombie makeup to those dressed as Rick Grimes and everyone in between -- will be among those tuning in for answers.

"Washington (CNN) -- It was the fall of 1995, and there was open warfare in Washington over the Republicans' Contract with America. Liberals had declared that civilization as we knew it was imperiled by the evil machinations of Newt Gingrich and Co. This is to be expected of liberals on Capitol Hill -- but those weren't the effective ones. It was their colleagues in the national so-called ""objective"" so-called ""news"" media whose ""reporting"" was poisoning the public discourse. Former CBS anchor Dan Rather was a frequent target of conservatives' ire. On November 28, he was a guest of Mike Rosen, the top-rated conservative radio talk show host in Denver, Colorado. Rosen directly accused him of having a liberal bias, but Rather would have none of it. ""I'm a lifetime reporter. What I care about is news,"" Rather insisted in his telephone interview with the KOA host. ""I'm all news, all the time. Full power, tall tower, I want to break in when news breaks out. That's my agenda. Now, very respectfully, when you start talking about a liberal agenda and all the, quote, liberal bias in the media, I quite frankly, and I say this respectfully but candidly to you, I don't know what you're talking about. ... What I don't like, and if you want to see my neck swell or the hair begin to rise on the back of my neck, is to be tagged by somebody else's label."" Rosen was unimpressed, insisting that Rather was biased. Callers called and repeated the accusation. Rather was in knots. ""Oh, bullfeathers, bullfeathers. Total, complete bullfeathers! Look, there is a limit where you have to just say, 'Listen, this is off-the-wall stuff,' and this is off the wall. ... Listen, my answer to the lady [is] Madam, prove it and I'll report it. Or get somebody to prove it and I'll report it."" But then the golden moment arrived. Rosen asked about the ""Mediscare"" campaign and how the press was willfully echoing the Democratic Party line that Republicans wanted to cut Medicare coverage, which was simply false. Rather's answer was remarkable: ""On the 'CBS Evening News,' here's what we try to do. We catch it from both sides on this, which doesn't necessarily mean we've been doing it right. Some of the time, we use the language, 'Medicare cuts,' which is what the Democrats insist these are, and some of the time, we use that these are, 'cuts in the rate of growth for Medicare,' which is what the Republicans prefer. We try to walk that line, we try to call it one way one time, one way the next time ..."" This was too much for Rosen, who pointed out that it simply was not true that CBS was giving equal time and, besides, if it were, it would mean that at best, CBS would be telling the truth only half the time. Click. Rather hung up. It was a perfect illustration of the challenge conservatives faced 15 years ago with a national news media almost uniformly liberal and arrogant and blatantly advancing a political agenda rather than reporting news. Their contempt for anything conservative was palpable, and should an uppity right-winger -- Ronald Reagan, Gingrich -- catch fire, the media hellfire was as ferocious as it was predictable. Conservatives didn't stand a chance. They owned a handful of newspapers and opinion magazines, and if they combined their audiences, they could match perhaps a tenth of the audience of just one television news network. Conservative talk radio was exploding, to be sure, but as opposed to ""news reporting,"" Rush Limbaugh and the industry he spawned were (correctly) labeled as biased, and their reports labeled commentary. The nature of their business was such that conservatives could only react with opinions to what liberals presented as objective truth. Today, the internet has changed everything. Enter the citizen journalist, the person (or entity) that can now create news and present it directly to the public without going through the filter of the liberal press. The left no longer controls the flow of information and therefore no longer can control the narrative. For years, there's been systematic corruption at federally funded outfits like ACORN; it took James O'Keefe and Hannah Giles -- armed with a camera and a chinchilla coat -- to bring them down. The liberal press has filed hundreds of stories about ""racism"" at the Tea Party rallies; one black conservative activist at BlackandRight.com, armed with a camera and a creative impulse, simply filmed the blacks who participate in the rallies to shatter the canard. In 2004, Dan Rather tried to take down President George W. Bush when he challenged the authenticity of his military service; instead, conservatives on the internet exposed the dishonesty of his hit piece and took down Dan Rather. The left is, of course, apoplectic now. ""Why, just look at the abuses!"" they scream, even when they can't find them. Are there land mines out there? Sure. Could the citizen journalist abuse the public trust? Hypothetically, of course. Conservatives must all guard against this. An example of abusing that trust is the attempted prank by O'Keefe against CNN, which I have clearly stated is not in line with the conservative movement. Read Bozell's full statement on the attempted CNN prank . Let there be scrutiny, by all means. But however it's done, those who devoted themselves to advancing a liberal agenda on the traditional media, all the while calling it ""news,"" and those who turned a blind eye to these abuses over the past half-century, should kindly recuse themselves from the conversation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brent Bozell.","Brent Bozell says that 15 years ago, conservatives couldn't expect fair shake in the media .

He provides commentary on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" daily from 4 to 7 p.m. ET. You can also visit Jack's Cafferty File blog. Jack Cafferty says people are losing faith in their ability to realize the American dream. NEW YORK (CNN) -- There is a chill wind blowing across this land of ours. People are losing faith in their ability to realize the American dream. While AIG pays out $165 million in bonuses to people who arguably contributed to the need for the federal government to hand them $170 billion of our money, and while politicians lie about who crafted the language that allowed this kind of stuff to happen (Are you listening Chris Dodd?), the average American is seeing his future disintegrate in front of his eyes. Here are some numbers that suggest we are losing hope: . A CNN-Opinion Research Corp. poll shows 39 percent of those surveyed say they're very confident they'll be able to keep up their quality of life. That's down from 45 percent a year ago. Fifty percent of homeowners with a mortgage say they're very confident they can keep making their house payments. Again, that's down from 58 percent a year ago. Also down are the percentages of Americans who are confident they can pay their other debts, things like credit cards and car loans. When it comes to saving for long-term goals, it's even worse. Only 24 percent of parents say they're very confident they'll be able to pay to send their children to college, and only 22 percent of those who are still working think they'll be able to save enough for retirement. This used to be the country where each succeeding generation could look forward to a better quality of life than their parents enjoyed. In the meantime, as the federal government continues to print money that isn't worth the paper it's written on and as our national debt soars past $11 trillion, a United Nations panel is set to recommend that the world ditch the U.S. dollar as its reserve currency in favor of a shared basket of currencies. One of the enduring strengths of the dollar has been that it has always been the currency of choice in times of crisis. But that's not the case anymore. Our ballooning deficits have driven down the value of the dollar so much that the Chinese government recently asked for guarantees from Washington that the Treasury bills they own are safe. All of this isn't lost on the average American. Last week there were protests and demonstrations by taxpayers in cities all around the country who are beginning to object in increasing numbers to runaway government spending, taxes, bailouts and our growing national debt. These protests were called tea parties. Has a familiar ring to it, doesn't it?

"(CNN) -- Palestinian journalists are finding reporting increasingly difficult in the face of the growing abuse toward them by Palestinian security forces in the West Bank and Gaza, according to a report released Wednesday by Human Rights Watch. The report, ""No News is Good News: Abuses Against Journalists by Palestinian Security Forces,"" criticizes Palestinian Authority forces in the West Bank and Hamas security forces in Gaza, saying they are abusing local journalists and limiting press freedom in the Palestinian territories. The 35-page report focuses on seven incidents in the West Bank and two in Gaza, saying they are ""cases in which security forces tortured, beat, and arbitrarily detained journalists, confiscated their equipment and barred them from leaving the West Bank and Gaza."" Human Rights Watch cites a report issued by the Palestinian Center for Development and Media Freedom that says there was a 45% increase in the number of physical attacks, arrests, confiscation of equipment and limitation of movement in the year 2010. ""We respect the Human Rights Watch report and other human rights organizations in what they do on the ground, and we have the readiness to investigate each case,"" said Maj. Gen. Adnan Dmeiri, spokesman for the Palestinian Authority security services. But, he said, ""Why don't they consult us and ask us ... before publishing these reports?"" He said the security services will investigate and ""bring people to justice. The PA has no agenda to violate the rights of human beings and especially the rights of the journalists. We trust our justice system and the freedom of journalists is a priority of all things."" Most of the abuses against journalists are connected to the rift between Fatah, which controls the West Bank's Palestinian Authority, and Hamas, which controls Gaza, according to the report. Pro-Hamas journalists are targeted by the Palestinian security forces in the West Bank and pro-Fatah journalists are targeted by the Hamas security in Gaza. The report stresses that the West Bank security forces have ""virtual impunity for serious human rights violations"" and states that the ""utter failure of the (Palestinian Authority) leadership to address the prevailing culture of impunity for such abuses suggests that they reflect government policy."" ""We don't accept the comparison between us and the militia in Gaza,"" Dmeiri said. He said his organization has no political agenda and ""we don't hold and detain people on their background. We detain people if they have criminal or security threats or matters that threaten the internal security."" Large sums are donated to the Palestinian Authority security forces in the West Bank by the United States and the European Union. Human Rights Watch calls on the donor countries to condition their support to those security services by making sure that Palestinian Authority officials investigate and punish security personnel for their abuses. Attacks on International journalists in Gaza also have increased in the past couple of months. In March 2011, as journalists were covering a demonstration in Gaza calling for reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, the offices of Reuters, CNN and NHK were raided by Hamas security forces. Efforts to get a response from Hamas officials were not immediately successful. The Tel Aviv-based Foreign Press Association released a statement expressing its ""grave concern"" that Hamas security forces ""brutally attacked photographers and cameramen, beating them, breaking equipment and confiscating photos and video footage."" The organization called the developments the latest in a ""string of chilling attacks on reporters in Gaza."" The United States and European Union have designated Hamas as a terrorist organization. Human Rights Watch describes itself on its website as ""one of the world's leading independent organizations dedicated to defending and protecting human rights."" CNN's Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.","NEW: Palestinian security forces say they will investigate the allegations .

"Rome (CNN) -- A former Vatican ambassador to the Dominican Republic has been found guilty of sexual abuse of minors by a Vatican tribunal and defrocked, the Vatican said in a statement Friday. Jozef Wesolowski was accused of sexual abuse of minors while serving in the Caribbean nation, the statement said. The Polish archbishop is believed to be one of the highest-ranking Vatican officials to be dismissed from the clergy for sexual abuse. Wesolowski has the right to appeal against the tribunal's finding and sentence within two months. Once the canonical process has been concluded, he will then be tried by Vatican judicial authorities, according to the Vatican statement. A report by the U.N. Committee Against Torture in May cited Wesolowski's case, noting that Poland had reportedly asked for the archbishop's extradition. It urged the Holy See to ""proceed to a prompt and impartial investigation of Archbishop Wesolowski"" and anyone else accused of violating the U.N. Convention Against Torture. If necessary, the Holy See ""should ensure such persons are criminally prosecuted or extradited for prosecution by the civil authorities"" of another state, it said. The U.N. panel asked to be informed of the outcome of the investigation into Wesolowski. In a statement issued following the report, the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, urged Polish bishops and Catholics to contact Pope Francis and ""insist that he send Wesolowski back to face secular justice in Poland."" Francis last month spoke out against sexual abuse by Catholic clergy and said he would meet with victims. A priest who abuses a child betrays the body of the Lord, the Pope told reporters, as he called for zero tolerance. ""This is very serious,"" he said. ""It is like, by way of comparison, holding a black Mass. You are supposed to lead them to sanctity and instead you lead them to a problem that will last their entire lives.""

"(CNN) -- A father and son who tread water for more than 12 hours in the Atlantic Ocean before being rescued spent much of the time in the dark seas not knowing if the other was alive, authorities said Monday. A U.S. Coast Guard rescue swimmer gives a thumbs up after reaching Chris Marino. Walter Marino, 46, and his son Chris Marino, who has autism, were swimming in the Ponce Inlet, south of Daytona Beach, Florida, on Saturday when currents pulled the 12-year-old boy out to sea. His father jumped in to try to save Chris but was also pulled out to sea. Family members called 911, but by the time rescue units arrived, the father and son could no longer be seen, officials said. The U.S. Coast Guard, the Volusia County Beach Patrol and the sheriff's office immediately launched a search-and-rescue mission using helicopters, boats and personal watercraft to try to find the Winter Park, Florida, father and son. ""[We were] floating,"" Walter Marino told CNN affiliate WKMG-TV after the rescue. ""We were floating and just waiting for help to come.""  Watch the father thank rescuers » . Hoping to find the pair alive, the Coast Guard searched from Saturday night until early Sunday morning before suspending the search because of darkness, Coast Guard officials told CNN. Coast Guard officials told Lt. j.g. David Birky that he would be part of a backup crew to relieve the team from the night before. Birky told CNN the crew was set to do a search when the sun came up, but received a call while they were en route that a good Samaritan boat found Walter Marino about 7:30 a.m. Birky, the co-pilot of the crew, told CNN that after the father was found, they began searching that area for his son. Chris Marino was found two hours later, three miles from where his father was rescued. The Coast Guard lifted the boy into a helicopter, and both father and son were taken to Halifax Medical Center in Daytona Beach, where they were in good condition. Both were treated for dehydration, according to WKMG-TV. ""The Coast Guard rocks,"" Walter Marino said as he was being transported to the hospital, according to WKMG-TV. ""God bless the Coast Guard."" While Walter Marino praised the Coast Guard for its rescue efforts, Birky said the true praise goes to the father and his young son. ""That kid is an amazing kid,"" Birky said. ""To tread water for almost 14 hours, I don't know about you, but I don't think I could do that. They have amazing willpower to be able to do it.""","Son swept out to sea by currents, father jumped in after him .

"(CNN) -- Even though the Ryder Cup prize ceremony took place at Medinah long after the sun had set, the staggering nature of Europe's triumph eclipsed the gloom -- and left many golf fans wondering how the visiting side had recorded the most remarkable comeback in the competition's 85-year history. Trailing 10-4 at one point on Saturday, and 10-6 as Sunday's singles got underway, the team led by Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal defied the odds to win a record eight-and-a-half points on the final day and thus the trophy itself. As darkness enveloped Medinah Country Club in Chicago, Europe's captain Olazabal talked of how the spirit of Seve Ballesteros had been key to his team's success. Inspirational and flamboyant, Ballesteros won five major championships, revolutionized the European Tour and revelled in the passion of a Ryder Cup battle with the United States. He died in 2011 after a long battle with cancer. ""Our team played in the spirit of Seve without ever giving up,"" Olazabal said. For leadership and teamwork specialist Khoi Tu -- a man who has advised Formula 1 champions and some of the world's leading companies -- the spirit of Ballesteros hung heavy over the European team. ""The thing that Europe had -- distinct to the United States -- was the notion of playing for Seve, and teams are often at their best when playing for an idea,"" says Tu, whose book 'Superteams' will be published next month. ""I'm not sure the U.S. did a lot wrong. But since the contest was so close, the key differentiator could be the 'Seve' idea. After all, could the power and pulling together of the U.S. team match his story? ""Like most sports, golf is a combination of will and skill and at this level, the will is often more important than the skill. ""The differentiator here was Seve had played a role in all the European players' lives and would have meant something for many of them."" As Spaniards and fellow professionals, Olazabal and Ballesteros shared a strong bond before the latter's death last year. On the course, the Spanish pair formed Europe's most dyanmaic Ryder Cup partnership (with 12 points gained from their 15 matches) and Olazabal ensured his late compatriot was never far from any of his team's minds this week by strategically placing his image on the players' clothing and bags. With Justin Rose looking up to the heavens in triumph, Sergio Garcia suggesting that Seve 'was with me all day' after his win and Europe's star man Ian Poulter saying he owed his presence on the team to Ballesteros, Olazabal's unorthodox approach to captaincy produced compelling results. The 46-year-old may have lacked the organizational ability of previous European captain Colin Montgomerie, whose side triumphed in another nail biting clash in Wales two years ago, but he compensated in other areas, says Tu. ""Compared to Montgomerie, Olazabal was all about emotion -- connecting with individuals on a very visceral level,"" he said. ""Montgomerie was about thorough preparation and leaving no detail unturned in an attempt to ensure the players were given the best platform to produce victory. ""This year, people felt emotionally connected to Olazabal and his ability to translate that Seve factor was very powerful. ""His organization wasn't perhaps the best though, given what happened with Rory McIlroy,"" referring to the world No.1 nearly missing his tee-off slot on Sunday after confusing his time zones. The Northern Irishman eventually made it onto the course just 10 minutes before he was scheduled to start thanks to a siren-wailing police escort from the team hotel to Medinah. Despite that glitch, Tu believes Olazabal built a team where belief became an intrinsic value and where his man management skills produced inspired results. ""Olazabal did do some interesting structural things -- such as choosing Poulter as a wild card,"" says Tu. ""Poulter has a brilliant Ryder Cup record and his infectious attitude will only ever amplify the belief in others."" Tu highlighted the way in which Martin Kaymer put a disappointing season behind him to emerge as the effective match-winner, as the German coolly sank a pressurized putt on the 18th to beat Steve Stricker and ensure that Europe retained the Ryder Cup. ""Teams play for a leader,"" says Tu. ""The worst leader of Europe in recent times was 2008 captain Nick Faldo, who told Lee Westwood in the middle of a round that he would not be playing the next day. ""Compare that to Olazabal's management of Kaymer, who was not in great form coming into the tournament and who didn't play on the Saturday either. ""Somehow, Olazabal managed to turn a potential weakness into a positive, by stressing to Kaymer that his absence on Saturday was a sacrifice for the team's greater good. ""This would have liberated Kaymer -- and just look at the way both he and Stricker handled the pressure in their clash late on. ""A lot of small things combined to tip Europe into the belief they could win and as the scores came through, their momentum became unstoppable. ""This momentum helped Kaymer -- and so did the Seve influence, as he was playing with something beyond himself. Stricker saw the increasing blue on the scoreboard and began to feel the pressure. ""It's a fine line between that pressure either being turned into a positive or negative, but Stricker knew everyone was relying on him -- which became pretty tough pressure -- and the game just ran away from him."" Stricker's misery was compounded by the fact he was the only player among the two dozen involved who failed to win a point all week -- a statistic that history will not look kindly upon as Americans try to understand how they snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. The Wall Street Journal is already debating this, with the newspaper pointing an accusatory finger at the decision by U.S. captain Davis Love III to select Stricker as one of his four wild cards. ""The better questions to ask might be how teams from Europe consistently pull rabbits out of their hats at these Ryder Cups. Europe has now won two in a row, five of the past six and seven of the past nine,"" the paper wrote on Monday. ""If it were just this U.S. team that lost when on paper it seemed to have the better players, the blame might be easier to assign. But that's not the case."" For Tu, the answer is simple. ""The Europeans were playing for each other, for their leaders and for a purpose -- Seve.""","Europe staged a stunning fightback to snatch the Ryder Cup from U.S. grasp .

"(CNN) -- Neglected by humans for almost two decades, New World Mall in Bangkok has attracted a slightly different clientele. Happily swimming among dilapidated storefronts and waterlogged escalators, koi and tilapia feast on fish food sold by enterprising locals and thrown by tourists who continue to descend on the surreal scene. Built in 1982, the New World shopping mall survived only 15 years before trouble came calling, according to the Bangkok Post. In 1997, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration demolished seven of the mall's 11 floors after it was found that the owner obtained permission for only four. The demolition, and a fire in 1999, left the mall roofless. Open to the elements, the mall's ground floor became a pond filled with years of accumulated rainwater -- and clouds of mosquitoes. To remedy this obnoxious and potentially hazardous problem, people in the area decided to introduce fish species known to prey on flies. And just like that, a miniature ecosystem was born in the abandoned mall. At first, there were only 10 to 20 regular visitors to the pond, local noodle vendor Jae Toom told the Bangkok Post. Toom said that most of these people were there only to feed the fish. ""But since photos of the pond were shared on Facebook last week, many more outsiders have come to visit,"" said Toom. ""And that was when the BMA began to have problems with the fish pond."" On Monday, a Bangkok Metropolitan Administration official declared the building condemned and ordered barricades erected to keep the public out, the Bangkok Post reported. City officials cited health risks and structural instability as possible risks to visitors. The administration hopes to determine whether New World is safe for public use by the end of July. If the structure is deemed unsafe, the plan is to raze it and relocate its aquatic residents to a far less interesting home. A fascination with abandoned buildings . 10 abandoned hotels .

"Auckland (CNN) -- The approaching election represents a crossroads for New Zealand. As its citizens visit their polling stations on September 20, they should consider the fact that the nation has quietly morphed -- under the leadership of Prime Minister John Key -- into the political equivalent of an American slave, responding more readily to the interests that motivate the United States than to the concerns of Kiwis. READ MORE: Who is Kim Dotcom? If the trend continues, New Zealand will not only lose its national identity to its stronger allies, it will cease to enjoy the fundamental individual rights and freedoms that seem to be evaporating elsewhere in this increasingly integrated world. These issues are personal to me. I came to New Zealand as an immigrant, but I fell quickly in love with the country and its people. More importantly, I saw New Zealand as a place in which my children could grow up safe in the knowledge that Kiwi society protects the interests of its own citizens above all others. My opposition to the John Key government goes beyond its abuse of surveillance powers or its leaking of confidential information to politically aligned publishers. READ MORE: Key apologizes to Dotcom over spying . It goes beyond Key's illegal conspiracy with the Obama Administration to placate the Motion Picture Association of America and other financiers of the Democratic Party in the United States. Whatever government is formed as a result of these elections will be charged with the responsibility of negotiating New Zealand's participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), an ambitious 21st century trade agreement proposed and driven principally by United States' interests. Make no mistake; the TPP is only the latest attempt by the intellectual property industry in America to criminalize legitimate business activities such as file sharing, to destroy privacy and free speech, and to extend the American legal empire to the Pacific. READ MORE: United States vs. Kim Dotcom . It is my belief that the Key government, if given the opportunity to participate in the TPP negotiations, will once again place the interests of New Zealand behind those of the United States. These critical issues are some of the motivating factors behind the formation of the Internet Mana Party. The unique relationship between the Maori-based perspective and issues of global technology abuse is more than mere happenstance. It is indigenous people throughout the world that suffer the most from the spreading mantle of intellectual property laws and elitist economic policies. The lack of basic access to knowledge for everyone, and the transformation of the Internet into a toll booth governed by pay-as-you-play American rules, are what motivated me to identify and then consolidate the relationship with this important group. New Zealand is engaged in a struggle, just as I am, for Internet freedom and everything beneficial that flows from it. The task of securing that liberty falls to this generation, as the point of no return is not far off. Those politicians around the present government in New Zealand -- whose ""Dirty Politics"" were exposed in Nicky Hager's recent book -- are the last people who should be entrusted with the future of this great country. This election represents a chance to turn back the clock to a time when New Zealand was the sovereign manager of its own domain.

"(CNN) -- It is the day after the tumultuous one before. Victorious captain Jose Maria Olazabal has arrived back in Europe with the Ryder Cup trophy as the continent continues to celebrate one of the greatest sporting comebacks of all time. It is a very different story across the pond as the head scratching continues. How did the United States turn what was supposed to be an emphatic victory into the 'Miracle of Medinah'? Despite an insistence from both sides they would get together over a beer at the end of the competition come what may, no U.S. players dropped into the European party, according to those who celebrated all night long. That should come as no surprise, as a party is probably the last thing any of the shell shocked Americans had on their minds as they tried to piece together a startling collapse that ended in a 14 1/2 - 13 1/2 defeat. Not that they are alone in their disbelief. Even some of the European players are still struggling to come to terms with such a decisive swing during the singles matches on Sunday in Chicago. As they head back home after overturning a 10-6 deficit to claim a fifth Ryder Cup win in the last six years, the magnitude of their achievement is yet to sink in for some of those who made it happen. Chicago resident Luke Donald, who led the charge by taking down Masters champion Bubba Watson in the opening singles match, is one of them. ""I still can't quite believe that happened yesterday, what an amazing feeling being a part of one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever,"" he said on his official Twitter site. Ian Poulter, who won four of his matches and gained a crucial point for Europe with a late victory over U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson, echoed Donald's sentiments. ""On the plane on the way back to Orlando, why does it feel like we just robbed a bank? Not sure how long it's going to take to sink in,"" he said on the micro-blogging site. The joy the European contingent felt was tinged with relief for world No. 1 Rory McIlroy, who nearly forfeited his match with Keegan Bradley by missing his tee-off slot. The Northern Irishman thought he was teeing off at 11.25am eastern time, but Chicago is in the central time zone and his starting berth was an hour earlier. After a frantic call from his manager he was hurried to the course in a police car, arriving 11 minutes before his match was due to begin. Had he missed the start, he'd have handed a crucial point to Bradley on a plate. ""I was just lucky there was a State Trooper downstairs who could take me, get his lights on and pass all the traffic,' he told reporters. ""Once we got off the highway it would have taken 10 minutes without him to get through that junction. ""I've never been so worried going to a golf course. I got to the course at 11.14, so I had 11 minutes to get ready and had just enough time to put my shoes on, have a couple of putts and go to the first tee. ""In a way it wasn't a bad thing because I didn't have time to think about it -- and I played probably the best I played all week."" As for captain Olazabal, who channeled the spirit of the his great friend and erstwhile Ryder Cup playing partner, Seve Ballesteros, it was the crowning glory after a tough opening two days. The U.S. dominated the foursomes and fourball matches, until a late Poulter charge on Saturday evening gave rise to the impossible dream, delivered in style by his charges on Sunday. ""It's going to take a little while before it completely sinks in,"" Olazabal was quoted as saying by the European Tour website. ""It's been a very emotional week, especially when things were not going our way, but (Saturday) everything turned round for us. ""We changed a couple of crucial matches around down the stretch and that gave us the chance to have this trophy back. It's completely different from playing, being a Ryder Cup captain. I think in my career it ranks number one."" The mood was very different back in the States, where one sports journalist was vilified for a column on Saturday in which he said the Ryder Cup was done and dusted unless one of five things happened. One included the abduction of Keegan Bradley, who lost to McIlroy, while another was a way for Olazabal to go back in time like Marty McFly from the Back to the Future movies. Elsewhere in the press, recriminations started to fly. 'Americans produce a choke for the ages at Ryder Cup,' cried the New York Post. The Chicago Tribune went with the headline 'Epic Ryder Cup Collapse Inexcusable' and said: ""Europeans forever will refer to it as the Miracle at Medinah. For the U.S., Medin-ahhhhhhhhhh!"" Several European players will now head to Scotland, host of the 2014 Ryder Cup, to play in the next European Tour event, including Martin Kaymer, who holed the putt that ensured Europe would retain the trophy. Ryder Cup rookie Nicolas Colsaerts, who delivered a fourball point on Friday with an inspired performance, said he was so enraptured by the atmosphere it will difficult going back to regular Tour life. He said: ""You don't come across an atmosphere like this anywhere else. It's almost like a fix -- you're going to need to play in an atmosphere like this. ""I can imagine how quiet it's going to be for the guys playing in tournaments next week. It's just going to be like you're playing in your garden on your own.""","Europe's players bask in the glow of a monumental comeback Ryder Cup victory .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Investigative newspaper reporter Ismail Saymaz thought he faced 10 criminal cases against him for articles he had written. But when he logged on to a Turkish government website to check his legal status, Saymaz discovered an unpleasant surprise: two new cases filed against him. ""They are asking for up to 95 years imprisonment for me in these 12 [cases],"" he said. The charges against Saymaz range from violating secrecy to influencing judicial processes. Media watchdog organizations warn growing numbers of Turkish journalists now face not only the threat of lawsuits and fines for their work, but also possible jail sentences. According to the International Press Institute, as of September 30, 50 press workers were incarcerated in Turkish prisons and at least 50 more were facing possible jail sentences. The climate of intimidation led the European Commission to accuse Turkey of not sufficiently guaranteeing freedom of expression. ""Concerns remain as regards political attacks against the press,"" the European Commission announced Tuesday, in its annual progress report on Turkey's bid to become the first predominantly Muslim country to join the European Union. The European report comes on the heels of a decision by the association Reporters Without Borders to downgrade Turkey's rating on a press freedoms index. In two years, Turkey has dropped from 102 to 138 on the association's index, and now sits among the bottom 40 countries of the world when it comes to freedom of the press. ""These declines can be explained,"" Reporters Without Borders wrote, ""by the frenzied proliferation of lawsuits, incarcerations, and court sentencing targeting journalists."" At a speech in England on Monday, Turkish President Abdullah Gul conceded his country faced shortcomings when it comes to freedom of the press. ""There are unfortunately certain cases that have been brought before the courts about journalists and it is a cause of concern for us as well,"" Gul said. ""There are certain legal amendments that will be introduced on this subject."" Gul's Justice and Development Party, or AKP, has instituted historic reforms since it first swept to power in 2002. Strict taboos imposed by the once politically-dominant Turkish military have been relaxed. ""The taboos have changed. The military is not taboo anymore,"" said Mehmet Ali Birand, a veteran journalist who was black-listed and lost his job for his critical reporting on the military-dominated regime. But as power has shifted over the past decade from military to civilian rule, the AKP government has introduced laws that make it easier to prosecute journalists. A 2005 change to the Turkish penal code established prison sentences for press-related crimes such as ""breach of secrecy"" and ""influencing of a fair trial."" The journalistic red lines are now much harder to discern, said Mehmet Ali Birand -- who anchors the prime-time evening news on Turkey's Kanal D. ""We knew what the military censorship was,"" Birand said. ""The problem with civilian government -- you don't know. ... It's very, very unpredictable now."" Last year, the Turkish government slapped Birand's employer, Dogan Media Group, with a $2.5 billion fine for unpaid taxes. At the time the assets of Dogan Group, Turkey's largest media conglomerate (and a business partner of CNN's parent company Turner Broadcasting), was valued at $2.8 billion. Tuesday's European Commission assessment report argued the penalty against Dogan Group amounted to a political attack against the press. Throughout Dogan Group's subsequent battle over tax evasion charges, several journalists working for the conglomerate -- speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs -- told CNN they routinely self-censor reports to avoid arousing further anger from the government. But journalists said they are also frequently targeted by court cases launched by the political opposition. Investigative journalist Ismail Saymaz said roughly half the cases he faces stem from articles critical of the AKP government, while the other half come from articles critical of Turkey's older secular establishment. ""In a country like Turkey, where political polarization is widening between traditional power-holders from the military and Kemalists on the one hand and conservative liberals on the other, ... we journalists become the ones who take the first bullet,"" he said. In 2007, Armenian newspaper editor Hrant Dink was gunned down outside his office in downtown Istanbul. The man accused of Dink's murder was caught on security camera moments after he allegedly shot the editor. Three years later, he has not been convicted. In the meantime, newspaper columnist Nedim Sener has been fighting in court after publishing a book accusing Turkish police of not doing enough to stop Dink's murder. At one point, Sener faced a possible 32 years in prison -- a stiffer penalty than the one potentially faced by the alleged murderer. Last summer, a court acquitted Sener. Several police officers named in his book are trying to appeal the decision, he said. During a state visit to England, Turkish President Abdullah Gul urged observers to appreciate the democratic reforms his government achieved over the past nine years.","Media watchdog organizations say Turkish journalists face lawsuits, jail sentenced .

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni says sectarian and chauvinistic cultural leaders are behind weekend attacks by people, armed mainly with machetes and spears, who killed security personnel and civilians in the western part of the country. Police raised the death toll to 90 on Tuesday afternoon. Hundreds have been arrested, police said, including cultural leaders of rival ethnic groups in the Rwenzori Mountains region and in the oil-rich Lake Albert region bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo. Most of the dead ""are attackers killed in a counterattack at a military camp in Bundibugyo district and civilians,"" police spokesman Fred Enanga said. ""We have so far found 86 key suspects out of hundreds, and we continue with a cordon and search in the communities looking for 22 guns we lost.

"(CNN) -- An uproar over treatment delays at the Department of Veterans Affairs is triggering a heated debate over whether it is too difficult to fire federal workers, with the House approving legislation on Wednesday that would make it easier to remove senior executives at the agency. The Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act, sponsored by House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Florida, and passed overwhelmingly, would let the agency secretary immediately fire any of the department's senior executives. Currently, those executives get at least 30 days' notice of potential dismissal and an option to invoke a potentially lengthy appeals process before losing their jobs. For months, Miller has argued that the VA is too reluctant to fire executives, especially those connected to delays in veterans care. The agency is engulfed by a growing controversy over allegations it covered up excessive wait times for veterans at some VA health care facilities. President Barack Obama is resisting calls from some quarters to fire Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. He said on Wednesday that he needed more time to review what was going on and promised accountability. How many has the VA fired? An argument for change . Miller's proposal is a strong statement, but it would affect a relatively small group of federal workers. There are roughly 360 senior executives at Veterans Affairs, according to the Office of Personnel Management. There are 340,000 total employees. But the more important figure to look at may be the number of execs fired recently. CNN analysis of OPM data found the VA fired two senior executives last year. And that was much higher than usual. During the four years from 2008-2012, only one other senior executive was terminated for cause from the agency, according to the personnel data. The VA's executive firing rate last year was in line with the 0.47% termination-for-cause rate of the federal government overall, according to the OPM statistics. But, the trend over the past five years shows a substantial difference at the VA. From 2008-2013, the VA fired executives at a rate one-fourth the firing rate for government overall, according to the OPM data. And even last year, when the VA was in line with the rest of the federal government on firing, critics still see that as a significant problem because the rates of termination in the federal government are substantially lower than in the private sector. The 0.47% federal rate is roughly a third of that for the private sector, according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data. ""I actually think the federal workforce would be better off with more firing or at least as much as in the private sector,"" argued Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute. ""The good workers get disheartened and demoralized if they see these non-performing workers making as much as them and they're not doing their job."" The danger of politics, an argument for workers . But just as some conservatives cry for removing red tape and speeding up the firing process for government executives, others insist the idea could easily harm good employees at the VA. ""What happens is the politics get ahead of the facts,"" said Joe Kaplan, an attorney who has worked on federal workers' cases for more than 30 years. Kaplan believes the need for potential scapegoats in a crisis could easily lead to abuse under Miller's bill. For example, he told the story of an IRS employee who came to his office saying others at the agency had suggested she could be fired and were pressuring her to over a recent high-profile congressional investigation of IRS targeting of conservative political groups. Kaplan looked at her case, saw no evidence of wrong doing and advised her to stay put. She did, and was not fired. ""For political reasons, things can get blown out of proportion easily,"" Kaplan concluded. ""And is it good that private employers can fire people without any cause? We should want the federal government to be a model employer."" Others argue something more: that allowing a political appointee, like a Cabinet secretary, to fire people at will could threaten American-style democracy. That it could invite patronage and corruption, something that was in full bloom until President Chester Arthur signed the first civil service reform act in 1883. ""It's really important in a political system to maintain a third party review of personnel actions,"" said Max Stier, president of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service which focuses on strengthening civil service. ""The operations of government need to be different in some ways than they are in the private sector. We don't want a government that is staffed according to political persuasion,"" he said. Stier believes the system needs to change, that there may be too much red tape. But he argues that Congress needs to revamp the entire, outdated federal personnel policy for the government, not just make a sudden change at the VA. ""It's the whole system that needs to be reviewed,"" he asserted. Why the change at the VA? Why now? Miller insists that as it is now, the VA is not a meritocracy. That instead, poor performers who oversee failing areas, may be rewarded with bonuses. ""In instance after instance where mismanagement has led to veteran suffering, department officials have repeatedly pointed to non-disciplinary actions such as employee retirements and transfers or bureaucratic slaps on the wrist,"" said Miller when he introduced his bill in March. He called those actions ""a disingenuous attempt to create the appearance of accountability."" Secretary won't quit . Shinseki has not publicly commented on whether he would like more power to fire executives. Now that the House has acted, the matter moves over to the Senate where Florida's Marco Rubio has introduced a companion bill. It's not clear if it will be considered. But for now, Shinseki has no plans to fire himself, saying he isn't resigning. Nor has he said if he is in the process of firing any VA employees as a result of the scandal. Some, including the head of the Phoenix branch where problems were first discovered, have been suspended. Did he say anything in his testimony why he couldn't? Senators asked the agency leader directly at a hearing last week on the scandal. ""Have you ever fired anyone on this issue?"" Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, questioned Shinseki. Shinseki replied that he needed to look through the agencies records to check. But would he fire someone because of the scandal? ""I will do everything I can,"" Shinseki demurred. ""That's not the question,"" replied Begich. ""There is a process here,"" Shinseki summarize, ""let me not get out ahead of it.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Denise Fettig-Loftesnes lives just 50 feet from the East China Sea on the Japanese island of Okinawa -- prime territory to witness the swirling winds of Typhoon Neoguri as they lashed the island Tuesday. ""The wind sounds like a freight train is coming towards you,"" the CNN iReporter said. ""It is hard to sometimes hear people in the same room with you because the wind is so loud."" Her building -- she lives on the sixth floor -- is swaying with the wind, so she's not going outside to check for damage. ""I did notice that my car has moved ahead about one foot and a little to the side,"" she said. The storm had lost strength early Tuesday, going from the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane to a Category 3, said CNN International meteorologist Tom Sater. But it still had knocked out power to at least 106,100 electric customers, according to Okinawa Electric Power Company. About 600,000 households were under evacuation advisories, but fewer than 1,000 had left, authorities said. Officials attributed 10 injuries to the storm, only one of them serious. Although the storm is expected to only sideswipe Okinawa, passing about 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the west, the island's main airport, schools and many businesses were closed. Authorities at Kadena Air Base, the largest U.S. military installation in the Asia-Pacific region, told the thousands of service members and their families at the facility that all outside activity was forbidden Tuesday morning. Okinawa, the site of multiple U.S. military facilities, regularly finds itself in the path of big typhoons. Buildings on the island are designed to withstand the powerful winds that come roaring in off the ocean. Each summer and autumn, heavy storms roll in from the Western Pacific, often causing damage in East Asian countries such as the Philippines, China and Japan. Fears for Kyushu . The storm weakened slightly overnight, with maximum sustained winds of 148 kph (92 mph) and gusts of up to 212 kph (132 mph), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. And while the storm is expected to continue to weaken, authorities are concerned about the potential impact of rain when it reaches Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's main islands, sometime Thursday morning (Wednesday night ET). ""This is not about wind, it's all about rainfall,"" Sater said, noting that parts of Kyushu have already experienced heavy rains in recent days. The rivers are swollen and the ground is saturated, he said. Authorities have already relocated about 84,000 people from areas of Kyushu vulnerable to flooding. Seen from space .

"(CNN) -- Peace. Love. And Snarknado 2. What does it say when Americans unite, not once, but twice in a lifetime for a TV show? And not just a TV show, but one where a twister filled with man-eating sharks menaces a major metropolitan area. We couldn't afford a psychologist so we'll just have to look at social media. Last summer, ""Sharknado"" churned up a storm of laughs, 5.3 million viewers and enough clever tweets to choke a ... shark. It was the same story Wednesday night for the debut of ""Sharknado 2: The Second One"" on Syfy. The Twitterverse exploded. #Sharknado2TheSecondOne was the top-trending hashtag on Twitter well into the overnight hours and social search website Topsy recorded more than 215,000 tweets with #sharknado2 over the past day. But what inspires such passion, such creativity? Is it the rubber sharks flying through Midtown Manhattan, the implausible storyline, the Al Roker cameo? Yes. Yes. And yes. With this amount of chum in the water, there was bound to be a feeding frenzy, right? And there's more to come. Syfy has already signed on for a third ""Sharknado"" movie. Screenwriter Thunder Levin predicts now that New York has gone down, there might be a ""global Sharkapocalypse."" Heaven forbid. Sequel suggestions are already making the rounds.

"(CNN) -- Imperfect though it is, journalism plays unique and essential roles in our society and in our democracy. Journalism serves the public and the public interest in important ways different from any other profession. I believe in journalism guided by sound ethical principles and built on competency, commitment and courage. I have a serious concern with news reporting (as distinguished from the opinion role of journalism) that is driven by ideological bias or activist intentions. My concern is with any and all forms of ideology from the left or from the right and with any argument that attempts to justify activism. My concerns are rooted in my strong belief in the ethical principle of independence that can and should guide the practice of serious, substantive journalism. I'm not arguing for a false sense of ""objectivity."" Rather, independence is about commitment to professional duty that serves society rather than one's own beliefs and self-interest. I haven't read Brent Bozell's commentary, nor have I viewed the ""Right on the Edge"" CNN documentary. Thus, my perspective is framed by my beliefs about journalism, what it does well and what it can do better. Journalists have an ethical and professional duty to pursue the truth about significant issues and events and to strive to report that elusive truth as accurately, fairly and fully as possible. Journalists gather and process a great deal of information and try to make sense of complex and often contentious issues. They report on the strengths and weaknesses of our economy, our government and our communities. They take us down the block and around the globe to give us an understanding of the good, the bad and the ugly happenings in our lives. Journalists take us to battlefields to tell us stories of horror and heroism, and they take us to classrooms to report on success, failure and hope. All this is aspirational, of course. Journalists, like all professionals, are inadequate at times. One gives his or her best effort recognizing there are many variables that prevent perfection. I don't believe that ideological bias is the major problem that erodes quality and corrodes credible journalism. This is much more of a perception problem than a reality. It's a false premise to suggest that most journalists come from an ideological position that reflects personal belief that creates biased reporting. To categorize journalists as liberal or conservative fails to recognize that many individuals -- including journalists -- have a range of views on issues that move along a spectrum. I know journalists who hold what we traditionally think of as liberal views on certain social issues who, at the same time, also hold what we traditionally think of as conservative views on economic issues. I know journalists who hold liberal views on some social issues -- favoring gay marriage, for instance -- while at the same time holding conservative views on other social issues -- expressing a strong pro-life position on abortion, for instance. I know journalists who personally hold contrasting liberal and conservative views on tax policy and health care reform. Most of the journalists I know cannot be labeled as liberal or conservative, because they hold a range of views that are at different points on the ideological spectrum. How, for instance, would one categorize a journalist who holds the following beliefs: opposed U.S. military force in Iraq but favors it in Afghanistan, calls for a much stricter immigration policy with no amnesty, favors the ordination of women as Roman Catholic priests, opposes all forms of abortion, favors capital punishment? Is that person liberal or conservative? How can we accurately and fairly characterize journalists as conservative or liberal? How then could we challenge the journalism they produce as driven by conservative or liberal bias? Furthermore, if a reporter allows his or her personal beliefs to become bias that could undermine reporting, good news organizations have checks and balances that minimize any skewing. Therein lies my deep concern with the so-called ""guerilla journalists"" who are attempting to right wrongs. Their starting premise is flawed by a distorted perception of the practice of journalism and by a false characterization of the beliefs of journalists. The ""guerilla journalism"" mission is further undermined by their use of questionable -- often unethical -- methods to report stories. There are many weak points in the underbelly of American journalism. We need to attract the best and brightest to the profession. We need journalists who are smart, skilled, committed and courageous. We need journalists who reflect all aspects of diversity in our society, and, yes, that includes ideological diversity. Journalism has its flaws. Let's improve the process and the product in the right ways, not by ideological activism. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Steele.","Ideological bias is not the major problem that erodes credible journalism, Steele says .

"(CNN) -- The Committee to Protect Journalists has placed 12 countries on its Impunity Index, a list of countries where journalists have been killed and their killers have not been found. The organization's third annual compilation, released Tuesday, cites Iraq, Somalia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Afghanistan, Nepal, Russia, Mexico, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India. The index, which covers 2000 through 2009, describes the countries as places ""where journalists are murdered on a recurring basis and governments are unable or unwilling to prosecute the killers."" Leading the field for the third consecutive year was Iraq, where all 88 journalist killings remain unsolved, the committee said. All but seven cases involve local journalists, ""the vast majority of whom"" were targeted by insurgents, it said on its website. But last year marked the first since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 that no killing directly related to a journalist's work was documented there by the organization. Still, four journalists were killed in crossfire in 2009, it said. Iraq's Impunity Index Rating was 2.794 unsolved journalist killings per million inhabitants, nearly triple the rate of any other country. Somalia ranked second, ""reflecting insurgents' routine use of violence to control the news media,"" CPJ said. The incidence of fatal, unpunished violence against journalists has increased in the Philippines, Somalia, Russia and Mexico, it said. But Brazil and Colombia, long among the world's deadliest nations for the news media, each showed improvements, with Brazil moving off the list, the committee reported. ""We've heard repeated pledges from governments that the killers of journalists will face justice, but until these promises are fulfilled, media will continue to be targeted by those who believe they are above the law and immune from consequences,"" said Joel Simon, CPJ's executive director. The group noted that many of the countries on the index present themselves as democracies with functioning law enforcement -- nations such as India, Russia, the Philippines, and Mexico. The index includes only those nations with five or more unsolved cases. In the Philippines, 30 journalists and two media support workers were killed in Maguindanao province, it said, boosting the country from sixth to third on the index. ""The massacre overshadowed gains that Philippine authorities had made, winning convictions in two journalist murders,"" the committee said. In Russia, which ranked eighth, three journalists were killed last year, bringing the country's 10-year total of unsolved killings to 18, it said. Mexico moved from 11th to ninth, reflecting continuing violence against crime reporters there, it said. In Mexico, self-censorship is widespread, it said. Many nations on the list have seen a reduction in the flow of information. In fourth-ranked Sri Lanka, with 10 unsolved killings, ""many of the country's most senior journalists have fled into exile,"" the CPJ said. ""Our goal in compiling this index is to spur leaders in these nations to action,"" said Simon. ""Many of these cases are solvable. The perpetrators have been identified but authorities lack the political will to prosecute."" CPJ released the index to coincide with a summit on impunity being held Tuesday and Wednesday in New York. The index calculates the number of unsolved journalist killings as a percentage of the country's population. Only nations with five or more unsolved cases were included. CPJ includes only those killings that are considered to have been deliberate attacks against specific journalists in relation to their work. It does not tally cases of journalists killed in combat or while carrying out other dangerous assignments. ""The only thing you can say about it is that the murder of journalists gets worse and worse, and the problem is that governments around the world are not interested in finding the perpetrators,"" said Stuart H. Loory, editor of the magazine Global Journalist and the Lee Hills Chair in Free-Press Studies at the Missouri School of Journalism. ""Too often they blame journalists for acting out of line.""","Committee to Protect Journalists has placed 12 countries on its Impunity Index .

"(CNN) -- A massive iceberg with an area almost twice the size of Atlanta is moving into the ocean off Antarctica and could threaten shipping during the Antarctic winter, scientists say. The ice island, known as iceberg B31, covers 255 square miles and could be almost a third of a mile thick, scientists say in a report from NASA's Earth Observatory. The iceberg calved from Antarctica's Pine Island Glacier last November, according to NASA. The crack that produced it was first spotted in 2011. Since November, B31 has drifted out of Pine Island Bay and into the Amundsen Sea off the western side of the continent. ""The iceberg is now well out of Pine Island Bay and will soon join the more general flow in the Southern Ocean, which could be east or west in this region,"" iceberg researcher Grant Bigg from the University of Sheffield in England said in the NASA statement. Once that happens, the researchers worry it will be difficult track the iceberg during the long weeks of darkness that comprise the Antarctic winter. And don't expect it to melt. An iceberg of that size could hang around for a year or more, Robert Marsh, a scientist at the University of Southampton in England, said last year. The largest iceberg ever recorded was called B15. With an area of 4,250 square miles -- about the size of the state of Connecticut or the island of Jamaica -- it calved off Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf in March 2000.

"(CNN) -- West African nations are turning to drastic measures in a desperate effort to stem the spread of the deadly Ebola virus. Guinea has closed its border with Sierra Leone, a border police official told CNN. Meanwhile, the Zambian government banned arrivals of people from countries where there has been an Ebola outbreak, as a preventive measure to stop the virus from entering the country. ""All delegates from any of the countries affected by Ebola Virus disease are restricted from entering Zambia until further notice,"" Dr. Joseph Kasonde, Zambia's minister of health, said in a statement Saturday. The virulent virus continues to advance from its epicenter in Sierra Leone to nearby Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria. Other West African governments are attempting to contain the outbreak, which has been declared a ""public health emergency of international concern"" by the World Health Organization. Nearly 1,800 cases, including 961 deaths, are attributed to the virus, the World Health Organization says. Nigeria and Liberia have declared states of national emergency, in an effort to control the unprecedented epidemic. The United States and the United Kingdom vowed Saturday to increase assistance to help combat the disease in West Africa. Two missionaries who had traveled to Africa are being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Canada, meanwhile, announced Sunday that a patient who recently traveled to Nigeria has tested negative for Ebola. The patient was treated in isolation after complaining of fever, headache and malaise. He is now doing well, said Eric Hoskins, minister of health and long-term care.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actress Eleanor Parker, nominated for three Oscars and known for her ""Sound of Music"" role, died Monday at 91, her family said. Parker died at a medical facility near her Palm Springs, California, home from complications related to pneumonia, according to director Richard Gale, who is a family friend. Her acting career began on stage as a teenager, but it was a performance at the Pasadena Playhouse that led Warner Bros. to sign her to a studio contract on her 18th birthday. She became a big screen leading lady during the 1940s, making her film debut in 1941 in ""They Died with Their Boots On."" Her early notable movies included ""Pride of the Marines"" in 1945 and ""Voice of the Turtle"" -- opposite Ronald Reagan -- in 1947. The 1950s brought Parker to another level of stardom, including three best actress Oscar nominations. The first Academy Award nomination came in 1950 for her portrayal of a terrorized prison inmate in ""Caged."" Parker was nominated again in 1951 for playing Kirk Douglas' wife in ""Detective Story."" A third Oscar bid followed in 1955 for her role as the polio-stricken opera star Marjorie Lawrence in ""Interrupted Melody."" Despite a long list of other distinguished film roles -- including opposite Frank Sinatra in Otto Preminger's ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" (1955) and Clark Gable in ""The King and Four Queens""(1956) -- it was a smaller role that audiences today are most likely to recognize. Parker played the baroness who wanted to send the von Trapp children to a boarding school in the 1965 classic ""The Sound of Music."" Although the stage and screen occupied the first several decades of her half-century acting career, she stayed busy working on television shows in the 1970s onward. She starred in NBC's ""Bracken's World"" in 1969. Her resume included three made-for-TV movies: ABC's ""Once Upon a Spy"" in 1980, NBC's ""Madame X"" in 1981 and TNT's ""Dead on the Money"" in 1991. Parker also acted in a 1986 episode of CBS' ""Murder, She Wrote."" People we lost in 2013 .","Eleanor Parker was a big screen leading lady during the 1940s .

"(CNN) -- Of the eight ""Harry Potter"" movies Daniel Radcliffe made, there's one in particular that sets his teeth on edge. The 25-year-old actor, who portrayed J.K. Rowling's adolescent wizard hero for 10 years starting at age 11, admits to the Daily Mail that it pains him to watch 2009's ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" ""I'm just not very good in it,"" Radcliffe bluntly told the UK publication. ""I hate it. My acting is very one-note and I can see I got complacent, and what I was trying to do just didn't come across."" It's not that Radcliffe is ungrateful for the experience. On the contrary, he calls the opportunity to play the globally adored character ""an incredible blessing, because it gave me this opportunity to start a fantastic career."" But Radcliffe was still getting started as an actor when he was cast in 2001's first ""Potter"" film, meaning the franchise also holds ""the moments I'm not as proud of,"" Radcliffe said. ""Mistakes other actors get to make in rehearsal rooms or at drama school are all on film for everyone to see."" Though admittedly self-critical, there is one ""Potter"" flick that Radcliffe is happy with: ""My best film is the fifth one,"" he tells the Daily Mail of 2007's ""Order of the Phoenix,"" ""because I can see a progression."" As he's taken on more complex and varied roles in an effort to leave Potter behind, Radcliffe has become more confident in his talent. In August, he stars in the romantic dramedy ""What If,"" playing a character that's ""someone most like myself,"" he told the Daily Mail. ""I'm definitely the geeky guy who wants to be in a relationship,"" he said. ""And it was a big thing for me to do a modern-day romance. There was no point in this film where I had to get covered in blood or cry over the body of someone or pull someone out of a muddy bog.""

"(CNN) -- The man now synonymous with hunting bad guys had no intention of a career catching fugitives. John Walsh was a hotel developer in south Florida, living a seemingly idyllic life with his wife and son, when a horrific tragedy changed his life -- and the lives of thousands of strangers. Here are five things to know about the host of CNN's The Hunt with John Walsh: . 1. His son was kidnapped and killed . Walsh's life unraveled in 1981 when his 6-year-old son, Adam, was abducted from a mall near their home in Hollywood, Florida. Two weeks after Adam's disappearance, his severed head was discovered in a canal 120 miles away from the mall. The devastation led Walsh to dedicate himself to catching fugitives and seeking justice for crime victims. 2. Helping nab the bad guys is his mission . For more than a decade, Walsh was known as the host of America's Most Wanted -- a groundbreaking show that put fugitives' profiles in the national spotlight. The FBI credits America's Most Wanted for leading to the capture of 17 of the fugitives who have appeared on the agency's 10 Most Wanted list. Walsh says 1,200 suspects have been caught as a result of the show. What was one of his best gets? Walsh says he accomplished in three days what the FBI couldn't do in 18 years: finding and capturing murderer John List, who killed his wife and three children. 3. He's a co-founder of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children . Before Adam Walsh's kidnapping and death, there was no national database on missing children. Law enforcement officers could enter information on stolen cars, stolen guns and stolen jewelry -- but there was no central place to keep information on missing children. So John Walsh and his wife Reve pushed Congress to pass the Missing Children Act, which led to the creation of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. According to its website, the center has helped law enforcement find more than 196,000 missing children since it was founded in 1984. ""Our recovery rate for missing children has grown from 62 percent in 1990 to 97 percent today,"" the center says. The site isn't just for law enforcement officers and missing children's families. At least one young woman discovered she was abducted as a newborn by using the database. Carlina White, now 27, knew something was amiss when the woman who claimed to be her mother didn't resemble her and couldn't provide her birth certificate. So she logged onto the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and found what turned out to be her baby picture -- eventually solving her own kidnapping. After reading about White's case, a Philadelphia man who was adopted from an orphanage also searched the database and found a baby photo of himself. His father had reported him missing three decades earlier. 4. Elizabeth Smart's family counts Walsh among her rescuers . After her abduction at age 14, Elizabeth Smart was held captive for nine months. She was starved, threatened, tortured and raped on a daily basis. While she was missing and her family searched for answers, her father Ed Smart turned to Walsh. ""He said, 'Be straight with me. Tell me what the odds are. You're the one guy who can tell me the truth,'"" Walsh told CNN in 2010. ""And I said, 'You know what Ed, 99% of the cases I do have a very unhappy ending. You're lucky to find the remains, if you do.' "" But Walsh put a photo of Elizabeth's suspected kidnapper on America's Most Wanted. Days after watching the show, a woman spotted the suspect in suburban Salt Lake City. 5. Walsh also has a connection to the Ariel Castro case . For roughly a decade, Ariel Castro kept three young women captive in his Ohio home, abusing and raping his victims in what became known as the ""house of horrors."" Walsh profiled two of the missing women -- Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus and Amanda Berry -- several times on America's Most Wanted. In a bizarre twist, it was Castro's daughter Arlene who appeared on the show to appeal for help in finding her friend DeJesus -- unaware that her father was actually hiding and abusing DeJesus in his home.","John Walsh started a career in victim advocacy after his son was abducted and killed .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The pervasive smoke spewing from the junk heap at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq is causing many returning troops to be concerned about the effects on their long-term health. The U.S. military burns waste -- including medical waste -- in pits near an Air Force base in Iraq. For four years, the burn pit was a festering dump, spewing acrid smoke over the base, including housing and the hospital. Until three incinerators were installed, the smelly pit was the only place to dispose of trash, including plastics, food and medical waste. ""At the peak, before they went to use the real industrial incinerators, it was about 500,000 pounds a day of stuff,"" according to a transcript of an April 2008 presentation by Dr. Bill Halperin, who heads the Occupational and Environmental Health Subcommittee at the Defense Health Board. ""The way it was burned was by putting jet fuel on it."" A lawsuit filed against the burn pit operators by a contractor alleges the burn pit also contained body parts.  Watch burn pits spew black smoke » . ""Wild dogs in the area raided the burn pit and carried off human remains. The wild dogs could be seen roaming the base with body parts in their mouths,"" says the lawsuit filed in Texas federal court. Aside from Balad, there are similar pits at bases elsewhere in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some still have no incinerators. 'Iraqi crud' Many of the soldiers who went through Balad since the beginning of the war had become used to ""Iraqi crud,"" as they dubbed the symptom. ""I had a chronic cough, irritation, shortness of breath,"" said Dr. Chris Coppola, an Air Force surgeon who worked on base in 2005 and again in 2007, ""I was coughing up phlegm, sometimes black stuff and dust."" While Coppola said he didn't work in the burn pit, he knew the medical waste was going there. ""In 2005, our hospital waste wasn't segregated,"" he said. ""Our trash went out the door and went into the burn pit."" By the time Coppola returned for his next tour, the hospital did separate its medical waste for disposal elsewhere, he said. Coppola said that when he worked at the base hospital, the emergency room had frequent visits for ""respiratory complaints, complaining of the coughing and breathing issues."" Since he's been back from Iraq, Coppola said he feels ""very healthy."" But other soldiers said they cannot shake the symptoms and they suspect the burn pit smoke is the cause. Dennis Gogel was stationed in Balad twice between 2004 and 2006. He said he was in housing just a few hundred yards from the pit and would often jog past the pit. The 29-year old Gogel said that in the last two years he's had upper respiratory infections, skin irritation and he's lost 60 pounds since deployment. ""I have blotchy spots on my face. I was treated for psoriasis, but it won't go way,"" he said. Gogel said his doctors do not know what caused the problems. ""You expect when you get to a new environment you would feel the effect, but it should get out of the system,"" he said. Gogel said it has affected his fitness, too. ""I used to run two miles in 10 minutes. I am up to 17,"" he said. Gogel has recently joined a class action lawsuit against the company contracted to handle waste disposal. Just months after returning home from his first tour in Iraq in 2006, Maj. Kevin Wilkins developed headaches, but did not see a doctor. Soon after his second Iraq tour in 2007, Wilkins -- a registered nurse in the Air Force reserve -- died of an advanced brain tumor. He was 51. His widow, Jill, suspects the burn pit at Balad. While the cause of his brain tumor is not known, Jill Wilkins was told by doctors who worked with her husband at a Florida emergency room that exposure to chemicals like those that come from burning trash is a potential risk. ""Kevin was in perfect health before he went to Iraq,"" Wilkins said. ""He's always been in good health, a healthy eater, exercises on a regular basis. There was not one thing wrong with him when he went to Iraq."" Wilkins is trying to show the cause was service related so she can get access to her husband's pension, medical insurance and other benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

One reason many soldiers suspect the burn pit is a widely circulated 2006 memo in which an environmental engineer cited a still-classified study labeling the pit ""the worst environmental site I have personally visited."" The memo, written by Lt. Col Darrin Curtis, a bioenvironmental engineering flight commander, concluded ""there is an acute health hazard for individuals."" ""There is also the possibility for chronic health hazards associated with the smoke,"" Curtis said. The memo is co-signed by Lt. Col James Elliott, chief, Aeromedical Services, who wrote that he concurred with Curtis' memo. ""In my professional opinion, the known carcinogens and respiratory sensitizers released into the atmosphere by the burn pit present both an acute and a chronic health hazard to our troops and the local populations,"" Elliott said. More alarm was raised in the military community when the initial draft of results from a 2007 study was released with a math error, overstating the dioxin levels tested by 1,000 times. The report was circulated by the military's U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine ""in the interest of transparency and the fact that they needed this information very quickly in order to answer service members' concerns,"" said Craig Postlewaite of the force readiness and health assurance office at the Department of Defense. But Postlewaite said the error has been corrected and the data re-analyzed. A new test and report will be out soon. The military said smoke from the pit exposed troops to toxic emissions, including low levels of cancer-causing dioxins. But its tests indicate there is no long-term danger, officials said. ""The data indicate that there are no substances above a health threshold that should generate any long-term health risks, including cancer,"" Postlewaite said. At the Pentagon's Force Health Protection Directorate, officials analyzed more than 160 air samples and concluded, in a soon to be released report, that the only risk is of temporary respiratory distress, nothing that poses a long-term threat. ""We have looked at respiratory health complaints for people that have been assigned to Balad. These complaints, by and large, are temporary in nature, most of them involve eye irritation, irritation of the upper respiratory passages, possibly a cough,"" Postlewaite  said. ""We know just right here in the United States for people that are around those kinds of conditions, like firemen, this is not unusual. But we feel that the data support the fact that these all should be temporary in nature."" A review of the findings by the military's advisory group of medical scientists and doctors concurred with the report's conclusions. However, in the general findings, the report questioned whether the conclusions would hold ""when more thorough analysis is conducted."" But a spokeswoman for the military said the final report, expected this week, will find the testing conducted was sufficient and conclusive. The reviewing panel also expressed concerns about how pervasive the burn pits were, according to a meeting transcript of the advisory group. ""It seems like there may be something systematic going on here in terms of waste disposal techniques going on in the [war] theater,"" notes Dr. Mark Brown, director of Environmental Agents Services at the Department of Veterans Affairs. ""You couldn't get away with this kind of waste disposal here in the United States. Pits still in use . The concern about the pits was first reported in the Military Times. Upon seeing that article, Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin, wrote to Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, to express his concern about the smoke's effect on troops. Petraeus responded citing the military findings, but said burn pits are necessary. ""There is and will continue to be a need for burn pits during contingency operations,"" Petraeus wrote back to Feingold in a letter provided to CNN. Five years into the Iraq war, many bases still do not have incinerators. There are 17 solid waste incinerators, two hazardous waste incinerators and 24 medical waste incinerators operational in Iraq, according to the military. Another 23 are under construction with some not scheduled to be completed until the end of 2009. In Afghanistan, where the United States has been fighting since 2001, there are no incinerators. ""Our military leaders in Afghanistan are in the process of designing treatment/disposal facilities for solid waste,"" Petraeus wrote to Feingold. Feingold said he awaits the latest report. ""I remain concerned that service members may become sick as a result of exposure to fumes at Balad Air Base and potentially other bases in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" Feingold said. ""Service members who serve at the base for more than a year could still be in jeopardy as a result of exposure to the fumes."" CNN's Mike Mount and Jamie McIntyre contributed to this report.","Troops worry smoke from waste burn pits carries toxins .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has claimed responsibility for recent suicide bombings in the capital that killed nearly two dozen people, according to SITE Intelligence, which monitors terrorist groups. ISIS identified the suicide bombers who struck Baghdad on Sunday and Monday as Libyan and Lebanese, SITE reported, citing a website linked to the terror group. One of the bombings occurred Sunday in the Washash district of Baghdad, when a suicide bomber struck a coffee shop, killing at least a dozen people, security officials told CNN. The second occurred Monday in the Kadhimiya neighborhood, security officials told CNN. A suicide car bomb exploded in heavy traffic at a security checkpoint there, killing at least 10 people and wounding 14, security officials told CNN. The bomb exploded at about 1 p.m. near the checkpoint, which created a sort of bottleneck of traffic. The explosion occurred about 1 kilometer (.6 miles) from the Kadhimiya shrine, which is revered by Shiites. Parliament session put off . Just hours after the caretaker speaker of Iraq's Parliament called on lawmakers to return Sunday to try to form a new government, state-run Iraqiya TV reported it had been postponed for another month. ""I invite the parliamentary blocs in this period to approve the necessary nominations in order to start the parliamentary session and the formation of the government,"" Speaker Mehdi al-Hafez said in a written statement provided to CNN. ""The delay in that will put Iraq's security and its move towards democracy at risk. Also it will increase the suffering of the Iraqi people, and it will encroach on the rights of voters."" Citing sources in Parliament, Iraqiya reported that the session was postponed until August 12 because the political parties have been unable to reach a consensus on who to name to top leadership posts. Those include the speaker, the president and the prime minister. A week ago, Iraq's Parliament postponed its first session, citing a lack of a quorum after 90 of the 328 lawmakers walked out. Al-Baghdadi investigation to be released . Iraq plans Wednesday to release its findings of its investigation into whether a man featured in a video delivering a sermon in Mosul is notorious ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, military spokesman Qassim Atta told reporters. Those findings are expected to include details about al-Baghdadi's movement, Atta said. The video surfaced on social media sites tied to ISIS, the terror group that now calls itself the Islamic State. It shows a man identified as al-Baghdadi conducting Friday prayers at the Great Mosque of al-Nuri. If it is al-Baghdadi, it would be one of the first known appearances of the elusive extremist militant leader to be captured on video. Very few images have been made public of al-Baghdadi. His appearance comes days after ISIS declared him as the leader of its new ""caliphate,"" or Islamic state, extending from Aleppo in northeastern Syria to the Diyala province in Iraq.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Pregnant women infected with the H1N1 virus are more likely to be hospitalized from it and perhaps even more likely to die from it, according to a federal study released Wednesday. A federal study released Wednesday says the H1N1 virus seems to be affecting pregnant women more severely. The authors of the study suggest that pregnant women infected with the virus, commonly known as swine flu, take antiviral drugs to protect themselves and their fetuses. ""If they feel sick, they need to call their health care provider and their health care provider needs to prescribe antivirals promptly,"" said Dr. Denise J. Jamieson, lead author of the study and a medical officer at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some doctors are reluctant to prescribe the drugs to pregnant women because they are concerned about their possible effect on the fetus, but Jamieson urged them to put aside those concerns. ""We know, in this situation, the benefits very likely outweigh the risks, because pregnant women could get pretty darn sick with influenza,"" the obstetrician-gynecologist told CNN. In fact, they could get more than sick. Of the 45 H1N1 deaths reported to the CDC between April 15 and June 16, six (13 percent) were among pregnant women. All of them had been healthy before infection, and all went on to develop viral pneumonia, leading to acute respiratory distress that required them to be placed on ventilators, Jamieson said. She acknowledged that the numbers are small, but said data collected since then are still reason for concern. Of the 266 H1N1 deaths investigated by the CDC to date, 15 (6 percent) were among pregnant women, she said. That's six times the percentage of U.S. women who are pregnant at any given time. In addition, pregnant women infected with H1N1 were four times as likely as sick people in the general population to be hospitalized for it, she said. But the study cautioned that part of that increase may be because of doctors being more likely to hospitalize a pregnant woman than a nonpregnant person with similar symptoms. Still, the apparent disproportionate impact of H1N1 on pregnant women is not surprising, given the body changes that occur during pregnancy, she said. ""As the uterus grows and pushes the diaphragm up, there is less room for the lungs,"" affecting a woman's ability to breathe, she said. Pregnancy's impact goes beyond structural; it affects the body's ability to fight off illness, she said. ""A pregnant woman has to accommodate this foreign body of the growing fetus, so there is an immunological shift that occurs in pregnancy,"" she said. Though it is not clear whether that immunological shift translates into a greater likelihood of contracting the virus, there is no doubt that it can result in more severe illness among pregnant women who are infected with it, she said. ""They are more severely affected, and that is consistent with what we are seeing with this H1N1,"" she said. Still, Jamieson said she is not recommending that pregnant women avoid crowds or take any other precautions that would affect their daily routines. She said she hopes to continue to track what happens to the H1N1-infected pregnant women in the report, though the details have yet to be worked out.","Of 45 H1N1 deaths between April 15-June 16, 13 percent were pregnant women .

"Sandvoort, Guyana (CNN) -- Nine-year old Kayla Hope loves fairy tales, especially ""Cinderella."" ""It's got a lot of rats!"" she giggles, burying her face in her hands. They're her favorite part. Until now, she's never read a book. She would have had to walk two miles to the closest library before. Now she will won't have to make that long trek, because her village in Guyana built a community library. ""It's something that they wanted for so many years, and they just had no idea how to start,"" said Matt Cusimano, a Peace Corps volunteer and a teacher at the primary school in Sandvoort, a village of nearly 200 people. Cusimano has taken on the challenge of creating a library with the villagers. Since starting, he's been working with few resources. Many students are roughly three years behind their expected reading level. ""There's no such thing as literature or fun reads or junior novels or any of those sorts of things,"" Cusimano said. ""They are growing up in an education system of chalk and talk -- where the teacher writes something on the chalkboard and talks about it. They write something on the board (and) the students copy it. There's nothing analytical about it. There's no such thing as differentiated learning."" Cusimano, 25, said it made sense when the school's headmaster approached him with the idea for a communal library. ""Guyana is a performance-based culture, which makes it one of the more appropriate places in this region for a library. ... We are limiting our children's abilities through 'chalk-and-talk' methods of teaching. That's why I was comfortable taking on a library project,"" Cusimano said. With a budget of roughly $5,000, the community agreed to front nearly 30% of the costs. But most villagers, Cusimano said, can barely afford toothpaste. ""They're doing it with donated labor and donated space because they can't afford several thousand U.S. dollars,"" he said. Some villagers contributed by cooking for hungry workers, while others shelved donated books or painted. With a daughter in the primary school, carpenter Korth Leitch gave of his time by becoming the construction lead on the project. ""I was just so happy because it's an opportunity that (came) to her, which never (came) to me,"" Leitch said. By day, Leitch, 33, ventured out to neighboring areas building homes and by night returned to work on the library. ""That is where I'm finding this happiness, grateful pleasure for this library because I know my daughter ... my children (are) going to learn a lot from it. They love books."" Leitch said the Bible was the only book he was exposed to while growing up. Better World Books and the nonprofit Margaret Clemons Foundation donated more than 3,600 books to the library. And with three new computers, villagers are anxious to become computer-literate. ""The (people of the) village never had an opportunity to learn about a computer. They never had it. When you are able to read, you're able to work with a computer. If you don't know how to read, you can't start a computer,"" Leitch said. In addition to learning about computers, many villagers are discovering new interests. Ten-year-old Shamar Benjamin comes to the library every night. He gets lost in the fictional battles of ""Pokemon"" and ""Power Rangers."" He's encountering words he's never seen before. ""It helps me to read better,"" he said. Such opportunities to learn have changed the village of Sandvoort. Kayla, the 9-year-old girl, now has books to fuel her imagination. If you want to donate books for the people of Sandvoort, go to their Facebook page for information or to Better World Books.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Monday that he does not believe Saddam Hussein was involved in the planning or execution of the September 11, 2001, attacks. Former Vice President Dick Cheney says Saddam Hussein ""provided sanctuary ... and resources to terrorists."" He strongly defended the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq, however, arguing that Hussein's previous support for known terrorists was a serious danger after 9/11. Cheney, in an appearance at the National Press Club, also said he is intent on speaking out in defense of the Bush administration's national security record because ""a clear understanding of policies that worked [in protecting the United States] is essential."" ""I do not believe and have never seen any evidence to confirm that [Hussein] was involved in 9/11. We had that reporting for a while, [but] eventually it turned out not to be true,"" Cheney conceded. But Hussein was ""somebody who provided sanctuary and safe harbor and resources to terrorists. ... [It] is, without question, a fact."" Cheney restated his claim that ""there was a relationship between al Qaeda and Iraq that stretched back 10 years. It's not something I made up. ... We know for a fact that Saddam Hussein was a sponsor -- a state sponsor -- of terror. It's not my judgment. That was the judgment of our [intelligence community] and State Department."" The former vice president said in 2004 that the evidence was ""overwhelming"" that al Qaeda had a relationship with Hussein's regime in Iraq, and that media reports suggesting that the commission investigating the 9/11 attacks reached a contradictory conclusion were ""irresponsible."" ""There clearly was a relationship. It's been testified to. The evidence is overwhelming,"" Cheney said at the time. ""It goes back to the early '90s. It involves a whole series of contacts, high-level contacts with Osama bin Laden and Iraqi intelligence officials."" On Monday, though, Cheney identified former CIA Director George Tenet as the ""prime source of information"" on the relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda. Tenet ""testified, if you go back and check the record, in the fall of [2002] before the Senate Intelligence Committee -- in open session -- that there was a relationship,"" Cheney said. Hussein was captured by U.S. forces in Iraq in December 2003. In November 2006, the former Iraqi leader was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death. He was executed the following December. Cheney said on June 17, 2004 that the evidence was ""overwhelming"" that al Qaeda had a relationship with Hussein's regime in Iraq, and said media reports suggesting that the 9/11 commission has reached a contradictory conclusion were ""irresponsible."" Among other things Monday, Cheney also called the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center a ""good facility ... if you are going to be engaged in a world conflict, such as we are, in terms of global war on terrorism. You know, if you don't have a place where you can hold these people, the only other option is to kill them. And we don't operate that way.""  Watch what Cheney has to say about the detention facility » . He reiterated his call for President Obama to declassify documents detailing the results of ""enhanced interrogations"" of high-value detainees. Since Obama has already released memos detailing the interrogation methods, Cheney said, it is important to share the results of those interrogations with the public as well. ""I would not ordinarily be leading the charge to declassify classified information, otherwise they wouldn't call me Darth Vader for nothing,"" Cheney said. But ""once the [Obama] administration released the legal memos that gave the opinions that were used to guide the interrogation program, they'd given away the store. ... I [therefore] thought it was important to have the results that were gained from that interrogation program front and center as well."" On May 14, the CIA rejected the former vice president's request to declassify the documents. CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano, in a written statement, said the two documents are the subject of pending lawsuits and therefore cannot be declassified. Cheney said Monday that the memos previously released also were the subject of ongoing lawsuits. He said Obama can release the additional documents with ""the stroke of a pen."" On May 21, Cheney gave a full-throated defense of the Bush administration's enhanced interrogations of al Qaeda prisoners during an appearance at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. He has said that the interrogations saved the lives of ""thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands."" He called the techniques the Bush administration approved ""legal, essential, justified, successful and the right thing to do.""","Ex-VP backs Bush administration invasion of Iraq, says Hussein supported terror .

"(CNN) -- A strong earthquake struck coastal Chile near the port city of Valparaiso late Monday, causing mudslides and some minor damage, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The 6.7-magnitude quake knocked out some power and phone lines in the region, authorities said. The temblor was felt in the capital city, Santiago, located 69 miles from the epicenter. A CNN en EspaÃ±ol anchor held onto his desk as the quake rattled the studio during a newscast in Huechurba, a suburb of the capital. ""We could feel the ground shaking,"" said journalist Richard Madan. ""It felt like we were standing on a subway track but multiply that by about 200."" Madan, of CNN's Canadian affiliate CTV, is in Santiago as part of the traveling press for Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's visit there. Both he and the Canadian delegation were okay, Madan said. No tsunami warning was issued, according to Chile's Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service, and a preventive evacuation for the area has been lifted. A 72-year-old man died of a heart attack during the evacuation, according to regional Mayor Raul Celis. The same part of the country was hit with an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in February 2010, killing hundreds of people. Chile is on the so-called ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines circling the Pacific Basic that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

"Lilongwe, Malawi (CNN) -- Malawi may not pull in the same number of tourists as its safari-toting neighbors. But that doesn't make the country any less special. Nicknamed the ""Warm heart of Africa"" for its friendly locals and temperate weather, Malawi has a wealth of offerings that make it an attractive travel destination in its own right. Flames of fire . Malawi means ""flames of fire"" in the local language -- a term that partly refers to the country's stunning sunsets. ""Describing a sunset is like asking you to describe humanity, because it comes in so many forms,"" says Howard Massey-Hicks, owner of local yacht-rental company Danforth Yachting. ""One day you can look at it, and it seems sad. The next day, it's happy. The next day, intense. The next day, it's slow. A lot of the time, it's very romantic,"" he adds. Malawi's many natural wonders -- from the azure waters of Monkey Bay to the dramatic rock formations of Mulanje Massif -- are made more picturesque when bathed crimson with the help of the setting sun. One thing's for sure: your travel pics will look amazing. Lake Malawi . Though Malawi is landlocked, its namesake lake makes up more than three-quarters of the country's eastern border. At nearly 30,000 square kilometers, Lake Malawi is the third largest lake in Africa, and the ninth biggest in the world. A UNESCO World Heritage site, it is also home to over 1,000 species of fish -- 99% of them unique to the region. ""It's like an evolutionist's holy grail, because a lot of the species have sort of evolved over the years from a single species into various different sub-species,"" says Massey-Hicks. He notes that the lake makes for an incredibly popular enclave with scuba divers and snorkelers. ""There's a dive site just north of here called Zimbawe Rock, and it's an incredible dive. You can dive there 50 times and not do the same dive twice,"" he says. Catching the 'big five' Malawi only recently got in the game of introducing visitors to the ""big five"" (the Majete Wildlife Reserve became the first safari park in 2012 after a nine-year and $2.5 million drive to restock the park with big game). While it has yet to draw the level of numbers seen in nearby Zambia and Tanzania, this just makes for a more tranquil safari experience. ""We have over 2,000 hippos just in this area and 360 species of birds,"" says Danger Chipino, a wilderness safari guide at Liwonde National Park. The park, a protected area, also houses more than 500 elephants. Paging Dr. Livingstone . One of Malawi's great claims to fame is its connection to Scottish explorer David Livingstone, who in the mid-1800s led the legendary Zambezi Expedition through the area. Today, visitors can follow in his footsteps. ""The Shire River is very special to Dr. Livingstone's history. When we read the histories, we find he sailed through this river to Lake Malawi,"" says Chipino. Visitors curious about Livingstone's history can also visit the Livingstonia Mission -- founded by one of the doctor's disciples. The site offers beautiful views of Lake Malawi, and is perched near a scenic eco-lodge. Living La Vita Rural . Compared to other, similarly scenic travel destinations, Malawi has remained relatively undeveloped. Of the 15 million people that call the country home, 85% live in rural areas. In many of Malawi's more isolated villages, life assumes a more traditional track. Many villagers live in huts constructed from brick, mud and grass, and agriculture makes up much of the day-to-day. In addition to growing tobacco, tea, coffee and sugar, Malawians also grow maize, which makes up a large part of their diet. It is also the main ingredient in entoba, or sweet beer. ""In the village, it's expensive to buy Coke, so instead we make our own here,"" explains Enoch Chidothi, leader of Ligangwa Village. ""It's sweet, just like soda.""","Malawi means ""flames of fire"" in the local language .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Superhero creator Stan Lee finally gets a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame on Tuesday, a week after his 88th birthday. Lee jokingly asked why he had to wait 50 years after the first star was awarded and 70 years after his comic book career began. ""I'll talk to somebody about that,"" Lee told CNN. Lee's characters include Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, X-Men, The Fantastic Four, Iron Man, Daredevil, The Avengers, Silver Surfer and Dr. Strange. ""I'm pretty proud of the fact that some of the stories I wrote so many years ago are still being read and hopefully enjoyed by the public and people are making motion pictures based on them, and television series and even a Broadway show,"" Lee said. Lee pays attention to everything, he said, including last month's accident that injured an actor in the Spider-Man Broadway show. ""Not a sparrow falls but that I notice,"" he said. His favorite creation is Spider-Man ""because he's the most popular and he's known and loved worldwide,"" he said. ""But I really loved them all and whichever one I was writing at the moment, that was my favorite."" As for his characters, he said he ""just dreamed them up,"" and they don't have roots in his childhood. ""As a child, I didn't really know anybody who shot webs or crawled on buildings or wore suits of armor and flew or anything like that,"" he said. ""I just imagined, and there they were."" The long life and broad success of his comic book characters were unexpected, he said. ""We just hoped that the books would sell and we would continue to get our salary and be able to pay our rent."" How much longer they live depends on how producers and writers treat them in the future, he said. ""If people take the care with them that they have taken up to now, there's no reason why these things couldn't last as long as any legendary fictional characters,"" Lee said. The movies based on Lee's comic books ""have done so much for the characters"" by giving them glamour and prestige, he said. ""When they were in comic books, they were still read all over the world and pretty well-known all over the world, but they didn't have, you might say, the respect that they have now because of movies,"" he said. Lee spends time these days also working on the Stan Lee Foundation, a nonprofit group that concentrates on educating children, he said. ""To me, education is one of the most important things in the world,"" Lee said. ""Somebody who isn't educated, it's like running in a race with one leg tied behind them."" He's still writing new stories for his POW! Entertainment company. ""To me, the most important thing in the world is to keep busy, and I'm happy to say I'm lucky enough to still be busy,"" he said. Lee's Hollywood star, to be dedicated Tuesday morning, will be the 2,428th on the Walk of Fame.","Stan Lee created Spider-Man, The Fantastic Four, X-Men, Iron Man .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of protestors took to the streets in Vietnam Sunday as territorial disputes escalated tensions between the communist state and its neighbor China. A rally which drew around a thousand protesters in Hanoi focused local ire on the Chinese embassy, while smaller protests in Danang and Ho Chi Minh City echoed the anti-Chinese sentiment emanating from the political capital. The demonstrations were sparked by what Vietnam says were intimidatory tactics involving China's deployment of a deep-sea drilling platform in disputed waters in the South China Sea. Vietnamese officials say Chinese military and civilian ships have been harassing their vessels near the Paracel Islands -- which are controlled by Beijing but claimed by Hanoi -- since the previous Sunday, even accusing the Chinese of repeatedly ramming into them and shooting water cannon. ""The Xisha (Paracel) Islands are China's inherent territory,"" Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a briefing Monday. ""The Chinese company's normal operations fall within China's sovereignty. China ... has required the Vietnamese side to take all necessary measures to protect the safety and lawful rights of Chinese citizens and institutions in Vietnam."" While public protests are rare in Vietnam, where the one-party system is wary of public gatherings, there have been several anti-Chinese protests in recent years. That this weekend's actions went ahead unobstructed by police is seen as a sign that the government tacitly approves of the protests. ASEAN backdrop . The anti-Chinese demonstrations, which were boisterous but free of injury or other incident, came as the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) met in neighboring Myanmar. The country's president, Thein Sein, said ""regional and global issues of great concern to ASEAN will be extensively discussed among ourselves,"" during opening remarks. He did not explicitly refer to the dispute, nor the protests that it had spawned. The summit's Foreign Ministerial Meeting sought to present a united front, releasing a statement that called on regional disputes to be resolved peacefully. ""The ASEAN Foreign Ministerial Meeting focused on (the) South China Sea issue in which it sought an approval to address the territorial dispute peacefully and reasonably,"" Myanmar Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin told journalists. ""In this regard, the meeting released the statement. All ASEAN foreign ministers expressed their deep concern about South China Sea."" Disputes on multiple fronts . China continues to exert its territorial dominance across the South China Sea, with recent disputes with its neighbors causing tension in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Japan. Last week Chinese fishing boat and its 11 crew members were apprehended by Philippine authorities near the Spratly Islands, another disputed region in the South China Sea. Philippine officials say the boat was carrying a large number of endangered species and they seized the boat ""to uphold Philippine sovereign rights"" in the disputed waters. ""It's possible that an armed clash could occur, but not a full-fledged war. The situation with Vietnam is serious -- more serious than the situation with the Philippines,"" said M. Taylor Fravel, Associate Professor of Political Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). ""China has controlled the northern half of the Paracel Islands since the 1950s and the southern half since 1974. Unlike the Spratly Islands, China maintains that no dispute exists over the Paracels. So we can see that China believes that its claim there is quite strong,"" he added. Exclusion zone . Relations between China and Vietnam soured on Friday, when a Chinese platform began drilling for oil near the Paracel Islands. The oil rig, Haiyang Shiyou 981, is owned by state gas and oil company CNOOC. The Maritime Safety Administration of China (MSAC) declared a three-mile exclusion zone around the rig, while military vessels have been deployed to patrol the area. ""At present, the number of escorting ships of China has reached 60, including military ships,"" Tran Duy Hai, Vice Chair of Vietnam's National Boundary Commission, said in a statement Wednesday. ""These vessels have intentionally hit and collided with Vietnamese law enforcement ships, including those of the Maritime Police and Fisheries Control, causing damage in human and property."" (sic) China maintains that its current drilling activities are legitimate and blame the Vietnamese for provoking conflict. ""The drilling activities of this rig are within China's territorial waters. The harassment by the Vietnamese side is in violation of China's sovereign rights,"" said Hua Chunying, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She did not confirm the boat collisions. According to CNOOC, a third of China's oil and gas resources are under the South China Sea, most of which it claims as its own, refuting rival claims from Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei. 'Undermines peace' In Washington, U.S. State Department Spokesperson Jen Psaki condemned China's drilling near the Paracels. ""This unilateral action appears to be part of a broader pattern of Chinese behavior to advance its claims over disputed territory in a manner that undermines peace and stability in the region,"" said Psaki. China's Hua hit back saying that Chinese drilling activities ""have nothing to do with Vietnam, let alone the U.S."" Meanwhile, the Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs said it will deal with the detained fishermen ""in a just, humane and expeditious manner."" Philippines police claimed the fishing boat was loaded with 350 endangered turtles when it was seized near an area it controls called Half Moon Shoal. China urged Manila to ""stop taking further provocative actions."" ""It is possible that the Philippines may have been emboldened by the recent defense agreement reached with the United States. China and the Philippines are jostling for control of the waters in the area where the arrest occurred,"" said MIT's Fravel. The arrests follow U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to the Philippines earlier this week, kicking off the annual military drills held jointly by U.S. and Filipino forces. During the trip, the U.S. and Philippines signed the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, a 10-year security pact that gives the U.S. more military access in the region.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Metallica's Lars Ulrich loves Black Sabbath and Deep Purple -- and so does his 10-year-old son. Actor Rodger Corser plays ""Guitar Hero"" at an April event in Australia. The game has revived interest in rock music. Ulrich may have played songs from those old rock bands around the house on his stereo, but he gives credit for his son's excitement to another source: video games. Myles Ulrich is a fan of games such as ""Guitar Hero"" and ""Rock Band,"" which have spawned a comeback for rock music. ""It's a cool generational thing to share that with your kids,"" said Ulrich, the drummer for the multi-platinum quartet. ""My [son's] favorite bands are ... the same bands that are my favorite bands -- the bands I grew up on."" A few years ago, rock music was struggling on the charts. With hip-hop and teen pop ruling, rock was finding it hard to break through with new music -- or sell more of the old. But ""Guitar Hero"" and ""Rock Band"" have prompted kids born in the '90s to discover artists from the '70s and '80s such as Aerosmith, Twisted Sister and Pat Benatar. The games' amazing popularity -- last year, the two brought in more than $935 million in revenue, according to the NPD Group market research company -- has helped create success in other markets, according to observers.  Watch Ulrich and others praise the games on ""American Morning"" » . Geoff Mayfield, senior analyst and director of charts for Billboard magazine, said he sees a direct cause-and-effect for some of the artists who have licensed their songs to ""Guitar Hero."" ""A few weeks ago, when the game featuring Aerosmith ['Guitar Hero: Aerosmith'] came out, there was more than a 40 percent increase in their catalog sales. I expect you'll see that again when Metallica gets the same kind of treatment in a few weeks,"" Mayfield said. iReport.com: Do you shred on ""Guitar Hero?"" Once wary of downloading, Metallica has changed its tune with its upcoming album. ""When 'Death Magnetic' comes out in September, you can actually download the new album the same day it comes out, and play it on your 'Guitar Hero III,' "" Ulrich said -- fully aware of the irony, given his band's past litigation with the Internet music file-sharing service Napster. Even in an uncertain economy, the video games also have increased interest in guitars, according to the nationwide Guitar Center chain. And bars holding ""Guitar Hero"" nights also have enjoyed a boost in business: Big Wangs sports tavern in Hollywood, California, reports a 25 percent to 35 percent increase in sales. The results have played out at such places as Roosevelt High School in Los Angeles, where most teens have grown up on a steady diet of hip-hop and R&B. Recently, heavy metal blared from the school's darkened auditorium as it sponsored a three-day ""Guitar Hero Face-Off."" Spotlights illuminated the competitors, and an audience full of enthusiasts screamed wildly at the end of each song. It was enough to make 16-year-old finalist George Gomez nervous. ""You got fans cheering you on,"" he marveled shyly. For Mayfield, the marriage of music and video games makes perfect sense, especially for an ailing record industry that's been having trouble selling CDs. ""This is a chance for something that's been a competition to actually be an ally, if you will,"" he said. Mayfield has never played ""Guitar Hero"" or ""Rock Band,"" but he said he understands the irresistible appeal of kids and adults indulging in some harmless headbanging -- albeit with toy instruments. ""If you've ever played air guitar, more than likely, you weren't doing it to a Michael Jackson song. You were doing it to an Aerosmith song,"" he said.

"(Travel + Leisure) -- It's 10:45 a.m. on a cloudy day, and the crew of Druk Air flight KB205 is preparing to land at their home airport of Paro, Bhutan. Suddenly, ominous warnings start blaring, alerting them that their flight angle is all wrong and their rate of descent is far too fast. They fly a series of unconventional right-and-left banks through a narrow channel of hillsides before centering the swaying jet and putting it on the tarmac. An excess of government buildings and restricted airspace make it challenging to land at Washington's Reagan National Airport. An emergency situation? Not quite. In fact, this is a completely normal -- however nail-biting -- landing at Paro Airport, set 7,300 feet above sea level. Because of the airport's tightly cropped valley, surrounded by 16,000-foot-high serrated Himalayan peaks, this drama replays itself on every flight. There's a sobering saying among pilots: ""Any landing you can walk away from is a good landing."" And it's not until you fly into places like Paro, or Toncontìn Airport in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, that the adage starts to make sense. Both are surrounded by mountains, and Toncontìn has one of the world's shortest international runways; each requires a series of hard last-minute banks. It's no wonder both give even the most seasoned pilots -- not to mention their passengers -- the sweats. While Bhutan is the most extreme example -- only eight pilots in the world are qualified to fly into Paro -- a number of the world's airports, from St. Maarten in the Caribbean to Madeira Airport in Funchal, can present challenges for pilots. ""A lot of these airports require additional training and route familiarization because they're so crazy,"" says one commercial pilot who flies international routes. Slideshow: Travel + Leisure's list of the scariest runways . According to aviation experts, mitigating factors range from the truncated length of runways to unique atmospheric and meteorological conditions, dramatic geographical settings, heavy air traffic, or a combination thereof. ""Sometimes it's just the way the airport is laid out that makes it a pain,"" says the pilot, referring to whether an airport is situated askew. One such tricky spot: Reagan National Airport, in Washington, D.C. That's not because of strange Potomac River winds or the pressure of being watched by statues of past presidents. It's the excess of government buildings and restricted airspace that makes setting down here like threading a needle with a 200-ton hunk of metal. In fact, cities are often tough: for years (73, to be exact), the honor of the world's most harrowing airport was reserved for Hong Kong's Kai Tak, whose single runway was jammed in between Victoria Harbor and densely populated Kowloon. Pilots had to battle crosswinds and fly a complicated curved approach, all while dodging mountains and high-rises. Kai Tak was shuttered in 1998 and replaced by a modern mega-port located on a reclaimed island out in the South China Sea. But many locales don't have that luxury, and continue to operate with their existing facilities, many of which include palm sweat-inducing approaches and photo-worthy opportunities. Travel + Leisure.com: Scariest runways . And it's not always the landing that's the stuff of lore. Matekane Air Strip, in the tiny African kingdom of Lesotho, features a stunted 1,312-foot-long runway perched at the edge of a couloir that sits at 7,550 feet. According to celebrated bush pilot Tom Claytor, depending on the wind during takeoff, it's entirely possible for the aircraft not to be airborne by the end of the airstrip. ""Instead,"" he says, ""you shoot off the end of the airstrip, then drop down the 2,000-foot cliff face until you start flying."" It's enough to make you take the train.

"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN)  -- He was to demonstrating his right to bear arms -- and he wanted you to know it. A man is shown legally carrying a rifle at a protest against President Obama on Monday in Phoenix, Arizona. Video of the unidentified man toting an assault rifle outside President Obama's speech to veterans Monday was aired all over the country, causing a buzz about weapons popping up -- legally -- around recent presidential events. The protester, who refused to give his name, was interviewed by a man carrying a microphone and said, ""I am almost always armed."" The interview, done by Libertarian radio talk show host Ernest Hancock, was staged. ""Absolutely,"" Hancock told CNN's Rick Sanchez Tuesday. ""You guys are so easy. What we wanted to do was make sure that people around the country knew that law enforcement in Phoenix, Arizona, protects our rights.""  Watch the rifle being legally carried at rally » . The Phoenix-based host of ""Declare Your Independence with Ernest Hancock"" identified the bespectacled man with the AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle as ""Chris,"" saying he's known him for two years as part of a younger generation of Libertarians. ""We are up against a tyrannical government that will rob the next generation as long as they can get away with it,"" Hancock said. Chris ""understands that his generation is going to be plundered until there is nothing left to plunder,"" he added. And while Hancock admitted the interview was staged, he insisted the protester's message was not. ""I come from another state where 'open carry' is legal, but no one does it, so the police don't really know about it and they harass people, arrest people falsely,"" the protester identified as Chris told Hancock in an interview aired by CNN affiliate KNXV. ""I think that people need to get out and do it more so that they get kind of conditioned to it."" Video from KNXV shows the man standing with other protesters, with the rifle slung over his right shoulder, a handgun in a holster on his left hip, and a bullet clip in his back pocket. The same protester told KNXV separately, ""I'm exercising my rights as an American in Arizona."" The protester was among a dozen other demonstrators carrying unconcealed guns outside the Obama event. Hancock, who said he was packing a 9-millimeter Beretta pistol, added that Phoenix police had known about the group's intent to protest while carrying guns. ""They are the ones standing a few feet away from us"" at Monday's protest, Hancock said. ""Oftentimes, the citizenry are better armed than law enforcement -- they need us on their side."" Arizona law has nothing in the books regulating assault rifles, and only requires permits for carrying concealed weapons. So despite the man's proximity to the president, there were no charges or arrests to be made, according to Phoenix police. Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Andy Hill on Monday said officers explained the law to some people who were upset about the presence of weapons at the protest. Hill told CNN on Tuesday that the widely broadcast protest was no different than any other for law enforcement, in that investigators with the ""community response unit"" had communicated with the group ahead of time. ""We try to have as much open communication as possible so we know what to expect and how to prepare,"" he said, adding that the police department relayed information about Monday's to federal law enforcement. He added that because of Arizona's open carry law, it's not uncommon for protesters to pack heat at demonstrations. Gun-toting protesters have demonstrated around the president before. Last week, a man protesting outside Obama's town hall meeting in New Hampshire had a gun strapped to his thigh. That state also doesn't require a license for open carry. U.S. Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan acknowledged the incidents in New Hampshire and Arizona, but said he was not aware of any other recent events where protesters attended with open weapons. He said there was no indication that anyone had organized the incidents. Asked whether the individuals carrying weapons jeopardized the safety of the president, Donovan said, ""Of course not."" The individuals would never have gotten close to the president, regardless of any state laws on openly carrying weapons, he said. A venue is considered a federal site when the Secret Service is protecting the president, and weapons are not allowed on a federal site, he said. iReport.com: Gun rights and health care . In both instances, the men carrying weapons were outside the venues where Obama was speaking. ""We pay attention to this obviously ... to someone with a firearm when they open carry even when they are within state law,"" Donovan said. ""We work with our law enforcement counterparts to make sure laws and regulations in their states are enforced.""

"(CNN) -- When President Obama spoke to the nation about military action in Iraq, it was hard to directly catch his eye. He moved side to side, reading the prompter, as he often does, but hardly ever facing the camera directly. It was a ""My Fellow Americans"" moment, only he didn't really look us in the eye. Maybe it's because he was saying something he really never wanted to say: that he had ordered airstrikes in Iraq. No one should argue with the decision. Part of it was to protect American personnel. It was to prevent genocide on a faraway mountaintop and drop food and water to the thousands stranded and cornered. It was to tell the world clearly that this won't be tolerated by the United States. And for that, the President should be applauded. But it was obvious, as the President's head weaved side-to-side, that there was much more baggage weighing on this decision. Eight paragraphs into the speech, the President felt the need to explain to the public that this isn't a slippery slope to another lengthy involvement. ""I ran for office in part to end our war in Iraq,"" he said. ""As commander in chief, I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq."" It was as if he was reassuring himself as much as the American public. Time and time again, this President has been drawn into decisions that threaten to undermine his chief foreign policy narrative: killing Osama Bin Laden, ending two unpopular wars. When the Islamic radicals were gaining strength in early summer, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham described the President as ""stubborn-headed, delusional, detached."" He argued at that time that the President should ""put air power into the game."" He went to the White House and told the President as much. But the President waited. The U.S. wanted a new Iraqi government in place -- and hopefully Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki gone -- before moving on ISIS. So he sent some noncombat special forces troops to get some eyes on the situation on the ground, but declined to use American air power at that time. But now he's up against the wall, and he's acting, which is the right thing to do. Still, no matter how limited -- and no matter how commendable -- this decision, the obvious questions now arise: Even though this mission is carefully, and narrowly, defined, what happens if the unexpected happens and the mission escalates? Would the U.S. turn away? Would we arm moderates, as we have refused to do elsewhere? And speaking of Syria, how does this decision apply there -- if at all? Some argue that the problem in Syria has gotten so far past the point where a carefully targeted use of air power would have any impact. Then the question becomes: How does the United States make its humanitarian and moral decisions? In a larger sense, what are the guidelines that govern these difficult foreign policy decisions? The President ought to talk some more to the American people about that part of his thinking. We already know his obvious rules of the game that now govern military involvement: no boots on the ground, no long-term commitments, just humanitarian efforts. The pillar for his foreign policy seems to be: Stay out of trouble. But the natural question to then ask is whether this credo doesn't just generate more trouble over time. At this point, it's hard to know. We all agree that not many of us want to be ""dragged,"" as the President put it, into fighting another war in Iraq. We all understand the President's sense about the limits of American involvement in military conflict. So we are all clear on what he won't do. We're still not sure about what he will do -- and maybe neither is he.","Gloria Borger: President Obama never wanted to order more action in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Was Karl Rove's assault on Hillary Clinton's brain a political masterstroke that will make her presidential campaign more difficult? Or a ham-fisted attack that will contribute to the persistent unpopularity of the Republican Party? The answer, to many a Republican's regret, is both. Whatever victory Republicans digest from this blow will leave a bitter taste. Hillary Clinton hasn't yet been president, though it feels like she is running for reelection. That is part of Mrs. Clinton's problem. The constant division her name invites has been with us now for decades. Who wants to continue those battles? Like Vietnam or Watergate, at times it doesn't matter which side of the Clinton conflict we take. We are exhausted by the relentless requirement that we engage them. Age and health are always issues in major political races, and fairly so, but they are usually aired gracelessly. I served my apprenticeship in politics working for mad-genius GOP pollster and strategist Arthur Finkelstein. While he was mapping the campaign for brassy, upstart Al D'Amato, Arthur came up with a unique strategy to do what was thought impossible: defeat in a primary an untouchable Republican icon -- legendary New York Sen. Jacob Javits. Javits, a liberal Republican, was out of step with Barry Goldwater's GOP but Republican voters had too much respect for the old senator to replace him. A near octogenarian, Javits had slowed a step and was beginning to slur his speech, presenting the initial symptoms of ALS, which would fell him within the decade. Finkelstein's strategy? Give conservative GOP primary voters permission to say publicly what only a few whispered privately -- and Arthur was none too subtle. Finkelstein released an attack ad that wrinkled the noses of New York's political elite. Its purpose being impropriety, it ended with the memorable line, ""And now, at age 76 and in failing health, he wants six more years."" New York's left-leaning upper-crust gasped, but Finkelstein didn't stop there. The inspired part of the strategy was the second step: Arthur had planned for the D'Amato campaign to fire him for the negative assault. That would not only distance D'Amato from the attack and leave his candidate wearing a white hat, it would also generate another delicious round of news coverage. The ""fire-Finkelstein"" debate kept the story alive for the remaining days before the election. Sometimes, in politics as in chess, a knight sacrifices himself to take the queen. Javits' career came to its end. Karl Rove is not on the ballot in 2016. At least in the short term, in any brutal exchange between a brass-knuckled political operative and Hillary Clinton, guess who wins and who loses? Clinton has already lost once, running as the candidate of experience against a younger candidate of hope and change. Political tides often wash in as high as -- if not higher than -- they have before. It could all happen to Hillary again. My experience is that once America moves forward a generation, it seldom moves backward. It's not Hillary's age that is the issue, but how young or old she would make the country. Rove has opened the door to Clinton's real weakness: Her lack of vision is more of an issue than her years. That other Clinton . Bill Clinton had no such debility. He was always the candidate of the future. His song was ""Don't Stop Thinking about Tomorrow."" His pledge, repeated nearly two dozen times in his acceptance speech at the 1996 Democratic convention, in his campaign against World War II's Bob Dole, was to build ""The Bridge to the 21st Century."" President Clinton was inspired to enter politics, he admits, as a 16-year-old on a visit to Washington, in a moment captured by cameras, when he shook hands with the New Frontier's President John F. Kennedy, whom he then emulated. Ronald Reagan was attacked for his age and mental acuity. America learned he was an optimist with a glorious sense of humor and a vision of them that lit the world as a ""Shining City on a Hill,"" so they found him forever young, regardless of his maturity and experience. Kennedy, Clinton and Reagan were young because they kept us young. Unlike those predecessors, however, Hillary Clinton isn't known for her optimism or inspiring vision. She is a pragmatist, not a futurist. America has known her for a long time. Even after 20 years, a stay in the White House, a career in the Senate and a tour as secretary of state, we do not know what stars she would follow. It is not unreasonable to ask where a candidate would go before we trust her to lead us there. It's hard to imagine that only now, after decades in the public eye, Hillary Clinton would suddenly discover her destination. Unfinished business . Hillary has only one attribute that makes her politically youthful and connects her to our future. It is, however, a powerful one: America has yet to have a female president. The power of that incomplete task should not be understated. In making the decision to nominate and elect our first black president, America rightly believes it acted as a good and noble nation. It advanced the defining belief that we are a country offering equal opportunity to everyone. In making that choice, however, America also made another decision: Not to elect our first female president. Women were left at the back of the bus. As I travel the country these days and speak to audiences of varied political persuasions, I am often struck by the quiet but growing movement of women, especially younger women, Democrat and Republican, who believe their time has come. Much of Hillary's support says, ""It is our turn."" Is that enough to keep Clinton ""forever young"", like Reagan? Not completely. Reagan's eternal youth, like Kennedy's, was actually the understanding that he would keep our country ""forever young"". Without similar vision and optimism, Hillary's crusade remains only a quest for personal achievement. To that purpose, Karl Rove has opened a wound that will bleed and hurt Clinton. Unfortunately, it will also hurt the Republican Party Rove aims to help. GOP has its own problems . Right now the GOP is a cause few are proud to join. We are a dark and purposeless confederation, known for primarily for saying ""no"" and telling people, not what they can be, but what they should not do. We seem to employ our principles only with only the darkest and most defensive intentions. This assault on Hillary Clinton will only aggravate that perception of the GOP, and the moment couldn't be worse. Many young voters have had their hearts broken by President Barack Obama. In return for the dreams, hopes and votes they invested in him, Obama has rewarded them with huge student debt, no jobs, declining prospects, and an intergenerational transfer of wealth from their empty pockets to their gluttonous elders. Those young voters are available to Republicans who would lift their eyes over the horizon and lead them to something better. They are not eager to stand beside Rove holding a bloody ax. Please don't think me apologetic. I love negative political campaigns and have run more than a few of them. I believe Republicans have an obligation to disqualify a failed, industrial-age political philosophy that is leading our nation to decline. We have responsibility to warn voters about hot stoves and shout an alert not to touch them. Yet, our ultimate obligation is to cook something and feed a population hungry for leadership. It remains our mission to inspire and take an ever-hopeful people from a great nation to an even better one. Ultimately, this is a collective failure, belonging to all but a few Republicans. GOP leaders and sages rarely make an effective case that their principles offer the only possible path to a future of promise, progress and prosperity. When we don't lift those principles before voters, when we don't step up and lead, we are defined only by tactical wedge issues that divide and not big principles that inspire, unite, and attract the next generation. In this battle, we have dug our hole a little deeper and exposed the GOP's lack of leadership. It is a big price to pay for a party in need of optimism and vision. It is also a steep cost to a country in need of renewal, confidence, and big dreams.

"(CNN) -- Amazon only this week acknowledged the storm it raised earlier this month when it made it much harder for consumers to buy books by Hachette, a major French publisher, in order to extract better contract terms. The spat has affected titles by authors ranging from Malcolm Gladwell to J.K. Rowling to J.D. Salinger, whose books Amazon has suddenly made unavailable or more expensive, or which the online retailer says will take many weeks to ship. In its first public statement recognizing the dispute, Amazon notes the standoff is unlikely to end any time soon. This fight is part of a long drawn-out battle between publishers and Amazon, which has used its immense control over the book market (by some estimates it sells up to 50% of print and electronic books in the U.S.) to reshape the industry. Understandably, authors, publishers, and others from the literary world reacted to Amazon's latest play with alarm, cautioning that its brute exercise of power threatens not only the economic underpinnings of their industry, but also the very quality of books and diversity of ideas. Amazon, meanwhile, has tried to defuse the frenzy of attention, explaining that its tactics are just a routine part of how retailers negotiate with suppliers. Many journalists, too, have echoed Amazon's point: Sure, it might seem unfair for Amazon to use its clout this way, but isn't it just how it goes? And if it means Amazon charges us less for books, aren't we better off? They're important questions -- ones that get to the heart of a decades-old law that, if still enforced by government, would likely go some way in taming this fight, and drastically curb Amazon's power over the book industry in general. Called the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, the law prohibits a retailer from wielding its mere size to bully suppliers for discounts. Congress passed the law as the rise of A&P -- America's first modern mega-chain store -- was shuttering independent businesses. Also known as the ""Anti-Price Discrimination Act,"" the law basically limits the clout won from size, establishing that a retailer can't simply secure better terms because it is bigger and therefore has more bargaining power. (The law also applies to suppliers, prohibiting them from discriminating against small retailers in favor of big ones.) Preventing large chain stores from muscling exclusive discounts from suppliers based on size and not service or cost-justifications, the idea went, would give smaller entities a fair chance at competing. It didn't matter if retailers passed on these savings to consumers or not. It was fair competition that mattered. Through the 1970s, antitrust agencies enforced the act pretty vigorously; in the 1960s alone the government brought 518 Robinson-Patman cases. Enforcement began to drop under President Carter, and the Reagan administration -- which ushered in a fundamental shift in antitrust policy more generally -- scaled back enforcement even further. Successive administrations have largely followed suit: The Clinton administration brought just one case between 1993 and 2000, and neither the Justice Department nor the . Federal Trade Commission has wielded the law since. Federal courts, too, have made it much harder to win a price discrimination suit. But the law is still on the books, and is important to recall because it enshrines a key tenet: That preserving fair competition requires that we curb the bullying power of size. So it is true that retailers and suppliers have a right to negotiate however they please. But the relative bargaining power between the two parties is an important factor when considering what is anti-competitive. Several journalists have compared Amazon's actions to those of Wal-Mart, which famously uses its market dominance to squeeze suppliers -- a strategy it has applied forcibly enough to transform entire industries. What this analogy misses, though, is that even Wal-Mart's license to use its heft this way is relatively new. ""If the government still enforced Robinson-Patman, it would go a fair way towards limiting the power of Amazon,"" said Oren Teicher, CEO of the American Booksellers Association, which represents independent bookstores. He would know: In the 1990s, ABA brought numerous cases against both publishers and chain stores for violating Robinson-Patman. Somewhat perversely, until now, the closest encounter Amazon has had with antitrust authorities was when it successfully prodded them to bring a case against five major publishers and Apple. That fight, too, centered on the price of e-books. In order to wrest control back from Amazon -- which had been pricing digital bestsellers and new titles at a flat $9.99, a fraction of the price of physical copies and sometimes even lower than wholesale -- publishers had adopted a new pricing arrangement, known as the ""agency model."" After getting Apple on board, publishers extended the model to all booksellers -- including Amazon. After losing the ability to undercut its competitors, its share of the market fell from 90% to around 65%. Amazon responded by filing a complaint with the FTC, and in 2012 the Justice Department sued Apple and the publishers for collusion. As part of their settlement, publishers temporarily lost the right to the agency model, handing back to Amazon the power to slash prices. In the years since, its share of the e-book market has, predictably, risen again, positioning it to leverage that market power against Hachette. It's worth remembering that its tactic -- holding the publisher hostage unless it concedes to better terms -- flouts the principles of anti-price discrimination laws. Accepting Amazon's argument that the nature of its fight with the publisher is innate to how markets work ignores a key piece of American history.

"(CNN) -- She just can't seem to stay away. A day after she pleaded no contest to stowing away, Marilyn Jean Hartman was re-arrested at the Los Angeles airport on Thursday. She was seen earlier in the day arriving at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), where she spent about an hour ""scouting out multiple passenger terminals before being arrested. ""Airport Police officers did not observe Hartman attempting to purchase an airline ticket and she did not have a ticket or boarding pass in her possession when arrested,"" the airport said in a statement. Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said in the statement that flyers were distributed with Hartman's picture on it. ""When we knew she was going to be released from custody, we were prepared,"" he said. This week, authorities say Hartman, 62, made it through a screening checkpoint at Mineta San Jose International Airport without a ticket and boarded a Southwest Airlines flight bound for LAX. She was initially arrested there Monday. She pleaded no contest Wednesday to a misdemeanor count of stowing away, CNN affiliate KTLA reported.

"(CNN) -- Despite all the buzz, Ellen Pompeo is not retiring from acting. Not yet, anyway. The idea of Pompeo leaving the business was raised during a BuzzFeed Brews session Wednesday, when the ""Grey's Anatomy"" star said ""she doesn't have a strong desire to continue to act"" after the series ends. ""I definitely feel myself transitioning,"" Pompeo said during the panel. ""I don't find acting terribly empowering."" But Pompeo clearly isn't going anywhere anytime soon. She starts her 11th season on the ABC medical drama this fall after signing a new two-year contract in January. The 44-year-old actress has played ""Grey's"" title character, Meredith Grey, since the Shonda Rhimes-created series premiered in 2005. Pompeo was joined at Wednesday's event by ""Scandal's"" Kerry Washington and ""How to Get Away with Murder's"" Viola Davis -- two stars who work on shows also created by Rhimes. The actresses were asked what their dream roles would be, which prompted Pompeo's response about her vision for her future. ""For the place I am in my life, I think my age -- once I hit 40, I feel differently,"" Pompeo continued. ""I don't necessarily want to work for other people."" Can she see herself walking away from acting altogether? ""Oh absolutely,"" Pompeo, replied, with a caveat: ""I would never say never, I'm not going to come out there and make one of those statements (about retiring)."" ""I try to keep an open heart, and an open mind, and an open soul and spirit to whatever comes my way, and whatever is meant to be for me will be."" As of now, it's producing that's caught Pompeo's interest. It's something she finds challenging and fun, and feeling challenged is important to her, she told the panel. ""I feel like the acting has been a wonderful opportunity and I guess I've just done so much of it over the past, you know, 11 years, that I don't know -- maybe part of my personality is that I feel like I have something to prove sometimes, and with acting, I feel like I don't have anything to prove anymore.""

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Some 70% of the Russian troops believed to have been in Ukraine have withdrawn back across the border, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said, according to the national news agency Ukrinform. ""This is another hope that peaceful initiatives have a good perspective,"" Poroshenko is quoted as saying during a Cabinet meeting in Kiev on Wednesday. The remarks came several days into a shaky ceasefire deal between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia rebels, signed last Friday after nearly five months of fighting in eastern Ukraine. The Presidents of Russia and Ukraine are ""broadly satisfied"" with the status of the ceasefire, a Kremlin aide said Wednesday. President Vladimir Putin and Poroshenko spoke by phone Tuesday night, Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told Russia's Interfax news agency. ""On the whole, satisfaction was expressed on our part and by the Ukrainian side with how the ceasefire is being observed although it is a difficult process,"" Ushakov said. Moscow has repeatedly denied allegations by Kiev and the West that it is sending Russian troops over the border into Ukraine. Meanwhile, EU leaders are weighing whether to pull the trigger on tougher sanctions against Russia. Talks are planned Thursday in Brussels among diplomats from the 28 member nations, following a decision Monday to put on hold for at least a ""few days"" a new package of economic penalties against Russia over its encroachment in Ukraine. The delay offered more time to assess the effectiveness of the ceasefire without risking further trade retaliation by the Kremlin, which has said it will respond if new sanctions come into force. OSCE to deploy drones . The chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is monitoring the truce, said Wednesday that more observers would be sent to eastern Ukraine. ""Around 70 specialists are in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions this week already to monitor the ceasefire. Further monitors are being recruited and deployed as we speak,"" Didier Burkhalter said. The OSCE will be using its own drones over the region soon, he said. A discussion is also under way on the possible deployment of drones from some of the 57 member states of the OSCE. Burkhalter, who is also the Swiss President and Foreign Minister, said his country was ready to support the OSCE mission in Ukraine with up to 10 additional monitors and an extra 500,000 euros ($647,000.) MH17 crash report . Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu blamed Ukraine for the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in comments Wednesday after meeting with Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein in Moscow, Russia's state-run Itar-Tass new agency reported. ""The catastrophe happened in the skies of Ukraine, which is fully responsible for what happened,"" Shoigu is quoted as saying. ""I'm convinced that this tragedy wouldn't have happened if Ukraine had solved its internal crisis without use of military force, including artillery, missiles, and war aviation."" A preliminary report into the crash in July, released by Dutch aviation investigators Tuesday, said the plane was brought down by ""high energy objects"" from outside. The U.S. and Ukraine have accused pro-Russian separatists operating in the region of downing the plane, which had 298 people on board, using a Russian-made missile system. The report supports the theory of a warhead exploding in close proximity to the passenger jet, but it doesn't point any fingers at who might have fired it.

"(MentalFloss.com) -- On Memorial Day, we thought it might be a good time to take a look at some of the rules for respectfully displaying the American flag, as dictated by the United States Flag Code. When did these flag rules fall into place? Surprisingly late in American history. On Flag Day in 1923, a group of organizations headed by the American Legion outlined the National Flag Code as a set of advisory rules for displaying the flag. These rules became law during World War II and form the bulk of what's now the United States Flag Code. These rules cover all manner of extremely specific situations, but they're all governed by the same basic principle: the flag is one of the most visible and important symbols of our country, so we should treat it with respect. Are you really supposed to lower the flag at sunset? You don't have to. While the flag code notes that displaying the flag only from sunrise to sunset is ""universal custom,"" it makes an exception. ""However, when a patriotic effect is desired, the flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours of darkness."" When should the flag be displayed? Section 6 of the flag code states, ""The flag should be displayed on all days."" However, the code goes on to say that the flag should especially (emphasis added) be displayed on the following days: New Year's Day, Inauguration Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Lincoln's birthday, Washington's birthday, Easter, Mother's Day, Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day, Father's Day, Independence Day, National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, Labor Day, Constitution Day, Columbus Day, Navy Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, state holidays, states' dates of admission, and ""such other days as may be proclaimed by the President of the United States."" Where should the flag be displayed? Section 6 of the flag code covers this question, too. The flag should be displayed in or near every schoolhouse on school days, on or near the main administration building of every public institution each day, and in or near every polling place on election days. Why doesn't, say, the Dream Team take the courts in American-flag jerseys at the Olympics? The flag code thought of that one, too. Section 8 of the code covers ""Respect for the Flag,"" and it explicitly states, ""No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations."" Mental Floss: Why do we sing the National Anthem at sporting events? Any other restrictions on wearing the flag? Section 8 also states, ""The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery."" What about those American flag lapel pins that so many folks wear? The flag code thought of that one, too. Section 8 rather elegantly states, ""The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. Therefore, the lapel flag pin being a replica, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart."" Is it true you have to retire and burn a flag that touches the ground? No, that's a myth. The flag code is quite a bit more realistic about this situation. While the code states, ""The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise,"" there's no rule saying that a flag that slips has to immediately be burned. Instead, the code stipulates, ""The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning."" Unless hitting the ground once renders the flag unfit for display, there's no need to burn it. When is it acceptable to fly the flag upside down? The flag code allows for flying the flag with the union (the blue field of stars) down only ""as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property."" We know that the American flag is supposed to be displayed in a position of prominence over other flags on American soil. Are there any exceptions to this rule? Section 7 of the flag code provides one major exception: the flag of the United Nations can be flown in the position of honor or prominence at the U.N. headquarters in New York. The only other exception involves church services performed by naval chaplains while at sea. In these instances, the church's flag may fly above the American flag during the service. Mental Floss: Videos: Dogs welcoming home soldiers . What's the penalty for breaking the flag code? There isn't one. The flag code is an odd duck in this regard. As part of the United States Code, the flag code is technically federal law. However, the code doesn't outline any measures for enforcement or punishment. Basically, the flag code is a set of advisory rules for Americans who want to know the proper and respectful way to display their flag. Even if the flag code did provide measures for its enforcement, it's not clear that the measures would be constitutional. Individual states used to have their own prohibitions on and penalties for desecrating the flag, but the 1989 Supreme Court decision Texas v. Johnson invalidated these laws as infringements on free speech. Congress responded by passing the Flag Protection Act, which made flag desecration a federal crime. The Supreme Court struck down this law in the 1990 case United States v. Eichman. Can anyone stop me from displaying the flag? In 2006 the Freedom to Display the American Flag Act of 2005 officially became law. This law basically says that no condo board, housing co-op, or residential real estate management group can restrict a person's right to display the American flag on their own residential property as long as the display jibes with federal law and is reasonable. What days is the flag always flown at half-staff? The flag always flies on half-staff on Patriot Day (September 11 of each year), Peace Officers Memorial Day (May 15), and Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day (December 7). On Memorial Day, the flag flies at half-staff until noon, at which point it is raised to the top of the staff. What if I can't fly my flag at half-staff? Some flags, like the ones commonly seen in school classrooms or on houses, are fixed in a certain position on their poles. How does one handle the sticky situation of a flag that physically can't be flown at half-staff? The United States Code doesn't cover this conundrum, but the American Legion advocates adding a black ribbon to the top of the flag's pole to indicate mourning. Mental Floss: Why is the flag flown at half-staff in times of mourning? What about adding new stars for new states? Should we ever pick up a 51st state, Section 2 of the flag code stipulates that the state will get a new star on the flag. It won't be an overnight process, though. The new star will make its debut on the first Fourth of July following the state's formal admission into the union. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's family gathered Tuesday for an early Thanksgiving dinner, determined not to let money and fame pull it apart, the pop icon's older brother said. ""That's really, really important because we're a family and throughout the years, the managers, the agents and Hollywood have tried to come between that,"" Jermaine Jackson said. ""What they don't know is we were together before we came out here and we're going to continue to be together."" Jackson spoke to CNN at a Tuesday morning screening of his brother's ""This Is It"" movie for inner-city students in Los Angeles. He said he has stayed away from the Michael Jackson estate legal battle, which pitted his mother's lawyer against his father's lawyer earlier this month. ""When there's a lot of fame and fortune and attorneys, accountants and advisers and managers and agents, it gets like this,"" Jermaine Jackson said. ""But at the same time, my mother is the boss and regardless of what the executors want to do at the end of the day, she has the say."" When family matriarch Katherine Jackson dropped her legal challenge of the men named in Michael Jackson's will to run his estate, family patriarch Joe Jackson's lawyer was launching his own challenge. This set off a bitter courtroom battle between the lawyers for the Jackson parents. ""She has now reneged on her obligation to her family,"" Joe Jackson's lawyer, Brian Oxman, told the judge. He said Katherine Jackson's reversal was ""one of the most despicable displays"" he's ever seen in court. Oxman accused her of reaching a secret deal -- behind Joe Jackson's back -- with the men who control their son's estate. Jermaine Jackson said despite what you may read, the Jackson family will ""pull together."" ""There's strength in numbers, and when there's a family like ours, we pull together,"" he said. ""We find strength within each other."" Katherine Jackson does not celebrate holidays because of her religion -- she a Jehovah's Witness -- but the Jackson brothers, sisters, and their children do traditionally gather for one day Thanksgiving week, he said. Tuesday is the day, he said. ""And it's really tough because Michael's no longer with us, but he'll always be with us in spirit, but you just continue to move on,"" he said. Michael Jackson's three children -- Prince, 12, Paris, 11, and Blanket, 7 -- are ""doing great"" and are ""best friends"" with his children, Jermaine Jackson said. ""They're doing well,"" he said. ""They're getting their lessons done. They have wonderful tutors and programs, they're getting a chance to go out and do things. They're getting a chance to travel."" An A&E network reality TV series that focuses on the lives of four of the Jackson brothers -- Jackie, Jermaine, Tito and Marlon -- debuts next month. Filming of ""The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty"" -- in the works before Michael Jackson's June 25 death -- is about to wrap, he said. He said his main job now is to promote his brother's legacy. Jermaine Jackson walked down the red carpet with dozens of students before the ""This Is It"" screening. Michael Jackson's vocal coach and several musicians featured in show also were there. Los Angeles artist David Ilan, who is creating a Michael Jackson tribute portrait with 1 million hand-drawn dots, added a dot on his artwork for each of them. The technique, ""pointillism,"" allows Jackson fans worldwide to sign up online to have a dot added in their name.

"(CNN) -- Lt. Col. George Bivens has a message for whoever ambushed two Pennsylvania State Police troopers last week: ""We will find you."" The Friday night shooting outside police barracks in Blooming Grove killed one trooper and seriously wounded another. Authorities are offering a $75,000 reward for information leading to the suspect or suspects, Bivens said. Police have released few details about the shooting, saying they want to keep most of the information they've deduced so far from evidence quiet. ""Only the coward that committed this act knows that information, and we will use that to find him or her,"" Bivens said. The assailant used a .308-caliber rifle, Bivens said, and could be an avid hunter of someone with formal firearms training. ""Clearly, they practiced with this rifle to maintain proficiency,"" he said, adding that the suspect may have been practicing at a shooting range. And it's possible the shooter had ""an ongoing issue with law enforcement or the government"" and ""suffered some level of crisis in his life,"" Bivens said. The FBI is assisting, he said, and investigators are working around the clock to track down the suspect. But there's one key person they haven't had a chance yet to speak with: the trooper who survived the shooting. Trooper Alex T. Douglass is conscious and speaking for the first time since undergoing surgery after the shooting, police said. But authorities haven't interviewed him. ""First and foremost is our concern for his health and recovery. So we're letting the doctors do what they need to do, and at an appropriate time that will occur. We expect that to happen in the very near future,"" Bivens said. The trooper is improving daily. ""He was very seriously wounded and he's going to have a long road to recover,"" he said. The shooting happened at 10:50 p.m. Friday in a rural, wooded area. Cpl. Bryon K. Dickson was killed in the attack. Police from New York, New Jersey and throughout the Northeast are assisting in the search for suspects, Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said. Police have received hundreds of tips in the case and are aggressively pursuing each one, Bivens said. ""We are determined...and we will solve this,"" Bivens said. ""We've all been through any number of complex investigations. They take time. I know we've assembled the A team here. They will absolutely work through this investigation, and I'm confident we'll make an arrest."" 2 officers from 'Alaska State Troopers' killed in confrontation .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Tom Greer is an 80-year-old crime victim who had the absolute right to use deadly force to defend himself when a pair of burglars -- a man and a woman -- broke into his home in Long Beach, California, and began assaulting him. And yet, if there is any justice, the 80-year-old should spend the remainder of his golden years in prison. That's because he killed 28-year-old Andrea Miller, who begged for her life, telling Greer: ""Don't shoot me, I'm pregnant! I'm going to have a baby!"" Not true, according to the L.A. County Coroner's Office. Miller was not pregnant. But Greer didn't know when he pulled the trigger -- for a second time. The homeowner, who has been robbed before, told police that he returned home one night and found Miller and her accomplice, who has been identified as 26-year-old Gus Adams, trying to open his safe. Greer said they immediately attacked him and threw him to the ground, breaking his collarbone. While the intruders were distracted, Greer got up and retrieved his .22 caliber Smith & Wesson revolver. When Miller and Adams saw he was armed, he said they ran out of the house. Greer told a Los Angeles television station that he pursued the intruders outside and into a nearby alley, gun in hand. First mistake. He told KNBC: ""When the time comes to defend yourself, you best do something."" But, at this point, Greer was no longer defending himself because he wasn't in imminent danger. And he was not protecting his home. Instead, he was stalking his prey. Then, Greer told the television station, he fired on the burglars, hitting Miller in the back. Second mistake. If Greer shot Miller in the back, it makes it hard for him to argue that he wasn't in control of the situation and that somehow he felt threatened by Miller. Finally, Greer said with no remorse, as Adams ran off, Miller pleaded for her life and claimed to be pregnant. But Greer fired off another shot anyway, killing her. Third mistake. Since Miller wasn't really pregnant, we can assume that she was just trying to save her own skin. Maybe Greer believed her, or maybe he didn't. What matters is this: With the suspect already wounded and bleeding, Greer should have called police and waited for them to arrive. He didn't do that. Instead, he meted out his own punishment. Was that because Greer was angry and frustrated at being victimized and wanted retribution? If so, that's not a good excuse for taking a life. Adams has been found and arrested on suspicion of murder for taking part in a crime that led to Miller's death. His arraignment is scheduled for August 11. Given that we're talking about an 80-year-old crime victim who grabbed a gun with the intent to defend himself, there are clearly extenuating circumstances. But they are not enough to let Greer avoid taking some responsibility for killing Miller. He's a victim, but not a completely innocent one. The fact that he was robbed and beaten doesn't excuse everything that happened next. Greer pursued Miller out of his house and into the alley. He shot her in the back. And then, with her lying wounded on the ground and pleading for her life -- and still not clear on whether or not she was really pregnant -- he fired the fatal shot. This wasn't premeditated, but neither was it a spontaneous crime of passion. During this entire ordeal, Greer had plenty of time to think about what was happening and how to react. He chose to react by shooting down someone who was no longer fleeing and no longer a threat to him. By firing the fatal shot at someone who was alone, unarmed, wounded, defenseless and pleading for her life, Greer committed a cold-blooded act. Let's be clear. If you confront a burglar in your home, and you feel your life is in danger, and you grab a gun to defend yourself and kill that person, most reasonable people could consider that to be a justified use of deadly force. This is not that. And it cheapens the right to self-defense to apply that label to what happened here. Because his crime wasn't premeditated, Greer shouldn't be charged with first-degree murder. Second-degree will suffice. And if it is proved in court that he punitively and needlessly took a life, then he should be locked up for the rest of his.","Police say Tom Greer, 80, shot to death intruder who said, ""Don't shoot, I'm pregnant""

"(CNN) -- Conestoga Wood Specialties was founded a half-century ago in a Pennsylvania garage. The Hahn family's commitment to quality is driven in large part by their Christian faith, which in turn may soon threaten the company's very existence. That financial and constitutional dynamic is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, in a high-stakes encore to the health care reform law known as Obamacare. The justices will issue their ruling Monday in a dispute involving contraception coverage and religious liberty. ""Our religion is Mennonite; that is our faith. Our company was founded on that religion as well,"" said Conestoga's President Anthony Hahn, son of the privately held company's co-founder. ""We feel the government has gone too far in too many instances. It's been troubling to us as a family."" The modest furniture maker's pending lawsuit is one of nearly 50 that have been filed in federal courts from various corporations, challenging the birth-control coverage benefits in the law championed by President Barack Obama. That law has come in for separate, fierce political criticism over its rocky public introduction last fall. The court will review provisions in the Affordable Care Act requiring for-profit employers of a certain size to offer insurance benefits for birth control and other reproductive health services without a co-pay. At issue is whether certain companies can refuse to do so on the sincere claim it would violate their owners' long-established personal beliefs. The justices' decision could clarify whether businesses have a religious liberty right, or whether such constitutional protections apply only to individuals. A companion legal challenge comes from Hobby Lobby, an Oklahoma-based retail giant that will have more than 700 arts and crafts stores nationwide by year's end. Both corporations emphasize their desire to operate in harmony with biblical principles while competing in a secular marketplace. That includes their leaders' publicly stated opposition to abortion. The Supreme Court held oral arguments in the two cases in late March. Under the ACA, financial penalties of up to $100 per day, per employee can be levied on firms that refuse to provide comprehensive health coverage. ""The fines and implications are, in my mind, astronomical,"" said Hahn, who employs about 1,000 people. ""It's devastating to any company."" Hobby Lobby, which has about 13,000 workers, estimates the penalty could cost it $475 million a year. The church-state issue now in the spotlight involves three-pronged rules negotiated last year between the Obama administration and various outside groups. Under the changes, churches and houses of worship are completely exempt from the contraception mandate. Other nonprofit, religiously affiliated groups, such as church-run hospitals, parochial schools and charities such as the Little Sisters of the Poor, must either offer coverage, or have a third-party insurer provide separate benefits without the employer's direct involvement. Lawsuits in those cases are pending in several federal appeals courts across the country. The Hobby Lobby and Conestoga claims are in yet another Obamacare category: for-profit corporations claiming a religion-based exemption. These suits follow the high court's decision two years ago that narrowly upheld the key funding provision of the health care law, a blockbuster ruling affirming that most Americans would be required to purchase insurance or pay a financial penalty, the so-called individual mandate. The constitutional debate now shifts to the separate employer mandates and whether corporations themselves enjoy the same First Amendment rights as individuals. Three federal appeals courts around the country have struck down the contraception coverage rule, while two other appeals courts have upheld it. That ""circuit split"" made the upcoming Supreme Court review almost certain. David Green and his family are Hobby Lobby's owners and say their evangelical Christian beliefs clash with parts of the law's mandates for comprehensive coverage. They say some of the drugs that would be provided prevent human embryos from being implanted in a woman's womb, which the Greens equate with abortion. Those drugs include Plan B contraception, which some have called the ""morning after"" pill. The large retailer says it already provides coverage for 16 federally approved forms of contraception -- such as condoms and diaphragms -- for its roughly 13,000 employees, who Hobby Lobby says represent a variety of faiths. Hobby Lobby is well known for giving to a variety of charities, for closing its stores every Sunday, and proudly offering Christmas, Easter, and other Christian-themed products. Both the Greens and Hahns sat together in the courtroom for the March arguments, offering little visible reaction to dense questioning aimed at lawyers appearing before the bench. The White House has said it believes a requirement on contraception coverage is ""lawful and essential to women's health"" and expressed confidence the Supreme Court would ultimately agree. Obamacare's supporters say it does not require individual company owners to personally provide coverage they might object to but instead places that responsibility on the corporate entity. ""Throughout our nation's history, corporations have been treated differently than individuals when it comes to fundamental, personal rights of conscience and human dignity,"" said lawyers for the Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive public-interest legal group. ""The First Amendment's free exercise guarantee has always been viewed as a purely personal liberty."" But lawyers representing the Hahns say they deserve freedom from what they call state intrusion into private moral decisions. ""The question in this case is whether all Americans will have religious freedom and will be able to live and do business according to their faith,"" said Matt Bowman, senior legal counsel with the Alliance Defending Freedom. ""Or whether the federal government can pick and choose what faith is, who are the faithful, and where and when they can exercise that faith."" A key issue for the justices will be interpreting a 1993 federal law known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, requiring the government to seek the ""least burdensome"" and narrowly tailored means for any law that interferes with religious convictions. Can companies, churches, and universities be included, or do the protections apply only to ""persons?"" As for Conestoga, Anthony Hahn and his wife, Carolyn, believe they are on the right side of the legal and moral argument. They live in Lancaster County with their four children, just down the street from their second-generation kitchen cabinet business, which has expanded over the years, with plants in two other states. Nearby are Anthony's two brothers-- who also work at the company-- and his parents, Norman and Elizabeth Hahn. Norman and his brother Sam formed the business fifty years ago, almost on a whim. As the family tells it, a local builder essentially dared the men, who were local craftsmen, to install a kitchen in one day. They did, and the builder kept his word and gave the Hahns all of his business. Their once-local clientele has now gone global. ""It's really not only just for Conestoga. We're taking a stand for other businesses as well,"" said Anthony Hahn about his appeal. ""This is a religious liberty issue that is concerning to us.""

"(CNN) -- Three woman in the Dominican Republic were paid to claim, falsely, that they had sex with U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, police said in a statement Monday. The women were paid by attorney Melanio Figueroa, who worked with Miguel Galvan, another attorney, they said. Galvan has previously said that another lawyer asked him to assist in a divorce case by finding ""witnesses"" to claim they had sex with Menendez for money. Attempts to contact Figueroa on Monday were unsuccessful. For their services, two of the women received a bit more than $400. The third woman was paid close to $300, police said. Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, has long denied a report that accused him of partying with prostitutes in the Dominican Republic. Confessions shows sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says . The Daily Caller, a conservative website, first published the report shortly before the November election, citing a video with two women claiming they had sex with Menendez for money. The three woman identified by police told investigators they made a recording. They first went to a hotel room to do it but later moved to a commercial area with an Internet connection after the connection at the hotel proved inadequate. ""The evidence released today by Dominican law enforcement authorities proves what we have said all along: that the smear campaign against Senator Menendez is based on lies, lies we now know were paid for by interests whose identities have not yet been fully disclosed,"" Menendez's communications director Tricia Enright said in a statement. She urged authorities in the United States to investigate the case. Menendez told CNN in January that the claims he'd partied with prostitutes were ""absolutely false,"" calling the allegations ""smears."" Menendez faces scrutiny over ties to Florida doctor . In addition to those claims, Menendez has faced criticism over accepting unreported plane flights and allegedly advocating on behalf of a business. Questions revolve around the senator's relationship with Salomon Melgen, a Florida man who owned a plane Menendez admits to having flown on three times to the Dominican Republic in 2010. One flight was on official Senate business, and two others were for personal reasons. Melgen, his wife, Flor, and his daughter, Melissa, have been generous donors to Menendez, his fellow Democrats and related causes in recent years. In January, Menendez paid approximately $58,500 to Melgen for the flights he took in 2010, chalking up the lapse in payment to his busy schedule. ""I was in a big travel schedule in 2010 as the chair of the (Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee), plus my own campaign getting ready for a re-election cycle, and in the process of all of that, it unfortunately fell through the cracks,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash, adding that when it came to his attention that the payment had not been made, he ""personally paid"" for it in order to meet his obligation. Menendez has also been in hot water for raising questions before Obama administration officials about a port security contract for a company in which Melgen has a stake. The company had a contract to screen cargo that went through Dominican ports, but Menendez argued last July during a Senate subcommittee hearing that Dominican authorities didn't want to ""live by"" the contract. Asked if he used his influence to help Melgen, Menendez told Bash: ""I have always advocated for issues and I have advocated for policies, and that's what I have done across the board.""

"Gaza City (CNN) -- With the latest failed cease-fire quickly becoming a distant memory, the two sides in the Israel-Gaza conflict traded rockets and airstrikes Saturday -- as well as blame for not stopping the bloodshed. Israeli airstrikes killed at least five more people in Gaza on Saturday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported. The area around central Gaza's Qassam mosque, in particular, was a frenzy of activity as medical workers sifted through rubble there. WAFA claimed that Israeli fighter jets struck that mosque and another, killing at least three people. Less than a mile away from the Qassam mosque, a strike killed two men riding on a motorbike, Palestinian Health Ministry spokesman Dr. Ashraf el-Qedra said. Israel's military confirmed the strike, saying the two men were militants. El-Qedra added Saturday night that a 13-year-old girl died in an airstrike on her family home in Rafah. That was in addition to a 10-year-old boy who died while playing with friends, the Palestinian health ministry said. Then again, Israel is on the defensive as well. The Israel Defense Forces said that, since the end of the cease-fire early Friday, about 100 rockets were fired toward Israel from Gaza. That figure includes at least 30 launched Saturday, of which 24 hit Israel, the military said. The IDF responded by targeting ""some 120 terror sites and nine terror operatives."" All this back-and-forth, of course, is nothing new. The Israelis and Palestinians -- particularly Hamas, the Islamic militant group and political party that controls Gaza -- have been at it for weeks, with the former fending off persistent rocket attacks and the latter dealing with relentless Israeli strikes. There have been efforts to halt the bloodshed as well as to broach some of the thorny issues related to it. And there have been some breakthroughs, including a few cease-fires. Yet none of those peacemaking attempts, so far, has stuck. Death toll's rise slows . The death toll's climb has slowed since IDF announced overnight into Saturday an end of its ground incursion in Gaza -- even as it continued to strike from the air. Israeli forces say troops redeployed after completed their mission of destroying Hamas' tunnels. Still, while there weren't scores of dead Saturday as has been true many other days over the past few weeks, the total carnage remains significant. According to el-Qedra, at least 1,911 in Gaza have died since the conflict began, in addition to just under 10,000 injured. It's unclear how many casualties were militants: The United Nations estimates that about 70% of the dead were civilians, or about 1,340. IDF, meanwhile says about 900 militants have been killed, which would put the civilian death toll at around 1,000. IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said that that number was a preliminary estimate based on field reports from troops returning from battle. Israeli officials say 64 Israeli soldiers have died, and three civilians were killed in Israel. The Iron Dome missile defense system has intercepted many of the rockets Gazan militants have fired at populated areas of the country. Blame game continues . Besides the violence, another thing that hasn't stopped is the blame game. One point of contention: who broke the most recent cease-fire hours before it was supposed to run out? Hamas denied firing rockets into Israel on Friday. Yet militants from Islamic Jihad and the Al-Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades admitted to doing just that -- blaming Israel for refusing to accept their demands during negotiations. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said it was Hamas' fault regardless, telling CNN the group runs Gaza and ""can't outsource terrorism to the other groups. When they want to enforce a cease-fire, they do it very well."" Hamas has been in charge of the Palestinian government in Gaza for years, while the Palestinian faction Fatah runs the government in the West Bank. The two groups have been at odds but also made repeated efforts at a unity government, including one earlier this year. One sad irony of all this bloodshed is that -- according to the Egyptian foreign ministry, which brokered recent talks -- the parties have reached an agreement on most issues. Those not agreed upon were few and limited, the ministry said in a statement. Still, there's too much history to show that agreement on some issues will not necessarily lead to a grander breakthrough. The Palestinians have asked for Israel to lift its blockade on Gaza and to re-open the air and seaports, a Palestinian negotiation who spoke on condition of anonymity said. Israeli authorities fear Hamas could import weapons by sea and maintains a ship blockade off Gaza's shores. Palestinians also wanted Israel to extend Gaza's fishing zone in the Mediterranean from three miles off the coast to 20. Fishing is a keystone of Gazan livelihoods. But Israel was willing to extend fishing rights to only six miles off the coast, said Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri. Yet Israel is resisting in-depth talks as long as rockets continue to head toward its territory. After Gazan rocket fire on Friday, Israel's Foreign Ministry said the country ""will not conduct negotiations while under fire."" CNN exclusive: Inside the mind of Hamas' political leader .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- After eight days of bone-shattering bombardment, Gaza was calm Thursday and Friday as residents of this battered land sought to return to their daily lives. North of Gaza City, the Abu Khusa family was preparing to move to a rented house until they can repair their home's roof, which was blown off. In the meantime, they said, they were hoping the peace would hold. ""God willing, it will last 100 years, 200 years, for the sake of our children,"" said Shadia Abu Khusa. In Gaza City, thousands of people took part in a celebration that was not so much of a military victory as a psychological one. Who won, who lost . For impoverished Gaza, whose 1.7 million residents were massively outgunned by Israel's military, to survive was to triumph. ""I think people feel now that the only way to push Israel to give concessions is resistance,"" said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official, who cited Israel's agreement to Wednesday's cease-fire as vindication of Hamas' struggle. ""Because President Abbas spent about 20 years in negotiations, but they got nothing from this,"" he added, referring to Mahmoud Abbas, leader of the rival Palestinian Fatah group, which governs the occupied West Bank and is considered more moderate than Hamas. This new reality may embolden Hamas to push for even more. After the cease-fire ended the flareup between the Palestinians of Gaza and the Israel Defense Forces, Hamas can claim credit for extracting important concessions from Israel, including its promise to loosen Gaza's isolation from the outside world. Hamas has also shown that its rockets have improved and that it is not as vulnerable to Israeli airstrikes as it was during the ""Cast Lead"" Operation four years ago, when more than 1,400 Palestinians were killed. Its international stature grew as it gained popular and official Arab support. Palestinians left with a paradox . Israel's military also claimed success, saying on Wednesday that it had destroyed ""significant elements"" of Hamas' rocket-launching capabilities. And its ""Iron Dome"" missile-defense system proved able to intercept numerous attacks from the south. Netanyahu, who is looking forward to elections in January, also showed himself to be an effective military leader. Polls say the vast majority of Israelis supported the operation. Palestinian leaders sought to cast the cease-fire as a catalyst toward uniting their divided factions, while Israelis said they were happy for quiet after the shelling and counterstrikes. In Gaza City, supporters of Hamas and Fatah gathered near the Parliament in a rare display of unity that included yellow Fatah flags and green Hamas banners flapping in the breeze alongside Palestinian flags. The mood was celebratory and militant. The leader of Islamic Jihad, a party to the truce that was brokered by Egypt and that took effect on Wednesday night, called for more weapons to maintain resistance against Israel. ""We should be ready through our unity, through our resistance, to keep the perseverance and steadfastness of our people,"" Mohammed Hindi said. Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh declared in a televised speech that Israel had ""raised the white flag."" He described the fighting as ""preparation to liberate Jerusalem"" and the al-Aqsa mosque located on the Temple Mount. Haniyeh, who heads the governing party of Gaza, said the cease-fire showed the United States had been forced to soften its stance in the region in the wake of the Arab Spring. ""The victory of Gaza is a solid truth, not a phenomenon,"" Haniyeh said. ""The era of Egypt and the region has changed, and America has now begun learning to listen to a new language."" Analysis: Conflict shifts balance of power in the Middle East . The violence left more than 160 Palestinians dead, many more injured and thousands homeless. At least six Israelis were killed, including a soldier who died Thursday of wounds suffered Wednesday just before the cease-fire took hold, the Israel Defense Forces said. For the first time, Israel experienced rocket attacks from Gaza on its main cities of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The truce negotiated by Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy followed a visit to the region by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and a series of phone calls from U.S. President Barack Obama to the main players. However, it was unclear if the latest events would lead to a resumption of long-stalled negotiations on a broader peace agreement or serve simply as a respite, as has occurred in the past. ""New dynamics in the Middle East potentially could make this time different,"" the independent International Crisis Group said Thursday in a report. The report said Morsy's government had demonstrated pragmatism in negotiating the cease-fire and presented Israel and Hamas with the opportunity to reset expectations because it had credibility among Islamists. ""Ultimately, as the dust settles and guns turn silent, much more will be known about the new regional map -- how it works, who sets the rules, how far different parties will go, whether the obstacles continually encountered in the past can be overcome,"" the report said. But it minced no words about the victims. ""This short war has been, as President Obama might put it, a teachable moment,"" it said. ""A pity the education came at such a high price. And that, once more, all the wrong people -- the civilians on both sides -- were asked to foot the bill."" Over the eight days of conflict, Palestinians counted 163 dead and 1,225 wounded in the wake of 1,500 Israeli strikes, Gaza's Health Ministry said. Hamas' military wing, the al Qassam brigade, said it fired 1,573 rockets toward Israel during the hostilities, including three shot toward Jerusalem. In addition to the six Israeli fatalities, 200 others were wounded. A spokesman for Netanyahu told CNN on Thursday that Hamas' stance toward Israel harms the ability to negotiate. ""You must remember, Hamas, unfortunately, is the enemy of peace,"" said the spokesman, Mark Regev. ""Hamas doesn't want to negotiate. Hamas says that any Palestinian who negotiates with Israel is a traitor to the Palestinian cause."" Arab-Americans watch conflict with mix of worry, relief . At the same time, Regev said Israel has called on Palestinian leaders to restart peace talks and was hoping for a positive response soon. At the Gaza City rally, Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath of Fatah blamed Israel for the division of loyalties between the two groups. He called for unification to thwart ""what the enemy is wanting to do"" and passed on greetings from Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority. ""Thank God, through you, we were able to push back this naked aggression that targeted Gaza and its people,"" Shaath said, adding that ""we should crown this victory by ending the division and expanding the national unity."" Egypt's Morsy praised for his key role in talks . Egyptian politician Sayyed al-Badawi, president of the moderate Wafd Party, also congratulated the crowd, saying, ""You have broken the will of the Zionist entity -- you have made them feel uncertain and insecure."" The agreement calls for both sides to move toward opening border crossings to facilitate the movement of people and goods. On Thursday, some of the Israeli soldiers who had been moved to Gaza's border for a potential ground invasion packed their gear to leave. Residents of Ashkelon, within rocket range of Gaza's border, expressed skepticism about whether the cease-fire would hold, noting that similar agreements have proved short-lived. Some said they would have preferred that Israel's military stage a ground invasion to destroy the militants' rocket capabilities. On the ground: Follow updates from CNN's reporters . Under the cease-fire, talks were to begin Thursday on easing economic restrictions on Gaza. Since the cease-fire was declared, three rockets have been launched from Gaza into Israel, the IDF said Thursday. Two of the three landed in open areas, and Israel's defense system intercepted the third. Israeli officials' earlier assertions citing five to 12 missiles were incorrect, the IDF said. Opinion: Will real change come from this cease-fire? A senior Obama administration official said Morsy had been ""very constructive"" and ""very pragmatic"" in his dealings with his U.S. counterpart. He and Obama developed a ""relationship of trust and were able to work through some of these issues,"" the official said. The cease-fire calls for Israel to halt all acts of aggression on Gaza, including incursions and the targeting of people, according to Egypt's state news agency. It also calls for the Palestinian factions to cease all hostilities from Gaza against Israel, including the firing of rockets and border attacks. Gazans could see an easing of border restrictions. Smuggling weapons to Gaza -- the long way . Regev said the agreement calls for ""complete and total cessation of all hostile activity initiated in the Gaza Strip."" ""For us, that's victory. That's what we wanted,"" he said. The fighting was ignited by the November 14 assassination by Israel of Ahmed al-Jaabari, the head of Hamas' military wing. Israel said its intent was to end rocket attacks on southern Israel from inside Gaza by degrading Palestinian capabilities.

"(CNN) -- The summer vacation season is already in full swing across the United States, and for many families that means loading up the car and heading to the beach. But as temperatures rise, so do the instances of air, road and railway congestion. With America on the move, the resulting traffic jams show the poor state of our infrastructure. Lane closures, potholes, flight and rail delays all have one thing in common: a lack of adequate investment in our transportation systems. The beleaguered Highway Trust Fund, which provides money for American roads, bridges and highways, is expected to go broke soon. The White House has just said it would support legislation for a short-term fix to keep the fund going through the height of the summer construction season. The federal dollars from the highway fund help supplement states' transportation projects across the nation to help keep travel routes safe, efficient and well maintained. This fund is vital in ensuring that U.S. roads and rails do not go from inconvenient to impassable. The fund relies primarily on revenue from the 18.4-cent-per-gallon gas tax and 24.4-cent-per-gallon diesel fuel tax. But because of a variety of factors -- from cars becoming more fuel-efficient, to states purchasing less gasoline from year to year, to the state of the gas tax (which has not been raised in 20 years) -- the trust fund is running on empty. 5 ways the highway crisis could affect you . If you think our roads, bridges and rails are in deplorable condition now, just think what would happen if the trickle of federal funding ever were to run dry. If Congress does not replenish the Highway Trust Fund quickly, ongoing projects will grind to a halt and new projects will be pushed back indefinitely. States depend on the money from the trust fund at levels ranging from 15% to 60% of their transportation projects. An empty Highway Trust Fund would affect the entire country, but certain states and projects could be hit especially hard. California, for example, has long depended upon federal dollars for miles of roads and bridges as well as many transit projects. Without the trust fund's capital, more than $2 billion worth of construction projects would be at risk. These projects range from road repairs to comprehensive transit rehabilitation projects and are of vital importance to the safety of California's transportation network. On the other side of the country, Rhode Island could be in dire straits, too. Our smallest state depends on around $200 million a year to keep its transportation hub a viable connector in the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states. Without this continued federal investment, delays in Providence could worsen, clogging the entire I-95 corridor. This is not just a coastal problem, either. In Missouri, a whopping 47% of highway and transit projects depend upon support from the Highway Trust Fund. The Missouri Department of Transportation has already been preparing to shut down many ongoing projects, with a spokesman saying: ""We're going to be in virtually a maintenance-only mode, and even that is short of what we need to maintain our system."" State and city governments rely on the investment from the Highway Trust Fund in order to make important projects a reality. However, without action from lawmakers in Washington, many projects could be delayed indefinitely and construction workers will be sidelined. This is not only bad for travelers -- it's bad for the economy. In fact, more than 700,000 construction jobs are at risk if the Highway Trust Fund goes broke. As the United States begins to see economic improvements following the Great Recession, a job market shock of this magnitude would be a huge step backward. Yet Congress seems poised to allow this to happen, a move that would directly affect millions of Americans -- especially those already frustrated with the delays they experience during this increasingly high-volume travel season. Americans must make Congress listen. One way is the ""I'm Stuck"" app, created by Building America's Future as a simple, fast and secure way for people to share travel frustrations with their representative or senator. If you find yourself stuck on a highway, the tarmac or a train station, this app allows you to take a quick photo and send a message to your lawmaker. It's a modern-day letter-writing campaign -- one that will be hard for Congress to ignore. American infrastructure is already in dire need of funding, and we cannot let Congress make the problem worse by letting the Highway Trust Fund run dry. The trust fund must be replenished as soon as possible -- but a long-term, comprehensive plan for infrastructure investment must become part of our country's legislative agenda. Congress needs to either raise the gas tax and index it to inflation or pass comprehensive tax reform that could include provisions to pay for long-term infrastructure investment. Lawmakers need to find a way -- where appropriate -- to bring in the private sector to assist and take advantage of the groundbreaking work being done at our great universities to use technology to improve our vital systems. While we are stymied on repairing our infrastructure, other countries are moving ahead with modern ports, highways and broadband. In order for the United States to stay competitive on an international level in the 21st century, we must invest in 21st-century infrastructure. The next time you are frustrated with a travel delay or stopped in traffic, pull out your cell phone and tell Congress to do its job. It just might be the wake-up call our government needs.","Marcia Hale: Summer travelers will find lane closures, potholes, flight and rail delays .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- The Israeli Military said Thursday that the ""vast majority"" of Palestinians killed in the recent Gaza conflict were ""terror operatives"" and the number of people killed was less than Palestinian sources reported. Israel says the majority of Palestinians killed during ""Operation Cast Lead"" were ""terror operatives."" In an e-mailed statement the Israel Defense Forces spokesman's office claimed their figures contained the names of 1,166 Palestinians killed in the conflict, called ""Operation Cast Lead."" The Israeli military said 709 of them were ""identified as Hamas terror operatives, among them several from various other terror organizations."" The remaining, the statement claims, were comprised of 162 names who ""have not yet been attributed to any organization."" ""Furthermore, it has come to our understanding that 295 uninvolved Palestinians were killed during the operation, 89 of them under the age of 16, and 49 of them were women."" The Israeli military said it was releasing the findings to counter ""false information originating from various Palestinian sources, and in order to remove any doubt regarding the number of Palestinians killed in Operation Cast Lead."" The numbers presented by the Israeli military differ sharply from those reported by Palestinian sources. At the conclusion of the fighting, the Hamas controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza had put the death toll at over 1,300, with the majority made up of non-combatants. More recently the Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR) published a study that put the total death toll at 1,417, including 926 civilians of which 313 were children under the age of 18 and 116 women. It reports that the remainder was made of 255 ""non-combatant"" police officers and 236 who were took ""an active part in hostilities."" Jaber Wishah, a deputy director for PCHR told CNN his organization ""stands firmly on our published figures"" and that Israel's choice to classify police officers as combatants is ""illegal."" ""Such classification constitutes a willful violation of the principle of 'distinction' which is a key component of customary international law. This raises serious doubts about the accuracy of the figures published by the Israelis,"" he said. Wishah said the civilian death toll included ""large numbers of deaths inside people's homes and other civilian facilities"" and that it indicated ""the extent to which civilians were intentionally targeted."" Wishah said that until the Israeli government produced the names and details on which its figures were based that he could not comment further. The Israeli military has maintained that it went to great lengths to minimize civilian deaths and put the responsibility of civilian deaths on Hamas. ""The Hamas terror organization placed the primary fighting scene at the heart of civilian neighborhoods as it booby-trapped homes, fired from schools and used civilians as human shields,"" the IDF said. Asked about the discrepancy in numbers, an Israeli military official suggested that natural occurring deaths in Gaza had been included in the Palestinian death toll numbers and that the total ratio of non-combatant to combatants killed was low. A spokesman for the Israeli military said it could not immediately make the list of killed Palestinians available and could not offer more detail on methodology.","Israel: ""Vast majority"" of Palestinians killed in Gaza were ""terror operatives""

"(CNN) -- In what was a bizarre, disturbing scene at Wimbledon, Serena Williams withdrew from her doubles match with sister Venus Williams on Tuesday due to a viral illness. ""I thought I could rally this morning, because I really wanted to compete, but this bug just got the best of me,"" Serena Williams said in a written statement. The Women's Tennis Association said in a release that Serena Williams, a five-time Wimbledon champion at doubles, had a viral illness. During warmups Tuesday, Williams stumbled around the court and looked disoriented. She had trouble catching balls thrown to her. Following the warmup, a tournament doctor examined her on the bench, at one point taking her blood pressure. During the 11-minute break, Williams put her head in her hands and appeared to cry. She decided to try to play, but it was tough to watch. At one point, Williams missed on a shot. When it was her turn to serve, it was an entire game of uncharacteristically wild double faults. At that point, the Williams sisters retired from the match, down 3-0. ""Unfortunately Serena has been feeling unwell for the past few days and she just couldn't play to her potential today,"" Venus Williams said. ""I'm really proud of her for trying.""

"(CNN) -- The attorney for the family of slain Ferguson, Missouri, teenager Michael Brown is coming down hard a local newspaper, accusing the St. Louis Post-Dispatch of reporting ""gossip and racist speculation"" instead of news surrounding the 18-year-old's death. Attorney Benjamin Crump is upset about the newspaper's pursuit of juvenile records on Brown, accusing its reporters of failing to apply the same zeal to obtaining background information on the police officer who killed Brown, Darren Wilson. ""In this new age, where there is a war being waged for clicks and eyeballs, it appears the Post-Dispatch has chosen to forgo its duty to report facts and provide meaningful context and has instead opted to pursue gossip and racist speculation,"" Crump said in an open letter to the newspaper's editor. ""This is deeply disappointing."" Telephone messages and emails from CNN to the newspaper's public relations office and editor were not immediately returned Friday afternoon. Brown died on August 9 in an encounter with Wilson that set off days of sometimes violent protests in the St. Louis suburb. The Brown family believes the teenager was unfairly killed. Wilson has not publicly given a statement, but police have said the two struggled over the officer's gun. Race has been at the heart of the case. Brown was black, like two-thirds of his neighbors in Ferguson. Wilson is white, like most of the city's police department. Michael Brown shooting: Is new video a 'game changer'? Crump's letter follows a decision Tuesday by a St. Louis County Family Court judge to deny the newspaper's request to obtain any juvenile court records related to Brown. Judge Ellen Levy Siwak did not explain her decision, the newspaper reported. A juvenile court official later told reporters that Brown had never been found delinquent on juvenile charges that would equate to the state's most serious felonies and was not facing any such charges at the time of his death. That revelation, the Post-Dispatch said Tuesday, ""put to rest claims by a California-based blog and others that Brown was facing a murder charge at the time he was shot to death."" However, Crump said the newspaper continued to press the case despite statements by police and in court that Brown was facing no charges. After Brown's death, police controversially issued documents alleging that he was a suspect in the theft of cigars from a convenience store shortly before he died, but he was not charged in that incident. Meanwhile, Crump said, the Post-Dispatch ""hasn't offered us a single new fact on Darren Wilson's behavior as a police officer."" ""Where is the petition for his employment records? Why stop there? Where are the lawsuits in pursuit of his employment records, police reports, memos and e-mails for the city and county police?"" Crump wrote.","Attorney Benjamin Crump says the newspaper has been biased in its quest for records .

"(CNN) -- When most people think of ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, the phrase ""devourer of worlds"" usually doesn't leap to mind. And yet, that's exactly how Len Peralta depicted him, and Yankovic says he got it right. ""Len's extremely talented. I think that he captured my inner essence as the devourer of worlds. He kind of brought that to light, which I'm very thankful for,"" Yankovic said. Peralta, a graphic artist from Cleveland, Ohio, is using his talent to complete the ""Geek A Week"" project: a compilation of 52 online trading cards featuring successful geeks and nerds. He's issuing one a week for an entire year; they can be found on geekaweek.net. He contacts heroes of the geek and nerd community, interviews them and then designs the front and back of a trading card. (He gets help with the text from collaborators Paul & Storm.) The geek celebrities who answer the Geek A Week call get Peralta's special treatment: He attributes superpowers or alter egos to the people he profiles, based on their interviews. ""He did incorporate some food into the image, and I've been trying to live down my food obsession ever since 'Eat It,' but I'm very happy with the card, and I think he did a great job,"" Yankovic said, referring to his famous parody of the Michael Jackson song ""Beat It."" The work is usually a collaboration. Actor Wil Wheaton wanted to experiment with duality on his Geek A Week card, so Peralta drew him as an evil twin, Peralta said. Some celebrities, like Adam Savage (of ""MythBusters"" fame), aren't completely comfortable with the first round of drawings. ""I thought his first illustration of me was a little too harsh and a little too evil and didn't quite look like me. So I ended up with my laptop and my webcam, posing with the very mask that I'm holding in the card, so that he could have a better drawing reference,"" Savage said. The resulting trading cards are colorful, artistic and as informative as any Magic: The Gathering, Garbage Pail Kids, ""Battlestar Galactica"" or ""Star Wars"" trading card. ""Trading cards is a really good idea. There should be something like this for every industry, like Wall Street ... or Congress,"" Trace Beaulieu said. Beaulieu helped create ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" (he also was the voice of Crow T. Robot in the 1990s television show) and is featured on Geek A Week with his current wise-cracking movie critiquing troupe, Cinematic Titanic. Beaulieu and Peralta were working together on another project, the recently published book ""Silly Rhymes for Belligerent Children,"" when Peralta mentioned his idea for Geek A Week. Consequently, Beaulieu played into Peralta's quest for contacting celebrity nerds. Beaulieu's MST3K mate Kevin Murphy (now with RiffTrax, also profiled in Geek A Week) was able to introduce Peralta to Grammy Award-winning parody artist and accomplished accordionist Yankovic for the project. Yankovic loved the idea of Geek A Week and was eager to help out a fellow nerd. He said the format of trading cards was a perfect platform for nerdy information. ""Collecting anything is really part of nerd DNA. Collecting and processing data, in and of itself, is nerd nirvana. 'Nerdvana,' "" said Yankovic, who considers himself to be generally a nerd but a geek about some things. ""A project about geek heroes, I think, is one way that people from that subculture can feel validated. They realize that there are more people like them, and here are these successful ones, and perhaps that will inspire them to greater achievement."" Savage agrees. ""Being a geek is all about learning the inventories of things. Whether it's instantiations of C++ or esoteric algorithms for programming or characters from 'Star Wars,' geek culture is really defined by esoteric inventories."" Peralta got in touch with Savage through mutual friends Paul & Storm. ""It's exactly the kind of innovative ambition that's awesome when you see someone do it. Len actually reached out to all the people that he's ever admired in the geeksphere and has managed to spend time interviewing them all,"" Savage said. ""I love everything about [Geek A Week]. The fact that the trading cards are a 'collect them all' kind of deal and the number of trading cards add up to the number of cards in a deck, it's all neat as you please,"" he said. Actress Felicia Day, mastermind of ""The Guild"" and known for her turn as Penny in 2008's ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog,"" was approached to be part of Geek A Week after her friends Jonathan Coulton and Wheaton re-tweeted their appearances in the deck. ""When he asked me what I wanted to do, I was like, 'Well, I really just want to be in space, or I want to be in a sci-fi setting.' The fact that he put me in one of the best video games of all time and as such an iconic figure -- I think he paired me with just the right thing to make me excited to see myself,"" Day said. Peralta admits that Day's trading card is one of his favorites. On it he references the Valve Corp. game ""Portal."" Thanks to his connections, Peralta has other big names in his Geek A Week stack, like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and filmmaker Kevin Smith, but he also includes plenty of geeks whom the general public might not know about. ""Everybody on my list is doing some amazing things in their field, whether it be blogging, whether it be entertainment, whether it be music or tech,"" Peralta said. ""It's kind of this exploration. If you don't know who a Molly Lewis is, then you should know. If you don't know who Monty Cook or Steve Jackson is, then figure out who that is,"" he said. According to Yankovic, a man who has made a career out of creating entertainment that's appreciated by nerds and geeks, Peralta's devotion makes his product more compelling. ""If a geek wasn't behind Geek A Week, I think you'd know. It would feel inauthentic. When I did 'White and Nerdy,' I think why it struck such a response with fans is that they knew I walk the walk. I wasn't singing about a culture I was unfamiliar with, I was basically singing about my life,"" Yankovic said, referring to another song parody. Fans of Peralta's project and the heroes he's profiling are sure to stick with it for all 52 weeks. In addition to the cards, the Geek A Week website includes podcasts of Peralta's interviews that give fans further insight about their heroes. As for spoilers about whose cards fans can expect to see in the coming weeks, Peralta was generally mum but very excited to share the fact that he recently interviewed author Neil Gaiman. The Geek A Week alums have their own hopes for who might show up on the trading cards: . ""Weird Al"" Yankovic (Geek A Week's ""Comedic songster/Devourer of worlds""): If you're talking about blue-skying it, I think probably Stephen Hawking would be a natural choice. Personally, I don't think they would classify as nerds themselves, but I think icons to nerds of my generation [are] Monty Python. That's sort of a right of passage for a nerd is to be able to recite ""Holy Grail"" word for word. Felicia Day (Geek A Week's ""New media actress/Test subject""): Stephen Hawking. He's pretty popular, right? Adam Savage (Geek A Week's ""Mythbuster/Jack Lint""): I would love to see a Guillermo Del Toro Geek A Week card. I think Guillermo is a dyed-in-the-wool geek. It just occurred to me, I know Guillermo. I think I'm going to try to hook him up with Len. Trace Beaulieu (One of Geek A Week's ""Master riffers/Monster hunters""): I don't know if Steve Martin is a nerd or a geek. ... He's an enigma. And what about the possibility of Geek A Week becoming honest to goodness, hard-copy trading cards? ""I get two or three requests a day to make hard copies. I'd love to. They lend themselves to it perfectly. Now, it's just a question of how we can make it happen. I'd love to see them, just like everybody else,"" Peralta said. ""They need to be packaged with really stale gum,"" Beaulieu added. ""And I would eat the gum!""","Hollywood has a thriving community of nerds, according to Len Peralta .
The trading card format conveys a lot of information to the geek audience .
Geek A Week brings successful geeks to a more mainstream audience ."
"(CNN) -- Extra-time goals from Mesut Ozil and Andre Schurrle spared Germany's blushes against Algeria in the World Cup last 16 tie at Port Alegre on Monday. Following 90 minutes of stalemate it was Joachim Low's side who finally broke the deadlock in the second minute of extra time when Thomas Muller squared the ball for Schurrle to cleverly back heal the ball past goalkeeper Rais Mbolhi. Ozil drilled in a shot to double the lead in the final minute of the second extra period before Abdelmoumene Djabou pulled one back for Algeria in injury time. It was a cruel end to what was a brave performance by Vahid Halilhodzic's side who were looking to settle an old score from the 1982 World Cup. Algeria were eliminated at the group stage at the tournament held in Spain after West Germany and Austria contrived a result (a 1-0 win to the Germans) which guaranteed both European teams would qualify for the knockout stages. Thirty-two years after the so-called ""Disgrace of Gijon"" it was fitting that Algeria's first last 16 match in the World Cup was against Germany. Spurred on by history, the Desert Foxes got off to a flying start and perhaps deserved more for their frequent early raids into the heart of the German defense. Islam Slimani served warning of Algeria's threat in the eighth minute as he scampered unchallenged down the left after a German attack broke down. The danger was only averted when Manuel Neuer rushed out of his area to tackle the Sporting Portugal striker. Nine minutes later Slimani looked to have scored his third goal of the tournament when he headed in El Arabi Soudani's superb cross, but was adjudged to be offside -- TV replays showed the referee's assistant had made the correct call. As the half wore on Germany came back into the game but were still vulnerable to the counter and were lucky when, in the 39th minute, Aissa Mandi's thunderous 25-yard drive ricocheted off the boot of defender Jerome Boateng and bounced narrowly wide. Moments later at the other end, Germany were denied themselves as Mbolhi pulled off an amazing double save from Toni Kroos then Mario Gotze. Schurrle replaced Gotze at the start of the second half -- a change which made Germany more purposeful in attack. In the 54th minute, Muller laid the ball on for captain Philipp Lahm whose shot from 18 yards out produced an outstanding fingertip save from Mbolhi. Algeria's rampant forays forward were less frequent but no less alarming for the Germany's back four who continued to struggle with Slimani's menacing runs. As the game entered the final 15 minutes of normal time it was Germany who increasingly looked likely to score. Muller looked certain to head in substitute Sami Khedira's cross in the 80th minute but could only fire straight at Mbolhi and ten minutes later Bastian Schweinsteiger missed the chance to head a late winner. Schurrle's 92nd minute strike calmed German nerves before Mehdi Mostefa got them jangling again eight minutes later with a close range strike which went wide. But when Ozil scored Germany's second in the 119th minute they were home and dry despite Djabou's late goal. Low's side can now look forward to a quarterfinal against France at the Maracana on Friday.

"Washington (CNN) -- Consider tonight's speech by President Barack Obama to be the antidote to his now-infamous comments two weeks ago that his administration lacks a strategy for combating ISIS in Syria. The beheadings of two Americans -- journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff -- have propelled ISIS into the center of the American public consciousness. The group is no longer a distant, local threat, but an immediate threat to American lives. Obama knows he must now give a comprehensive answer to this threat. Is ISIS a threat to the U.S.? First, he will need to explain to Americans to what degree ISIS threatens U.S. national security. The administration's current assessment is that, for now, it is principally a threat to the region, as well as to American diplomats, soldiers and other personnel based in Iraq. However, the U.S. intelligence community believes ISIS also threatens U.S. interests outside the region, including in the U.S. homeland. Gingrich: 10 questions for Obama on ISIS . Intelligence officials tell me that while ISIS is focused on strengthening the Islamic state, or caliphate, in Syria and Iraq, this does not mean its aspirations end there. ISIS is believed to be encouraging the many foreigners now fighting for it (including about a dozen Americans) and other sympathizers to carry out attacks in the West when they return home. When I asked Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel last week whether ISIS is a threat to the U.S. today or some day down the road, he said the administration doesn't have the luxury of making that distinction. ""We can't take a chance, Jim, on saying, 'Well, let's technically define this -- is it a real threat today or tomorrow, or is it going to be in six months?' "" Hagel said. ""That's the way the threats don't work in little, neat boxes and emanate on our time frame. They emanate on their time frame. We know they're a threat. We know they're brutal. We know that they are, as I've said, as others have said, something that we've never seen before."" What's Obama's strategy? Second, the President will need to lay out in detail his strategy for dealing with ISIS. This follows another confusing rhetorical moment for the White House. Obama is open to airstrikes on ISIS . Officials including the President now say the goal is ""degrading and destroying ISIS,"" but only after the President indicated last week that his goal may be simply to make ISIS a more ""manageable"" threat. Now that the goal is to defeat ISIS, exactly what steps will the President order to accomplish that? Sources tell CNN he is ""open to"" ordering airstrikes inside Syria. And Hagel told me in our interview that the Pentagon has already presented him with military options to do so. Kerry: 'Broad coalition' of nations will help fight ISIS . We also now know that the President is asking for so-called Title X authority to arm and train Syrian rebel groups. However, the President has said, and will likely repeat tonight, that military action alone will not accomplish his goals. He needs an international coalition, particularly involving regional states directly involved in the conflict. He needs a more inclusive government in Iraq. And he needs a continuing and broad humanitarian mission to serve the many Iraqis and Syrians that ISIS is driving from their homes, starving and murdering. Kerry's mission: Mideast buy-in for anti-ISIS efforts . How long will this fight last? Finally, Obama will need to explain to Americans how long and how intense this new war will be. He campaigned on ending the long American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Until very recently, his administration continued to emphasize that Americans are war-weary and that the administration was loathe to bring the nation back to war, short of very direct threats to U.S. interests. Remember the administration's -- also infamous -- mantra ""Don't do stupid stuff"" as the driving force of the President's foreign policy. Now, the President is taking the nation back to war. For how long? How costly will it be? As a candidate in 2007, he famously called Iraq ""a dumb war."" Why won't this war be dumb? Opinion: Could Obama's plan against ISIS spark backlash? Round-up: Did Obama sell his ISIS strategy?","Beheadings of two Americans put ISIS into Americans' consciousness .
Obama must explain to public the threat ISIS presents .
The President must also lay out what his strategy is for eliminating the ISIS threat ."
"(CNN) -- Another top Atlanta Hawks official is facing accusations of racism just days after the team's owner said he would sell his stake in the franchise after a racially charged email came to light. A letter obtained by CNN affiliate WSB details comments Danny Ferry, the team's general manager, allegedly made about player Luol Deng during a June conference call about free agents. ""Ferry talked about the player's good points, and then went on to describe his negatives, stating that 'he has a little African in him. Not in a bad way, but he's like a guy who would have a nice store out front but sell you counterfeit stuff out of the back,' "" said the letter from J. Michael Gearon Jr., a minority owner of the Hawks. The general manager also described the player ""as a two-faced liar and cheat,"" the letter says. ""We were appalled that anyone would make such a racist slur under any circumstance, much less the GM of an NBA franchise on a major conference call. ... Ferry's comments were so far out of bounds that we are concerned that he has put the entire franchise in jeopardy,"" Gearon wrote. In the letter, Gearon called for Bruce Levenson, the team's controlling owner, to ask for Ferry's resignation and fire him if he refused. Ferry, who remains the team's general manager, apologized for the comments in a statement Tuesday, describing them as ""insensitive remarks."" ""I was repeating comments that were gathered from numerous sources during background conversations and scouting about different players. I repeated those comments during a telephone conversation reviewing the draft and free agency process,"" he said in a statement released by the Hawks. ""Those words do not reflect my views, or words that I would use to describe an individual and I certainly regret it."" Hawks CEO Steve Koonin told CNN that Ferry had been punished ""in excess"" for the comments but gave no details. 'I'm proud to say I actually have a lot of African in me' Deng, now a forward for the Miami Heat, responded in a statement Tuesday. ""I'm proud to say I actually have a lot of African in me, not just 'a little.' For my entire life, my identity has been a source of pride and strength. Among my family and friends, in my country of South Sudan and across the broader continent of Africa, I can think of no greater privilege than to do what I love for a living while also representing my heritage on the highest stage,"" Deng said in a statement released by the Heat. ""Unfortunately, the comment about my heritage was not made with the same respect and appreciation."" Team officials discussing his free agency should have focused on his professionalism and athletic ability, Deng said. ""Every person should have the right to be treated with respect and evaluated as an individual, rather than be reduced to a stereotype. I am saddened and disappointed that this way of thinking still exists today. I am even more disturbed that it was shared so freely in a business setting,"" he wrote. ""However, there is comfort in knowing that there are people who aren't comfortable with it and have the courage to speak up. In the same way a generalization should not define a group of people, the attitude of a few should not define a whole organization or league."" Comments sparked investigation . After the June conference call, the Hawks brought in an outside law firm to review the organization from top to bottom in an investigation that took two months. That investigation turned up a racially charged e-mail Levenson wrote to Ferry in 2012, describing the troubles the franchise faced in attracting more affluent white season-ticket holders. The e-mail bemoaned the high percentage of black cheerleaders and said that white fans may have been scared away by black fans. ""There were 19 people interviewed, 24,000 pieces of evidence looked at, and in that discovery -- that internal investigation -- this email that we released this morning was found, from Bruce Levenson,"" Koonin told CNN's Martin Savidge on Sunday night. ""Bruce was confronted with this email from 2012, and he decided that instead of fighting it ... he thought it was best for the city, for the team, for his family, to walk away."" The reported remarks from Ferry sparked widespread backlash on Twitter, including criticism from NBA great Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson. ""Atlanta Hawks GM Danny Ferry should step down after making racist statements about NBA player Luol Deng,"" Johnson said in a Twitter post Tuesday. ""The city of Atlanta and the Hawks fans deserve and should demand better from the Hawks leadership. CNN's Kevin Dotson, Jillian Martin, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Holly Yan and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","Hawks GM Danny Ferry allegedly described Luol Deng as a ""two-faced liar and cheat""

"(Life by DailyBurn) -- Picture it: A four-day competition, with two to four workouts a day that consist of running, swimming, muscle-ups, 345-pound squat cleans, handstand push-ups, rope climbs, double unders, handstand walks, 245-pound overhead squats and more, against 43 of the most in-shape competitors you know, all with the title of Fittest on Earth on the line. Now imagine doing it four years in a row â€” and winning every time. That's what Rich Froning did as he secured his fourth consecutive title as the Fittest Man on Earth at the CrossFit Games this past July. DailyBurn: 5 beginner-friendly CrossFit workouts . Froning, who has been said to do up to eight workouts a day, had the pressure of 200,000 live spectators as well as the world watching on his shoulders (on top of 310-plus actual pounds) as he made his way through the grueling Games. We caught up with the four-time CrossFit champion to learn what it means to be the Fittest Man on Earth, his training and supplement regimen, and where he went for his celebratory burger post-Games. Can you put into words what it means to be the Fittest Man on Earth for the fourth year in a row? It feels good. It's what I train for all year -- it's the ultimate goal. The title's just the title. Winning the CrossFit Games is what I'm most happy about. Fittest Man on Earth is cool, but Crossfit champion is what I most like. DailyBurn: What HIIT is and why it works . CrossFitters say CrossFit is a great sport for anyone. Why is that? Do you think all people should try it? Maybe not even as a sport, but as a fitness program, it works. Pick things up and put them down; run; carry stuff. It's what our bodies were made to do -- not sit on a machine and do single joint movements. Those are good things if that's what you want to do -- it's better than sitting and doing nothing. People get too caught up sometimes in thinking the traditional CrossFit circuit is [all there is to it]. But CrossFit is lifting heavy weights, being strong...and it's also running, it's swimming, it's rowing, it's biking. It's getting outside the gym. I think we did a lot of outside-the-gym CrossFit this year, and that was a little different than years past. Picking up heavy objects and running with them, pushing the sled. A lot of us get caught up in just ""gym CrossFit."" Probably because it's fun. I like it, too. DailyBurn: 5 CrossFit workouts that will kick your butt . In terms of injuries, do you think a CrossFitter is his or her own worst enemy? What do you need to look out for so that you don't get hurt? Yeah, I think people start out too quickly and say things like, ""Rich does several workouts a day so I can do several workouts a day, too."" No, you need to ease into it and find a good coach. Plenty of people have started CrossFit without a coach and not got hurt, but the best-case scenario is doing it with a good coach and learning the right movements. And also, I hate to say it, but people sometimes think they're injured when they're really just sore. You have to be smart about the workouts, but realize you're going to be a little sore the first few times you do CrossFit. For me, doing bodybuilding-type workouts using single-joint movements led to more injuries and more flair ups than I've had doing CrossFit. I had shoulder surgery before I did CrossFit, and my shoulder has never been stronger, so I think it's great. Every day you're pushing your body to the limit and constantly challenging yourself. What do you do to recover? I continue to work out, which usually helps with the soreness, but maybe just take the intensity down. I feel better when I move. When I sit or don't do anything is when I get more sore or feel more sluggish. This year swimming actually helped a lot. It's a great workout, great breathing -- but doesn't beat you up as bad as say lifting a barbell 60 times over your head. So I'd say swimming was a good recovery this year. Do you take ice baths? At the Games I'll do some ice baths every once in a while, because this year it was hot, a lot hotter than the years past. It's just so much of a pain to do an ice bath at the house. Let's be honest...an ice bath is not pleasant. What workout supplements do you take? In the morning I don't really eat a lot. I'll take some type of creatine -- not a lot though. Then throughout the day I'll have a protein shake or two, depending on the workouts I'm doing. I usually don't eat that much during the day and then at night I eat a lot. What's a typical dinner for the Fittest Man on Earth? Anything. Whatever my wife Hillary decides to make, or we go out to eat. I'm not real picky and at that point, since I usually haven't eaten a lot and have been working out all day, food is food. Sometimes it's not that healthy. But I try not to be ridiculous. DailyBurn: Learn more about CrossFit and try a WOD . What was your celebration meal post-Games? Oh man, what did I have that night? I think it was a Five Guys burger. And then we had some pizza, too. You can't beat a good hamburger or steak -- some red meat, you know? What is a typical day at the gym like for you? Usually I wake up around 9 or 9:30, and I have a crew of people that I work out with. And we just kind of go by what we've done the days past or how we feel or what we need to work on, and do some type of workout. Then I'll do some strength training depending on what strength cycle I'm on, but really it's just how I feel or what we've done in days before or what has to be worked on. There's no real schedule to be honest. If you looked at any given day, it would be six or seven workouts, but really it's three or four sessions, that are anywhere from one hour to three hours...whatever we can get in. Do you still love CrossFit and working out or do you look at it as a job? Before the Games I looked at it as a job. Now I'm starting to have fun again, and enjoy working out and staying healthy. You've mentioned you're going to move over to teams this year. Are you not ready to be done with the sport, but individual is just too much commitment to do again? Yeah, that's basically what it boils down to. It takes a lot of sacrifice and a lot of hard work. And you've got to be a little bit crazy to be the best in the world at anything. We just adopted a baby girl and I don't to want to let other things sacrifice or that. I've made a good living for what I've done so far. But I want to have some fun on a team. I grew up a team sport guy and I want to try that aspect of it. DailyBurn: See the full interview with Rich Froning .","Rich Froning secured his fourth consecutive title as Fittest Man on Earth .

"(CNN) -- When Bob Bergdahl was formally introduced to America in the White House Rose Garden beside the President, he was startling to see and hear at first: He was wearing a long beard and even speaking Pashto. The transformation of the former UPS delivery man was five years in the making in the mountain valleys of Idaho, sparked when his son, Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, was captured by the Taliban in Afghanistan in June 2009. In the half-decade that he and wife crusaded for their son's release -- finally won this past weekend -- Bergdahl journeyed deep into the meaning of his son's captivity and war itself, according to media accounts. He immersed himself in books about Afghanistan and its Pashto language, to speak to his son's captors if only from afar. When it was over, he emerged as someone apparently transformed by his odyssey to save his son. ""I am your father, Bowe. To the people of Afghanistan, the same,"" Bergdahl said during the Rose Garden announcement of his son's release. His immersion into the Afghan mindset, however, hasn't gone unquestioned. His Twitter account posted a message expressing his intent to help free prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Bowe Bergdahl's release was secured after the Obama administration traded five terrorism detainees from Guantanamo in exchange for the U.S. soldier, which Republican leaders and others have criticized as negotiating with terrorists. Does Bergdahl swap set precedent? The tweet on May 28 was subsequently deleted. A military spokesman for the family, Col. Timothy Marsano, told CNN that the Bergdahls had no comment on the tweet and would not confirm or deny its authenticity. CNN has no way of independently confirming the authenticity of the tweet. Back in Hailey, Idaho, where the Bergdahls raised and home-schooled their son and daughter, residents strongly support the family and dismiss the anger over the prisoner exchange. The community has long maintained a yellow-ribbon vigil for the return of Bowe Bergdahl. ""I think that people need to take a little bit more time to stop and listen and understand the situation before they make snap judgments,"" said Minna Casser, 55, a caregiver and artist who has been living in Hailey for 15 years. In the past five years, Bob and Jani Bergdahl have been holding rallies, maintaining a website and lobbying congressmen in a campaign to win their son's freedom. In May 2011, almost two years into his son's captivity, Bergdahl made a YouTube appeal to his son's captors. The father had a long beard, but he didn't speak much Pashto at that time: ""We ask that your nation diligently help our son be freed from his captivity. I pray this video may be shown to our only son,"" he told Pakistani armed forces, apparently because his son's captors were moving him between Afghanistan and Pakistan at that time. ""We've been quiet in public, but we haven't been quiet behind the scenes,"" As recently as last January, Bob Bergdahl also spoke Pashto at a rally in Hailey. ""May the peace of God and blessings of God be upon you,"" he said in Pashto. ""After 12 years, let there be peace. Can we push this forward and make this happen?"" Bergdahl then spoke in English, delivering a message to his only son that revealed a mutual trial of the spirit. ""Bowe, my son, if you can hear me ... you are part of the peace process. You are part of ending the Afghan war. Have faith. Do good works. Tell the truth, and have the patience that can only come from God. We are being tested."" Bergdahl, 54, who retired from UPS after working there for 28 years, recently built a campsite with a tent and a wood-burning stove in the same birch forest in the mountains where his son used to play as a child, according to a recent videotaped interview with the U.K.'s Guardian newspaper. To reach the campsite, Bergdahl hiked in snowshoes with a backpack through the wintry summits. He's hoping his son will use the isolation of the camp to recover. ""I wake up each morning, and my first thought is, my son is still a prisoner of war in Afghanistan, and I need to do something about that,"" the father told the Guardian. Back at home, the family kitchen features a small shrine to their son, with a framed photograph of him in uniform along with a U.S. flag. Elsewhere in the home are stacks of books including one entitled ""Pashto"" and another called ""War Is a Lie,"" according to the Guardian. ""I'm trying to learn a little Pashto so that I can speak to people,"" he said in the newspaper interview. ""I'm trying to write or read the language. I probably spend four hours a day reading on the region and the history."" Stefanie O'Neill, a Bergdahl family friend, said those are the thoughts of a father fighting for his son's life. ""Wouldn't you try and connect with the people that had your child? Bob and Jani did everything possible they could to ensure Bowe's safety. And if Bob was trying to connect with them, it was to keep his son safe, I'm sure,"" O'Neill said. The family home sits high in the crystalline air of the Rocky Mountains down the road from the resort town of Sun Valley, a famous tourist and celebrity getaway for skiing and fresh air. Outside the house, Bergdahl rides a quarterhorse in the snow without a saddle. ""I don't think anybody can relate to the prisoners in Guantanamo more -- I don't think -- than our family because it's the same thing. My son is a prisoner of war, and wars end with reconciliation and negotiations with the enemy, and prisoners of war should be part of that dialogue, and I insist that it will be,"" Bergdahl told the UK news outlet. Bowe Bergdahl was officially classified by the military as missing/captured. Bob Bergdahl taught his son ethics from the classics. He and his wife moved to Idaho from California and built a two-bedroom house on mountain valley farmland near Hailey, the family told Rolling Stone magazine in 2012. There, the couple raised Bowe and daughter Sky. The parents are devout Calvinists who home-schooled their children six hours a day and taught them the theologies of Thomas Aquinas and St. Augustine. ""Ethics and morality would be constant verbiage in our conversations,"" Bergdahl told the magazine. ""Bowe was definitely instilled with truth. He was very philosophical about perceiving ethics."" His son's upbringing in mountainous Hailey may have helped the young man during captivity, Bergdahl told Time magazine in an interview two years ago. ""Idaho is so much like Afghanistan,"" Bergdahl told the magazine, citing the mountains of both. ""The similarities will help him. We hope that will be what sustains him."" It apparently did, though the captivity has taken a toll on the son, the father said. His son, too, became immersed in the language of his captors and now has trouble speaking English. The son's recovery will certainly take a long time, the father said. Bowe Bergdahl's return to the United States -- and reunion with his family and hometown -- have not been announced by U.S. officials. Opinion: Bergdahl still has a hard road home .

"(CNN) -- Washington state health officials have issued a warning to anyone who may have been in the vicinity of a particular woman at the end of March: You may have been exposed to measles, a highly contagious and potentially fatal respiratory disease. Privacy laws prevent them from showing you the woman's picture or telling you her name, so they're trying another tack: they're telling you where she's been. The Department of Health posted where she was virtually every hour of the day between March 26, when she became contagious, and March 29, so that you can determine whether you are at risk and possibly need medical attention. ""I've seen it happen pretty regularly when it comes to significant infectious disease circumstances,"" agency spokesman Tim Church said Tuesday when asked whether this was a unique approach to quelling a public health crisis before it starts. ""What's unique is the extent of the schedule this person had while ill,"" he told CNN. The 20-something Whatcom County woman didn't seem to be slowed a bit by the infectious disease. She kept a schedule that would be the envy of any healthy bon vivant. On Friday, March 28, for example, after working from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the at the Lynden Dutch Bakery (home of the ""world's best scones"" according to its website""), she made a stop at Lynden Wine and Spirits before checking into the Best Western in downtown Seattle at 7:15 p.m. She then took in the Kings of Leon concert at Key Arena -- about a 20-minute walk from the hotel -- until midnight. She kept the party going at a place called Wasabi Bistro until 3 a.m. before finally heading back to her hotel. The next day was spent traipsing around like an energetic tourist: lunch in Pike Place Market, then south to Tacoma to take in the LeMay car museum and a visit to a place called the Celebrity Cake Studio before bellying up at Harmon Brewing Co. and Eatery in Pierce County. Measles is so highly contagious that you can get it by simply walking into a room where someone with it had been hours before -- which is why her attending the concert is a concern. ""This wasn't a local bar,"" Church said. ""It was a major concert at a major venue."" Even though most people in Washington state are vaccinated -- 96% statewide by 6th grade -- Key Arena holds 15,000 people for concerts, signifying the potential for exposure, given some concertgoers may have been from out of state. ""It's a serious illness,"" said Church. ""Measles has a way of finding those who are not vaccinated."" There have been no linked reported cases thus far, according to Church. ""It's still early."" The department says the woman became contagious with measles on March 26 after visiting a local family member with measles linked to an outbreak in British Columbia. Fraser Health, the health authority in British Columbia, confirms 375 cases of measles as of April 8. Church would not pinpoint when the woman was diagnosed, only that it occurred between March 29 and April 2, when the agency posted her schedule online. ""Anyone who was in those locations at the listed times should find out if they have been vaccinated for measles or have had measles previously,"" the agency said. Those who aren't and ""develop an illness with fever or unexplained rash should consult a health care professional immediately."" As for the patient, Church says that she is recovering. CNN's John Newsome contributed to this report.","Measles patient's daily schedule published to alert those who may have been exposed .

"Washington (CNN) -- Richard Mellon Scaife, the billionaire publisher and banking heir who financed conservative causes that included attempts to discredit Bill Clinton while he was president, has died. He was 82. Scaife's death on Friday followed his disclosure less than two months ago that he had terminal cancer, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, one of his newspapers. He was heir to the banking, oil and aluminum fortunes of the Mellon family and used his estimated $1.4 billion wealth to underwrite conservative crusades and groups that included the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute and the American Enterprise Institute. Republican leaders mourned him. ""RIP Dick Scaife. Great newspaperman. Set the highest standard. True patriot for first principles we honor today. Prayers for his family,"" House Speaker John Boehner tweeted. During his time supporting presidential campaigns, Scaife first backed Sen. Barry Goldwater, a Republican from Arizona who lost to Lyndon Johnson in a 1964 landslide. Scaife would later spend more than $1 million to re-elect Richard Nixon to the White House before becoming a staunch backer of Ronald Reagan nearly a decade later. Scaife did not always toe the line on every front of the conservative movement. He broke with the Republican Party on abortion, legalizing same-sex marriage and the decision to invade Iraq in 2003. But the deeply private Scaife became a more widely known figure in 1998, when he became the face of what Hillary Clinton, first lady at the time, called the ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" bankrolling investigations into her husband around the time of his impeachment. He denied involvement. Scaife's regard for the Clintons apparently shifted years later when he reportedly donated $100,000 to the Clinton Global Initiative after having lunch with the former President. And in 2008, Scaife's newspaper even endorsed Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid. Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who helped lead the 90s-era charge to impeach Clinton, praised Scaife's patriotism. ""Richard Scaife was a remarkable patriot, philanthropist and conservative activist,"" Gingrich tweeted on Friday. ""His passing today is a great loss to America."" Scaife purchased the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review in 1969 and, while he used the paper's editorial pages as a bullhorn for his political views, the newspaper's staff attested to the mogul's love of newspapers. ""He loved newspapering more than anyone I've known,"" Frank Craig, the newspaper's editor, said in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review's obituary. ""No one on the staff took more pride in breaking important stories or winning major awards than he did. Many of his ideas and news tips produced some of our best coverage."" In the column announcing his untreatable cancer, Scaife wrote about his philanthropy and said none of the causes he supported ""gave me as great a sense of accomplishment as the newspapers."" While he supported a number of causes and institutions, Scaife also reportedly struggled with alcoholism for years and several family issues that pushed him into the headlines, including a contentious divorce with his second wife, which was finalized in 2012, according to media reports. Before inheriting his family's fortune, Scaife attended Yale University, but was expelled in his freshmen year when he rolled a beer keg down a flight of stairs and broke a classmate's legs, according to a 1999 Washington Post article. Scaife is survived by two children and two grandchildren. People we've lost in 2014 .","Scaife was heir to the banking, oil and aluminum fortunes of the Mellon family .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari would welcome back Ross Brawn to help turn around the famous Formula One team's flagging fortunes. As Ferrari's former technical director, Brawn helped guide the Scuderia to six constructors' titles as well as five world titles between 2000 and 2004 with Michael Schumacher. Ferrari's new team principal Marco Mattiacci revealed to CNN he would be happy to work with the English technical guru. ""Ross Brawn is an iconic figure at [Ferrari headquarters] Maranello,"" Mattiacci told CNN. ""Everyone would like to have Ross or would like to see Ross back at Ferrari. ""He's one of the most respected personalities in F1 with the highest knowledge and pedigree. Everybody would be happy with someone like Ross."" Brawn left his latest role as team principal of Mercedes in 2013 after taking the Silver Arrows to the verge of their most successful season in the sport since the 1950s. The German team is leading this season's team and driver championships with Brawn acknowledged as a huge driving force behind the success. In contrast, Ferrari has not won the team title since 2008 while current driver Kimi Raikkonen was the last to win the drivers' crown in 2007. Fernando Alonso continues to drive for the team, finishing on the podium twice this season, while Raikkonen has struggled to adapt to the feel of the car under 2014's huge rule changes. Ferrari would love to emulate Mercedes' sensational return to form, perhaps with Brawn's help. ""We've talked several times,"" said the Ferrari team principal, who took over the role following Stefano Domenicali's resignation in April. ""Ross has been at Ferrari. He came here with friends so it was very nice to spend a few minutes [together]."" Brawn is on a break from F1 after leaving Mercedes following a management restructure which saw former McLaren technical director Paddy Lowe arrive to lead the team alongside Toto Wolff. However, Mattiacci made it clear that any future for Brawn with Ferrari would not undermine his tenure at the top. Successful story . ""At the moment I am the number one on the team,"" the Italian insisted. ""I like to work with what I have. We are building a very strong team with a medium, long-term plan. ""My role is to shorten as much as I can this plan to make it effective as soon as possible. We are building the foundation for a very successful story."" Certainly, Mattiacci is a man who has created his own story of success up to this point, following a 15-year career with the Italian marque. Roles in Asia and Europe led to the 43-year-old becoming president of the North American business, where he picked up the 'Automotive Executive of the Year Award' following a 20% increase in sales. So global were his previous roles that he's currently readjusting to life back in Italy for the first time in 20 years, while his young family remain in the US. Critics argue Mattiacci lacks F1 experience, but for the man who lives by a personal motto of 'nothing is impossible', this is the time for the 'Prancing Horse' to be bullish. And key to rediscovering their 'self confidence' will be not to repeat the mistakes of the recent past. Ferrari failed to take advantage of 2014's new engine formula, which opened the door to catch up on its rivals, and engine chief Luca Marmorini subsequently found himself without a job. The Scuderia reportedly made another big money offer to Red Bull's star technical chief Adrian Newey this year, although he turned it down to stay on at Red Bull in a revised role. A much needed reorganization of Ferrari's technical department continues to be led by James Allison, who returned to the Italian team in 2013 from the Lotus F1 team. When asked if he was confident he might be able to tempt Brawn to also return to Ferrari, Mattiacci responded: ""As I said, at the moment I'm building a new team. ""James is the technical director and I want to start from this point. ""To tango you have to have two,"" the classical music fan told CNN. ""Maybe Ross is happy with what he is doing."" Brawn, who turned to his hobby of fly-fishing after leaving Ferrari in 2006, might not be fishing for a return to F1 or Ferrari yet. But if Mattiacci could persuade him to join the Italian marque he would have landed one of the sport's biggest catches.","Ferrari team principal says Ross Brawn is ""an iconic figure"" at the Italian Formula One team .

"(CNN) -- The statistics are devastating, but for aid workers like Faisal Kapadia and Awab Alvi, witnessing the despair from the Pakistan flooding was far more tragic than they imagined. ""You can see 8,000 to 10,000 people in Sukkur in the road, sleeping in the mud,"" said Kapadia, a resident of Karachi. ""All the people are sitting on the side of road, defecating there, drinking water there, living there."" Roughly 4 million people are homeless from mammoth flooding that covered much of Pakistan for three weeks. Hundreds of health facilities are damaged or destroyed. Millions are at risk for deadly waterborne diseases from the filthy flood waters. Officials estimate the death toll between 1,500 and 1,600, but Kapadia says he thinks the numbers could skyrocket as water recedes and more bodies and animals surface. ""Everywhere we go we see eight to 10 feet of water,"" said Kapadia, who traveled through inundated villages between Shikarpur and Sukkur. ""All we see are the tops of houses."" Just a month ago, Kapadia was a recreational rider in the 4x4 Offroaders Club of Karachi. He didn't expect to use his off-roading skills to deliver life-saving supplies to flood victims across nearly impassible terrain and waters. ""We never thought of that,"" Kapadia said. ""But when you see things happen like this, you can't just sit on the side and watch thousands of people die."" So club members, family and friends raised money for supplies to the neediest survivors. So far the 4x4 Offroaders Club of Karachi has distributed 100 tents and about eight truckloads of food. In Sukkur, where refugees are arriving en masse, the riders have distributed at least 400 hampers of food. Each hamper contains 5 kilograms of flour, 5 kilograms of rice, a liter of oil, salt, tea and water. But the work hasn't been easy. The stench of filth permeates the air. Skin blisters surface from temperatures reaching 48 degrees Celsius (118 degrees Fahrenheit). Kapadia said he can't shake the image in his mind of young children chasing him as he tossed water from a moving truck. The truck was moving at least 30 kilometers per hour, but he couldn't slow down. Mobs of hundreds have pounced on aid workers delivering food or water. ""It somehow gives the impression that these are greedy people,"" Alvi said. ""But it's not greed. It's desperation."" Hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis have acquired transmittable ailments such as acute watery diarrhea, scabies and respiratory infections. ""This is the desperation phase right now,"" Alvi said. ""I think a few weeks ... that's when the diseases will get worse."" Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani has called a Tuesday meeting of local and national health officials as well as United Nations agencies and other international groups to address the mounting health crisis. The UN says it still needs about $200 million for aid. Kapadia said he wonders why some aren't donating as much to Pakistani flood relief as they have to previous natural disasters, such as the Haiti earthquake in January. ""Maybe it's donor fatigue,"" he said. ""But that's no excuse."" Despite the heat, filth, disease and destruction, Alvi said he had no regrets about his decision to help. ""We could have stayed home and watched this happen on TV,"" he said. ""But someone has to take the next step.""","Thousands of people are sleeping on muddy roads .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The death of a teenage girl in a Welsh village in an apparent copycat suicide has raised fears she may have been part of an Internet death cult already blamed for the deaths of six young men. Natasha Randall, 17, who was found hanged in her bedroom in Blaengarw, near Bridgend, south Wales, on Thursday, was the seventh person believed to have killed themselves in the local area in the past 12 months, the UK's Press Association reported. Police are examining Randall's computer after the teenager posted messages on a social networking site, Bebo, prior to her death dedicated to 20-year-old Liam Clarke, who was found hanged in a Bridgend park last month. The message read: ""RIP Clarky boy!! gonna miss ya! always remember the gd times! love ya x. Me too!"" Messages have also been posted on Randall's page since her death, PA said. ""RIP tash - can't believe you done it!"" one said. Another read: ""Heyaa Babe. Just Poppin In To Say I Let My Balloon Off With A Message On It, Hope You Got It Ok And It Made You Laugh Up There."" Five more men aged between 17 and 27 have been found hanged in the area since January 2007. Speaking to the Daily Mail newspaper, Liam Clarke's father, Kevin Clarke, said the seven who had killed themselves appeared to have known each other. ""We don't know if it is some weird cult or copycat suicides or if they have had some bizarre pact to kill themselves,"" Clarke said. Superintendent Tim Jones, divisional commander of Bridgend Police, said the investigation into Randall's death would include examining her online contacts. ""There is a growing trend for young people to communicate through telephone text messaging and also over the Internet, whether it's e-mail or within chatroom forums. This is all part of conducting a thorough investigation,"" Jones said. A spokesperson for Bebo told CNN that it was committed to working closely with the authorities to provide any assistance which would help them with their inquiries into the suicides. ""The loss of any young life is always distressing. We have close relationships with our member community, law enforcement agencies, and public safety partners -- including Samaritans -- to provide support and advice for our users. We are committed to providing our members with the safest possible environment online."" Anthony Langan, a spokesman for the Samaritans support service, told CNN that links with Bebo had enabled it to reach young people via the Internet. ""Teenagers are one of the most 'at risk' groups and increasingly use the internet to access advice from support services which they may be less inclined to seek through other routes,"" Langan said. ""Suicide is an issue for society as a whole; the internet provides a window into the issues young people are dealing with.""

"(CNN) -- The announcement Wednesday of a diplomatic breakthrough between the United States and North Korea is a welcome surprise at a critical time. Not only are more than 6 million North Koreans facing food shortages, but also the window is quickly closing for the United States to have any leverage over North Korea's nuclear program, given the changing global balance of power. In exchange for an initial 240,000 tons of U.S. food aid and prospects for improving bilateral relations and returning to six-party talks, North Korea agreed to halt its uranium enrichment program, accept monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and stop testing its long-range missiles. Contrary to some media assertions that U.S. food aid has not been linked to denuclearization, Washington has stalled for over a year on sending food to North Korea, despite a direct appeal from Pyongyang, and after several assessments, including by the U.N. World Food Program, the European Union, and a team of five U.S. nongovernmental organizations, all verifying the urgent need. So what shifted? For one, the Obama administration appears to have concluded that the succession to Kim Jong-Un has been a smooth transition and that the imminent collapse of the North Korean regime is unlikely. It has likely realized that nonengagement has been a complete failure. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has refused aid, trade and talks with North Korea until Pyongyang apologizes for its alleged sinking of a South Korean navy ship and shelling of Yeonpyong Island. Not only has the opposition Democratic Party in South Korea called for an end to sanctions and closer ties with North Korea, even members of Lee's own party are calling for more engagement. Moreover, as China's trade and aid to North Korea have continued to grow, U.S.-led sanctions have not had their anticipated effect of undermining the North Korean regime. To the contrary, there are signs that Washington's ability to influence North Korea's behavior, including its nuclear program, is on the wane. According to Katharina Zellweger, the former head of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation who worked in North Korea for 15 years, there are rumors that China already has or is planning to send food aid and fuel, though the amount is unclear. ""Why would [North Korea] deal with the United States?"" she said. ""The train has left the station."" This week's diplomatic breakthrough may indeed be one of the last opportunities Washington has to influence Pyongyang's nuclear program. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it at a Senate hearing, ""The world is transforming around us."" Why, then, is North Korea making concessions to the United States? North Korea still needs the United States to lift its sanctions and to formally end the Korean War. According to the Korean Central News Agency, the United States affirmed during talks in Beijing that its sanctions were not intended to target the North Korean people and that once six-party talks began, priority would be given to lift the sanctions. North Koreans view resolving tensions with the United States as a crucial step to joining the international community, including being able to access loans from international financial institutions to recalibrate their economy. This point was made last year by former President Jimmy Carter, who explained, ""In almost any case when there are sanctions against an entire people, the people suffer the most and the leaders suffer least."" In the case of North Korea, Carter said that ""the last 50 years of deprivation of the North Korean people of adequate access to trade and commerce has been very damaging to their economy."" Most Americans don't realize that underlying tensions with North Korea stem from the unresolved Korean War, which ended not with a peace treaty, but only with a temporary armistice. We cannot lose sight of the fact that peace is the only solution to ending hunger in North Korea. North Koreans need food aid, but they also need an end to hostilities, the lifting of sanctions and a genuine engagement plan that includes a formal resolution of the Korean War. This week's diplomatic breakthrough brings us that much closer to realizing peace on the Korean Peninsula and gives hope that denuclearization there and elsewhere can be still achieved through diplomacy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christine Ahn.","Christine Ahn: Apparent breakthrough on N. Korean nukes comes at critical moment .

"Cartagena, Colombia (CNN) -- A group of Secret Service agents and officers sent to Colombia ahead of President Barack Obama were relieved of duty and returned home amid allegations of misconduct that involved prostitution, according to two U.S. government sources familiar with the investigation. The 11 Secret Service members -- both agents and uniformed officers -- were interviewed Saturday at the agency's Washington headquarters, after which they were placed on administrative leave, Assistant Director Paul Morrissey said in a statement. They are under investigation after preliminary findings revealed that they brought back several prostitutes to the Hotel Caribe in Cartagena, sources told CNN on Saturday. Also Saturday, the U.S. military announced that five service members assigned to support the Secret Service in its assignment have been ""confined to quarters"" in Colombia after they violated curfew and ""may have been involved in inappropriate conduct"" at the same hotel. The statement, from U.S. Southern Command, did not offer more details, including whether prostitution was involved. The command's leader, Gen. Douglas Fraser, said he is ""disappointed by the entire incident and that this behavior is not in keeping with the professional standards expected of members of the United States military,"" according to the statement. The alleged misconduct overshadowed the start of the sixth Summit of the Americas, where the president was to focus on trade, energy and regional security. None of the agents or officers being investigated was part of the president's personal protective detail and Obama isn't based at the hotel. But dignitaries and journalists reporting on the hemispheric meeting were staying there, a U.S. government official said. Obama: 'Hemisphere is very well positioned in the global economy' Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, was briefed on the matter and told CNN that the government personnel brought prostitutes back to their rooms Wednesday night and ""one of the women did not leave the room in the morning."" A hotel manager tried to get in the room, and eventually the woman emerged and said ""they owed her money,"" according to King. Similarly, U.S. government sources said there was a dispute between at least one Secret Service member and a woman brought back to his hotel over a request to be paid. At least one of the women brought to the hotel talked with police, and complaints were filed with the U.S. Embassy, the sources said. ""The Secret Service saw that report, and they immediately began an investigation,"" King said. A hotel staffer gave Colombian security personnel the entire list of U.S. government personnel staying there, said a U.S. military official who couldn't speak for attribution because of the ongoing investigation. A spokesman for Colombia's National Police declined to comment, referring questions to the Secret Service. King, the Republican from New York, said the issue isn't about any ""criminal allegations but a dereliction of duty."" ""My understanding is that there are no allegations of any crime being committed,"" he told CNN's Don Lemon. ""It violates the Secret Service code of conduct."" Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovon said that the group of agents in Cartegena were relieved of duty Thursday -- prior to the president's arrival in Colombia -- and replaced after ""allegations of misconduct."" The U.S. government sources said that, because the trip already had a large security detail, only some of the recalled agents and officers were replaced. Still, the sources said there was no threat to the president. Morrissey, the assistant director from the Secret Service, noted his agency's ""zero tolerance policy on personal misconduct."" He said that putting the accused employees on leave is ""standard procedure"" as the agency conducts a ""full, thorough and fair investigation."" ""This incident is not reflective of the behavior of our personnel as they travel every day throughout the country and the world performing their duties in a dedicated, professional manner,"" Morrissey said. ""We regret any distraction from the Summit of the Americas this situation has caused."" The U.S. military is conducting its own investigation and will mete out ""punishment, if appropriate ... in accordance with established policies and the Uniform Code of Military Justice,"" the Southern Command said in its statement. A senior military official and senior Secret Service official decided the five U.S. service members would stay in Colombia, confined to their hotel except for work-related business, because their ""special skills"" were still needed, according to a U.S. military official. Barred from contacting others about the matter, they will return to the United States with the rest of their unidentified unit at the end of the mission, according to the military. Ronald Kessler, a former Washington Post reporter who has written a book about the Secret Service, called the incident ""clearly the biggest scandal in Secret Service history."" The Washington Post, which was the first to report the story, said it was alerted to the investigation by Kessler. Jon Adler -- president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, which represents Secret Service agents and other federal law enforcement officers -- urged caution in jumping to conclusions, characterizing the incident as ""isolated"" and not necessarily a scandal. ""That's just sort of an overdramatic interpretation of an isolated incident,"" he said. ""We have to trust the process of the internal review."" While soliciting prostitution is legal in certain areas of Colombia, it is considered a breach of the agency's conduct code, the government sources said. High-level officials in the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security were outraged over the incident, the sources said, noting that the investigation indicated the prostitutes were brought back to a hotel that had been secured for the summit. The president arrived in Cartagena on Friday, the same day he first learned about the incident, White House press secretary Jay Carney said from the coastal resort city. Obama will spend more time in Colombia, where security concerns had limited previous presidential trips, than any other U.S. president. Two nearly back-to-back explosions in Cartagena -- which caused only minor damage and no casualties, Colombia National Police spokesman Cantihho Toncell said -- were a reminder of the violence that has gripped Colombia as its government has battled powerful drug cartels. Violence has significantly fallen off in recent years as the Bogota-based government, aided by U.S. extradition efforts, has successfully picked apart the cartels. Still, there is an extensive security presence in the walled colonial city of Cartagena for the summit -- including more than 7,600 police officers and thousands more troops. CNN's John King, Dan Lothian, Barbara Starr, Randi Kaye, Chelsea J. Carter, Mike Ahlers and Catherine E. Shoichet and journalists Jorge Baron and Fernando Ramos contributed to this report.","11 Secret Service members are interviewed and put on leave, the agency says .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of migrants departing from unstable Libya died in early October in a shipwreck while trying to reach Lampedusa, their gateway to Europe. But although their tale is tragic, it is far from exceptional. In the last two decades 20,000 people have perished from hypothermia, drowning, or landmines on the journey toward their ""European dream."" And while European Union institutions are beginning to address this history of loss, it is crucial that the discussion on asylum, immigration, and borders be further democratized. INFOGRAPHIC: How illegal immigrants enter the EU . These are defining moments shaping the future of Euro-Mediterranean geopolitics, democracy, and human rights. Members of the EU Parliament recently adopted a joint resolution calling for a coordinated approach to immigration and asylum, to be inspired by both intra-European solidarity and responsibility toward would-be migrants. Seeking to prevent further disasters, the EU's 28 heads of state have reached a consensus on the need to pursue activities that have long been in place. These include cracking down on organized crime; boosting search and rescue and Frontex border patrol activities; implementing the EUROSUR border surveillance system; cooperating with countries of origin and transit; collaborating with international agencies. Additionally, a new task force for the Mediterranean has been set up and is expected to offer operational proposals by December. Immigration and asylum will again be discussed at the next EU summit in June 2014 with possible legislative action at that time, when strategic guidelines ""in the area of freedom, security and justice will be defined."" Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta has also announced that his government is working on new national norms to regulate asylum. But he has dodged a crucial question -- whether forced migrants, including children, could be allowed to apply for temporary protection in Italy or elsewhere in Europe while still living in countries such as Libya. As a clear political direction and ""strategic guidelines"" are still to emerge at the national and EU level, civic engagement with these issues is vitally important. Demographic and economic disparities between northern and southern Mediterranean shores contribute to migration as an enduring condition. Post-World War II boundaries between forced and economic migration are increasingly blurred as terrorism, corruption, border disputes, trafficking, drought, and sectarianism displace millions of people south and east of the EU. Developing countries host 80 percent of the world's refugees, with Pakistan, Iran, Germany, and Kenya hosting the largest numbers. In protracted refugee situations, such as that of Somalis in Kenya, children are born to refugees who themselves were born in refugee camps. OPINION: Europe's immigration nightmare just beginning . What all migrants have in common is the hope for a good life. And a good life, for most of them, is not merely about remittances, but also civic and political rights and duties, and belonging to a community that accepts them and their children for who they are and who they become. Some are convinced Europe can offer this. Opaque technocracy, abstract humanitarianism, and militarization alone cannot provide answers to their plight -- answers must be political, and the EU's discussion in this sense is only beginning. A democratized discussion on borders, asylum, and migration would need to include a more grounded assessment of the costs and benefits -- financial and in terms of human rights -- of colossal projects including EUROSUR, Frontex, and EU Border Assistance Missions to non-EU countries such as Moldova, the Ukraine, and Libya. In the short term, small reallocations of the massive spending supporting these surveillance projects might enable the proliferation of initiatives akin to Germany's Humanitarian Admissions Program. This relatively modest, feasible program has recently flown to Germany in cooperation with the UNHCR for 5,000 Syrian at-risk women and children, people with serious medical conditions, and survivors of torture. For two years they will be integrated into the socio-economic, healthcare, and educational fabric of German cities -- and the program may be extended beyond that timeframe. OPINION: EU must solve crisis to deserve Nobel Prize . EU institutions are also recommending migration management agreements between the EU and transit countries. But several readmission agreements are already into force. They essentially oblige non-EU signatories to take back not only their own citizens, but also third country nationals. In renewing or promoting such agreements, the EU should better assess whether those countries offer a reliable state apparatus, a functioning asylum system, and the resources to adequately protect human rights. The EU also needs to consider whether the youth in non-EU signatory countries will continue to experience these agreements as disparaging and humiliating, or as equitable and mutually beneficial. More broadly, EU actors will have to decide whether the Mediterranean is to serve as an integrated space of common growth or as an insurmountable frontier. Both options have their costs. But in the latter case, everyone must appreciate the risk of more deaths at sea -- and billions of euros will need to be invested in permanent ""military-humanitarian"" operations. And despite the massive deployment of the ""Mare Nostrum"" Italian military mission off Lampedusa, transnational smuggler networks will look for other routes, as they have done for years, or alternatively bet precisely on patrol and rescue operations and ask inexperienced migrant themselves to take the helm of unseaworthy vessels. Either way, they will profit by gambling with the lives of thousands of people. OPINION: What's the place of outsiders in Europe? As consequential and costly decisions are being considered in Brussels and other capitals it is time for citizens and leaders to make a choice as to how they envision national and European liberal democracy. What is the place of outsiders? What is my legacy in writing the history of the present? What will I say to the children of the drowned? Survivors, human rights advocates, pluralists, Islamophobes, Eurosceptics, fiscal conservatives, post-colonial and ""second generation"" Europeans need to speak out now, engaging each other and their representatives. I admit I am not a supporter of European right wing parties, and I do believe their growing popularity cannot be challenged by merely adopting sanitized, ""light"" copies of their rhetoric. National and EU politicians have to pragmatically tackle the serious challenges faced by their constituents. But they also have to more courageously explain what their vision of Europe is, accepting that in a functioning, non-demagogic democracy making everyone happy is impossible. And yes, the EU has yet to win the hearts and minds of its citizens. It is precisely with our actions, relationships, voices, votes, and laws that we can help ground in democratic methods core EU ideals of freedom, security, and justice. If we fail, the ""European Dream"" will remain a scam marketed by smugglers and other dream dealers.

"(CNN) -- The northern Pakistani school where a teenage boy died while tackling a suicide bomber last week will be renamed in his honor, a top provincial official announced Monday. The school will be named after Aitazaz Hassan Bangash, the 14-year-old boy who authorities say saved an untold number of fellow students by sacrificing himself at the building's main gate, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province's chief minister said during a provincial assembly session. The ninth-grader was on his way to school January 6 in the province's Hangu district when the bomber, dressed in a school uniform, asked him where the school was, the teen's cousin Musadiq Ali Bangash said. Aitazaz challenged the bomber and tried to catch him, and the bomb detonated when the two scuffled, the cousin said. Aitazaz and the bomber died at the scene. Witnesses said the blast injured two other people. Iftikhar Ahmed, a Hangu district police officer, confirmed the details of the attack to CNN. Hangu is a troubled district bordering Pakistan's tribal areas. It is rife with sectarian violence, with attacks against Shia and Sunni Muslims. On Friday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif nominated Aitazaz for the Sitara-e-Shujaat -- the country's top civil award for bravery. The same honor was given to Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani schoolgirl who survived being shot in the head in 2012 by the Taliban for her efforts to promote education for boys and girls. The award is worth about $50,000 to Aitazaz's family. A separate civilian martyr package provides another $5,000 in compensation. CNN's Saima Mohsin and Karen Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: Bravery award will give boy's family about $5,000 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Groups representing federal air marshals and flight attendants -- outraged over the Transportation Security Administration's decision to allow small pocketknives back into aircraft cabins -- say they will ask the TSA to reconsider the policy. Both groups say they learned about the policy change Tuesday, and charged that the TSA is forgetting about the terrorist attacks that led to the formation of the agency. ""It's as if we didn't learn anything from 9/11,"" said George Randall Taylor, head of the air marshal unit of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA). ""Flight attendants are going to be sitting ducks."" On Tuesday, TSA Administrator John Pistole announced that small pocketknives and an array of sporting equipment -- which were banned from aircraft cabins in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks -- will be allowed in U.S. planes beginning April 25. Former TSA chief backs 'knife' decision; suggests axes and machetes, too . Pocketknives will be allowed if the blade is no longer than 2.36 inches (6 centimeters), which is shorter than the 4-inch blades that were allowed at the time of the 2001 attacks. And they must adhere to other rules: the blade can be no more than 1/2 inch at its widest point, it cannot have a locking or fixed blade and cannot have a molded grip. Box cutters and razor blades are still not allowed inside the passenger cabin. The TSA also will allow travelers to bring billiard cues, ski poles, hockey and lacrosse sticks and a maximum of two golf clubs into aircraft cabins as carry-on baggage. It will allow novelty and toy bats if they measure less than 24 inches and plastic bats if they weigh less than 24 ounces. Some experts say security improvements since the attacks -- most notably reinforced cockpit doors, better intelligence and motivated passengers -- have made the strict prohibition of small pen-knives unnecessary. But Taylor said he is ""appalled"" by the decision, and said air marshals are voicing their opposition to him. ""I've received probably over a hundred (calls from air marshals). They're very upset."" FLEOA President Jon Adler said the dangers extend beyond air marshals. ""Pistole's decision is putting my guys at greater risk,"" Adler said. ""It's not just the (Federal Air Marshal Service), it's all of my guys,"" he said, noting that law enforcement officers are allowed to carry weapons during commercial flights. A union representing 90,000 flight attendants called the measure ""a poor and short-sighted decision by the TSA."" ""Continued prohibition of these items is an integral layer in making our aviation system secure and must remain in place,"" the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions said in a statement. Pistole said the TSA sought to distinguish small pocketknives, such as those equipped with corkscrews, from sturdier knives used primarily as weapons. Screeners seize on average 47 of the smaller knives every day from Los Angeles International Airport alone, he said Tuesday. Opinion: Is TSA serious about letting people carry knives? The new rule will allow screeners to focus on finding explosive device components and other things that can be ""catastrophic"" to a plane, speed trips through security checkpoints and ""address the hassle factor,"" Pistole said. Pistole said his agency consulted with its federal air marshals and other experts before making the change, and that led to the continued prohibition of the sturdier knifes with short blades. ""Experts in martial arts and close-quarters combat talked passionately about some of these smaller (knives), even though they're smaller than 6 centimeters. Some of these knives are primarily weapons and do not serve the similar purpose as what you would call a small pocketknife. Some are for hunters, for skinning; some are simply for weapons. And so those will still remain on the prohibited items list,"" Pistole said. Box cutters are prohibited regardless of blade length, he said. ""I wish (the new rule) could be as clean as possible,"" Pistole said. But ""there's just too much emotion associated with particularly the box cutters, so those will not be allowed."" Although it was widely reported that the 9/11 hijackers used box cutters in their attack, the weapons were not recovered, and investigators believe other types of knives were used. ""Our best working hypothesis is that a number of the hijackers were carrying -- permissible under the regulations in place at the time -- permissible utility knives or pocket knives,"" a commission staff member said at a January 2004 hearing of the 9/11 Commission. A Leatherman knife was displayed during the hearing. The commission said its investigation found that ""at least two knives like this were actually purchased by the hijackers and have not been found in the belongings the hijackers left behind."" Immediately after the attacks, the TSA prohibited a wide range of items from aircraft cabins. But it has gradually been reintroducing some banned items such as cigarette lighters and matches. On occasion the TSA has expanded the list, as it did after a liquid bomb scare in August 2006 when it prohibited bringing large containers of liquids and gels on board aircraft.

"(CNN) -- Next week, the people of Scotland will vote on whether to seek independence from the United Kingdom, creating the world's newest country in the process. Recent polls suggest that this is by no means just a pipe dream of the Scottish nationalists, with the ""Yes"" campaign actually leading in one survey. But the results will be being watched far from Britain's shores; this is a decision that has potentially far-reaching consequences, especially within Europe. The referendum -- and the United Kingdom's clear willingness to abide by the results -- is a rarity among the world's independence movements. We're much more used to hearing about low-level armed conflict and even all-out war among regions seeking to split from each other. One nation that has grappled with periodic separatist violence is Spain, which may well be the country that will see the most immediate impact of a vote. Here, regional, historical and linguistic differences have spawned several strong separatist movements, and the Catalonia region plans its own referendum in November, despite Spanish court rulings that the process will have no standing. A strong vote for secession in Catalonia would send a signal that a democracy cannot afford to ignore and could be the first domino to fall. In Spain's Basque country, as it is known, a separatist movement headlined by the terrorist group ETA left hundreds dead before the organization abandoned violence in 2011, but calls for independence have not died down in the same way the violence has. If Scotland goes, expect the Catalans, the Basques, the Galicians and other Spanish regions to make a renewed push to split from Madrid. Disillusionment with central government has been compounded by the lengthy and painful European economic crisis (although some argue smaller countries have typically fared worse in times of trouble), and many regions with an eye on independence lament that they are being shortchanged by their central governments. That is the case in northern Italy, a part of the country that is more prosperous than the rest and with a reputation for more disciplined work habits than southern regions. The Veneto region, anchored in Venice, once the center of the powerful Republic of Venice, recently held its own unofficial online referendum. A majority said they want to split from Rome. But at its core, the question of independence comes down to more than economics. It is about two related questions: What are nations and states? And should the former always become the latter? After all, nationhood is in many ways about cultural issues -- a shared language, a shared history -- while a state is essentially a political entity. With all this in mind, it isn't surprising that the case for independence is often, to a large degree, emotional, an appeal to nationalist sentiment as much as to politics and practicalities. And it is also often fostered by a sense of injustice or even exploitation. Take the Bavarian separatist Florian Weber, who wants his region to split from Germany and is passionately cheering the Scots on to statehood, arguing that independence fortifies democracy, because ""the larger the political unit, the less chance individuals have of being heard."" Some Belgians might sympathize with the notion that bigger does not always mean better. The country is made up of the French-speaking Walloons and the Dutch-speaking Flemish, but the Flemish resent the outsize influence of French speakers. It is unsurprising, then, that calls to unravel the union emerge with regularity. These debates are taking place against a backdrop of a Europe where the entire notion of what being an independent country means is being debated, as individual states wrestle with how to define the role of the EU, with its Brussels-based bureaucracy, its vague and shifting foreign policy and economic powers and its distant links to the populations it is meant to represent. Will Europe's evolution create a whole new type of entity, a semi-independent nation-state, which surrenders some of its autonomy to a much larger supranational union? For now, the experiment is yielding mixed results, with financial crises undermining confidence in, and distracting from, discussions of greater integration. But with Russia's recent incursions into Ukraine, who knows how the debate will evolve? (Moscow will argue that the Scottish referendum is equivalent to Crimea's vote to join Russia, although few outside Russia see things that way.) Farther afield, in the Middle East, boundaries that themselves are only several decades old are being erased by, among others, ISIS even as the Kurdish people, spread across Iraq, Iran and Turkey, push for their own state. (Don't expect any referendums here. Such votes are more likely to remain the exception rather than the rule.) Of course, in a tumultuous, violent world, it is encouraging in Scotland's case to see peaceful, democratic means used to settle a contentious, high-stakes issue like the very existence of a nation. But if Scots really do decide to vote for independence, it is hard not to see it triggering a wave of separatist tension in Europe and beyond.","Scotland will vote in a referendum next week on whether to become independent .
Decision could have huge consequences, especially within Europe, says Frida Ghitis .

"Editor's note: Join Roland S. Martin for his weekly sound-off segment on CNN.com Live at 11:10 a.m. ET Wednesday. If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. A nationally syndicated columnist, Martin has said he will vote for Barack Obama in November. He is the author of ""Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith"" and ""Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland S. Martin says the McCain campaign has done Sarah Palin a disservice by keeping her hidden. (CNN) -- Is Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin running for vice president of the United States or vice president of the student council? Listening to some political strategists, pundits and radio and TV blowhards, you would think that all she has to do is show up, sign her name on the roll, and she's done enough to satisfy the requirement for president. Do people really and truly understand that she will be sitting a heartbeat away from the presidency, backing up a 72-year-old guy who has a history of cancer? Nothing drives me nuts more than listening to some of these folks who act as if we shouldn't expect Palin -- and Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Joe Biden -- to be well-versed on national issues, foreign policy and the social and cultural issues that have to define America. Conventional wisdom says that the vice president means nothing and that the voters going to the polls between now and November 4 are really voting on Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain. iReport.com: What would you ask Palin, Biden? But looking at the role that the last few vice presidents have played, especially Vice President Dick Cheney, it is clear that the VP can make a world of difference and that we should be demanding the tough answers to tough questions from both candidates. Now, the blowhards have been going on and on, suggesting that too much attention is being paid to her gaffes and not to those of Biden. True. But what we have learned this election season is that there are double standards. Countless folks have said that we all know McCain, and it's necessary to scrutinize every aspect of Obama. Really? I think if you ask the average person, they'll know a lot more about Obama's childhood than McCain, solely by the level of scrutiny. The truth is, the nation doesn't know much about Palin. And when folks don't know a lot about you, there is an expectation to get to know more. As for Palin, I fundamentally believe that millions of Americans want to know what she thinks about the critical issues of the day and not from reading cue cards. The McCain camp has done her a huge disservice by treating her like a Faberge egg, totally untouchable. She needed to do multiple media interviews and not keep an arm's distance from the media and, yes, the general public. Back to that low expectation thing. The reality is that the McCain camp and Republicans want that. Even Biden and the Obama camp are tamping down expectations, hoping that if the bar is set just above someone's ankle, it will be easy to cross. Hogwash. Now is not the time for low bars and low expectations. We need our candidates to think big and be big. They need to speak to our concerns and our fears. And yes, Biden has been around a long time, and many say they know what to expect from the loquacious one. But Palin must strut her stuff. Thursday's debate will not be read from a teleprompter. It won't be on cue cards. With the nation watching, she is going to put up or shut up. What is most at stake is whether she's the subject of further ridicule or can show Americans that she has a strong command of the issues. If she can do the latter, she validates McCain's selection. If not, she calls into question his judgment, and at this stage of the game, that is not a good thing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.","Vice presidential candidate can make world of difference, Roland Martin says .

"(CNN) -- The Israel Defense Forces said Wednesday it intercepted an Iranian shipment of ""advanced"" weapons bound for ""terrorist organizations"" operating in Gaza. The Israeli navy stopped a Panamanian-flagged civilian cargo ship and boarded the vessel, the IDF said. The weapons found were identified as Syrian-manufactured surface-to-surface rockets, IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said. It was an Iranian shipment headed for Gaza, the IDF said, citing intelligence. Tehran offered no immediate comment on the incident. According to state media in Iran, military officials denied the reports. ""This allegation is merely based on repetitious and baseless fabrications of the Zionist media,"" said Hossein Amir Abdollahian, the deputy foreign minister for Arab and African Affairs. The boarding took place in international waters about 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) off the coast of Eilat, Israel, between Sudan and Eritrea in the Red Sea, Lerner said. Asked why Iran didn't try to send its own missiles to Gaza, the IDF spokesman said Tehran was doing everything possible to cover up its role in the shipment of weapons. ""The IDF will continue to operate against the Iranian attempts to arm regional terrorist organizations, who intend to continuously ignite our borders,"" Lerner said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the weapons shipment was organized by Iran. ""At a time when it is talking to the major powers, Iran smiles and says all sorts of nice things, the same Iran is sending deadly weapons to terrorist organizations and is doing so via a ramified network of secret operations in order to send rockets, missiles and other deadly weapons that will be used to harm innocent citizens,"" Netanyahu said in a statement. A spokesman for Gaza's interior ministry said the Israeli action was merely a justification for an ongoing blockade around Gaza. ""The Palestinian resistance is not naive to send this amount of weapons through the sea while it is totally under siege in the Gaza strip,"" spokesman Islam Shahwan said. Earlier Wednesday, the IDF reported that it stopped two suspects affiliated with Hezbollah from planting a bomb near the Israel-Syria border. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.","NEW: Iranian state media cites sources who knock down the report .

"Punjab province, Pakistan (CNN) -- Monsoon has many translations in the various languages spoken across South Asia. But words alone cannot describe its power and splendor -- it's a necessary force of nature, thundering life back into fields parched by endless days of summer, where the rains create lush landscapes of vivid greens and intense marigold. It is awaited with bated breath; people anticipate the storm, welcome it and embrace its fury. This year the monsoon rains came late but when they did it was with an unrelenting force that brought massive flooding to parts of Pakistan-administered Kashmir and across the plains of Punjab province, wreaking devastation and disaster along the way. So far, more than 400 people have been killed across India and Pakistan, with tens of thousands more displaced. According to Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority, ""exceptionally heavy to very heavy rains from September 4 to 7 resulted in exceptionally high flood discharges at various control points on the River Chenab."" The rains have now eased, leaving behind the deep waters from this year's deluge. On our journey to the city of Jhang in southern Punjab, the road passes along the River Chenab, which literally translates as Moon River. The river has swollen and swallowed entire towns -- and livelihoods. At one point, we see the dome of a mosque peeking up through the waters as displaced families stand helplessly with their livestock on higher ground nearby wondering where to camp for the night. Relief camps . On the outskirts of Jhang, a relief camp has been set up by the government. Men mill around by the roadside while the women sit inside the canvas tents, their children running around outside in the foggy heat -- the humidity seems so thick one could slice it with a knife. Pakistan last suffered from massive floods in 2010 when close to one fifth of the country was submerged underwater. This year's flooding is not as devastating but the outlook is still quite grim. Thirty-five-year-old Mansabdar is angry. Forced to find shelter in the camp, the rage and desperation is palpable in his voice: ""I have nine children, we have been out here for six days. I took nothing with me, we've only been given water and some rice by the authorities. My village is underwater. When will I be able to go back home?"" Just a few kilometers away from the camp, under an awning, sit representatives from Imran Khan's Movement for Justice party, an indication of how this calamity is slowly becoming politicized. The city of Jhang lies closest to Trimmu Barrage, through which the Chenab flows. This barrier, which is in place to stem flooding and aid irrigation, has a capacity of 600,000 cusecs, or cubic feet per second, which is the measure for the flow rate of water. But according to Pakistan's National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA), on the evening of September 12, close to 800,000 cusecs of water will pass through the barrage, causing flooding in the surrounding districts of Multan, Muzafargarh, Khanewal, Jhang and Toba Tek Singh. Helicopter perspective . CNN was given access to a military rescue helicopter that flew over the flooded areas close to Jhang and near the head of Trimmu Barrage. The muddy waters that had inundated roads, villages and homes went on as far as the eye could see. Our helicopter eventually descended close to the head of the barrage to deliver engines for rescue boats. Lines of tents had been set up on a narrow strip of land along the barrage for the many displaced people in the area. Farzana stood nearby holding her baby; she had left her home only a day ago. ""We didn't pick up anything,"" she said. ""We scooped up our children in our arms and fled."" A group of young boys holding metal water containers dipped their feet into the water. ""School's out"" they said, ""but we miss home."" According to Asif Mughal, an activist for the education campaign Alif Ailaan, 948 schools have closed down in the district of Jhang alone. The government ordered them to be closed on September 5. It will take close to 20 days for them to reopen, though ""nothing is certain yet,"" said Mughal. The scale of the crisis is such that NDMA has now requested assistance from the United National Development Project (UNDP). Fatima Inayet, a UNDP spokesperson, told CNN ""the UN is discussing with the NDMA the possibility to support the government in carrying out an immediate and detailed assessment."" Until then, many ordinary Pakistanis are on their own. As dusk settled on the road to the city of Multan, which lies to south-west of Jhang, two young men using rubber tires to stay afloat took advantage of the fact that the fish farms nearby had broken open to catch some carp. ""It's the easiest access to food,"" Shaukhat told CNN. ""We don't know when this is going to end, we must make do with what we get.""","This year the monsoon rains came late but when they did it was with unrelenting force .

"(CNN) -- Inside a dilapidated warehouse, underneath scattered clothes hanging from rusty pipes, a young black man is down on his knees. His feet are naked, his trousers rolled up to his knees as he beats his sodden shirt against the ground to remove the dirt from it. Near him, a cluster of men cut desolate figures -- some of them crouching down to wash their worn-out clothes, some standing, naked, trying to clean up their work-wasted bodies. This is not a scene from prison life -- but it might as well have been. Instead, this is a communal shower room for mineworkers in South Africa under apartheid as captured by pioneering photographer Ernest Cole some five decades ago. A tiny man -- barely five feet tall -- with a great eye for detail, Cole was one of South Africa's first black photojournalists. His captivating and often clandestine images documented different aspects of black life under apartheid, opening a window into the oppression and economic inequality endured by his people during that brutal era, including mineworkers forced to live in squalid conditions. In 1967, one year after leaving South Africa to go into exile, Cole published his first and only photo book, entitled ""House of Bondage."" The book, which was banned in South Africa, quickly sold out and received great critical acclaim. But despite the initial success, Cole died destitute and lonely in New York in 1990 and until recently his story was largely unknown. Yet in recent years, Cole's work has received renewed recognition, with several exhibitions in South Africa and abroad. And now, New York University's Grey Art Gallery is the latest institution to commemorate his ground-breaking work by hosting the first solo touring museum exhibition of 120 rare black-and-white gelatin silver prints from Cole's archive at the Hasselblad Foundation in Gothenburg, Sweden. ""Ernest Cole's life and work were dominated by the apartheid system,"" says Gunilla Knape, curator of the exhibition that runs until December 6. ""It was the theme of his most important photographic work, it was the reason for his going into exile and becoming a stateless, but recognized, stranger in the world,"" she continues. ""The story of Ernest Cole is very little known and this exhibition is an attempt to shed light on his life and work, and to make part of a large collection of his photographs available to a broad international audience, not the least in Cole's native country."" Dangerous mission . The son of a tailor and a laundry woman, Cole was born in Eersterust, a black freehold township near Pretoria, in 1940. The fourth of six children, he grew up living in the countryside with an aunt because his parents wanted to protect him from crime in urban townships. Cole reunited with his parents as a teenager and it was then that his interest in photography began. Aged 15, Cole received his first camera from a family friend, and from then on he would carry it everywhere, always taking pictures of friends, relatives and people in his community. In 1958, Cole started working as a darkroom and layout assistant at Drum Magazine, a radical black lifestyle publication in Johannesburg. He also enrolled in a correspondence photography course from the New York Institute of Photography before leaving Drum in 1960 to work as a chief photographer on a weekly South African newspaper and as a freelancer for the international press. During that period, Cole came across the photo essays of Henri Cartier-Bresson, the celebrated French photographer. Inspired by Cartier-Bresson's style, especially his refusal to crop his images, Cole set out on a dangerous mission to capture the injustice of the apartheid system and communicate it to the people outside South Africa. ""He had an intention to make stories that would enlighten the world about what was happening in South Africa,"" says Knape. ""His mission was to get change through his pictures."" Powerful photographs . To achieve his goal, Cole would often use covert tactics such as working without flash and sneaking his camera inside lunch bags whenever he visited mines or prisons. Pretending that he was an orphan, he even managed to convince authorities to reclassify him as colored (mixed race), a deception that gave him more freedom to travel in areas where black people were required to carry a permit. Subtle yet incendiary, Cole's powerful photographs offer a stark insight of what it meant to be black under apartheid -- there are pictures of townships being bulldozed to make way for white settlements; of benches marked ""Europeans only;"" of crammed commuter trains; of handcuffed black men arrested for being in white areas without a pass; of downtrodden mineworkers enduring humiliating examinations and dehumanizing living conditions. Other, happier, photographs include those of children playing with water cannons, friends sharing laughs and couples dancing. ""He was living with his people,"" says Knape. ""He was documenting their struggles, their joys and everything, so he really knew what was going on around him."" In 1966 Cole was arrested with a group of street gangsters with whom he'd built a relationship so he could capture their lives. The police told him he'd need to become an informant to avoid jail time, so Cole decided to flee South Africa, taking little more than the layouts for his book with him. But life in exile -- first in Europe and then in the United States -- was painful for Cole. Penniless and lonely, he spent much of the remainder of his life living on the streets and subways of New York. He died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 49 in February 1990, one week after the release of Nelson Mandela from prison.

"Beijing (CNN) -- The trial of Bo Xilai, a former darling of the all-powerful Communist Party, will begin Thursday, China's state-run Xinhua news agency said. Authorities claim Bo abused his official state position to seek financial benefits, resulting in ""huge losses to the nation and the people."" He is charged with bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power, the Jinan Intermediate People's Court said Sunday. A source close to the Bo family for decades said this month the claims are ""ridiculous."" ""The charges go way back when Bo was in Dalian,"" the source said. ""That's more than 20 years ago. So they cannot find anything more recent?"" The trial begins another chapter in a gripping tale of murder, betrayal and political factionalism. It caps the biggest political scandal to hit China in decades. READ MORE: Bo Xilai indicted for corruption . Until March 2012, the charismatic, populist leader was a member of the policy-making politburo of the Communist Party and party chief of Chongqing, a megacity in southwestern China. Bo, 64, is currently in detention. He has not been seen in public since news of the scandal emerged, and he was stripped of his role as Chongqing party chief and later his prestigious politburo post. TIMELINE: Bo's fall from grace . According to the indictment documents, as a civil servant he took advantage of his position to seek profit from others and accepted an extremely large amount of money and properties, Xinhua reported. The documents don't quantify the amount of bribes allegedly accepted, but published reports say it could be as much as 20 million yuan ($3.3 million). What are the allegations about? Concrete details are not forthcoming. Bo's lawyer did not respond to request for comments, but sources close to Bo who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case, gave CNN their thoughts on how he is preparing to defend himself. The accusations, according to those sources, may be linked to the case of Xu Ming, a multi-millionaire entrepreneur who owned several companies in Dalian, a bustling port city in eastern China where Bo Xilai served as mayor for nearly nine years. Xu has not been seen for more than a year and is believed to be under detention for alleged corruption. The sources believe that, of the 20 million yuan in alleged bribes, 16 million ($2.6 million) may be related to the purchase of a house in Nice, France that Xu bought some years ago. Prosecutors may allege that Xu gave the house to Bo's wife and son. ""The Bo family says they are aware that Xu bought such a house, but they have no connection with its purchase and ownership. It's believed to be an old house that Xu may have bought as an investment or for use as vacation house,"" one source said. READ MORE: Bo's wife convicted of murder . What punishment awaits Bo? China's legal system gives much discretion and flexibility to the local courts in imposing punishment. For the same charge of bribery, for example, Zheng Xiaoyu, former head of the State Food and Drug Administration, was convicted in 2007 of taking more than six million yuan (about $1 million) in bribes. He was sentenced to death and executed later that year. In 2009, however, Chen Tonghai, former chairman of Chinese oil giant Sinopec, was convicted of taking 196 million yuan ($31 million) in bribes. He was given a suspended death sentence. Family sources say while they worry for his life, they want Bo to be ""strong-willed."" ""We hope he will not fall for any offers of compromise or blackmail, like if you co-operate we will leave your son out of this, or will give you and your wife leniency."" READ MORE: Bo's son submits statement in mother's defense . They are also concerned about the in-fighting at the top leadership and its impact on how Bo's case will be settled. ""Although Bo may not be sentenced to death, we still worry,"" the sources said. ""It is also far from over for (Bo's wife) Gu Kailai, who is serving suspended sentence. They still hold much leverage.""","Source close to Bo Xilai's family reject charges against him .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The trigger of China's biggest political scandal in a generation, Wang Lijun was once a feared police chief whose crime fighting exploits inspired a TV series. He is now serving a 15-year prison sentence after being found guilty in September 2012 of abuse of power, defection and bribe taking. Wang's fall from grace began in early February of that year when he arrived at the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu in southwestern China in an apparent asylum attempt. During a frenzied 24 hours, he reportedly revealed to U.S. officials a jaw-dropping tale of corruption and murder in the nearby municipality of Chongqing involving his boss and the city's mayor, Bo Xilai. Bo, a charismatic and popular leader, was a contender for a top position in the Communist Party. Wang was later collected by central government authorities, and city officials said he had gone on medical leave following ""immense mental stress."" The dramatic events unleashed by Wang threatened to derail the once-in-a-decade leadership transition at the end of 18th Communist Party Congress. However, before the November 2012 Congress, officials charged Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, and a family aide with ""intentional homicide."" After a two-day trial in August of the same year, she was found guilty of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood, once a friend of the Bo family. Gu was given a suspended death sentence, the aide was sentenced to nine years in jail. The following month Bo was expelled from the Communist Party and relieved of his duty. In July 2013, state media said he had been indicted for bribery, corruption and abuse of power. Timeline: Bo Xilai's fall from grace . Wang's rise to prominence . Wang was born in a remote corner of Inner Mongolia and spent two years as a ""rusticated youth"" during the Cultural Revolution in the 1970s. He first crossed paths with Bo in the northeastern province of Liaoning where he had worked his way up the region's public security bureau and Bo was governor. After Bo was promoted to the top job in Chongqing in 2007, Wang followed him and was assigned to lead his crime-fighting program. Under Wang, the ""da hei"" (literally translated as ""smash black"") campaign reportedly caught nearly 3,000 criminal groups and detained thousands of suspects. It also led to the execution of notorious figures in the city's underworld. The crackdown, along with economic reforms in the city of more than 30 million, helped burnish the political credentials of Bo, who aspired for a spot in the Party's Standing Committee of the Politburo, a nine-member body that effectively rules China. Allegations of torture . Wang's heavy-handed, crime-busting methods were decried as brutal by critics. At the height of the campaign, Beijing-based lawyer Li Zhuang defended an alleged gang member and discovered police torture during interrogation. ""For eight days and eight nights, my client was repeatedly hung from the ceiling,"" Li recalled in an interview with CNN. ""He eventually soiled himself. His interrogators ordered him to remove the feces on the floor with his bare hands and use his shorts to wipe it clean. Then they hung him up naked."" As he tried to expose the interrogators' crimes, Li said, he was detained, tortured and promptly sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison under the direct order of Wang for ""fabricating evidence and inciting witnesses."" Wang was also known for his unconventional working style and according to the Chongqing Commercial News, once worked as a taxi driver to gauge public opinion on local security and police issues. The most hated figure? Wang's two-day trial took place in Chengdu in September 2012. He faced four charges -- bending the law for selfish ends, defection, abuse of power and bribe taking. Some observers said his15-year jail term appeared lenient given that bribe-taking can carry the death penalty in China, depending on the amount involved and the gravity of the case. Prosecutors said that Wang knew that Gu was involved in the murder of Heywood but covered up for her. They added that Wang used illegal surveillance measures, forged documents and accepted massive bribes to secure benefits for other individuals. Political observers have said that Wang, not Bo, ""is probably the most hated"" figure in the eyes of the Beijing leadership for attempting to defect.

"(CNN) -- The Los Angeles coroner has concluded preliminarily that singer Michael Jackson died of an overdose of propofol, a powerful sedative he was given to help him sleep, according to court documents released Monday. A search warrant filed in court showed toxicology reports found propofol in Michael Jackson's body. Los Angeles coroner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran reached that preliminary conclusion after reviewing toxicology results carried out on Jackson's blood, according to a search warrant and affidavit unsealed in Houston, Texas. The affidavit, used to outline probable cause for search warrants of the offices of doctors who are believed to have treated Jackson, disclosed many details of drugs given to Jackson in the weeks before his death. Jackson family lawyer Londell McMillan said the report ""reaffirms the very sad reality that there was a tragic and gross violation of duty and care for Michael Jackson."" The publicist for Jackson's family said the ""family looks forward to the day that justice can be served."" ""The Jackson family has full confidence in the legal process, and commends the ongoing efforts of the L.A. County Coroner, the L.A. District Attorney and the L.A. Police Department,"" the statement said. The Associated Press is quoting a single law enforcement official, who said the L.A. County Coroner ruled Michael Jackson's death a homicide. The Los Angeles County Coroner's office told CNN they had ""no comment"" on the report. An LAPD spokesman said the story did not come from their department. ""We will not comment on the ""anonymous"" law enforcement source that claims that Michael Jackson's death will be ruled a homicide,"" Murray's lawyer Ed Chernoff said in a statement on his firm's Web site. ""Most of the reports by ""anonymous"" sources have been proven wrong. We will be happy to address the Coroner's report when it is officially released."" The 32-page warrant said Dr. Conrad Murray, Jackson's personal physician, told a detective that he had been treating Jackson for insomnia for six weeks. Murray said each night he gave Jackson 50 mg of propofol, also known as Diprivan, diluted with the anesthetic lidocaine via an intravenous drip.  Watch what court documents show about Jackson's last hours » . Worried that Jackson may have been becoming addicted to the drug, the Houston cardiologist said he attempted to wean him from it, putting together combinations of other drugs that succeeded in helping Jackson sleep during the two nights prior to his death. On June 22 Murray said he gave Jackson a cocktail of drugs similar to what he gave him on the day he died, June 25 -- propofol, Ativan and Versed, which helped the star fall asleep, according to the documents. On June 23 he gave Jackson only the Ativan and Versed, which helped him sleep. But on June 25, other drugs failed to do the job, as Murray recounted to detectives in an hour-by-hour account detailed by detective Orlando Martinez of the Los Angeles Police Department:  Learn more about the events of the night Jackson died » . -- At about 1:30 a.m., Murray gave Jackson 10 mg of Valium. -- At about 2 a.m., he injected Jackson with 2 mg of the anti-anxiety drug Ativan. -- At about 3 a.m., Murray then administered 2 mg of the sedative Versed. -- At about 5 a.m., he administered another 2 mg of Ativan. -- At about 7:30 a.m., Murray gave Jackson yet another 2 mg of Versed while monitoring him with a device that measured the oxygen saturation of his blood. -- At about 10:40 a.m., ""after repeated demands/requests from Jackson,"" Murray administered 25 mg of propofol, the document said. ""Jackson finally went to sleep and Murray stated that he remained monitoring him. After approximately 10 minutes, Murray stated he left Jackson's side to go to the restroom and relieve himself. Murray stated he was out of the room for about two minutes maximum. Upon his return, Murray noticed that Jackson was no longer breathing,"" the affidavit said. Efforts at CPR proved fruitless, according to Murray. Shortly after Murray said he found Jackson not breathing, Murray was on the phone with three separate callers starting at 11:18 a.m. and ending at 12:05 p.m., according to the court documents which cite the doctor's phone records. ""Murray didn't tell this to anyone when he was interviewed,"" the court documents said. Chernoff denied the timeline referenced in the affidavit. ""Much of what was in the search warrant affidavit is factual. However, unfortunately, much is police theory. Most egregiously, the timeline reported by law enforcement was not obtained through interviews with Dr. Murray, as was implied by the affidavit,"" the statement said. ""Dr. Murray simply never told investigators that he found Michael Jackson at 11:00 a.m. not breathing. He also never said that he waited a mere 10 minutes before leaving to make several phone calls. In fact, Dr. Murray never said that he left Michael Jackson's room to make phone calls at all."" The document also cited reports from staff at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center, where Jackson's body was taken, who said Murray ""admitted"" to having given Jackson flumazenil to counteract the Ativan. The document lists another five doctors and a nurse practitioner who reportedly treated Jackson. ""Detectives ... believe that the miscellaneous prescriptions, from multiple doctors ... could have contributed to his death,"" the document said. ""It cannot be determined whether the cause of death is due to the actions of a single night and/or a single doctor, or the grossly negligent treatment of several doctors over an extended period of time."" According to the warrant and affidavit, Murray said he was not the first doctor to give Jackson the powerful anesthetic, which the singer called his ""milk."" The drug has a milky appearance. Jackson also told Murray about two unknown doctors in Germany who gave him propofol, according to documents. Documents show police found eight bottles of propofol inside Jackson's home. A search of Murray's doctor bag, which he left at the house the day Jackson died, contained multiple bottles/vials of Lidocaine and several bottles/vials of propofol, Ativan, Versed and Anexate, according to the documents. The affidavit said a search of Jackson's home revealed ""numerous bottles of medications"" at Jackson's bedside that were prescribed by Murray and two other physicians -- Dr. Allan Metzger and Dr. Arnold Klein. Many of the drugs ""have an indicated or off label use in the treatment of insomnia,"" the affidavit said. Metzger's lawyer told CNN last month that Metzger -- who treated Jackson in 2003 -- refused Jackson's request in April for a propofol prescription. Klein -- a dermatologist who also was Jackson's longtime friend -- has insisted he never gave Jackson dangerous drugs. Jackson visited Klein's Beverly Hills, California, medical office just days before his June 25 death. Murray took the job as Jackson's personal physician in May, as the pop star was preparing for a series of comeback concerts set to begin in July at London's O2 arena. Murray told investigators that Jackson would not tell him what drugs other doctors had given him, but he did tell Murray the medicine given to him by Klein and Metzger was not working, the affidavit said. The DEA has been unable to find a record of Dr. Murray purchasing, ordering or obtaining any propofol under his medical license or DEA number, according to the documents.

"(CNN) -- Those who were diagnosed with cancer after working at the World Trade Center site following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks were relieved earlier this week to find out that the federal government would compensate them for their illnesses. But the news came too late for Jevon Thomas, a worker who died of a rare cancer in April, penniless and distraught. He was 45. Thomas spent more than a year working on ""the pile,"" breathing in fumes from burning jet fuel and asbestos. For 10 years, federal authorities said it was impossible to make a link between his work and his illness. ""He was so depressed. He didn't want to talk to anybody,"" says his daughter, Monet Thomas. ""If he could have heard this news, it would have made him so happy."" It's not known how many of those who worked at ground zero have died of cancer, according to Dr. Michael Crane, director of the World Trade Center Health Program Clinical Center at New York's Mount Sinai School of Medicine. While relatives of deceased workers may file claims, the federal program provides no financial or emotional solace for the workers who have died. ""I'm so grateful cancers were included, but when I'm reminded of the people who've died, I get a pain in my heart,"" Crane says. ""It's a real tragedy."" Former worker '100 percent' sure cancer is linked to ground zero . Didn't hesitate to say 'yes' Thomas was working for a company that installs portable toilets when the planes hit the World Trade Center. He didn't hesitate to say yes when his boss asked him to set up toilets at ground zero for the emergency workers. He told CNN in an interview two years ago that he worked there without a mask for 10 hours a day, seven days a week, for about 14 months. Around the time he stopped working at ground zero, he noticed a lump on his hand. It turned out to be a rare cancer called epithelioid sarcoma. Thomas had several surgeries and rounds of chemotherapy and had to quit his $65,000-a-year job. His physician, Dr. Iris Udasin at Rutgers University, found him as much charity care as possible, but his family suffered financially as Thomas' wife is disabled and couldn't work to support their two young children. At the time, workers could apply for money from the federal September 11th Victim Compensation Fund if they suffered respiratory problems -- but not cancer, because a scientific link had not been found between the disease and breathing in the fumes at ground zero. ""Instead of everyone uniting, coming together, and figuring out a way to help you, they're figuring out a way of not helping you to save a dollar,"" Thomas said in 2010. ""And that's what it all boils down to. A dollar."" What hurt Thomas the most, his daughter says, is that after graduating high school with honors, she got accepted to a community college, attended orientation and then had to leave because her family couldn't pay the tuition. More than anything, her father had wanted her to be the first in their family to attend college. ""He didn't care about himself. All he cared about was me and my brother,"" Monet Thomas says through tears. ""He knew we needed help."" Her brother hasn't been able to find work, her mother is too sick to work and Monet, 21, supports the family by working as a hotel clerk in Secaucus, New Jersey. ""I feel like I'm going nowhere,"" she says. 58 cancers receive 9/11 coverage . 'Tension between two poles' When CNN interviewed Thomas two years ago, he said he was ""100% sure"" his cancer came from his work at ground zero. ""You can't work in an environment with so many different chemicals and carcinogens ... for a year straight, day in and day out, and not come down with something,"" he said. But scientists weren't so sure. While someone's cancer might be because of his or her work at ground zero, it might also have been a coincidence -- Thomas might have gotten cancer anyway. The long lag time makes it particularly difficult to study the link between ground zero and cancer. Cancer doesn't develop quickly after breathing in something toxic, the way asthma might. Instead, leukemia can take five to six years to develop, and solid tumors can take 10 to 20 years. ""People were very concerned that they were going to pull the trigger on the (federal) coverage too soon and they would end up covering people who didn't have a World Trade Center cancer,"" Crane says. ""They were trying to do this in an absolutely scientific way, according to rigorous principles of epidemiology, which is important to do,"" Crane adds. ""But on the other hand, you have to balance that against the needs of needy and really sick people. There's a tension between those two poles."" In the end, a study of firefighters helped persuade the government to include cancers. In the study, firefighters who worked at ground zero were 19% more likely to develop cancer than firefighters who did not. Firefighters responding to 9/11 at increased cancer risk . 'He would never take it back' Monet Thomas says her father would be ""grateful"" for the decision to compensate cancer victims who worked at ground zero, even though it took more than a decade. ""He would be crying right now,"" she said when she heard about the decision. Even though her father was depressed, destitute and felt alone at the end of his life, she says he never regretted his work on the pile. ""He was proud of what he did,"" she says. ""He was a hero, and he would never take it back."" CNN's Stephanie Smith, William Hudson and Georgiann Caruso contributed to this report.","Jevon Thomas, 45, died of a rare cancer in April .

"(CNN) -- Is the world of Formula One ready for Senna v Prost: The Sequel? Mercedes teammates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg's battle for the 2014 championship is drawing tantalizing comparisons with the sport's most famous rivalry between former McLaren pairing Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. The Mercedes duo fell out at last week's Monaco Grand Prix and will go wheel-to-wheel again at Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal with the wounds still sore. But the Mercedes team is keeping a cool head with executive director Toto Wolff confident he can stop any drama between his drivers getting out of hand. ""It is an intense relationship but this intensity is normal,"" Wolff told the Mercedes F1 team website. ""They are both competitive guys and they are fighting for a world championship. ""There have been a lot of comparisons to the Senna/ Prost scenario, which is a kind of compliment to both Lewis and Nico. ""The racing philosophy of Mercedes is to allow our drivers to compete; we let the boys play with their toys, unless they break them. ""It can be pretty tense when they are racing so hard but the drivers know we will not tolerate any incident. ""It's a job, not a holiday and the drivers need to work with and for the team first of all."" Hamilton struggled to hide his frustration in Monaco after Rosberg's error in qualifying prevented him from setting a quick time on his final lap. The German went on to win the race, where it is difficult to overtake, from pole position to retake the lead in the world championship. After the controversy, Hamilton suggested their teenage friendship was in danger of fracturing into Senna and Prost's acrimonious relationship. ""I quite like the way Senna dealt with it so I'm going to take a page out of his book,"" the British 2008 world champion told BBC radio. Senna and Prost dueled for the F1 world championship as McLaren teammates in 1988 and 1989. Prost, nicknamed ""Le Professeur"" for his cool, calculated approach accused his more passionate Brazilian teammate of forcing him off the road on more than one occasion. But despite their fierce rivalry, Prost and the late Senna respected each other as uniquely talented opposites who pushed each other to the limit to help them win seven world titles between them. Ahead of the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal, Hamilton has moved to ease any angst with Rosberg. He posted a photo of himself and Rosberg on his Twitter page along with the message: ""We've been friends a long time and as friends we have our ups and downs. ""Today we spoke and we're cool, still friends."" The 2008 world champion wrote Tuesday: ""We all stumble in life but it is how we get back up that defines us! #ican #iwill #nevergiveup #TeamLH."" Hamilton and Rosberg have been buddies since their teenage karting days and were often roommates on the junior racing circuit. But with the best car in F1 at their fingertips this season, the 2014 world title is a very real prospect for one of the Mercedes drivers, and that sort of prize can test even the most enduring friendships. Rosberg, who has never won a world title, leads 2008 winner Hamilton by four points in the drivers' championship ahead of the seventh race of the season. ""I now have the lead, which is great,"" Rosberg told the Mercedes F1 website. ""But it's still very early days and it's going to continue to be an extremely tight battle between us this year."" The tighter the title chase, the looser their ties of friendship might just become.","Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg's fight for 2014 F1 title echoes Senna-Prost rivalry .

"(CNN) -- Usain Bolt and Jessica Ennis have been named the best athletes on the planet at the 2013 Laureus World Sports Awards in recognition of their gold medal success at the 2012 Olympic Games. Jamaican sprint star Bolt was named sportsman of the year after he successfully defended the 100 meters, 200m and 4 x 100m relay gold medals at the London Games -- becoming the first man in history to do so. Bolt was unable to attend the ceremony in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, which will host the 2016 Olympics, but he did appear to collect the award via hologram. ""This is victory for track and field,"" the 26-year-old said via his official Twitter account after winning the accolade for the third time following previous successes in 2009 and 2010. ""Thanks to all the fans for the support over the years and the Laureus academy for selecting me for the 3rd time."" Ennis was one of the faces of London 2012, delighting British fans in the Olympic Stadium by clinching heptathlon gold at her home Games. ""It's been a whirlwind,"" the 27-year-old told CNN. ""It's been an absolute dream to have come into a home Olympics and to have been able to perform the way I had always hoped and to them experience all these amazing award ceremonies to be here tonight with some amazing sports people."" The team of the year honor was awarded to Europe's Ryder Cup golf side, which launched a stirring final-day comeback to beat its American counterpart at the 2012 tournament at Medinah in Illinois. Jose Maria Olazabal's team trailed Davis Love III's U.S. 10-6 heading into the final day's play, but won eight and tied one of the singles rubbers to retain to the cup. American swimmer Michael Phelps was recognized with the Laureus Academy Exceptional Achievement Award, which was handed out for the first time. He became the most decorated Olympian of all time at London 2012, taking his total of medals to 22 and his haul of gold medals to 18. ""Being able to be here with not only all of these great athletes but these great actors and actresses from all over the world, it's something new to me,"" Phelps, who has taken to golf since quitting the pool, told CNN. Felix Sanchez was rewarded with the Comeback of the Year award after he regained the Olympic 400 meters hurdles title he had won eight years earlier. The 35-year-old from the Dominican Republic provided one of the most emotional moments in London, displaying a picture of his recently deceased grandmother after taking gold. ""This makes everything and all the dedication and all the hard work that went into this season and all of last season all that much more fulfilling,"" Sanchez said. Tennis star Andy Murray won the breakthrough prize after ending Britain's 76-year wait for a men's grand slam title at the U.S. Open, and also claimed the Olympic singles event, while Brazilian swimmer Daniel Dias was named best athlete with a disability for the second time after winning six gold medals -- all in world-record times -- at the London 2012 Paralympics.

"Buffalo, New York (CNN) -- The rubble that blankets much of Port-au-Prince delivers the deadly verdict on decades of inadequate construction in my home nation. My siblings were spared; their house was not destroyed, but my apartment back home collapsed. The destruction is of stupefying proportion. My heart cries out to my Haitian brothers and sisters who are enduring so much. I had long known that Haiti was vulnerable -- it had been hit before, in 1751, 1771 and 1842. I anticipated that if it happened again, damages and loss of life would be substantial, due to the poor quality of the built environment. Some local and foreign scientists were talking about the eventuality of a major quake, but not enough attention was paid to their warnings, and eventually many saw it as only a remote possibility. I decided to study earthquake engineering, hoping that I would have time to get the education in designing against earthquakes, would get hands-on experience, share the knowledge with engineers back home, and advocate for the adoption of building codes and the integration of sound design criteria against such occurrences. Sadly, I ran out of time. I know that it is critical that my country now examine what steps ought to be taken to prevent such massive loss of life in the future. This is my humble contribution to this process. Much has been written about why the earthquake flattened whole communities. There was the flouting, or just ignorance, of international building codes developed by engineers to provide a framework in construction engineering and design, especially important in a country so susceptible to what we call ""multiple hazards"" -- earthquakes, hurricanes, storm surges, tsunami. No such building code exists in Haiti. There was the low-cost unreinforced masonry, or barely reinforced concrete structures that have dominated Haiti's landscape; the anarchic construction that flourished in tightly-packed Port-au-Prince, suffocating the city and further deteriorating its already degraded environment as builders frantically mined and extracted construction materials from its mountainsides. There was construction in obviously unsuitable areas, such as wetlands and unstable and eroded mountain flanks -- structures there could not possibly sustain the large deformation imposed by the earthquake. They collapsed without warning. Very few buildings were designed by architects and engineers; most were built with no construction standards -- by wealthy and poor alike. Enforcement of construction permits and site inspections has been lax. Hardly any structure met the minimum requirements to resist the type of horizontal force generated by an earthquake of that magnitude. The ones still standing may just be lucky. As tragic as this event is, it is also an opportunity to start from scratch and rebuild the country in a planned and orderly fashion. This calls for a comprehensive urban-development plan. There must be an emphasis on the development of model cities in Haiti, which may intelligently, yet safely, integrate architectural local features -- such as building façades mimicking the fretted wood and intricate latticework that ornamented traditional ""gingerbread"" houses favored by tourists in the 1950s -- to lure visitors and stoke an economic rebirth. The government also must adopt and enforce a comprehensive set of construction codes and regulations with a multi-hazard focus. Engineers must think globally while designing and building structures that protect life in such an array of hazards. Multi-hazard engineering is emerging as a cost-effective solution to engineering design and construction issues in countries like Haiti, where several natural or man-made hazards are involved. And while it is a new concept that hasn't been widely applied yet (it's an approach championed at my university, and by the federally funded Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research, or MCEER), this multi-hazard focus is imperative in our case. Haiti's building codes must be based on existing, well-tested research and emphasize the necessity for peer-reviewed design as an embedded layer of safety in the design process. For reasons of proximity and the role that the United States is playing in the earthquake's aftermath, it would be reasonable for Haiti to base building codes on those used in the U.S. and in American territories like Puerto Rico, which share similar exposure and vulnerability, for example, to annual tropical storms or earthquakes. Beyond this, the Haitian authorities must provide the local and international private sectors with incentives to invest in the development of affordable housing for the survivors, through tax cuts or tax payment deferments and by making public lands available during the reconstruction efforts. These housing projects would put people back to work and support the housing market, as realtors and financial institutions will be needed. They would also provide hands-on experience to local engineers, who will need help from the international community as they learn skills required for designing multi-hazard structures to code, while providing a basis to hold them accountable in case of gross malpractice. This financial and intellectual collaboration can extend to developing a curriculum in multi-hazard engineering that can be required in engineering schools both in private and state institutions in Haiti, and sanctioned by standardized mandatory certification tests for graduating engineers and in educational sessions for practicing engineers. Of course, a wider reconstruction project must include the new development of lifelines that provide vital emergency response and recovery: health care facilities, communication, electric power, liquid fuel, natural gas, transportation (airports, highways, ports, rail and transit), water, and wastewater. This is critical, considering that the rescue efforts on the ground right now are hindered by the damage sustained by many of those systems. In the wake of such destruction, the construction sector can be the main driver for sustainable economic development in Haiti. While it shouldn't have taken such a horrific event to get there, this can be a way to pay tribute to the Haitian people who have demonstrated such resilience in adversity, and to give hope to the families of the countless loved ones who have lost their lives or are injured. Reversing the course of this catastrophe is going to be a Herculean task, requiring intense resources and a multidisciplinary approach with a strong multi-hazard focus.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When Xi Jinping, 59, and his ""Fifth Generation"" of leaders assume power, it will mark a first for China's post-1949 generation and those who spent their formative years during the Cultural Revolution. In a series of steps, Xi, the current vice president since 2008, is expected to be named general secretary of the Communist Party during its 18th Congress, which opens Thursday, and then president next March, succeeding incumbent Hu Jintao. As with all Chinese leaders, details of Xi's life are tightly controlled by the government, creating a gap that biographies -- some written under pseudonyms, given the political sensitivities -- have sought to fill. China watchers meanwhile try to discern how he would lead. ""Chinese leaders don't rise to the top telegraphing what changes they'll do,"" said Bruce J. Dickson, a political science professor at George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs. ""They rise to the top showing how loyal they are to the incumbent. What they'll do when they rise to the top -- that's the big question."" Read about what Xi Jinping faces . Xi was born in 1953, four years after the Chinese Communist Party defeated the ruling Nationalists and established the People's Republic of China. He is the son of the second marriage of Xi Zhongxun, a revolutionary hero whom then-paramount leader Mao Zedong would appoint minister of propaganda and education. Xi Zhongxun would later become vice premier under Zhou Enlai and secretary general of the State Council, China's highest administrative body, before being purged in 1962. Until then, Xi Jinping had grown up a ""princeling"" in the enclave of power, Zhongnanhai, with other children of China's first generation of leaders. One childhood peer was Bo Xilai, son of Bo Yibo, the first finance minister who was also purged during the Cultural Revolution. Life was comfortable and far removed from the mass starvation during Mao's disastrous ""Great Leap Forward"" campaign (1958-1962), which was designed to transform the nation into an industrial society. However, a few years later, Xi -- his father by then deposed -- would be among 30 million ""sent-down youth,"" forced to leave cities for the countryside and mountains under another of Mao's policies. From 1969-1975, or most of the Cultural Revolution, Xi was an agricultural laborer in Liangjiahe, Shaanxi, his ancestral province. ""That generation went through a lot of difficulties,"" said Cheng Li, director of research at the John L. Thornton Center at the Brookings Institution. ""Idealism and pragmatism in a very unique way combined in this generation."" Read about Mao's shadow lingering over China . The experience had a positive influence on Xi's view of China and the world, according to Guo Yanjun, chairman of CNHK Media, the publisher of ""China's Future: A Biography of Xi Jinping."" ""Even after he became a leader, he helped farmers,"" Guo said. His favorite story was of the Tsinghua University-bound Xi in 1975 being accompanied by villagers who walked 60 li (30 km) to send him off at a train station. Mao died in 1976, and Xi's father was subsequently rehabilitated and became party secretary of Guangdong, where he oversaw China's first special economic zones near Hong Kong -- reforms that would define then paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's economic legacy. China's next leader keeps Iowa close to his heart . The elder Xi's connections proved critical. After graduating from Tsinghua with a chemical engineering degree in 1979, Xi Jinping became the personal secretary to his father's former comrade-in-arms, Geng Biao, and became an active military servicemember. As vice premier, a member of the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee and secretary general of the Central Military Commission, Geng ""dominated the Party, government and the army,"" according to ""China's Future,"" affording Xi a rare vantage point. Such military ties -- familial and professional -- give him what neither Hu nor his predecessor Jiang Zemin had, said Chi Wang, president of the U.S.-China Policy Foundation. ""The military takes him as one of the family members."" It was around this period that Xi was married to his first wife, Ke Lingling, the daughter of Ke Hua, China's ambassador to Great Britain and a former underling of Xi Zhongxun, according to ""China's Future."" Not much is known about the marriage except that it ended in divorce within a few years. (In 1987, Xi would marry his current wife, Peng Liyuan, a popular folk singer for the People's Liberation Army.) Read how Xi is considered a ""mystery"" In 1982, when his father entered the ruling Politburo and the Secretariat, Xi became county deputy secretary in Zhengding, Hebei province, his first experience in rural politics. In this role, he took his first trip to the United States -- as part of an agricultural delegation in 1985 to Hebei's ""sister state"" of Iowa -- and brought back knowledge of farming technology as well as tourism. This trip had a great impact on Xi, who stayed with a family in Muscatine, said Pin Ho, chairman of Mirror Books, which published a separate ""Biography of Xi Jinping"" this year. ""Vocally, he's a nationalist. Psychologically, he greatly hopes to keep good relations with the West, especially the U.S.,"" Ho said, noting that Xi's daughter, Xi Mingze, studies there -- at Harvard -- under a pseudonym. In a major policy speech in Washington in February Xi called for increasing strategic trust and reducing suspicions while respecting each other's core interests, such as the ""one-China policy"" that opposes Taiwan and Tibetan independence. In an indirect reference to the Obama administration's ""rebalancing"" strategy toward Asia, Xi said, ""We hope the United States will respect the interests and concerns of China and other countries in the region."" Nonetheless, Xi got high marks for his desire to engage with the United States, and his trip included meetings with President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Also not overlooked was the fact Xi chose to make a nostalgic stop in Iowa, in addition to Los Angeles, during his five-day U.S. tour. Read about China reaction to Obama's re-election win . ""From my conversations with people in the United States, the reigning understanding is, 'This is a guy we can work with,'"" said David Lampton, director of the China Studies Program at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Wang of the U.S.-China Policy Foundation echoed the sentiments, calling Xi ""relaxed, very at ease to talk with people"" and a departure from Communist leaders who tend to be ""very cautious"" when talking. Read about how U.S., China are worlds apart but joined . Meanwhile, ""Xi's leadership experience [after Zhengding] in running Fujian, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, three economically-advanced regions, has prepared him well for pursuing policies to promote the development of the private sector, foreign investment and trade, and the liberalization of China's financial system,"" wrote Cheng Li of Brookings for the Washington Quarterly in its winter 2012 edition. The run-up to Xi's ascension as China's next leader has nonetheless been bumpy. In September, his nearly two-week ""disappearance"" -- and canceled meetings with Clinton and other foreign officials -- fueled speculation over his health and factional infighting. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, former Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said Xi had suffered a back injury while swimming. Even so, the Chinese media's ""default mode"" of not speaking about its leaders, coupled with the lack of a constitutional basis for the regime's transfer of power, left people wondering, ""What's the Plan B if something were to happen?"" Lampton said. Read about the struggle of ideas at the top . Also of note were two reports released by Xinhua on September 28 within three minutes of each other: the Congress' November 8 opening date -- after much speculation it would fall in October -- and the expulsion of Bo Xilai from the Communist Party. Bo now faces criminal prosecution in the wake of a scandal that saw his wife convicted of murder. Given the turbulent lead-up to the Communist Party Congress, Lampton says he, like other China watchers, will be trying to glean clues as to China's political direction. He says a longer-than-expected Congress could hint at an inability to reach decisions. Also important will be the make-up of the Politburo Standing Committee, what happens to the key portfolios -- and crucially, whether Hu will relinquish his chairmanship of the Central Military Commission to Xi. Read about the secrecy surrounding China's Party Congress . ""Having two centers -- the predecessor heading the military and the new leader second-in-command -- is not a healthy signal to the world,"" Lampton said. The flipside of having a more collective leadership as opposed to a dominant leader like Mao or Deng is that the ""system has been set up to prevent a strong leader,"" Dickson of George Washington University said. All the more reason that the charismatic Bo, who had been tipped for the Standing Committee and is said to have led a ruthless anti-crime campaign in Chongqing, drew some concern before his downfall. Read a who's who of China's next leaders . The clean reputation of Xi -- who had become Shanghai's leader after his predecessor, Chen Liangyu, was dismissed over a social security fund scandal -- took a hit in June when Bloomberg reported on the wealth of his extended family. Although no assets were traced to Xi, his wife or daughter, Bloomberg found that his extended family had business interests in minerals, real estate and mobile-phone equipment, with assets in the hundreds of millions. Last month the New York Times gave a similar treatment to Premier Wen Jiabao, reporting on the staggering wealth of his relatives -- a review that found assets of at least $2.7 billion. Xi and the new leaders will have to demonstrate to the public how serious they are in fighting widespread corruption, Lampton said, or face ""huge problems."" CNN's Shao Tian contributed to this report.","As with all Chinese leaders, government tightly controls details of Xi's life .

"(CNN) -- Most flowers start as seeds planted in soil, but Wim Noorduin, currently a post-doc researcher at Harvard, prefers to craft bouquets using Barium carbonate and sodium metasilicate. The two chemicals are disolved in a glass beaker filled with water and as carbon dioxide seeps into the vessel it kickstarts a chemical reaction that creates a wonderland of micro-sculptures that are about the diameter of the human hair. After giving the chemical reaction a few hours to bloom, Noorduin slides the sample into an electron microscope where hundreds of thousands of flower-shaped sculptures have blossomed. ""When zooming in using an electron microscope, you see that inside the beaker a vast landscape of complex sculpted microstructures has evolved in which you can get completely lost,"" says Noordin. ""It really feels like you are diving in a sort of alien coral reef."" Fascinating ways people try to leave their mark on the world . Sculpting might be too strong a word, but Noorduin has become increasingly adept at controlling the outcome of his experiments by carefully manipulating variables. Altering the temperature of the beaker by submerging it in an ice bath, adding drops of acid to control the pH, or even adding a pinch of table salt can lead to vastly different results. Increasing carbon dioxide levels leads to expansive, leafy crystals while changing the pH level results in rosette structures. Beyond being the kind of gift that would set Amy Farrah Fowler's heart afire, Noorduin's nano-sized nosegays have serious applications in materials science research. Microfabrication techniques that build objects at impossible small scale have seen tremendous gains over the last decade, but researchers are bumping up against limits at molecular and nanoscales. Noorduin believes this low-tech, biology-based growth approach could ultimately lead to breakthroughs in optical materials and other applications. For those interested in the science behind Noorduin's BoutonniÃ¨res, his research has been published in prestigious journals, though his most important peer-review comes from his lady friend.

"Kabul (CNN) -- An audit of Afghanistan's disputed presidential election results will begin within a day in Kabul, and the two candidates will accept its determination of who won, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Saturday. ""Make no mistake. These will be the first steps of what will obviously be a hard, difficult process and we will be working hand in hand with both candidates,"" Kerry said. ""In keeping with each of the candidate's request, this audit will be conducted with the highest international standards."" The inauguration of the new president, originally scheduled for the first week of August, will be postponed while the audit of votes cast for Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani is conducted, Kerry said. Both candidates stood beside him. Kerry announced the brokered deal amid fears the country could descend into chaotic bloodshed. He extended his stay here to deal with the issue. Abdullah cited how ""there were previous challenges in relation to the election, and today we are happy to announce"" the agreement for an audit. Ghani said he was ""delighted"" by the accord in which ""the candidates will abide by the will of the people."" The two candidates clasped hands and raised them for the cameras before leaving. Ballots cast in the provinces will be brought to Kabul by NATO-led International Security Assistance Force and Afghan national security forces for the audit, Kerry said. Kerry arrived in Kabul on Thursday for the unannounced visit amid concern over signs of growing division following the country's contested presidential runoff election. Despite efforts by the Taliban to disrupt the election, about 8 million votes were cast in June 14 balloting and provisional results showed Ghani ahead with roughly 56% support to 43% for Abdullah, according to Afghanistan's Independent Elections Commission. Both candidates have alleged large-scale vote fraud and manipulation during the runoff last month. The audit will take weeks to complete, Kerry said. Roadside bombing . Amid continued insecurity, a civilian vehicle hit a roadside bomb in the Panjwai district of southern Kandahar province on Saturday, killing eight members of one family, including four women, according to the Afghan Interior Ministry. Two children were injured. Only two days earlier, six members of a mine-removal team were killed and three others were abducted in an ambush by gunmen in western Herat province, a local police official said. The United States is withdrawing most of its troops by year's end, reducing the primary leverage it has had in Afghanistan. But it still supports the country with billions of dollars in foreign aid. The international community, which fears a resurgence of the Taliban, is keen to see Afghanistan continue on the path to democracy. 'Critical moment' The Obama administration says it has no favored candidate but wants to see a credible and transparent process that produces a president who can bring Afghanistan together and govern effectively. Senior administration officials said Friday that Kerry's meeting with the two candidates had focused on the need to preserve the gains Afghanistan has made over the past 13 years, through a legitimate political transition. Conversations have focused on two main areas, the officials said: how to address allegations of fraud in a credible manner and restore confidence in the electoral process; and how to ensure political dialogue so the process is inclusive and produces as unified a government as possible. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan has been looking into the fraud allegations. But the senior administration officials stressed that the political process must be Afghan-led. Although once an ally of President Hamid Karzai, Abdullah has in recent years become an opponent and vocal critic of the Taliban. Ghani, also a former adviser to Karzai and finance minister, was once a U.S. citizen, but he gave up his passport to run for president five years ago. The International Crisis Group, a nongovernmental organization, said in a news release Friday that Afghanistan had ""reached a critical moment in the development of its democratic system."" It urged both sides to engage in talks and to accept the outcome of investigations into the fraud allegations. ""The final result will be less important, however, than the way the contest is decided,"" the group added. ""Such periods of transition are a crucial test for a country's institutions. This is a moment when Afghans must hold tight to their constitution and the rule of law, despite political turmoil."" Nuclear talks . After Saturday's meetings in Kabul, Kerry is expected to travel to Vienna, Austria, for talks on Iran's nuclear program. Iran and six world powers, the United States among them, are engaged in a final round of negotiations ahead of a July 20 deadline aimed at reaching a permanent deal on the future of Tehran's nuclear program. Tehran insists its ambitions are peaceful, but the world powers fear it has ambitions to build nuclear weapons. Kerry is due to speak in Vienna with his German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the senior administration officials said. The foreign ministers' encounter will come amid a row over fresh spying allegations against the United States. Germany's government on Thursday asked America's top spy chief stationed in the country to leave. This followed the revelation that two Germans -- one working at a German intelligence agency, the other in the Ministry of Defense -- are suspected of spying for the United States.

"(CNN) -- The iPod classic, a venerable stalwart in the world of consumer technology, may be getting the axe along with its cousin, the iPod shuffle, according to a blog that focuses on Apple news. Citing an unnamed source, The Unofficial Apple Weblog is reporting that, in addition to unveiling the iPhone 5 next week, Apple plans to discontinue the more dated versions of its music player in favor of sleeker models like the iPod Nano and iPod Touch. The blog notes that Apple teased a ""product transition"" during its most recent earnings report. Saying only that the source is not an analyst, TUAW says the rumor makes sense. ""The classic is a holdover from 10 years of iPod existence, bearing many similarities to the original iPod,"" wrote blog editor Victor Agreda, Jr. ""The shuffle is basically the same form factor as the nano, minus a screen."" He writes that the blog had been ""sitting on a tip"" about the discontinuation and only wrote about it after speculation popped up on other sites. A groundbreaking device in personal tech, credited with reinvigorating Apple a decade ago, the iPod line now accounts for just about 7 percent of Apple's overall revenues. The iPhone and iPad, which offer music and video streaming along with lots of other features, have in some way trumped the iPod's usefulness. Last year, Apple made what then-CEO Steve Jobs called ""the biggest change in the iPod lineup ever."" But amid big changes to the Touch, Nano and Shuffle, there was no mention at all of the classic iPod, leading many to speculate that the end may be near.","Report: Apple will discontinue iPod classic and shuffle .

"(CNN) -- It doesn't appear tracking down this piece of 9/11 history will be easy. Tips have been rolling in, spurred by the CNN Films' production, ""The Flag,"" a documentary about the flag that three New York firefighters hoisted above the World Trade Center rubble in the aftermath of the attack. This particular version of Old Glory was 3 feet by 5 feet. Photos and video from the site suggest it went missing fewer than six hours after a photographer with a Bergen, New Jersey, newspaper captured the firefighters' deed in a photo that would become one of the most -- if not the most -- iconic images from tragedy. Co-director Michael Tucker said he expects that as news of the film infiltrates the tight-knit communities of New York's firefighters, police officers, port authority workers and paramedics, more viable leads will come. ""Once more people from that world see it, I think we're going to start learning a lot more,"" he said, adding that he and co-director Petra Epperlein examined more than 5,000 photos and viewed four days of television coverage from each of the networks during the documentary's production. Viewers began sharing leads before the documentary aired Wednesday, as TV featured promos and CNN.com posted a preview. By Wednesday night, there were a collective 50 tips to CNN.com's landing page, an e-mail tip line and Twitter. Only a dozen or so were credible. Of course, there was the obligatory yahoo claiming aliens took it -- but there were more sober sightings as well. A Florida woman said she saw it in the New York State Museum in Albany, while another viewer wondered whether a flag he'd seen at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point was the banner in question. Other potential sightings came at Missouri's Fort Leonard Wood; NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston; the Escondido, California, Elks Lodge; and the hair and makeup department of the New York New York Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. In one seemingly angry e-mail received before the documentary aired, a man using the name of a retired New York police lieutenant slammed the firefighters. He accused them of stealing the flag (the documentary explains how it was taken from a yacht docked near the trade center) and claimed the iconic photo was staged and that the firefighters absconded with the flag after the picture was taken. ""There had already been a few flags hoisted down at the site including the first flag to be hoisted by 2 officers from the NYPD,"" the tipster wrote. ""Since the NYPD raised their flag in the immediate aftermath of the attack, there is still a ton of smoke and soot in the air, there are numerous rescue workers on scene ... several of whom are saluting. This is a much more original, natural, unrehearsed shot than the photo op taken much later."" The most credible tip, Tucker said, came from a man who said a lighting company in Oskaloosa, Iowa, that assisted with the 9/11 cleanup effort was in possession of the flag. But that flag turned out to be larger than the 9/11 flag, Tucker said. Tucker's hunch is that the flag's disappearance involved nothing nefarious. ""Someone most likely saw it there and thought that's a dirty, tattered flag and said, 'I'm going to save that,' "" he said. ""It's going to be someone who either went there to volunteer with some specific skill or was a first responder. ""If anything, I think someone's intentions were very good."" While some tips are more feasible than others, Tucker says, ""They're all legitimate because people have connections to these objects, to these symbols."" And perhaps more important than finding the flag is providing this outlet for catharsis, Tucker said. Many people have forgotten how they felt the day the towers came down. With a war-weary nation now considering military action in Syria, Tucker believes discussing and searching for the 9/11 flag gives people an opportunity to revisit their emotions and ""immerse themselves in the story of that day."" ""It was the worst of days that somehow brought out the best in many Americans,"" he said. ""It's more than looking for a flag. It's about looking for that feeling."" Help find the flag .","The flag that became the subject of an iconic 9/11 photo went missing after it was hoisted .

"(CNN) -- The New Zealand political party founded by German Internet tycoon Kim Dotcom has joined forces with a firebrand Maori activist, in what is being described as one of the world's most unlikely political marriages of convenience. ""It's a very unusual alliance... It's like Mark Zuckerberg getting into alliance with Fidel Castro,"" political scientist Bryce Edwards, of the University of Otago, told CNN. ""The individuals involved are larger than life and dynamic people, but their ideological backgrounds are pretty disparate."" The Internet-Mana Party alliance between Dotcom's Internet Party and the left-wing, indigenous-focused Mana Party was announced by Mana's leader, the controversial Maori nationalist MP Hone Harawira. ""It's completely new ground, but politics is about the art of the possible and I'm looking forward to what we can achieve,"" Harawira, seated next to the Internet Party's chief executive Vikram Kumar, told reporters. Dotcom, the controversial founder of the shuttered file-sharing site Megaupload, cannot personally run for office as he is not a citizen of his adopted home of New Zealand. The wealthy Web entrepreneur, who is battling extradition to the U.S. on criminal digital piracy charges, launched his party in January, with a pledge to focus on Internet privacy and government surveillance, and to make politics exciting. Critics, including New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, have described Dotcom's political activities as part of an attempt to protect himself against U.S. extradition efforts. But Harawira said the issue of whether Mana would support Dotcom's efforts to remain in New Zealand had ""not even come up once"" in discussions. ""It's not a matter on the table at all."" 'Gaming the system' Bryce said the alliance represented an attempt by the two political minnows ""to game the electoral system and help each other get their politicians into parliament"" at the general elections in September. Under New Zealand's proportional voting system, a party must win either an electorate seat or at least 5% of the nationwide vote to get into parliament -- a situation that hindered new parties, said Edwards, because potential supporters feared their vote would be wasted. But if Harawira retained his electorate seat, it would remove the need for the party to cross the 5% threshold, and both parties could expect their share of the national vote to count towards a representative share of seats in the 120-member parliament. Edwards said he tipped the buzz around the alliance could see it fare well in the September vote. ""New Zealanders like to see outsiders having a go,"" he said. ""The sum of the whole is going to be greater than the two parts."" Odd couple . The two parties make strange bedfellows, apparently sharing little common ground beyond their opposition to the current center-right National government. ""On the two issues these parties are principally known for, Internet freedom and Maori nationalism, there doesn't seem to be any crossover whatsoever,"" said Edwards. ""They're quite different versions of anti-establishment. One's an urban, middle-class, tech version, the other's more traditional left-wing, almost anti-capitalist."" Harawira, the son of a veteran Maori radical, has a long history of strident Maori activism and is seen as a figure of the far-left. He has been a polarizing presence in parliament since he was elected in a seat reserved for Maori voters in 2005, criticized for remarks perceived as racist against white New Zealanders, and for calling for an opposition leader to be shot. He eventually split with the Maori Party in 2011 over their support of the government. His new party, Mana, was established primarily as a vehicle to represent the interests of indigenous New Zealanders but also attracted support from non-Maori left-wing activists. Dotcom's political tendencies are less well-known. He has previously made a NZ$50,000 ($42,792) donation to a right-wing New Zealand politician at the opposite end of the political spectrum to Mana, but the yet-to-be announced leader of the Internet Party, who will be named on Thursday, is somebody Harawira says he can work with. Internet Party chief executive Kumar said the two parties would retain their separate policies, and acknowledged his party was providing the bulk of the financial backing to the alliance. 'Big mistake' Harawira's decision to team with Dotcom's party has already drawn criticism. One of the Mana Party's founding members, the left-wing activist and former lawmaker Sue Bradford, quit the party over the move, which she labeled a ""big mistake."" ""Sucking up to a German millionaire is not in my future,"" she told reporters. ""There's no way I can continue to be in a party where we are all really just the political plaything of a millionaire Internet mogul."" Harawira's former party has also attacked the move, with Maori Party co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell telling CNN affiliate TVNZ that ""utilizing Maori seats to drag in somebody who is questionable about their knowledge about things Maori... it's not on.""

"(CNN) -- Casey Anthony's fate keeps changing. Two years ago, her murder trial for the death of her toddler riveted the country, ending with Anthony's dramatic acquittal. But she was convicted on four counts of lying to authorities. On Friday, an appeals court threw out two of those convictions. Now, the 26-year-old has filed for bankruptcy, citing almost $800,000 in liabilities. And her legal struggles are far from over. Bankruptcy motive questioned . Anthony sought Chapter 7 protection in a federal court in Tampa on Friday, soon after the appeals court ruling. Such a filing is meant to allow one to do away with most existing debts and make a fresh start financially. In the documents, Anthony says she owes almost $800,000 to about 80 creditors, and she has no income. She is also defending herself against several civil lawsuits, including a defamation suit from Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, who claims Anthony ruined her reputation. In 2008, Anthony told an investigator the last time she saw her 2-year-old daughter Caylee was when she dropped Caylee off at Gonzalez's apartment. Gonzalez's attorney, Matt Morgan, told CNN affiliate Central Florida News 13 he believes the bankruptcy filing is an attempt to postpone the case. ""This most recent filing appears to be yet another calculated delay tactic,"" Morgan said. ""We are not deterred and will stay the course."" But an attorney for Anthony told the affiliate his client is distraught that she can't pay her legal fees. ""To some extent she feels, she feels bad that she's having to have all these legal services provided to her and she is unable to compensate anyone,"" Andy Chmelir said. ""So she wants closure more than anything else."" What she has and what she owes . Anthony listed about $1,000 in personal property, according to court documents obtained by News 13. The listed property values include: . - Cash on hand: $474 . - Furniture and laptop: $200 . - Jewelry: $200 . - Clothing and accessories: $100 . The documents also list people that might have a claim against Anthony, which includes her mother and consultants that helped in her criminal case, News 13 reported. Claims listed in the filing include: . - Jose Baez, the lead defense attorney during Anthony's trial: $500,000 . - Orange County Sheriff's Office: $145,660.21 . - Internal Revenue Service: $68,540 . - Cindy and George Anthony, her parents: Unknown amounts . Anthony: ""We keep fighting"" after two convictions tossed . The filing came the same day Florida's 5th District Court of Appeal threw out two of Anthony's four convictions of lying to authorities as they investigated the disappearance of Caylee. The appeals judges agreed with Anthony's argument that the multiple convictions amounted to double jeopardy. But the judges upheld the other two convictions. According to Friday's court filing, the appeals judges rejected Anthony's claim that statements she made before being read her Miranda rights should not have been allowed in the trial. And they rejected her argument that the state statute she was convicted of violating is unconstitutionally vague. Attorney Cheney Mason said when he called his client to share the ruling that two of the four convictions had been overturned, Anthony said, ""We keep fighting."" Anthony could appeal the remaining two convictions to the Florida Supreme Court next. Caylee Anthony's death and the emotional trial . In an internationally publicized case, Anthony was tried in 2011 and acquitted of murder charges in the death of Caylee. The child was last seen June 16, 2008, but was not reported missing until July 15, 2008, when Casey Anthony's mother tracked her daughter down and demanded answers about Caylee's whereabouts. Investigators searched for the child for five months, eventually finding Caylee's skeletal remains in woods less than a mile from her grandparents' Orlando home. Read how Anthony's prosecutor has no regrets . When questioned early in the investigation, Casey Anthony admitted to police that she hadn't seen Caylee for more than 30 days, and on July 16, 2008, she was arrested on suspicion of child neglect, filing false official statements and obstructing a criminal investigation. After almost three years of legal maneuvers, Anthony's capital murder trial began on May 24, 2011. Prosecutors alleged that she killed Caylee by using chloroform and covering her nose and mouth with duct tape, and that she put her body in the trunk of her car before dumping it in the woods. Defense attorney Jose Baez argued that Caylee drowned in the Anthony family pool on June 16, 2008, and that Casey Anthony and her father, George, covered up the death. Watch: A year after trial, where's Anthony? On July 5, 2011, a jury found Anthony not guilty of first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter of a child, while convicting her on the four ""false information"" counts. Anthony was sentenced to four years in jail, to be served consecutively. But with her time in jail as she awaited trial counting against the jail terms, she was released 10 days after her sentencing.

"(CNN) -- Nearly five months of cramped living in zero gravity will come to an end Thursday for one American astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station. Their Soyuz capsule is set to undock at 8:30 p.m. ET, and land less than three and a half hours later in Kazakhstan. Soyuz modules are vital to the Russian space program. They are launched into space as capsules atop a rocket, and are capable of landing on land, not requiring a body of water to splash down in. A Soyuz carried the first ever crew to the ISS in November 2000, according to NASA. One is docked there at all times, in case the crew needs to leave in an emergency. It became the standard mode of transportation to the station after the deadly 2003 Columbia space shuttle accident. The modern version, the Soyuz TMA, is made of three parts. Two of them jettison then burn upon reentry into Earth's atmosphere, according to NASA. Only the Descent Module will land on Earth, carrying Commander Kevin Ford of NASA, Russian Soyuz Commander Oleg Novitskiy and Russian Flight Engineer Evgeny Tarelkin. NASA TV will broadcast the undocking and landing live. The undocking of the Soyuz will mark the beginning of the 35th ISS mission, which awaits the arrival of two more Russian cosmonauts and an American astronaut in two weeks. The journey up to the station takes longer than the return trip to Earth, NASA said. The Soyuz needs a total of two days to catch up with the ISS in its orbit.

"(CNN) -- It's hard not to become distressed, when I'm carefully following the situation in Yemen since violence got worse. It's even more troublesome not to become distressed thinking that there is a bleak future waiting for Yemen. The fight by the security forces against unarmed protesters is indeed inhuman. More than 2,000 protesters have been murdered and more than 8,000 wounded by security forces across Yemen. Admittedly, the uprising has a long way to go but one of its great merits so far is the exceptional participation of women. I have been astonished by the growing numbers of female protesters as the uprising has proceeded. It started with just a few women; then day after day the number multiplied. Thousands of female protesters have been actively participating in demonstrations across the country since February 2011. Female doctors have been playing an important role treating wounded protesters and female activists have been running seminars on political issues. Mr Saleh's (Yemen's current president) security forces arrested four female doctors on 19 April 2011, while the doctors were marching along with a peaceful demonstration to provide medical help if needed. The female doctors were released after a huge condemnation and pressure from protesters. Even female protesters were not immune from the savage killing by pro-government thugs. On the 16 October 2011, I was saddened to see a female protester being shot dead by a thug's bullets. Aziza Othman was murdered in Taiz during an attack at a peaceful and unarmed protest by women. A very important recognition of women's participation in Yemen's uprising is the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Tawakkol Karman, one of the leading pro-democracy figures in Yemen. I believe that there are several motives behind this amazing participation by women -- I myself joined the protests and rallies because I want to build and improve my country. I wanted it to be a double revolution; a political one to topple President Saleh and a feminist one to ensure that women have equal rights in what Yemenis hope will be a new Yemen. It was a double political statement: First, that women have as much right to call for democracy as men, and an indirect message to lift gender apartheid. Indeed, it's been hard to be a woman in Yemen. A woman's gender, by default, deprives her of rights enjoyed by men. Women in Yemen have been always marginalized in law. As in many developing countries, women in Yemen suffer from limited access to healthcare, economic opportunities and education. I remember vividly attending a seminar in Sana'a by Amal al-Basha, one of the leading feminist and human rights activists in Yemen and founder of The Arab Sisters Forum for Human Rights in in March this year. I asked her, ""Do you think that the uprising will serve women's rights?"" ""We have been dealing with a state system that marginalised women for over three decades; unfairly snatching their rights,"" she said. ""Women in Yemen have only a restrained degree of legal protection in regard to family matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance. ""Many women in Yemen are forced to get married when they are still children. This corrupt system means women in Yemen have one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. Seven women are raped every month in Yemen, with no concrete punishment from the state for rapists. ""Women in Yemen also suffer from illiteracy. The current system provides a relatively low degree of protection for women's physical integrity. ""There are no laws against domestic violence and the law does not recognize the concept of spousal rape. There is zero observation and accountability by the government to ban the practice of female genital mutilation. How can women not call for change! Of course the uprising will serve women's rights,"" she told me. In a nutshell, the participation of women in the uprising has huge merit. What women have done so far embodies their civil and political liberty. Bearing in mind that freedom for women in Yemen is usually subject to numerous limitations; their participation in the uprising is extraordinary. What they are doing is really a protest against socio-political norms that have always limited their freedoms.","Afrah Nasser is a Yemeni journalist and blogger currently living in Sweden .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Track star Oscar Pistorius broke down in court Thursday, the fourth day of his murder trial, as a neighbor described the grisly scenes when he tried to save the athlete's girlfriend after a fatal shooting on Valentine's Day 2013. The amputee sprinter, 27, nicknamed ""Blade Runner,"" has pleaded not guilty to all four counts against him, saying the killing of model Reeva Steenkamp, 29, was a tragic error and he mistook her for an intruder. In graphic testimony, witness Johan Stipp, a doctor who lived close by, said he went to Pistorius' residence after hearing shots fired. He said he saw Steenkamp mortally wounded, her brain tissue mixed with blood and Pistorius praying for her to live. ""I remember the first thing he said when I got there was, 'I shot her, I thought she was a burglar and I shot her,' "" Stipp told the court in Pretoria. He said he had arrived and found Steenkamp's body lying at the bottom of the stairs. Pistorius was bent over her body with his left hand over her right groin and two fingers of his right hand in her mouth as he tried to clear her airway. Stipp tried to assist and said he found no signs of pulse in her neck, no peripheral pulse nor breathing movements. As the doctor described the details of her injuries to the court, Pistorius broke down with his head in his hands. He was also seen convulsing but then recovered and wiped his face and nose with a handkerchief. Stipp, who said he had trained in the army with assault rifles and 9 mm pistols -- the gun that killed Steenkamp -- said he had been surprised to hear no ambulance had been called when he arrived. He left after it did. Lawyers are battling over whether the world-famous athlete killed his girlfriend on purpose or by mistake when he fired four bullets through a closed bathroom door at her. 'He wanted her to live' Stipp told the court he did not realize Pistorius lived in the house until the day after the shooting when his wife told him. The doctor was later cross-examined by defense attorney Barry Roux, who has been working toward establishing that Pistorius was the one heard screaming after the shots were fired. Roux said he had consulted three specialists and the autopsy and asked Stipp: ""That person after the shots would not have been able to scream. That person would be nonresponsive, does that make sense to you as a medical doctor?"" ""It does,"" Stipp replied. The prosecution interjected, saying Steenkamp could have screamed after the first shot. Earlier in the week, prosecutor Gerrie Nel, reading a report from an expert, told the court that of the four bullets fired toward Steenkamp ""the fourth bullet hit her in the head. She then died."" Pistorius sat impassively during the exchange between Roux and Stipp. He leaned forward, his head down in his hand, as his attorney asked Stipp if the athlete had wanted Steenkamp to live. ""He definitely wanted her to live, yes,"" Stipp replied. ""He looked sincere to me. He was crying; there were tears on his face."" After the court adjourned for the day Thursday, Pistorius was in tears as his sister consoled him. Witness grilled over notes . Earlier Roux had cross-examined another neighbor who testified that he heard shouting from Pistorius' house before the shooting. Charl Johnson, husband of the trial's first witness, was back on the stand after the defense team wanted to retrieve notes he had taken in the weeks after the shooting. Roux grilled Johnson about the notes such as ""the screams did not sound like fighting but more like the panic and distress calls of being attacked."" Roux established that Johnson and his wife, Michelle Burger, thought they were hearing noise from a house break-in and not from an act of domestic violence. Nel said Roux was taking individual sentences out of context. Johnson also testified he owns the same caliber gun as the one that killed Steenkamp and he has fired a firearm before and knows what it sounds like. When Roux asked if he has heard it from the distance of one house to another, he said did not have a similar experience to relate it to but was convinced he knew what the noise sounds like regardless of distance. Defense pokes holes . The prosecution has put up several witnesses who live near Pistorius and say they heard shouting before the four gunshots that night, while his defense attorney has grilled them relentlessly to raise doubts about their version of events. Roux on Wednesday said he had no doubt that Johnson believed what he was saying -- but that whether what he was saying was true was a different question. The defense only has to show that there is reasonable doubt Pistorius intentionally killed Steenkamp. Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa will decide whether Pistorius is innocent or guilty. South Africa does not have jury trials. Johnson and his wife have testified to hearing shouts from Pistorius' house before a series of gunshots around 3 a.m. Johnson told investigators he and his wife didn't discuss their versions of events with each other. But on the stand, Johnson said he did discuss how many shots he and his wife heard and the timing of those shots. ""You and your wife could just as well have stood together in the witness box,"" Roux remarked. For witnesses to be considered reliable, they have to maintain independent versions of events, Roux said. ""You failed, Mr. Johnson,"" he said. The lawyer then questioned Johnson on whether what he heard that night was indeed gunshots. Roux said the sounds could have been Pistorius trying to break down the bathroom door with a cricket bat. Pleading not guilty . Lawyers had briefly detoured Wednesday into another of the four charges Pistorius faces, related to the discharge of a gun he was holding in a crowded restaurant in Johannesburg about a month before the killing. Pistorius pleaded not guilty Monday to one charge of murder and a firearms charge associated with Steenkamp's killing as well as the two gun indictments unrelated to her death. The trial is expected to take at least three weeks. In South Africa, premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence, with a minimum of 25 years. Pistorius also could get five years for each gun indictment and 15 years for the firearms charge. If he isn't convicted of premeditated murder, the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide, a crime based on negligence, and could be looking at up to 15 years on that charge, experts said. Picture of a dream couple . Pistorius and Steenkamp were a young, attractive, high-profile couple popular in South Africa's social circles. Pistorius, whose ""Blade Runner"" nickname reflects the special prostheses he uses while running, won six Paralympic gold medals and became the first double-amputee runner to compete in the Olympics, in London in 2012. Cover girl Steenkamp, who was soon to star in a TV reality show, was on the cusp of becoming a celebrity in her own right. But on February 14, 2013, Steenkamp lay lifeless in a pool of blood on the floor of her boyfriend's house in an upscale gated community in Pretoria. Moments before, Pistorius said, he had pointed his 9 mm pistol toward an upstairs toilet room and fired four bullets through the locked door. In court documents, Pistorius has said he heard a noise from the bathroom in the middle of the night and -- feeling vulnerable without his prosthetic legs on -- charged toward the bathroom on his stumps. He has said he shot through the toilet door to protect himself and Steenkamp. ""I felt a sense of terror rushing over me,"" he said in his court affidavit. ""There are no burglar bars across the bathroom window, and I knew that contractors who worked at my house had left the ladders outside. ""It filled me with horror and fear of an intruder or intruders being inside the toilet. I thought he or they must have entered through the unprotected window. As I did not have my prosthetic legs on and felt extremely vulnerable, I knew I had to protect Reeva and myself."" Prosecutors are painting a different picture. They say the pair had an argument and that Steenkamp locked herself in the toilet. At last year's bail hearing, the state said Pistorius put on his prosthetic legs, collected his gun from under the bed and walked down the hall leading from the bedroom to the bathroom before unloading a flurry of shots through the door. Pistorius is not claiming self-defense; he is claiming to have been mistaken about his need for self-defense. He is denying he intentionally, unlawfully killed Steenkamp. He has never denied killing her. The case has put the spotlight on South Africa's rampant gun violence and high crime rates. Roughly 45 people are murdered every day, according to police statistics, and the number of home burglaries is up 70% in the last decade. In 2012, more than half of South Africans told the country's police force they were afraid of having their homes broken into. In his affidavit, Pistorius said he had been the victim of violence and burglaries before, including death threats. CNN's Nic Robertson, Emily Smith, Robyn Curnow, Nick Thompson, Ashley Fantz and Susannah Cullinane contributed to this report.","NEW: ""He definitely wanted her to live, "" witness says about Oscar Pistorius .

"(CNN) -- In their tall, fur hats and embellished traditional jackets, hundreds of Cossacks are patrolling the streets of Sochi, Russia, as the 2014 Winter Olympic Games approach. These Russian soldiers, whose ancestry dates back thousands of years, are known in the West for their gravity-defying dance style. Closer to home, the Cossacks have long symbolized rebellion and military might in Western and Southern Russia and Ukraine. That reputation was further enhanced by Russian literature giants Leo Tolstoy and Alexander Pushkin, whose writings contributed to the myth surrounding the Cossacks. But within their high hats is hidden a dark history. Known for rebelling against Russia's feudal system, the Cossack state allied itself with Russia's tsars to help create the monolithic Russian Empire. These warrior horsemen helped bring Russian rule to vast parts of the country, most notably Siberia. Opinion: The Olympics' forgotten people . During the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, the Cossacks fought for the Russian crown in regional wars against the Russian people, garnering a reputation as the tsars' henchmen. Acting on behalf of the Russian Empire, the Cossacks carried out pogroms, or massacres of the Jews, in 19th century Russia. But over time, the tsars became wary of the Cossacks' impunity against the Russian Empire and their inability to fully control them. So, when the Cossacks again turned to rebellion against the empire and its imposed rule, the tsars ruthlessly punished the Cossack leaders and their warriors, as documented in the Cossack rebellion, led by Yemelyan Pugachev, against Catherine the Great in the late 18th century. The tsars and the Cossacks found themselves united once again during the rise of the Bolsheviks in the early 20th century. The Cossacks supported Tsar Nicolas II and the anti-communist forces that made up the White Movement during the Bolshevik revolution in 1917 and the ensuing Russian Civil War. After the Bolsheviks (who later became Communists) came to power, they massacred many Cossacks for their opposition to the revolution. Since the fall of the Soviet Union in the late 20th century, there has been a revival of Cossack culture and pride in Russia and the former Soviet states. Russia has been turning to the Cossacks to help bolster security, even before Sochi was named as the host city for the 2014 Winter Olympics. Russian forces hunt Dagestan militants, 'black widows' Last year, the governor of Russia's Krasnodar region -- where Sochi is located -- hired about 1,000 Cossack patrolman to rein in the surge of illegal immigrants, mostly Muslim, according to the New York Times. ""What you cannot do, a Cossack can,"" Krasnodar Gov. Aleksandr Tkachev explained to local police. His comments sparked an outcry from Sochi natives, minorities and migrants. Analysts say it is not a coincidence that the Cossacks' revival is taking place as nationalism and xenophobia are on the rise in Russia. This new role for the Cossacks has opened up a ""can of worms,"" writes Valeriy Dzutsev, an analyst with the Jamestown Foundation. That's because some Cossacks are starting to demand more power and land from Moscow ""to support the process of the rebirth of the Cossacks,"" Dzutsev writes in the Central Asial-Caucasus Institute (CACI) Analyst. And Dzutsev warns that Russia's reliance on the Cossacks ""may naturally translate into conflicts between the indigenous population of the North Caucasus and the Cossacks."" So far, most Russians have embraced this rebirth of the Cossacks, due in part to the mythology surrounding them, aided by Tolstoy and Pushkin's writings. But as Moscow calls on the Cossacks to fulfill this myth of the warrior class -- traditional clothing and all -- the tumultuous relationship between the Cossacks and the Russian Empire will be important to remember.","Russia has deployed Cossack soldiers to help with Olympics security .

"(CNN) -- Only five months in office and President Hassan Rouhani of Iran secured himself a top speaking slot at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. This feat is in itself full of symbolic significance. Rouhani's predecessor -- the bombastic Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -- never during his 8-years in office made it to the prestigious gathering of world political and business leaders. The organizers of Davos, a forum intended for the exchange of ideas aimed at reaching solutions to pressing global challenges, doubtless felt Ahmadinejad's policy approach -- ""a locomotive without brakes"" to use one of his own favored analogies -- was unseemly for such a gathering. Not so with Rouhani, a man elected on the promise to reach out to the world and overhaul Iranian foreign policy. In Davos, Rouhani was handed another occasion to outline his vision and convince a still somewhat skeptical Western audience. In contrast to his predecessor, President Rouhani's presentation in Davos was a down-to-earth one. There was no mention of Iran seeking to ""change the global management,"" another favored Ahmadinejad mantra and a jab at the United States and other Western powers. Instead, Rouhani explicitly urged Washington to come to terms with the Islamic Republic as a political reality and a regional power. Do that, he seemed to say to the Americans, and we can start working together on a host of issues. And Rouhani had plenty to say along those lines, so much so that the poor interpreter was at times out of breath. He tied the issue of economic development to stability in the Middle East. He spoke of the numerous economic and trade opportunities that could bring Iran and her neighbors closer together. He singled out specific countries such as Turkey, Iraq, Russia and Pakistan but then did not mention Saudi Arabia by name. That was a glaring omission as it is hardly a secret that Iran and Saudi Arabia are engaged in proxy conflicts from Lebanon to Yemen and from Bahrain to Afghanistan. As Rouhani himself stated repeatedly during his election campaign, Tehran and Riyadh need to hit the refresh button or dig themselves into a deeper hole. The other country that Rouhani did not mention by name was Israel, another omission that was notable. Of course, the question of Israel is never far away from Rouhani's mind. In fact, the Iranian president's aircraft had ended up awkwardly parked next to that of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Zurich International Airport as the two leaders arrived. Professor Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum and Rouhani's host, gently nudged the Iranian president to see if Tehran might find it feasible to include Israel in this new outreach to the world but Rouhani dodged the question. This showed that Rouhani, for whatever idealism he might secretly hold, is not willing or able to go down a path that would require him to to shake some of the basic tenants of the Islamic Republic such as its non-recognition of the State of Israel. At least not for now. Meanwhile, one of Rouhani's key intents in Davos was to sell Iran to the world business community as an untapped market of nearly 80 million people. In his remarks, he mentioned that his government wants to prepare the foundations for Iran to become one of the top 10 economies in the world in the next 30 years. And in that context, his pitch to Western energy firms was blatant. In fact, Rouhani had made sure to bring along his oil minister who has in turn promised that the notoriously sheltered Iranian energy sector will by September launch new attractive projects in the oil and gas fields and open to international bidders. The skeptics will point to Rouhani's focus on trade and economic reintegration as an indication that Tehran is only after lessening the pains of economic isolation and sanctions brought about by its nuclear program but that it has no genuine intention to transform itself politically. Rouhani's speech had after all no new compromises to offer, including no signs that Tehran is prepared to change its support for the Assad regime in Syria. Such a reading of Rouhani ignores the political realities in Tehran where his critics are waiting for him to slip. And as a seasoned political player in the Islamic Republic, Rouhani knows he has to choose his battles carefully. Otherwise he will soon have his wings clipped by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who has out of necessity approved of the idea of seeking a compromise with the United States but shown no sign to date that he is ready to accept any other fundamental adjustments to the Islamic Republic. This is the basic premise confronting Rouhani at home and this has to be recognized in Western capitals as they prepare wish lists for Rouhani. At the same time, a truly transforming President Rouhani should find it in himself to go back to Tehran and repeat something that the Iranian president said in Davos: that no country can live in isolation and that global inter-dependence is a fact of life. By insisting on such an open and frank debate at the highest levels of the Iranian government, Rouhani can truly help bring Iran closer to the international mainstream and reduce the number of the skeptics in the West who believe he is a gimmick put up by the Iranian regime and not a genuine agent for change. But it will invariably be a process that will include reconsideration of some the existing Iranian policies -- including the question of relations with Israel and Saudi Arabia that Rouhani dodged in Davos -- but are not going to go away.

"(CNN) -- It is much easier to score a tough restaurant reservation in New York City in the summer. If you want to snag a table at places like Eleven Madison Park, Torrisi or Brooklyn Fare, summer is the best time to try because many New Yorkers empty out of the sweltering city to avoid feeling like a roast chicken on the subway platforms. City dwellers zoom out on the Long Island Expressway to the Hamptons, the summer playground for the wealthy and those who wish they were. Though the Hamptons are spectacular for a lifestyle that matches the city's sophistication, there are countless other getaways in New York state that offer unparalleled beauty, charming bed and breakfasts, beautiful farms, rivers and restaurants. Some of the state's most beautiful areas, like the Hudson River Valley, are just two hours from the city. Within four to five hours are enchanting regions like the Adirondacks, the Finger Lakes and Saratoga and a chance to live the small-town life for a weekend. America's most charming inns . For a slower pace, reasonably priced meals and spectacular vistas only found in New York, here are five options to consider for your next vacation. Greenport . On the North Fork of Long Island is the charming, historic village of Greenport. Just a ferry ride from Shelter Island and the rest of the Hamptons, Greenport feels like a quaint seaside oasis, untouched by any power scene. Shacking up here for a weekend is completely relaxing and a great central point for exploring the area's many wineries, fresh produce and seafood. Settled in 1682, Greenport has lived through eras as a whaling and fish-processing town and is now seeing an oyster reboot. The North Fork Oyster Company has experienced great success in its Stirling Square location since opening a year ago with Farouk Ahmad and his wife, Sana, at the helm. Most of the wines served at the restaurant are from the surrounding vineyards, like McCall, Lenz and Pellegrini. For oysters with a water view, award-winning clam chowder and classic fried seafood, Claudio's Clam Bar has a celebratory feel for no apparent reason except that life is good in the North Fork.

For a sense of place in a night's stay, the Morning Glory serves up a gourmet breakfast in a restored 19th-century home, while the Harborfront Inn offers chic comfort with water views. Photo rituals: Landmark handstands and more . Saratoga Springs . If you've ever dreamed of quitting your high-stress job and opening a bakery, strolling the main street of Saratoga Springs just might convince you to do it. It's like a movie set of what an upstate town should look like. The area was first known for the rich mineral water from the natural springs, but the Saratoga Race Course is the major draw and has been since the first horse races were held there in 1847. Today, there are concerts and events held at the track year-round. Coming up August 18-26 is the oldest major thoroughbred race in America, the Travers Stakes, also known as Saratoga's Mid-Summer Derby. Even if you don't go to Saratoga for the horses, there is plenty to do. Tour nearby Skidmore College, or attend a performance at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. A great place to stay is the Saratoga Arms, a beautiful B&B housed in an old brick home, with a front porch perfect for a morning cup of coffee. At Putnam Market & Wine, you can pick up local gourmet goodies, like jars from Saratoga Peanut Butter Company. A night out inevitably ends on tiny Caroline Street, with people spilling out of cute pubs and bars, including Saratoga City Tavern, which has the only rooftop bar in town. Seven beauties of the British Isles . Lake George . In Lake George Village, the town on the southern end of the lake, classic summer nostalgia is everywhere you look, from mini golf courses to ice cream stands and T-shirt shops. Lake George itself is 32 miles long, surrounded by lush greenery in the summer. The Sagamore Hotel opened in 1883 and immediately attracted the most sophisticated travelers of the day. Today, it's the most fitting place for family vacations and celebrations on the lake, with tennis courts, an indoor rec center and lodge rooms that cater to families and a great pool. New York City dwellers might be shocked with how low restaurant prices are, and though Lake George isn't a foodie paradise, meals are comforting and good. A round of mini golf at Around the World and ice cream at the Pink Roof is certainly a rite of passage for locals and visitors alike. Five guys take same photo for 30 years . Hudson River Valley . In a word, the Hudson River Valley is glorious. Just a two-hour drive from Midtown Manhattan, it could just as well be a plane ride away, as different as it feels.Â Summer allows the local farms to show off and sell their delicious fruits and vegetables. With rolling hills, Hudson River views, historic homes and great restaurants, the valley can be visited time and again. Perched like a castle on the river, the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park has churned out some of the nation's most celebrated chefs but also offers a phenomenal lineup of classes for home cooks and those wanting to learn more, as well as options for lunch and dinner. In Rhinebeck, the Beekman Arms Hotel is a classic, and guests of Chelsea Clinton stayed here during her July 2010 wedding in the Hudson Valley. Nearby is Gigi Trattoria, which serves ""Hudson Valley Mediterranean"" food with a laser focus on using what is in season. But the trattoria always serves the famous Gigi Skizza, an addicting light flatbread pizza. The Millbrook Winery has sweeping views and lovely wine tastings and is part of the Dutchess County Wine Trail. Also worth seeing are significant American sites like the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's home and the Vanderbilt Mansion. Skaneateles . Just think ""Skinny at las(t),"" dropping the T, when trying to pronounce Skaneateles. This small town sits on the shores of on an unspoiled blue lake in central New York's Finger Lakes region, named for 11 lakes that resemble fingers if you look at it from above. The area is known for a wealth of outdoor and water activities on Skaneateles Lake in the summer, as well as the wine trail, B&Bs and home decor shops. Visiting the Mirbeau Inn and Spa feels like you're visiting the grand country estate of a rich uncle, with fine dining and a spa that rivals those of Manhattan's hotels. For a top dinner choice, Rosalie's Cucina has a reputation that goes beyond the Finger Lakes and is evocative of a bustling Tuscan trattoria. The restaurant, serving heaping plates of salad and pasta, has welcomed A-list guests alongside its local clientele and visitors. You'll see a long line at Doug's Fish Fry, but it moves fast, offering fresh, delicious seafood perfect for lunch.","Try these spots if you want to skip the see-and-be-seen feel of the Hamptons .

"(CNN) -- You never know what you're going to find in an unused storage room. Employees at the National Institutes of Health, for example, recently discovered some old vials of variola. You may know variola by its less formal name -- smallpox. Yes, the deadly virus that was the scourge of civilization for centuries. It's been considered an eradicated disease ever since 1980, following successful worldwide vaccination programs. The last known outbreak in the U.S. was in 1947 in New York. Childhood vaccination programs are safe, seriously . The vials appear to date back to the 1950s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which released a statement on Tuesday about the discovery. Scientists made the discovery when they were preparing to move a lab from the Food and Drug Administration's Bethesda, Maryland, campus to a different location. The laboratory had been used by the NIH but was transferred to the FDA in 1972. The vials were located in an unused part of a storeroom. When the scientists found the vials, they immediately put them in a containment lab and on July 1 notified the branch of the government that deals with toxic substances, called the Division of Select Agents and Toxins. The CDC says there is no evidence that any of the vials was breached, nor were any of the lab workers exposed to the virus. On Monday, law enforcement agencies transferred the vials to the CDC's high-containment facility in Atlanta. Testing confirmed that there was variola virus DNA in the vials. Scientists will do some more testing to see if it could grow in tissue culture. Once the tests are done, the CDC will destroy the samples. The CDC is one of only two official World Health Organization designated repositories for smallpox. The other is in Novosibirsk, Russia. The CDC let the WHO know about the find and invited the WHO to witness the destruction of the vials, which is the standard protocol any time anyone finds smallpox samples unexpectedly. The FBI is investigating how the samples ended up where they did. Smallpox Fast Facts .","Vials of smallpox virus that appear to date back to the 1950s found at NIH laboratory .

"Editor's note: A nationally syndicated columnist, Roland S. Martin is the author of ""Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith"" and ""Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. He is hosting ""No Bias, No Bull"" at 8 p.m. ET on CNN while Campbell Brown is on maternity leave. Roland Martin says there's an assumption the word ""qualified"" needs to be used for women, minorities. (CNN) -- I couldn't help but laugh this morning when I saw the headline for a debate on Politico.com: ""Should Obama feel obliged to appoint a qualified woman, African American or Hispanic to the Supreme Court? If so, why, and on what basis should he choose among these groups?"" Hmmm. A ""qualified"" woman, African-American or Hispanic. My first thought? Hell no! Give me the most unqualified person to sit on the highest court in the land! Yeah, right. It's always amazing when diversity is discussed that people feel the need to use the qualifier ""qualified."" If you think about it, there never seems to be an assumption when white men are being discussed that they are unqualified. Their qualification is simply assumed and is inherent in their whiteness and maleness. Sure, go ahead and say, ""Man, you're being too sensitive!"" But I do want you to think about this for a second. Why do we as a society feel the need to say it's important to have ""qualified"" women or minorities? Isn't that assumed? If President Obama is going to pick a Supreme Court justice, it never has dawned on me that he will grab a list of people who aren't capable of doing the job. The thought never even enters my mind. Part of the issue is that a lot of folks have bought into the notion that any minority has gotten a job based on their skin color or a woman is hired because of her gender, so therefore, we better emphasize the need for a ""qualified"" person. You ought to see some of the e-mails I've gotten from folks who think they are hurting my feelings by saying I'm a ""quota"" or ""affirmative action"" hire and took the job of ""a deserving white person."" Oh, yeah, these are a part of the greatest hits in my inbox. A few years ago, I recall a white female news director in Texas who often reveled in her liberal way of thinking. She would go on and on about being a white liberal but would often talk about how hard it was to find ""qualified"" minorities for jobs. Then I would look at some of the most incompetent white men and women who worked for her and ask myself, ""I wonder if they passed the qualified test?"" Another time, I challenged a white male recruiter on the term, and he would just say over and over, ""You, know, qualified."" And I kept pressing him on whether he asks the same question of someone white, and he couldn't answer the question. Now, I'm sure the folks who despise affirmative action will quickly say, ""See, if it weren't for affirmative action, no one would even use such terms!"" Yeah, right. In the 17 years I've been a professional journalist, I've seen unqualified white men, white women and, yes, minorities hired and promoted, and affirmative action had nothing to do with it. People make hiring decisions based on the flimsiest of reasons, whether it's what schools they went to (such as assuming everyone from an Ivy League school is the best; no, some are incompetent), they know the right people, or they were so ""articulate"" that they were given a shot. And yes, I've seen a host of qualified white men, white women, African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans hired for jobs, and they've done a fantastic job. It wasn't their race or gender that was the key; they simply had the skills to do the job. It's simply time that when it comes to women or minorities, we should retire the use of word ""qualified."" Every job, regardless of a group targeted, should be filled with a person with the right talents, smarts and energy to get the job done. Hiring the best should automatically mean they are qualified. Period. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin: Why isn't the word ""qualified"" used often for white men?
He says ""qualified"" is often applied to idea of hiring women, minorities .
He says every job should be filled with someone who has talent to succeed ."
"(CNN) -- In a cold, wet field two hours' drive west of London, there's no mistaking the huddle of ancient shapes that emerge suddenly on the horizon, back-dropped by a distant cluster of leafless trees. Until recently, any first encounter with Stonehenge, that legendary keeper of Neolithic secrets, could prove deeply underwhelming. Two traffic-snarled highways have encroached on the brooding rocks, robbing them of their scale. Now that's changing. The site's custodians have unveiled a $44 million visitor center and a radical remodeling of the landscape that will reconnect the circle with the atmospheric terrain it has occupied for more than 4,000 years. CNN was among the first visitors through its doors -- and to experience a redesigned approach to the UNESCO World Heritage Site that its guardians hope will restore some of its once-formidable presence. Visitors are no longer directed to a cramped parking lot slapped hastily on top of historically significant earthworks. The parking lot and a roadway, which for decades has severed the stone circle from an ancient avenue, are being torn up and grassed over. Instead they arrive at the new center, an elegant modern pavilion of glass and weathered sweet chestnut wood that now forms the gateway to the enigmatic millennium-old monument -- helping to create a sense of anticipation and drama. Contrast vital . ""One key thing has been to make it as different from the stones as possible,"" Stephen Quinlan, one of the center's architects, told CNN. The building's undulating roof and matchstick steel pillars blend in with the area's rolling hills and sparse woodland, he said. The center officially opens on December 18, three days before the winter solstice, when druids, pagans and revelers gather to watch the sun rise in perfect alignment with the stones -- a celestial event that both explains their purpose and deepens their mystery. These time-honored traditions show how cherished Stonehenge is, not only to the people who assign it spiritual importance, but also to the archaeologists who study its origins. Not to mention the 1 million tourists who traipse here each year. It's no wonder the government bodies guarding the site have been cautious about remodeling -- enduring 30 years of wrangling over budgets, designs and locations before creating the new center. Worthwhile wait . For some, however, the wait has been worth it. ""I think it's fabulous,"" Mark Horton, a professor of history at Bristol University, told CNN at the center's opening. ""It's one of the most important archaeological monuments in western Europe and has been for so long woefully neglected."" In one way the delays had been an advantage, he said. ""If it was here 10 years ago, it would look out of date because we now have completely new interpretations of how and why and when Stonehenge was built."" Stonehenge isn't visible from the center, lying over the crest of a hill -- so visitors spend time exploring its new exhibition space before walking or catching a road train to cover the mile and a half to the stone circle. The exhibition's centerpiece is a 360-degree virtual display that tries to simulate the experience of standing within the stone circle -- something most visitors have been banned from doing since the late 1970s in order to protect the rocks. It uses laser-scanned images to zap the viewer back through history amid dramatic solstice sunrises and sunsets. For anyone who has waited in vain for a dawn obscured by the miserable British weather, this could actually be an improvement. Neolithic head reconstructed . Among 250 other antiquities, the exhibition also includes the reconstructed head of a 5,500-year-old Neolithic man found nearby. Archaeologists have used advanced 3D scanning technology on his skull to reveal his face. While this undoubtedly offers a valuable glimpse into the human story behind Stonehenge, there's no escaping the fact that the result of all that hi-tech labor bears an uncanny resemblance to Jeff Bridges in ""The Big Lebowski."" The Neolithic man's skeleton is also on display, a fact that has stirred some controversy. The leader of Britain's self-proclaimed largest order of druids says the use of the bones is disrespectful to their long-dead owner. ""Those who've been laid to rest should stay at rest -- it's not a pagan issue, it's one of common decency,"" King Arthur Pendragon, who describes himself as the Battle Chieftain of the Council of British Druid Orders, told CNN. While it brings visitors face to face with the monument's history, what the new center cannot do is shed definitive light on how and why Stonehenge was constructed using stones quarried 150 miles away in the Preseli mountains of Wales. There have been numerous theories about their construction and purpose, ranging from outlandish claims about UFOs or mythical stories of giants and wizards to explanations concerning druidic rituals or astronomical observatories. Solstice ceremonies . The 2009 announcement that another stone circle -- Bluestonehenge -- had been discovered adjacent by the nearby River Avon has lent support to another theory: that Stonehenge was a temple forming part of a larger funeral and burial complex that only later became a place for solstice ceremonies. Back in the 21st century, with much of the remodeling yet to be completed, it's still a work in progress. Although the road train's slower approach to the stones does help build the atmosphere, the old parking lot and the remaining busy highway still blot the landscape. There are times, however, walking the circuit around Stonehenge, when the traffic, the noise and the fellow visitors taking iPhone selfies suddenly melt away. In these fleeting moments there's a sense of the power these simple rocks have conveyed to so many. But while the site's guardians hope their innovations will help visitors to connect better to the surrounding ancient landscape, for some there will always be one crucial element missing. ""The only thing that struck me is you can't go up and touch it,"" said fourth-time visitor Keith Foskett, of West Sussex, England. ""I think that's a real shame. English Heritage might own it, but it really belongs to the people. You should be allowed to go up and hug the stones."" Stonehenge, near Salisbury, England. +44 87 0333 1181. Visits over the festive period won't require booking but must be reserved from February 1, 2014, when entrance will be managed through timed tickets; adults $24, child $14.50, family $65.","Overhaul of 4,000-year-old monument cost $44 million and was delayed for decades .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown has ""made significant strides"" in staying sober since he got out of jail in June, the singer's psychiatrist said. The doctor's letter to Brown's probation officer said he's ""working on personal growth"" and ""is taking responsibility for his behaviors"" in the two months since he was freed from jail. Those behaviors have included an alleged sidewalk fight that sent him to jail in Washington, D.C., in October and a violent outburst that got him booted from a drug rehab program in November. The doctor's treatment is part of his probation sentence for an attack on then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. Brown, 25, was in a Los Angeles court on Wednesday for a status hearing on his probation, which will end on January 23, 2015, as long as he stays out of legal trouble and completes another 600 hours of community labor. Judge James Brandlin praised the singer for his favorable probation report, which is a contrast to several recent reports that culminated in Brown spending four months in court-ordered rehab and three months in jail. ""Mr. Brown has made significant strides in maintaining his sobriety, as well as developing skills that promote personal growth,"" wrote the doctor, whose name was deleted from the report. Read Brown's probation report (PDF) He has passed all drug tests since he was freed from the Los Angeles County jail on June 2, the probation report said. Brandlin rewarded Brown by reducing random drug tests from three times a week to twice each week. But drug use -- specifically marijuana -- hasn't been Brown's only challenge. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which is blamed for violent outbursts. Chris Brown apologizes for 'GMA' outburst . He still faces trial this fall in Washington on a misdemeanor assault charge stemming from the sidewalk fight. He was booted from one rehab facility in November because he stormed out of a family counseling session and smashed the window of his mother's Mercedes with a rock. But Brown is taking his twice-a-week court-ordered psychological therapy sessions seriously, the doctor said. ""He continues to show great perseverance in implementing recommendations made by his treatment team, utilizing his learned skills and seeking guidance in his recovery process,"" his doctor reported. Brown's efforts to remain calm and in control appeared successful at the courthouse, despite some tense encounters with the news media covering Wednesday's hearing. He quietly watched as a TMZ reporter attempted to get on a courthouse elevator with him after the hearing. He left it to bodyguard Christopher Hollosy to repeatedly nudge the reporter until he was out the door. Hollosy, a large man who is fiercely protective of his client, was found guilty in April of attacking the same man in Washington that Brown is accused of hitting. When he encountered news photographers at the front courthouse exit, Brown retreated to a rear door, appearing unshaken and unemotional. The only woman with Brown at Wednesday's court date was his mother. She has been with him at almost all the hearings, except immediately after the window-smashing incident. Rihanna, who reunited with Brown at times in recent years, came to show her support for him at a hearing in February 2013. Karrueche Tran, his on-again, off-again, girlfriend is off again. She has attended most of Brown's recent hearings, including the last one in May. She was not in court Wednesday. Brown was a young teenager when his remarkable dancing and singing talents made him a pop star. He was 19 when he smashed Rihanna's face with his fist during an argument inside a rented Lamborghini on the evening of the 2009 Grammy Awards. Rihanna gives painful details of Chris Brown assault . ""Mr. Brown continues to work on gaining further insight into his thought processes and is taking responsibility for his behaviors,"" his doctor said.

"Gaza (CNN) -- With just 72 hours of calm under the current cease-fire, Palestinians are rushing to try to fix some of the worst of the destruction caused by the conflict in Gaza. Among the most urgent problems: sewage pipes that have been spewing raw effluent for weeks, a lack of clean water and severe power shortages. Aid groups are distributing basic supplies like mattresses and bottles of water. But as Palestinian and Israeli officials hold indirect talks in Cairo to seek a more lasting end to hostilities, residents of Gaza are confronting the longer-term question of how the territory can rebuild. More than 60 construction industry companies, which provide crucial building materials, were hit by Israeli strikes, according to Palestinian officials. 'They destroyed our business' Hatem Hassouna's factory made pavers for roads and concrete ready mix for buildings. ""You can't rebuild Gaza again until these kind of factories rebuild,"" he said as he stood amid the building's wreckage. Hassouna said he doesn't know why his factory was a target -- he sold only to the United Nations and aid groups. All of it, he said, was closely monitored by Israeli authorities. The Israeli military said it was looking into why the construction factory was hit. ""We are not following Hamas policies, we are following Israeli policies,"" Hassouna said. ""They destroyed our business, they destroyed our factories. And they want peace? How?"" Last month, Israel began its offensive against Hamas, the militant Islamic group that holds power in Gaza, in an effort to stop rocket fire across the border. It later sent in ground troops with the aim of destroying Hamas' network of tunnels, some of which extend into Israel and have been used to launch attacks. Over 100,000 homeless . The need for reconstruction following weeks of heavy fighting is pressing. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 16,700 homes in Gaza were destroyed or severely damaged in more than a month of fighting, leaving more than 100,000 people homeless. Residents say Israeli strikes flattened entire neighborhoods, like the one where Ayman Karfana and his family lived. ""I don't even know where my house is,"" he said. ""Where is the road? Where is my neighbor's home?"" The U.N. estimates that rebuilding the homes in the impoverished territory will cost more than $455 million. Limits on imports . The reconstruction issue plays into the talks in Cairo between Israeli and Palestinian delegations. Israel says the rebuilding of Gaza should be linked with demilitarization of the territory, which Hamas opposes. Hamas says it wants, among other things, the lifting of Israeli restrictions on the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza. Israeli authorities say the measures are necessary to prevent weapons being brought in. Israel limits imports of construction materials into Gaza. The Israeli military says that Hamas used much of the materials that were allowed in to build more tunnels rather than civil projects like schools, hospitals and libraries. Israel: Halt to violence is key . Israel would be willing to ease sanctions ""if all aggression from Gaza stops,"" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said Monday. ""I believe if the Palestinians -- if Hamas -- ceases violence, ceases to target Israeli citizens, then anything is possible,"" he said. The Palestinian delegation includes representatives from several factions, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Fatah, the group that governs the West Bank. Hamas officials have said the current round of Egyptian-mediated talks are crucial, suggesting it's the last time they'll be willing to participate. The truce began early Monday and is due to end early Thursday. Talks during a previous 72-hour cease-fire last week failed to yield a breakthrough. That truce ended Friday with a resumption of attacks. The U.N. said Monday that 1,960 Palestinians have been killed during the conflict; 71% of them were civilians. Israeli officials say 64 Israeli soldiers died, and three civilians were killed. CNN's John Vause reported from Gaza, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Samira Said and Saima Mohsin also contributed to this report.","More than 60 construction companies in Gaza were hit during the conflict .

"Berlin, Germany (CNN) -- Thousands of German demonstrators urged their leaders Monday night to shut down nuclear power plants in their country. The protests were staged in Berlin and other cities days after a powerful earthquake damaged nuclear plants in Japan and spurred fears of radiation there. Thorben Becker of the Federation for Environmental Protection, an environmental group, said the movement had received a major boost from the crisis in Japan. Becker said more than 100,000 turned up in more than 400 cities. There were hundreds of people at the Berlin protests and shouts of ""turn them off,"" a reference to German nuclear reactors, rang through the demonstration. On Saturday, protesters formed a 45-kilometer human chain between Stuttgart and the nuclear power plant Neckarwestheim. Police said around 60,000 people showed up for the protest, organized by various anti-nuclear organizations. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced a three-month moratorium on the extension of the operation periods for German nuclear plants. That move will lead to at least one German nuclear plant shutting down very soon, Germany's environmental minister later said in a statement. Germany opted out of nuclear energy during the Gerhard Schroeder administration and the country is waiting for the operational periods of its nuclear plants to expire. But the more pro-nuclear Merkel government, which succeeded the Schroeder administration, had passed a law extending the lifespan of the plants.","Anti-nuke demos held in German cities .

"(CNN) -- When the stirring speeches, heavyweight debates and fevered campaigning of the U.S. elections are long forgotten, a handful of far less noble incidents are  likely to be our enduring memories of the 2008 White House race. ""Hey America, I'm Paris Hilton and I'm a celebrity too."" While the candidates would like us to view their bids for the top job as an honorable battle of wits, policies, values and big issues, the sad truth is that it's more likely to boil down to a list of gaffes, embarrassments and sideshows. Both Democratic and Republican PR machines have been working hard to keep their campaigns on-script, but with a cast list of John McCain, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Sarah Palin and the Clintons, they had their work cut out. Alaskan ""hockey mom"" Palin's late arrival undoubtedly stirred things up, adding a dash of vigor as the race lumbered into its final straight, but even before she began stealing the show, there was no shortage of scrapbook moments. Sound off: Which do you think are the most memorable moments from the 2008 election? In no particular order, here is a selection of some of the best: . 1. Crying game: Back in January's New Hampshire primaries, Hillary Clinton welled up with emotion, almost crying into her coffee cup during a chat with voters. This unexpected exposure of her human side was credited with winning back some women supporters. Read more . 2. McCain bombs: John McCain displayed rather off-key singing and diplomacy skills when asked if there was a plan to attack Iran back in April 2007. Changing the words to the classic Beach Boys' song ""Barbara Ann,"" the Arizona senator responded: ""Bomb bomb bomb, bomb bomb Iran."" Read more . 3. Pastor disaster: Proving once again that religion and politics don't mix, Barack Obama was forced to distance himself from his former pastor and mentor Jeremiah Wright, after a series of pulpit fulminations in which he made racially-charged criticisms of Hillary Clinton and said of the 9/11 terror attacks: ""American's chickens are coming home to roost."" Read more . 4. Ramblin' man: Garrulous ""gaffe machine"" Joe Biden got the last word in a primary debate about his tendency to speak his mind and not shut up. Asked if he could hold his tongue enough to ""reassure your voters in this country that you have the discipline you would need on the world stage,"" Biden replied succinctly: ""Yes."" Read more . 5. The pig issue: Obama may have been hoping to generate oinks of outrage when he commented in September that McCain's policies were like ""lipstick on a pig,"" after the Arizona senator named Sarah Palin as running mate. The Democratic candidate refused to apologize for what Republicans said was a misogynistic response to Palin's own claim to be a pitbull in lipstick. You couldn't make it up.  Read more . 6. Miss-firing: Hillary Clinton had her campaign guns blazing in March when she described the drama of a visit to Bosnia 12 years earlier. ""I remember landing under sniper fire,"" she said. Clinton was later forced to admit ""misspeaking"" after video footage of the event showed her strolling leisurely from the aircraft. Read more . 7. Ordinary Joe: First there was Joe Biden, then there was Palin's mythical beer swiller Joe Sixpack and finally there was Joe the Plumber -- just a regular guy worried about his business going down the drain. Despite not actually being a licensed plumber, and not even being called Joe, he has been seized on by McCain as an everyman hero. This endorsement sprung more leaks when Joe failed to appear on cue to a recent McCain event. Read more . 8. Bad business: Neither presidential candidate makes claim to being psychic, but McCain might have done better consulting his tea leaves rather than the advisors who led him to say ""the fundamentals of our economy are strong"" on the eve of America's worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Read more . 9. Palintology: Her political skills aside, moose-shooting Sarah Palin has been an unfortunately prolific headline generator for the Republican campaign, whether eyeing Russia from her Alaskan home, shopping for suits, stumbling over questions from Katie Couric or introducing her pregnant teenage daughter. Read more . 10. Barack=Britney: Celebrity endorsements are one thing, but McCain's campaign ad comparing his rival to pop star Britney Spears and heiress Paris Hilton was seen by at least one person as taking things a little too far. A swimsuit-clad Hilton responded by launching her own campaign for the presidency: ""Hey America, I'm Paris Hilton and I'm a celebrity too.

"(CNN) -- Doing 75 mph down a winding canyon on an otherwise calm afternoon evoked some discomfort from my then-fiance passenger, white-knuckling his door handle. ""Am I making you nervous, Sweetie?"" I asked. I was enjoying the speed thrill and was acutely aware that he was not. ""Not really,"" he managed to squeak. But we were a month and a half away from the ""biggest day"" of our lives, and I knew better. The nerves were starting to fray a bit. Five seconds of silence before he said: ""I just don't want anything to happen to us before the wedding."" And there it is. The very sentence that summarizes what I like to call ""Wedding World"" -- an alternative reality not elicited by drugs, engaged in by the weak of heart, nor entered often by choice. A place where you believe, unequivocally, that the universe does revolve around you. A place that gave me some sympathy for the narcissists in my life. This frame of mind is entirely limiting. There is no time to enjoy a beautiful sunset when you've got to put lotion on your skin for the fifth time that day. Let me clarify. I love my husband dearly. I wanted to get married, and I think, as an observer, weddings are beautiful occasions. Everyone is smiling, and if they're crying it's because they're so very happy. Weddings are inspirational events, evoking notions of summer evenings, blushing brides, silly pranks by younger brothers and pretty bridesmaids all in a row. That's what a wedding is all about, right? I was the sort of bride-to-be who prided herself on not capitulating to the capitalist wedding-day requirements. Yes, I know that the average U.S. wedding costs a staggering $28,000, but those ""free spirits"" who serve Cheetos and Ho Ho cakes at their soirees didn't seem that bad to me. I was certain that I would not lose sight of what the occasion was all about: marrying the man I love. Four months before our big day, after we moved into a house large enough to accommodate a polygamist family, I realized things were getting out of hand. It wasn't explicitly said, but we chose that house knowing his family and friends were coming into town and would not be impressed by our basement apartment. We chose that house to have a big-ass rehearsal dinner. People do crazy stuff in Wedding World. Soon I was faced with such ""heavy"" decisions as: Reserved or open seating? Band or DJ? One or two entrees? Veil or no veil? Roses or tulips? 6:00 or 6:30? Guitar player or violinist? Pachelbel's ""Canon"" or ""Over the Rainbow""? Sanity or nuthouse? After all was said and done, our wedding was wonderful. I have the best husband a woman could ask for, but it turned out that leaving Wedding World was not so easy. As part of my 12-step Wedding World cessation program, it helped me to identify six fairly distinct phases of this common affliction -- and laugh at our silly ways. Phase 1: The post-engagement high . This is a blissful, short-lived period when the wedding still feels like an exotic, far-off event. ""Yay, we're getting married!"" You and your partner bat around loose ideas about what sort of wedding you each want (""Oh, maybe we can get married in Hawaii!"") and leave it at that, which brings me to the next phase. Phase 2: Denial for two . For me, this lasted too long -- about five months of our nine-month engagement. Toward the end of this phase, a mutual friend said over drinks at a bar, ""You know what I love about you guys? That you never talk about your wedding. Engaged couples get so consumed and you guys aren't like that at all."" Her comments made me, um, think about things. Phase 3: Reality bites . In this phase you collide with the fact that you're essentially throwing the largest party of your life for the most important people in your life. And you realize you want very badly for this party to go extremely well. We picked out invitations and tasted cakes as if Martha Stewart were on the guest list. We scoured weddings sites as though our very lives depended on finding the perfect location -- would people prefer the view of a mountain or a beautiful garden? -- and went to Napa Valley to taste wines. OK, this one was an excuse to take a break from this phase, which boils down to a package of stress with the delivery date pounding your brain every minute. Phase 4: Crunch time . This phase, mere weeks away from the main event, was actually more bearable for me. My fiance and I talked as if we were planning a military operation: ""I've got the flowers covered, the RSVPs are coming in and we should have a final count by Tuesday at 16:00, but the backyard is the fly in the ointment."" The wedding loomed larger than ever, but we were too busy to stress about it. Phase 5: The big day . This is the phase Wedding World folks live for. It is the height of WW, the reason you do it all. It absolutely amazes me how wonderful this phase was. We got pre-ceremony massages. There were pretty bridesmaids all in a row and it was a summer evening. No silly pranks were played, but we danced the night away and love was all around us. Still, it's ironic that this is the shortest phase. We spent how many months planning -- for a five-hour event? Phase 6: Post-honeymoon detox . This last phase is much less stressful, but definitely the silliest. My husband and I actually volunteered to videotape and DJ a friend's wedding one week after we returned from our honeymoon. We double-handedly sought to make it an affair to remember. I gave a toast in front of 250 people, of whom I knew approximately 15. My husband became DJ and announcer. We danced to every song, hoping to inspire people to get footloose. I think our freakish, post-wedding energy scared and confused guests as they remained firmly planted in their seats. Despite the stomach knots, obsessive thoughts and money squandering, Wedding World is ultimately a difficult place to leave. If you know people who are in this alternative reality, cut them some slack. Their days are strange and their logic skewed. Don't be afraid to approach them when they're poring over wedding pictures like dealers with a new load of premium cocaine. This phase will end. You'll get your friends or loved ones back, and when it's your turn to get married they'll be there to help you. And you'll be glad that they are.

"(CNN) -- When it comes to the new ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movie, critics have found one begrudging silver lining: At least it's better than ""Transformers."" Of course the live-action ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" in theaters Friday, has some things in common with that toy-based franchise, beginning with its association with Michael Bay. The ""Transformers"" director served as a producer on 2014's ""Turtles"" adaptation -- leaving the directing to Jonathan Liebesman of ""Battle Los Angeles"" -- and tapped former ""Transformers"" star Megan Fox to go along for the ride. In ""Turtles,"" Fox plays April O'Neil, the eager NYC TV reporter who stumbles across the titular crew of teenage mutants who are well-versed in the martial arts. As April learns, this quad of wise-cracking reptiles, who have a fondness for pizza and a rat for a mentor, are the result of a lab experiment. So there's the first sigh of relief for longtime fans of ""turtle power"": the new ""Turtles"" backstory is pretty faithful to the legacy of the comics, animated series and movies that came before it. There's a tweak involving April's childhood relationship to the turtles, but, overall, Donatello's still the brainy one; Raphael's still the hothead; Leonardo's still the leader; and Michelangelo is as party-ready as ever. The problem, critics say, isn't that Bay, Liebesman and script writers Josh Appelbaum, Andre Nemec and Evan Daugherty didn't respect the lore, or that the movie doesn't deliver on action. It's that they revived the franchise with no sense of humor or affection, or even a clear understanding of their audience. ""The new adaptation,"" says the Los Angeles Times, ""often feels like some sort of corporate seminar in brand management. There is something half-hearted about the entire film, as if those behind it were involved not because they wanted to make it, not because they should make it, but just because they could."" It's not ""out-and-out terrible,"" but it's not ""particularly memorable,"" either. Variety wound up in the same place of ambivalence, remarking in its review that ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is a ""back-to-basics origin saga that is neither a particularly good movie nor the pop culture travesty that some were dreading."" There are all the usual Bay trademarks -- ""chaotic action, crass side jokes, visual-effects overkill, Megan Fox"" -- but on the other hand, it's also ""nowhere near 'Transformers'-level off-putting,"" Variety shrugs. For The A.V. Club, it isn't ""fidelity"" the movie lacks, ""but a spirit of genuine boyish fun ... . 'Ninja Turtles' exists for the sole purpose of squeezing a few more drops of milk out of an old cash cow. At least the Turtles themselves look cool, strange new nostrils and all."" But according to The Washington Post, those turtles -- whether you find them to be cool or simply creepy -- don't get nearly enough screen time, and are treated more like ""sidekicks to the actual focus of this film: summer-movie sexpot Megan Fox."" USA Today, which found the movie ""charmless, dull and derivative,"" joined the party line and conceded that ""while there's nothing particularly playful, fun or clever about this big-screen 'Turtles' re-boot, there is some good news ... the ninja turtles are more enjoyable to watch than 'Transformers.' ""","The new ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" isn't getting great reviews .
The movie isn't horrible, but it isn't great, either .
At least, reviewers say, it's better than ""Transformers"""

"(CNN) -- For better or worse, Iraq and the United States have been attached at the hip for decades. From the 1991 Gulf War to the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein to subsequent years marred by violence and instability, there's no doubting the deep connection between the two nations. That's largely thanks to policies crafted out of Washington, be they intended to contain or eliminate Hussein or to stabilize and build up the fragile nation that remained in his wake. So it is no surprise that, with militants overrunning much of Iraq and threatening its capital, people are turning to the United States. What can it do? What will it do? Among Obama's options: . Option No. 1: Send in American troops . As of Monday, the Pentagon says it has only about 170 troops in Baghdad and 100 in undisclosed locations around the region. Their job is to protect the U.S. Embassy and other American interests, the Pentagon said. That's far from the troop levels of past Iraq engagements. U.S. troops didn't stay in Iraq for long after driving Hussein's military out of Kuwait in 1991, but they did hunker down 12 years later after toppling the Baathist regime. The responsibility that comes with rebuilding a country from over 6,000 miles away was one factor, but so was the continued violence. American troop levels in Iraq peaked at 166,300 in October 2007, according to the U.S. Defense Department. Critics derided the withdrawal of U.S. troops by the end of 2011. Among them was Sen. John McCain, who last week reiterated his disgust at that decision and called for the firing of Obama's national security team in part over what's happened in Iraq. ""Could all this have been avoided?"" the Arizona Republican said about the current state of Iraq, though he didn't outright call for fresh military action. ""And the answer is: Absolutely yes."" The biggest, simplest way to make an impact in Iraq: Send American troops back into the country. But it won't happen again. Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari told CNN on Thursday that no one is calling for ""American troops into Iraq."" And of all options now on the table, it's the only one that the Obama administration has explicitly nixed. ""We are not contemplating ground troops,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said last week. ""I want to be clear about that."" Option No. 2: U.S. airstrikes . Still, while the U.S. military might not have a role fighting on the ground in Iraq, it could have a role over it. On Monday, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged to Yahoo! News that airstrikes on Iraqi targets are under consideration. The aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush and five other warships are now in the Persian Gulf. More than 500 Marines and dozens of helicopters are on standby. In the past, Iraqis have been very public about their desire to limit the involvement of the American military. Yet, a U.S. official said the Iraqi government had indicated a willingness for the U.S. military to conduct airstrikes targeting members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and other militants. American air power has proven effective before in campaigns such as Kosovo or Libya. Yet it's not foolproof. Last week, Carney deflected a question about whether Obama might consult Congress before sending warplanes into Iraq -- saying it's too early to give an answer because the President hasn't decided the best course of action yet. Attacking sites from the air comes with a host of limitations and challenges -- the risk of U.S. casualties or capture should warplanes be shot down; the unlikelihood of wiping out an insurgency from above; the likelihood militants will blend into the civilian population and cause death and injury to the innocent. Option No. 3: Provide more military aid . Unlike the first two options, the U.S. government has already taken this course and has signaled it may do more. A Defense Department official says that about $15 billion in equipment, training and other services already have gone to Iraq. Carney reeled off some of the many items that have made their way east of late: millions of rounds of small arms fire, thousands of rounds of tank ammunition, hundreds of Hellfire missiles, grenades, assault rifles, helicopters and much more. And that tally doesn't include an additional $1 billion in arms -- including up to 200 Humvees -- that are now in a 30-day review period in Congress. But U.S. officials -- calling the current situation ""extremely urgent"" -- acknowledge that what's already in Iraq and what's coming may not be enough. Chief among those officials is Obama himself, who said last week: ""Iraq is going to need more help from us, and it's going to need more help from the international community."" At the same time, it's not like the billions of dollars worth of firepower proved all that effective against ISIS fighters in places like Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. Witnesses reported seeing Iraqi security forces drop their weapons, even shed their uniforms, then run to safety. James Jeffrey, U.S. ambassador to Iraq from 2010 to 2012 and now a fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, characterized Iraq's military as ""ill-trained, badly led and not particularly competent."" ""They clearly cannot fire and maneuver,"" said Jeffrey, a U.S. Army veteran. And it's not just a matter of making sure that whatever resources sent to Iraq are used effectively and not wasted. Already, militants have been able to pick up weaponry, vehicles and other goods on its swift, vast sweep of Iraq -- some of it supplied by the United States. ""We are not surprised,"" a defense official told CNN. ""It was a question of when, not if, something like this would happen."" Option No. 4: Effect change politically in Iraq . Beating back ISIS by retaking Mosul and other cities would be a huge victory for Iraq's government. But it wouldn't be a complete, conclusive win unless the country can get its house in order. And doing that, according to experts and U.S. officials, requires addressing what CNN's Nic Robertson has referred to as Iraq's ""political dysfunction."" One silver lining to the turmoil is Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government seems to be coordinating with the semiautonomous Kurdish government, American officials said. It appears Iraqi forces will team up with Kurdish fighters, known as the Peshmerga, to combat ISIS. Addressing the divisions between Shiites and Sunnis, the two dominant Muslim sects, in Iraq is another matter. Al-Maliki's government, as well as the military, is dominated by Shiites -- leaving Sunnis not only left out but also bitter, so much so that some of them may not see ISIS as a worse option. ""Over the last several years, we have not seen the kind of trust and cooperation develop between moderate Sunni and Shia leaders inside of Iraq,"" Obama said. ""That accounts in part for some of the weakness of the state, and that carries over into the military."" Vice President Joe Biden has been talking regularly with al-Maliki to try to effect political change, including possibly through a new unity government that gives Sunnis a prominent, hands-on role. Still, words -- as opposed to, say, troops on the ground -- are sometimes only so effective. And it's not like al-Maliki has heeded U.S. officials' call for sectarian reconciliation and unity in the past. Yet Washington's misgivings about the Prime Minister don't change the fact that they support him, generally. The question is still how, exactly, they will support him. ""There's more that Prime Minister Maliki should have done, could have done, over the course of time,"" said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. ""That's a message we've conveyed publicly and privately to him. ""But the enemy here is (ISIS). We need to work together and present a united front."" Interactive: Where is Iraq's oil?

"(CNN) -- If a Facebook picture is worth a thousand words, we're pretty sure there's one word in the lexicon you'd be loath to have associated with you: tool. (Unless you're a handyman, in which case, carry on.) Yes, Facebook started off as a gated community for college kids awkwardly trolling for chicks in their rooms because the outside world was just too bright ... too bright. But now, as Mark Zuckerberg sallies forth with his plan to consume all of society, it has become kind of legit. Last week, Zuckerberg unveiled a messaging system for the book of faces that will consolidate e-mail, texts, chat and Facebook messages. While we (unlike myriad reactionary news outlets) won't be calling Z's new baby a ""Gmail killer"" any time soon (dude, eradicate all those FB phishing scams and then we'll talk), the fact that Facebook would take such a step got us thinking. Every day, 4 billion messages are shot off via Facebook, and next to those 4 billion messages is something that could make or break the legitimacy of your missive -- or, at the very least, amuse or horrify your friends: your profile picture. This is your calling card, your public face. So why do so many of you contort it into that of a duck? Read on for five common types of Facebook photos that make your friends want to block you, potential employers take pause and future suitors weep with frustration at the state of the human race. The ""MySpace shot"" Oh, the ""MySpace shot"" -- in which men pose shirtless in front of their bathroom mirrors and women pout into their boobs. You think it makes you look sexy, but, truth be told, it makes you look like you have no friends. Which makes sense, considering the dudes are always hanging out shirtless in the bathroom and the chicks always look so freaking depressed. Fun fact: Research from OK Cupid shows the ""MySpace shot"" is the most effective snap for women when it comes to racking up messages. Still, that same research shows that shots of a chick doing something interesting, as opposed to looking sexy, garnered more meaningful communication. Yes, Facebook is not OK Cupid, but the research holds true: A cell phone pic may get you some attention, but, well, so will drunkenly passing out at a party and flashing your underwear. And for those among you who are too deeply entrenched in the morass of narcissism to pry iPhone from hand, might we suggest getting an account on DailyBooth? This service lets you take a photo of yourself every day in order to track how your appearance changes over time. At least then you can call it art ... or something. Subbing in an inanimate object/pet/baby . ""Hey Tim... so, I've known you for about five years now and I'm pretty sure you are not a crude drawing of a dinosaur, a cat with lasers for eyes or a green square. No, I'm pretty sure you're a skinny dude with an only slightly unfortunate haircut."" So thinketh your friends when nary a picture on your Facebook profile is actually of you. Also, people will start to wonder if you have been disfigured in some horrifying accident and -- Phantom of the Opera-like -- are masking your hideous face with that of Conan's. If you insist on getting creative with your profile pic, check out Twibbons, which lets you create profile images that promote a cause. Liquoring up . A couple of party pictures in which you're holding a glass of wine or a beer are fine, but a parade of profile pics that could pass for Budweiser ads -- or, for that matter, the photo above -- are probably not the best choice when it comes to looking like a professional/not an alcoholic. Yeah, that pic of you in the pool doing Edward 40-Hands might be hilarious to your poker pals and fellow former frat bros, but the kids you teach fourth grade math to (and their parents) will probably be less than amused. Group shots . Let's say you meet a new dude at a dark party. The guy seems nice, and looks to be cute from what you can tell through the haze of the smoke machine and Four Loko (it hasn't been banned everywhere yet, folks), but you can't quite tell because of the crudely markered-on Castro beard (oh, forgot to mention it's Halloween). The next day, you eagerly seek out homeboy on Facebook, only to find a profile picture that features not one, but five similar-looking dudes lying in the grass  -- wearing Wayfarers and fedoras. How are you supposed to tell which is which, and whether you should click ""friend""? Yeah, Facebook is not technically a dating site, but let's face it, the first thing you do after meeting a new romantic interest is stalk the hell outta him or her. According to a survey from Seventeen magazine, within one week of meeting someone, 79 percent of 16-21 year-olds add that person to their Facebook circle. And, as shallow as it is, folks will judge you based on your profile -- that same research shows that 43 percent of girls would decide not to date someone if his profile was a bust.

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis arrived in Seoul Thursday, marking the first papal visit to the country in 25 years. The historic visit is also a nod to Catholicism's shifting demographics as an increasing number of believers come from Latin America, Africa and Asia instead of its historic stronghold in Europe. ""The Pope's visit to South Korea is the first part of a very intelligent opening to Asia,"" said Lionel Jensen, associate professor of East Asian Languages and Cultures at the University of Notre Dame. ""The Pope's presence is a powerful symbol of the Vatican's recognition that it is in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa that the church is growing most prominently."" During his packed, five-day visit to South Korea, the Pope will beatify 124 Korean martyrs, help celebrate the 6th Asian Youth Day, which is a gathering of Asian Catholic youth, and hold Holy Mass for Peace and Reconciliation, expected to be aimed at prayers for peace, including South and North Korean relations. North Korea fired five short-range projectiles into the sea east of the Korean peninsula, beginning about an hour before the Pope's landing in Seoul, the South Korean Defense Ministry said. The Korean peninsula remains a divided one. One of the Pope's missions is to ""go to Korea and pray for the reconciliation and peace,"" said Vatican spokesman, Padre Federico Lombardi. Pope Francis is expected to meet South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, as well as hold Mass with family members of the victims of the sunken Sewol ferry and comfort women, who were forced to sexual slavery by the Japanese in World War II, in attendance. A message of simplicity . Catholicism's growth in South Korea has been incremental, rising from 5.2 million Catholics in 2005 to 5.4 million in 2013. That represents a significant slowdown from the growth rate of 70% seen in the 10 years to 2005. Just 10.4% of South Koreans are Catholic; most are Buddhist or Protestant. In a country that is entrenched in the latest technologies and also home to one of the biggest average household debts, Pope Francis is expected to bring his usual message of simplicity and humility. The Pope had requested the smallest car possible for his trip. ""Korea has experienced rapid economic and social development, and now is struggling with the conflicts surfacing from increased social polarization,"" wrote Rev. Peter Kang U-il, the President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Korea. The Korean Church must try to follow spiritual growth, rather than pursue material growth, he wrote. Thursday - August 14 (Greetings with officials) After his morning arrival, the Pope is expected to attend a private Mass and then proceed to the Blue House, which is the South Korean president's residence, where he is to meet with Park and other South Korean officials. He meets with Korean bishops at the Korean Episcopal Conference. Friday - August 15 (Interaction with youth) Pope Francis will lead a Mass at the Daejeon World Cup Stadium. The stadium, built for the 2002 World Cup games, can accommodate up to 42,000 people. As part of efforts of Asian Youth Day, he will lunch with young people at a seminary and meet with more youth at a shrine for Catholic martyrs. Saturday - August 16 (Beatification) The Pope will beatify 124 martyrs, many of whom were persecuted from 1791 to 1888. South Korea's early Catholic history is marked by fierce persecution by the government. Catholicism was viewed as a foreign influence and also a threat to Confucianism, which was the governing social order. The Catholic Church estimates about 10,000 believers died in the persecutions beginning in late 18th century. Those who refused to denounce their faith were executed. Many of them were tortured and beheaded. One of the most infamous execution sites is Seo So Mun, now located in Seoul. With his message of embracing the marginalized, the Pope is scheduled to visit Kkottongne, which means flower village. The biggest welfare facility run by the Korean Catholic Church, the program works with homeless, disabled people and substance addicts. The facility includes an adoption center for abandoned disabled infants. Sunday -- August 17 (Closes Asian Youth Day) After meeting with Asian bishops from the region, Pope Francis is expected to hold the closing Mass for Asian Youth Day, which is expected to be attended by 2,000 young people. Monday - August 18 (Mass for Peace and Reconciliation) After meeting with religious leaders, Pope Francis holds a final Mass for Peace and Reconciliation at Seoul's oldest cathedral, Myeong-dong Cathedral, in Seoul. Pope Francis is expected to hold a brief farewell ceremony before boarding a flight back to Rome.

"(CNN) -- The deadliest Ebola outbreak in recorded history has now infected nearly 2,000 people, with more than half of those killed by the disease, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. Ebola is believed to have infected 1,975 people in four West African countries since the outbreak began this year, and 1,069 of them have died, the WHO said. The numbers reflect the WHO's count as of Monday. That's an increase of 127 cases and 56 deaths in two days, the WHO said. The outbreak began in Guinea and has spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. The new numbers come as health officials are opening up to the use of experimental treatments and vaccines, since no proven treatment or vaccine exists. A group of ethicists gathered by the WHO this week unanimously concluded that it is ethical to offer unproven medications to fight the Ebola virus, even if their adverse effects are unknown. After the panel's decision, Canadian Health Minister Rona Ambrose announced that her government will donate between 800 and 1,000 doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine to the WHO. A ""small supply"" will be kept at home ""in the unlikely event it is needed for compassionate use in Canada,"" the Public Health Agency said. The drug, VSV-EBOV, is Canadian-made and -owned, having been developed by the National Microbiology Laboratory. And after an experimental serum was used to treat two American missionaries and a Spanish priest, Liberia is poised to use the serum on two infected doctors. Experimental drug likely saved Ebola patients . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Liberia's request for access to ZMapp, which was created by the San Diego-based biotech firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. Sample doses of the medicine will be sent to Liberia this week to treat doctors who have contracted the virus, the Liberian government said. The two Americans who received ZMapp, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, received the serum after contracting Ebola in Liberia. They were transferred to an isolation unit at an Atlanta hospital and appear to be recovering. 9 questions about this new Ebola drug . Writebol's husband, David, said his wife tells him that ""she is feeling better and getting stronger."" ""Each time I talk to her, I get a sense her voice is clearer and brighter,"" he told CNN's Elizabeth Cohen. The Spanish priest, Miguel Pajares, contracted the disease in Liberia and was transferred to an isolation unit in a Spanish hospital, where he received the serum. He died Tuesday morning. Mapp Biopharmaceutical said Monday that its supply of ZMapp has been exhausted. Kentucky BioProcessing, which manufactures a version of the drug, is working to increase production of ZMapp, but the process will take several months, company spokesman David Howard said last week. Ebola can torment its victims with high fevers, internal and external bleeding, vomiting and diarrhea. It often afflicts multiple organ systems and can kill up to 90% of those infected. The virus spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva and urine. Ebola outbreak likely started with 2-year-old in Guinea . Nine things to know about the Ebola virus .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The pace of the 2012 race for the White House kicks into high gear Wednesday night, with the first of three Republican presidential debates scheduled over the next 15 days. And while it's the fourth GOP debate so far this cycle, it's the first to include Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who jumped into the race for the White House less than one month ago. Joining Perry on the stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, will be former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who's making his second bid for the GOP nomination, Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, who's making third run for the White House, Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, businessman and former talk show host Herman Cain, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, and former Utah Gov. and former U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman. Five of the candidates -- Romney, Paul, Gingrich, Bachmann and Cain -- met Monday at the Palmetto Freedom Forum in Columbia, South Carolina. Perry was scheduled to attend, but canceled to return home to deal with the wildfires burning across Texas. Perry's entry into the race last month has dramatically altered the landscape, with the Texas governor on the top of the pack according to six major national polls released in the last three weeks. Romney, the former front-runner in the polls, has now be relegated to second place in the surveys. The three debates this month and two more next month will be major tests for Perry, who doesn't have a lot of recent experience debating political rivals. While the spotlight will be on the Texas governor, it will also be shining on Romney. The question for the former Massachusetts governor: Does he attack Perry's record, or does he keep his line of fire directed at President Barack Obama? Bachmann's mission in the debates: Try to grab back the spotlight that Perry grabbed from her on the day of her biggest victory. The Texas governor announced his candidacy on August 13, just a few hours before Bachmann won a crucial GOP presidential straw poll in Ames, Iowa. For the rest of the candidates on the stage, the objective is to show relevancy. This week's debate is followed by a CNN/Tea Party Express GOP presidential debate Monday in Tampa, Florida, with another debate in Florida on September 22. A New Hampshire debate on October 11 is followed a week later by a CNN debate in Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 18.

"(CNN) -- Capping a hotly contested contest, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos won re-election Sunday. With more than 99% of polling stations reporting, he had nearly 51% of the vote versus the 45% won by challenger Oscar Ivan Zuluaga, according to election officials. A first-round vote was held last month. None of the five candidates running then received more than 50% of votes, forcing a runoff between Santos and Zuluaga. Santos was first elected in 2010 on a platform of continuing an offensive against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, leftist guerrillas at war with the government for decades. But since late 2012, peace talks with the group have become a hallmark of the Santos presidency. Zuluaga had called for an end to the peace talks and is against giving any political space to the rebels. He conceded Sunday night, thanking supporters and promising to continue to fight for the good of the nation. Santos celebrated in Bogota, predicting the start of a new Colombia. ""These have been unique elections (because) what was at play wasn't the name of a candidate -- but the direction of the nation. Colombians with very different ideas ... came together around a cause,"" he told cheering crowds, ""and that cause is peace."" ""This is the end of more than 50 years of violence in this country, and the beginning of a new Colombia,"" Santos said. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Rafael Romo contributed to this report.","NEW: Juan Manuel Santos predicts the start of a new Colombia .

"(CNN) -- Jessica Moore knew working for a boss she didn't trust wasn't healthy. The 25-year-old epidemiologist from Georgia says her former boss would verbally abuse her and the colleagues she worked with in their office. ""You never knew what would set off this supervisor,"" said Moore. ""One minute, this boss would be calm, then the next minute this person would berate you or a colleague in front of others."" Moore said her supervisor would act out in other ways, too, like sending scathing e-mails written in all capital letters. Eventually the situation became so stressful, Moore starting having anxiety and panic attacks. ""I had to lean on my family, friends and co-workers during this period of my career for support and guidance,"" she said. ""I would remind myself that I was good at what I did, and the negative situation was only temporary and I would find another job soon."" The public health professional used her connections to find a new job where she is much happier. ""I feel I am accomplishing more in this job because I am more relaxed and trust my supervisor,"" she said. ""I feel appreciated and I want to do a great job."" Whether you work at a large corporation or a small company, trust inevitably plays a role. Mickey Parsons, a master certified career coach based in Atlanta, says good leaders understand the power of honesty and trust. Employees want to know they can trust what their supervisors say and do, and relationships can fall apart when trust is lacking. ""Without trust, teams and work groups simply cannot sustain satisfactory productivity over time,"" said Parsons. So what should an employee do if he or she can't trust a supervisor? CNN.com asked Parsons and certified career coach Hallie Crawford of Atlanta for some advice. Parsons said you need to either find a way to understand and resolve the issues with your boss, or find a new job. Consider these tips, too: . 1) As an employee, make sure you aren't contributing to the problem. ""When bosses 'judge' that someone is not trustworthy they pull away, they do not offer them the best assignments or flexibility that they do others,"" said Parsons. ""The first step an employee who mistrusts his boss should do is to look inside and ask if they are giving their boss any reason to mistrust them or act in a certain way."" 2) People tend to trust competence -- make sure yours speaks for itself. Parsons said there's a saying that at work 20% of the staff do 80% of the work. He challenges workers to ask themselves which side people think they're on. ""If a supervisor doesn't see you as competent and hardworking, they may treat you as not trustworthy -- and what you experience in return causes you to mistrust them, too,"" said the career coach. 3) Keep a paper trail. Crawford said if you feel there is a problem, document what is happening so you have something to provide your human resources department should the time come. 4) Confront your boss. Consider confronting your supervisor if you think it's necessary and won't hurt your reputation or job -- or confront your boss if you are ready to leave anyway, said Crawford. ""I was in a position where I had a good enough relationship with my boss that if I felt I didn't trust her on something or something was unclear, I could ask her directly and knew she would give me an answer that would clear it up,"" Crawford said. Not everyone has this kind of relationship with their boss, however, so you want to tread lightly and not lose a job that you're not ready to leave, she said. 5) If your boss is violating company policy, consider approaching human resources. ""This depends on if it's worth it to you to go to HR and how extreme the violation is,"" said Crawford. You have to decide if this will jeopardize your job, and if so, decide if you can deal with those consequences, Crawford said.","Whether employed in a large corporation or a small company, trust inevitably plays a role .

"(CNN) -- The ex-wife of a Texas convict executed in 2004 for the deaths of his three children reaffirmed her belief in his guilt Wednesday as his relatives sought to open a new inquiry into the case. The family of Cameron Todd Willingham has asked a judge to posthumously clear his name, arguing that he was put to death based on ""junk science."" Though Willingham was executed in 2004 for killing his three daughters by setting fire to his house, subsequent investigations by outside experts have concluded that the fire that killed the girls should not have been ruled arson. Willingham's ex-wife, Stacy Kuykendall, has kept a low profile throughout the debate over his execution. But she told reporters outside the Travis County courthouse in Austin that ""I am here to make sure that my daughters' voices are heard."" ""Todd murdered Amber, Karmon and Kameron. He burnt them,"" she said. ""He admitted he burnt them to me, and he was convicted for his crime. That is the closest to justice that my daughters will ever get."" Kuykendall spoke before an Austin judge opened a hearing into the Willingham's family's request for an inquiry into the execution. But inside the courtroom, prosecutors from the town of Corsicana -- where the 1991 fire took place -- forced a delay in the proceedings by challenging the impartiality of District Judge Charlie Baird and asking him to recuse himself. Baird told lawyers he will issue a decision on that request next week, said Gerry Goldstein, a lawyer representing Willingham's stepmother, Eugenia Willingham, and cousin Patricia Cox. Goldstein pointed out that Kuykendall has told differing stories about whether her former husband ever admitted his guilt in the fatal fire, and criticized death-penalty supporters for ""parading her on the courthouse steps while they're inside trying to stop proceedings."" ""What possible harm could there be to their side to have this aired in court?"" he asked. Also representing the family is The Innocence Project, led by nationally known defense lawyer Barry Scheck. Lowell Thompson, the district attorney for Navarro County, which includes Corsicana, did not return a phone call seeking comment Wednesday. In asking Baird to open a ""court of inquiry"" into the execution, Willingham's family argues that he was put to death for a crime ""that modern science reveals may never have been committed."" State officials failed to act on evidence of ""significant deficiencies"" in the finding of arson at the heart of the case before the execution, and have ""continued to resist attempts to clear Mr. Willingham's name,"" their petition states. ""If we can get a hearing before him or any other fair judge, we're going to go ahead,"" Goldstein said. The Texas Forensic Science Commission is investigating claims that state fire marshals ruled the fatal blaze arson based on outdated or faulty science. The first of three reports to reach that conclusion was sent to Gov. Rick Perry's office and submitted to appeals courts before Willingham's execution, while two others were conducted after his death. ""Despite overwhelming scientific evidence, state officials have continued to demonize Mr. Willingham and defend the arson evidence on which he and others have been convicted,"" the family's petition states. The Forensic Science Commission was to hear from the author of the most recent of those reports in October 2009. But the panel's deliberations were put off after Perry -- who allowed the execution to go forward -- abruptly shook up the panel, spurring complaints from the Willingham family and allegations that Perry was trying to head off the potential admission that Texas had put an innocent man to death. In July, the commission found that arson investigators used flawed science but were not negligent and did not commit misconduct. A spokeswoman for the governor's office told CNN on Tuesday that Perry, who allowed the execution to go forward, remains convinced of Willingham's guilt. And Corsicana authorities have said that evidence beyond the testimony of state fire marshals supported Willingham's conviction.

"(CNN) -- Robin Thicke's new album ""Paula"" is inspired by his estranged wife Paula Patton, but he hasn't seen the woman herself in months. That's what the singer told New York radio station Hot 97 on Tuesday, assuring the station's morning show co-hosts that his breakup isn't just PR. ""I try to keep most of that private, but I haven't seen her for four months,"" Thicke said. ""I still had so much I wanted to apologize for and things I wanted to take responsibility for, that's pretty much what the album's about. ... The album is exactly what happens when you lose the love of your life and you're trying to figure it out in your head: 'How am I going to move on, get through it all?' "" The 37-year-old singer is the first to admit that he's unsure if he's going about that in the right way. ""I actually have no idea what I'm doing,"" he told ""Good Morning America"" Tuesday. ""I'm just kind of flying by the seat of my pants on this one. I just wanted to make something artistic out of a very difficult period."" Thicke and his actress wife have known each other and dated since they were teens, eventually tying the knot in 2005. Yet in February, the couple announced that they'd mutually decided to separate and co-parent their 4-year-old son, Julian Fuego. It seems Thicke has been obsessed ever since with wooing 38-year-old Patton, making public apologies, writing songs like ""Get Her Back,"" and filming an uncomfortably intimate music video that has become the gold standard of over-sharing. Some said the breakup was due to Thicke's rumored infidelity, and while the singer didn't divulge details on Tuesday, he did confess to being dishonest. ""I'm a man. I messed up, and I had to lie for awhile,"" Thicke told Hot 97. ""And then I stopped lying. And that was actually good for me, because I was tired of lying. So this whole album is me revealing everything."" But is Paula Patton listening? Doesn't sound like it. ""She hasn't heard ('Paula'),"" Thicke said of his estranged wife. ""She's only heard a few songs, and I don't think she wants to hear it right now. I can't speak for her, but space is an important part of any healing process."" #AskThicke backfires big time on Robin Thicke .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Marine Corps reservist Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi told CNN by phone Sunday that he was ""more hopeful"" and ""optimistic"" than ever that he would be released from a Mexican prison after a court hearing coming on Wednesday. More than three months after he was imprisoned for driving into Mexico with three firearms in his truck, Tahmooressi called CNN from the El Hongo Penitentiary in Tecate, Mexico, where he is being held. ""I'm not as down as I once was,"" he said. ""My relationship with the guards has turned more into a friendship, so I don't feel as alone, I guess. Once the media started covering it ... things did start changing. ... I'm just trying to keep my cool and stay relaxed."" Tahmooressi has maintained that he took a wrong turn on the California side of the border into Tijuana, Mexico, the night of March 31. He was detained by Mexican border officials for possessing a .45-caliber pistol, a 12-gauge pump shotgun and an AR-15 rifle. ""I'm not a guilty man, and you can probably hear it from my voice and the sincerity in my voice,"" he said. ""I'm innocent, and it was just a big mistake."" He says he replays in his head what happened the night he was arrested. Tahmooressi has denied crossing the border with the intent of trafficking arms. He said allegations against him that he could be involved with in gun trafficking or anything nefarious are ""silly."" ""I don't know what more there is to say, really,"" Tahmooressi said when asked what he would tell people who don't believe what he did was an accident. ""If you look at the facts, I mean ... I'm a smart man too, I'd like to think. I wouldn't go about trying to sell my guns to criminals. For one, I'm not a criminal. And I don't like any criminal activity. I especially don't like any cartel people."" ""I wouldn't have gone about selling my guns to get money. I would have sold my motorcycle. I would have sold my truck. Besides that I had plenty of money in my bank account that I had saved up from the Marine Corps. And I'm not a dumb man, to be selling my guns that have serial numbers registered to me."" The director of the Tijuana checkpoint told Mexican media last month that Mexican agents at the border gave Tahmooressi a chance to surrender his weapons and return to the United States without incident. Tahmooressi told CNN that's ""a lie."" ""That's not true at all. They never told me anything of that sort,"" he said. Tahmooressi said the Spanish translator provided to him at the border added to the confusion in communication. ""After I had got off the phone with 911 and I felt like there was no one there to help me, I even told them, I said, 'You can take my guns, take my truck and take all my possessions, just let me go back to America.' And they shook their head no in frustration."" Asked by CNN if he believes he should receive punishment for his mistake, Tahmooressi said no. ""I feel like the punishment was never necessary from the beginning. But once the (Mexican) military people got involved, they were like, 'Look what we found, we found these guns, good for us. Let's get this guy incriminated.' There was some good people at the border who were going to do the right thing, and that's how it should have been from the start."" As for what he needs most right now, Tahmooressi said, ""I just need the people to keep on praying for me. I think that should help. There's really nothing else besides that that I need,"" he said. ""My court date is on Wednesday. Once the judge gets to hear me out, I think it should go well. And I think it shouldn't be too much longer (that I will be in prison) after that, I hope.""

"(CNN) -- Until a few months ago, Denmark's Greenland North National Park was the world's largest nature reserve at 972,000 square kilometers -- bigger than all but 30 countries on Earth. There are now two spots that eclipse it. For a few short weeks, the French semi-autonomous territory of New Caledonia in the southwest Pacific held the top spot, having established the world's largest marine managed area in May. Covering 1.3 million square kilometers (502,000 square miles) -- the territory's entire economic zone -- the Natural Park of the Coral Sea protects the world's second longest double barrier reef and the world's largest marine lagoon, an underwater coliseum where the level of endemism (the number of species found nowhere else on earth) is off the charts. ""Because it lies in a temperate zone, the marine biodiversity of New Caledonia's reef is very peculiar,"" says Richard Farmer, director of the Aquarium Des Lagons in the capital Noumea. ""So we have an obligation to humanity to keep the reef pristine."" On June 17, the United States outdid New Caledonia when it declared an even bigger national park in the central South Pacific Ocean measuring 2 million square kilometers. But getting there is difficult. The U.S.-controlled islands lying between Hawaii and American Samoa that are incorporated into the new Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument are mostly uninhabited or off limits to all but a handful of scientists. New Caledonia's park, however, is open for business. Here are three novel ways to experience the world's largest ""accessible"" national park. On a surf board . On the east coast of the main island of Grande Terre, La Roche Percee beach is a long strip of sand edged by an extraordinary cliff formation that looks like a giant chess piece. It's the only known place in New Caledonia where one can surf off the shore. The waves are for beginners but the real action lies three kilometers out to sea, where the swell hits the outer reef to produce thick and hollow waves. Manu Hernu runs Nekweta (Respect for the Ocean), a small surfing and fishing camp set in the mangrove forest behind La Roche Percee. A typical day starts with breakfast at 6:30 a.m. followed by a half-hour motorboat ride to the outer reef. There, guests spend the next five hours surfing two different reef breaks, snorkeling or fishing for snapper to be baked back at the camp. ""We saw four- to five-foot (1.2-1.5 meter) waves, but it can get up to six to eight feet,"" says Nicolas Sarian, a surfer and recent visitor from Argentina. ""But the best things about it is nobody was there. Just Manu and me."" Nekweta Fish & Surf Camp (+687 784 026) offers seven-day surf camps and bungalow-style accommodation with communal meals from $1,386. Book via The Perfect Wave or World Safaris. On a yacht . Each June, a dozen or so monohulls and catamarans sail out of Noumea's Port Moselle to compete for glory at the Great Lagoon Regatta. The friendly three-day, 90-nautical-mile yacht race heads along the west coast of Grande Terre to Ouen Island for a night, then through the Woodin Canal and south to Ua Islet for a second night at sea before heading back to Noumea. This isn't an event filled with wind-burnt sailors who wake at the crack of dawn to swab the decks and raise the sails. The crews -- families and groups of friends from Noumea plus a few ring-ins from Sydney and Tokyo -- spend race nights at sea eating paella, drinking punch and dancing to '80s hits on the beach. They aren't early risers. For those who are, the late-morning starts present an opportunity to borrow a kayak or tender to explore the outer reef and its rich marine life. Or to walk around a tropical island all by themselves. ""In this small part of the lagoon you have at last 50 little islands,"" says Herve Moal, a super-yacht agent in Noumea who co-founded the regatta in 2011. ""Even on the weekend you can find a place to be alone."" The Great Lagoon Regatta (+687 795 601) is held on the first weekend of June. Entry is free for foreign boats. Dream Yacht Charters (+687 799 118) in Noumea rent 43-foot catamarans that sleep eight to 10 people for $900 a day. Add $275 per day for a skipper. Through a snorkel mask . Less than 20 kilometers from Noumea, Signal Island Marine Park is a campground straight out of ""The Blue Lagoon."" On weekends, rangers visit to leave chopped wood for people to enjoy campfires on the beach. Camping is free but most visitors sleep on yachts and motorboats moored around the island on floating buoys designed to protect the reef from anchor drag. More alien than the edge of space and more spectacular than an exploding supernova, the coral here is free of the bleaching and crown-of-thorns starfish infestation affecting reefs throughout other parts of the South Pacific. The rich coral creates habitat for an extraordinary number of marine species: leopard sharks, green turtles, dugongs, shoals of rare bump-headed parrot fish and yellow sea perch, poisonous but friendly banded sea snakes, clown fish, big sweetlip cod, huge toothy groupers, delicate feather starfish and the serene butterfly-shaped fish from ""Finding Nemo"" known as Moorish idol. ""It's incredible to have this quality of water and coral so close to the city,"" says Bernard Andreani, a diver who runs small group snorkeling tours to Signal Island. Bernard Andreani Snorkelling Treks (+687 779 072; bernard.andreani.nc@gmail.com) offers half-day snorkeling, walking and birdwatching boat tours to Signal Island Marine Park for $170 for two people. Bookings essential. Tours depart 8 a.m. from Noumea's Kuendu Beach. Getting there: Qantas and Aircalin offer codeshare flights to New Caledonia from Australia and New Zealand.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- A Syrian official said his country's forces might have thought the Turkish jet it downed last week was from Israel. ""As you know there is a country called Israel there and as you know this Zionism country's planes are very similar and because they both are from the same factory, from the U.S., maybe Syria thought it was an Israeli plane,"" Syrian Information Minister Omran Al Zubi told the Turkish A Haber channel on Wednesday. Israel and Syria are longtime neighboring adversaries and don't have diplomatic relations. Al Zubi adopted a friendly tone toward Turkey in the interview, which belied the increase in tough rhetoric in recent days over the downing of the jet. Relations between the two neighbors have deteriorated during the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime. The act drew sharp condemnation from NATO, and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday his country is changing its military rules of engagement and will now treat a military approach toward its borders by Syria as a potential threat that ""will be dealt with accordingly."" Both sides say the jet strayed into Syrian airspace, but Turkey says the incursion was accidental and quickly corrected. ""I underline that Syria did not launch an attack and I wish that the Turkish-Syria relations are at a better point. The current issue is that the Turkish plane entered Syrian space and it was responded as an unknown target. It was not downed because it was Turkey's plane,"" Al Zubi said. ""We never want to do any harm to the Turkish people and Turkey."" Both countries are searching for the jet's pilots. ""We have no information about the two pilots currently. Our wish is that they are alive and well,"" Al Zubi said. Erdogan, dressed in a bomber jacket for a photo op inside the cockpit of a Turkish military jet in Ankara, stressed that his country isn't an aggressor but will respond to it bluntly. ""I express this at every opportunity: we never have our eyes on any country's lands. We don't show a hostile attitude against any country. We never threaten the security of any country,"" Erdogan said, in remarks aired on CNN Turk. ""We never hesitate to respond in the harshest way and do what is necessary with all our existing power as well as with the power and inspiration that we get from our history, against hostile attitudes, attacks and threats against us."" NATO did not promise any action in response to the incident. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Turkey did not invoke the NATO article calling for collective defense of members. The NATO consultations were held under Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's founding charter. The article allows any member to call for consultations ""whenever, in the opinion of any of them, their territorial integrity, political independence or security is threatened,"" the charter says. Syria raised the stakes Monday in the war of words over the incident. Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said the plane was shot down in Syrian airspace, disputing Turkey's claim that it was downed over international waters after briefly straying into Syrian airspace by mistake. ""What happened was a violation of Syrian airspace. Even Turkey says Syrian sovereignty was violated. Regardless of whether it was a training mission, a reconnaissance mission, it was a violation,"" Makdissi said. He insisted that Syria was the wronged party, not Turkey. Also Monday, a spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry told CNN that Syria on Friday fired at a second Turkish plane that was part of a search-and-rescue mission sent in after the jet was shot down. The plane, which entered Syrian airspace in search of the jet, was not hit, said Selcuk Unal. ""There was no injury, nobody was harmed. But that plane immediately returned to Turkish airspace. And through military diplomatic channels we (asked) them: 'What's going on?'"" Unal said. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said Sunday that it considered the shooting to be a hostile act. Turkey delivered the message in a diplomatic note to the Syrian consulate in Istanbul, Unal told CNN. In addition to NATO, Turkey also submitted a letter about the incident to the U.N. Security Council. The country made no request for action, but outlined its version of events. ""This attack at the international airspace, causing possible loss of two Turkish pilots, is a hostile act by the Syrian authorities against Turkey's national security. Thus, we strongly condemn it,"" read the letter, dated Sunday. It identified the downed plane as a Turkish RF-4 reconnaissance aircraft, a version of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. It was flying alone, without arms, in international airspace when it was shot down, the letter read. Turkish search-and-rescue teams found the wreckage of the jet in the Mediterranean Sea on Sunday, about 1,300 meters (4,260 feet) underwater, Foreign Ministry spokesman Unal said.

"(CNN) -- A California judge on Monday denied Donald Sterling's request for a postponement of a probate court trial over the proposed $2 billion sale of the Los Angeles Clippers by the Sterling family trust. The trial is scheduled to start July 7 and last four days. Shelly Sterling agreed May 29 to sell the NBA franchise to billionaire Steve Ballmer for what would be an NBA record price. But Donald Sterling, the Clippers' other co-owner, doesn't want to sell the team he bought in 1981. He refused to sign on to terms of the deal. The trial will focus on Shelly Sterling's right to sell the Clippers and not Donald Sterling's mental capacity, lawyers for each side said Monday. At issue will be whether the procedures for removing one of the trust's owners were followed. Shelly Sterling hired a neurologist and a specialist in geriatric psychiatry who separately examined her husband and judged him to be mentally incapacitated. Donald Sterling's attorney Bobby Samini maintains that the mental examinations he was given were under ""undue influence"" and ""there was fraud"" on Shelly Sterling's behalf. Donald Sterling, 80, has been embroiled in controversy since a recording of a conversation with his friend V. Stiviano was posted online in late April. The recording included a series of racist comments. Sterling's comments, first posted on TMZ, sparked outrage among NBA players, executives and fans. NBA commissioner Adam Silver fined Sterling $2.5 million and banned him for life from the NBA. The NBA's board of governors, representatives from each of the 30 ownership groups, is scheduled to meet July 15 and could approve a sale then if the legal aspects of the deal are sorted out. In order for the team to be sold, either Donald Sterling would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team.

"Editor's note: This is an excerpt from Jane Velez-Mitchell's new book ""iWant"" published by HCI Books. Velez-Mitchell anchors ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" on HLN nightly at 7 p.m. ET. Jane Velez-Mitchell writes about her journey from addiction and overconsumption to a simpler, honest life. This is the story of my ch . . . ch . . . changes, which took me from insanity to clarity, from egocentricity to altruism, from alcoholism to activism. These changes have marked an evolution in what I want from this life. I am what I want. What I seek to consume, possess, and achieve is a mirror that reflects my lusts and cravings, values and priorities, and moral boundaries or lack thereof. I am happy to say that what I want today is much less toxic and self-centered than what I used to want. It's taken decades of self-examination to peel back the layers and figure out what really makes me happy. And while I'm still searching for my ultimate bliss, I know for sure it's not what I once thought it was. It's not alcohol, cigarettes, money, food, sugar, or status symbols: I've consumed all of those in massive quantities, and they've just made me miserable. Now, I want what can't be tasted, smoked, worn, seen, or counted. It's the opposite of material. As sappy as it might sound, what I want is spiritual.  Watch Jane talk about her new book » . The shift from material to spiritual is a particular challenge in our culture. We have allowed ourselves to be defined by our consumption, instead of by our ability to move beyond it. To keep consumers consuming, the corporate culture has brainwashed us into thinking we can change ourselves by changing what we buy, which pills we pop, what type of booze we swill, what gated community we join, what kind of golf clubs we swing, and what kind of cancer sticks we dangle between our lips. We've been told that certain consumer choices say a lot about us, that they reveal our character. If we've stepped up to a more prestigious brand, we've changed for the better. Nonsense! We cannot consume our way into personal growth. Yet, millions of us have bought into this cynical concept of faux identity. If you keep buying the ""latest and the greatest"" but feel like you're stuck in the same place, you're just changing labels, and that's not changing. That's rearranging. Real change occurs on the emotional, psychological, and spiritual levels, not in a shopping mall, a car dealership, online, at the drugstore, at the liquor store, or at the fast-food joint. For too long, we have allowed ourselves to be manipulated by forces whose sole purpose is PROFIT and POWER. We have given advertisers leave to claim that inanimate objects have spiritual qualities. One ad, in perhaps the world's most prestigious newspaper, urges us to buy an expensive diamond by insisting that such a purchase will feed the soul, lift the spirit, and increase our resolve to achieve whatever we wish. Really? How exactly does a diamond feed the soul? It's absurd! This is false advertising. Today, as a culture, we are awash in false advertising. As a society, we've lent legitimacy to these patent lies by literally buying into them. As a result of this unnecessary, self-indulgent consumption, we've gone a long way toward destroying our natural environment with our waste. Perhaps most important, by obsessing about material things, we've cheated ourselves out of the most fundamental aspect of the human experience: real experiences that result in real growth. Unlike diamonds, meaningful experiences can actually feed the soul, resulting in self-development and self-knowledge. Authentic change has allowed me to gradually learn why I'm here experiencing this existence as well as what I am destined to contribute during my lifetime. For me, meaningful change has been about getting sober, becoming honest, and adopting a new attitude. Sobriety has allowed me to shift the criteria I use for all the decisions I make from an ego-based formula of what's in it for me to a more evolved formula based on compassion for other people, other living creatures, and our environment. It's an ongoing struggle, and there are many times when I fail. But I keep trying. This book is my story of how I've progressed from self-obsession to a life that I hope will count. In the tradition of the Twelve Steps created by Alcoholics Anonymous, I'm going to lay out what it was like, what happened to change me, and what it's like now. For thirty years as a television news reporter, I've been recounting other people's mostly sordid stories. Frankly, the prospect of airing my own dirty laundry scares the wits out of me. The very thought of this sparks a flood of memories, primarily featuring the many stupid and embarrassing things I've done over the years, especially before I got sober. My face burns at the prospect of sharing some of these memories with you. I know we're all only as sick as our secrets. By pouring out the intimate details of my personal history, I am trying to get healthier through honesty. Still, I can't help but wonder if you really have to know every single one of my secrets. Is that what is meant by ­rigorous honesty? These thoughts swirl through my mind as I ­huddle under my covers unable to sleep... ...There's so much to tell. But would you want to know everything about my personal struggles? You may simply be reading this book because you're interested in my life, and for that I thank you. But if you identify with my story, then we will both learn from my experience. That is the essence of all recovery programs. Many of the battles I'm fighting, the compulsions I'm struggling to conquer, are the same as those experienced by many of my friends, relatives, co­workers, and neighbors. Some struggle with overeating, with alcohol or drugs, with workaholism, with codependency, with compulsive spending, with gambling, with sex addiction, or with facing the truth about themselves -- whatever that truth may be. And virtually everyone I know, including myself, suffers from generic overconsumption -- a chronic craving for more of everything that is poisoning our lives, not to mention our oceans, skies, and forests. My friend once called himself a tornado of consumption. That description fits most Americans. Sadly, we're a nation of addicts. For a multitude of reasons -- our health, our finances, and our environment, among them -- we need to take immediate action to reduce our collective consumption levels. Unfortunately, addicts don't respond to reason or rationality. Just as you can't reason with a drunk who is on a binge, we are not going to lecture our way out of America's consumption mess. Fortunately, there are proven recovery methods out there that can help us get a handle on our addictive consumption. I've used them to deal with my plethora of addictions, and I will share these techniques with you while I tell you my story. From IWANT by Jane Velez-Mitchell. Available wherever books are sold.

"(CNN) -- ""Obvious Child"" has all the story arcs for romantic-comedy gold, including a newly brokenhearted protagonist trying to find her way in life and love, an unlikely meet-cute of opposite personalities and an advisory panel of cheeky best friends. But one of the film's major through lines is a topic not often broached in theaters: abortion. The film, which premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival and will open nationwide on Friday, has been called ""the most winning abortion-themed rom-com ever"" by The Dissolve, and in a piece called ""No more Shmashmortion"" on Slate.com, writer Amanda Hess deemed it ""the most honest abortion movie I've ever seen."" Though the movie successfully mines the traditional rom-com tropes for laughs, groans and ""awwwws,"" abortion is emerging as its unlikely claim to fame. ""We don't feel like that description does it justice,"" producer Elisabeth Holm told CNN. ""It's as much about a stand-up comedian and her life in New York. (An abortion) happens, but it doesn't have to define her."" When Holm spoke with CNN, she acknowledged the filmmakers were ""trying to humanize the experience,"" even including a scene during the main character's abortion procedure. But they ""never set out to make an agenda-driven film,"" Holm said. Gillian Robespierre wrote and directed ""Obvious Child""; actress Jenny Slate stars as Donna Stern, the bathroom-humor-prone comedian who chooses to undergo an in-clinic procedure after a booze-fueled, one-night stand with Vermont-bred prepster Max, played by Jake Lacy. Abortion has long been a hot topic in pop culture, from ""Maude"" in 1972 to HBO's ""Girls"" in recent years. The release of ""Obvious Child"" comes shortly after a woman faced criticism for filming and releasing footage of her own abortion in order to show that it wasn't the traumatic experience for her that many assume it to be. In 2010, the CDC reported 765,651 legal induced abortions, with women in their 20s -- like Slate's character -- contributing to the majority of that number. The debate in movies, TV and viral clips is a reflection of real life: According to a recent CNN/ORC International survey of Americans, 27% of respondents said abortion should be legal in all circumstances, 13% said it should be legal in most circumstances, 38% said it should be legal in a few circumstances, and 20% said it should always be illegal. Holm says as a born-and-raised New Yorker, both she and director Robespierre came from a world where conversations about abortion happened ""in a shame-free, regret-free, clear way"" with mothers, friends and sisters -- and that was the experience that they wanted to show on-screen. In ""Obvious Child,"" several characters along the way reveal they had abortions (some legal, some not) in their teens and 20s. As with any romantic comedy, the two leads, Max and Donna, maintain a ""will they/won't they"" vibe throughout most of the film -- and that's intentional, Holm says. But Donna's decision to terminate her pregnancy isn't wishy-washy, or even driving the plot. It's the result of a drunken one-night stand that ends without exchanging phone numbers. She's lost her job, and is trying to get a comedy career on track -- from Donna's perspective, the choice is clear. ""It's very decisive,"" Holm says. In a scene filmed in an actual Planned Parenthood, Donna says, ""I'd like an abortion, please,"" then apologizes about sounding like a fast-food customer before repeating her request. Holm says it was crucial to illustrate the actual abortion process: A camera focuses on Donna's face as the sedative kicks in and vacuuming sounds hum in the background. ""I think we've seen a lot of movies where they fade off into the sunset before that action happens,"" she says. ""It was critical to show this moment where it's safe and healthy and also vulnerable."" ""This is an experience that many women go through without shame and regret, but not without emotion. Hopefully it's something that people can connect to and have a conversation about. Whatever side you're on."" Framing the ever-contentious issue in a romantic comedy has captivated audiences. ""It shouldn't be a particularly earth-shaking turn, but in a world of rom-coms like 'Knocked Up' and 'Juno,' in which the heroines make the heartwarming decision to go ahead with their pregnancies, this modest little indie movie feels momentous,"" NPR film critic David Edelstein said of the film. Meanwhile, a piece at the Daily Caller asked, ""Has Hollywood hit a new low?"" Its gist: ""The film seems to be another Hollywood attempt to reinforce their idea of female empowerment. In this case, it includes one night stands and abortions."" Robespierre told nonprofit news organization Mother Jones: ""Whatever other conversation occurs, we're really excited. ... (Conservatives bashing ""Obvious Child"") haven't seen the movie; they're basing it on articles and trailers."" Still, just as with any summer romantic comedy, the filmmakers hope the takeaway for viewers is sweet, sincere and relatable. ""Hopefully, the movie is one that makes people feel confident in who they are and the choices that they make,"" Holm says. ""And sometimes with confidence comes vulnerability -- and that's a very human experience."" Do you think abortion is a fitting topic to include in a romantic comedy?

"(CNN) -- Marco Rubio crossed his party again on immigration. The potential 2016 presidential contender from Florida was one of 11 Republican senators joining most Democrats to support a procedural vote this week on legislation aimed at stemming the tide of immigrant children crossing the southern border. The vote for the $2.7 billion Democratic bill aimed at meeting needs of the immigrant families in the surge and kids who arrived on their own, simply allowed lawmakers to begin debate on the measure. But it's significant as the Democrats needed the lofty threshold of 60 votes to move on to the border package that is in line with their priorities and basically those of the White House although it would spend $1 billion less than what President Barack Obama wants. Most in Rubio's caucus opposed, including fellow potential White House hopefuls Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas. And it all took place as House leaders reworked their version in an uncertain bid to attract conservative support to address the situation most consider a humanitarian crisis. The Rubio vote carries unique significance for him, regardless of the proposal's outcome. That's because his aspirations for higher office took a big hit in the Republican Party over his central role in drafting and then voting for comprehensive immigration reform last summer. He later moved away from the legislation, but it was too late, politically. Vocal and influential conservatives panned the measure over their claims it would not secure the southern border and would only create amnesty for some 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country. The legislation stalled in the GOP-led House, as did Rubio's standing with the right wing of the party. Conservative views are paramount in the presidential nominating contest, and they simply didn't like what the son of Cuban immigrants had done. Senate votes to start debate on emergency border bill . So after all that, and a lot of effort since to rebuild his standing with conservatives, why did he cast his lot with Democrats on an immigration vote again? ""I voted to move to the Senate border bill so that we would have the opportunity to vote on and pass amendments that would achieve real reforms,"" Rubio wrote in a statement. He also said he would not support a final bill unless the Democratic-led chamber did two things that Republicans want: Change a 2008 law to make it easier to deport young migrants from Central America as a deterrent and toss parts of an Obama administration program that eases deportation of other immigrants in the United States illegally. Most Democrats don't want either change, but Republicans blame the influx of young immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras on what they contend are flawed immigration policies. The message, they say intended or not, is that it's easier to immigrate. This is the first time in the border crisis debate that Rubio has inserted himself in a significant way. While he has given numerous interviews about the nearly 60,000 minors -- many of them unaccompanied -- who have crossed the border in the past 10 months, he has not been instrumental in crafting emergency legislation in Congress to address it. Rubio's vote on Wednesday certainly carries some risk, judging by conservative responses to more Republican-friendly legislation in the House. Erick Erickson, editor of the conservative blog RedState, wrote Thursday that the slimmed down, $659 million House proposal is actually ""inexcusable."" His problem with it is that it gives money to Obama to disperse to border and other immigration programs without imposing the changes to immigration policy Republicans want immediately. Cruz convinces House to alter border bill . While Rubio's willingness to move forward could be unpopular among conservatives, enough lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers are concerned about leaving town Friday for the month of August without doing anything about the border crisis. House members and senators will be spend the rest of the summer amid constituents back home where polls show immigration overall is especially on the minds of voters. In a recent CNN/ORC survey, 39% say it's extremely important for Obama and Congress to deal with illegal immigration in general, up 10 points from last year. ""That means that immigration is the only issue tested that has grown significantly more important to the public in the past year,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. House GOP seeks cover with slimmer border bill . CNN's Ted Barrett, Deirdre Walsh and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Sen.

"(CNN) -- Once described as ""sterile,"" the birth city of the iconic Singapore Sling is experiencing a cocktail renaissance. Since 2012, the city has seen a rush of cocktail bar openings, and the boom isn't showing signs of slowing. In 2013, UK-based liquor-producing giant Diageo reported a 58% spike in spirits sales in Singapore over the previous financial year. ""Singapore's cocktail scene has grown tremendously in the past few years,"" says Colin Chia, Asia Pacific manager of Diageo Reserve World Class, which hosted the World Class South East Asia Finals in Singapore in May to showcase top bartending talents in the region. ""The scene has moved toward the opening of independent bars with talents concentrating on craft cocktails and introducing the consumer to new techniques, ingredients and spirits, while still keeping true to the classics. ""They have collectively invested time and energy in putting Singapore on the global cocktail map."" In the last year alone, some 20 new bars have sprouted across Singapore. Tron Young, who founded the inaugural Singapore Bar Industry Accord to recognize the industry's future luminaries, says the city-state is at the forefront of Asia's cocktail and bar scene. ""Other Asian cities like Tokyo may have a longer reign at the top, but Singapore is taking the lead in pushing boundaries and drinking ideals, researching trends as well as exploring techniques,"" says Young, a former bartender at Singapore hotspot Tetsuya's and ex-bar manager of Waku Ghin. ""One of the ways to gauge the progress of the beverage industry in a country is to look at the range of products available -- a bigger range and variety is generally driven by the volume of demand."" More suppliers are indeed joining the spirits distribution game in Singapore, brandishing an alluring arsenal of artisan spirits by independent distilleries. La Maison du Whiskey joined the fray in 2009; followed by Proof & Company Spirits (stablemate of the acclaimed 28 HongKong Street) in 2012; with Liberty Spirits Asia coming on board most recently. ""As consumer demand for artfully prepared cocktails has grown, the spirits industry has responded and is now going through its own renaissance,"" says Spencer Forhart of Proof & Company Spirits. Where cocktails are as important as food . According to Forhart, Singapore has a strong community of professionals treating bartending as a proper vocation and pushing each other to achieve. ""The result -- even restaurants and hotels are taking their cocktails and spirits seriously,"" he says. The seeds of all this growth were sown in 2008, when the trendsetting Tippling Club introduced its cocktail-paired tasting menu, a first in Singapore. Today, Tippling Club has been joined by a host of restaurant-bars where cocktails are treated with as much reverence as food -- Bacchanalia, Catalunya, Sugarhall and Tess Kitchen Bar are examples. ""One of the best ways to judge the F&B trends in a city is also to see what the hotels are doing,"" says Young. ""Recently Anti:dote at Fairmont Hotel and Manhattan Bar at Regent Singapore hotel opened while Four Seasons hired one of the greatest bartenders in history -- Javier de lad Muelas -- to consult on its beverage and cocktail list at One Ninety bar."" In addition to adding a touch of glitz to the city's bibulous culture, hotel bars such as Anti:dote and Manhattan Bar have brought in talented craftsmen -- Tom Hogan and Ricky Paiva, respectively -- who are rapidly shaking up the craft cocktail movement started by stalwarts such as Aki Eguchi, bar manager of Jigger & Pony. Today, Eguchi, a 2011 and 2012 Diageo Reserve World Class Singapore champion, has about 30 types of homemade infusions and syrups in stock at any one time. ""Singapore is enjoying a cocktail boom that New York and London experienced over the last 15 years,"" concludes Forhart. ""It started a bit later than those cities, but it's really developing at a much faster pace."" Thirsty yet? Here's a roundup of Singapore's best new cocktail bars. Anti:dote . Fairmont's latest F&B addition showcases inventive cocktails and a raft of tonics concocted by head craftsman, American-born Tom Hogan. He uses freshly plucked herbs from the hotel's garden and personally makes a clutch of bitters and liquors, like spiced orange bitters fortified with Cognac. Hogan cocktails such as Corpse Reviver #2 (made with gin, Absinthe and house-made orange liqueur) are best paired with the tapas by Spanish chef, Carlos Montobbio. Anti:dote, Level 1 Fairmont Singapore, 80 Bras Basah Road; +65 (0)6 431 5313 . Manhattan Bar . Former Rickhouse barman, Ricky Paiva, puts the spotlight on craft cocktails at the artful grand hotel bar at the Regent Singapore hotel, which features a menu of 25 seasonally rotating cocktails inspired by the neighborhoods of Manhattan. In addition to showcasing the world's first in-hotel ""rickhouse,"" where the Sacramento native finishes whiskeys, ages cocktails and brews bitters, the bar offers cocktails mixed table-side via a trolley. Manhattan Bar, Level 2 Regent Singapore, 1 Cuscaden Road; +65 (0)6 725 3377 . The Library . This secret bar tucked behind the recently re-branded The Study isn't spanking new but it's worth the schlep for the new-to-Singapore barman, Nicholas Quattroville. An Australian formerly of The Blind Pig (London), he prepares most of his cocktail ingredients in-house -- horseradish-infused vodka, walnut orgeat and burnt butter whiskey are favorites.

"(CNN) -- Officials in central and southern Texas are worried about how much more rain will flow into streams and rivers after huge downpours on Sunday. More than five inches of rain fell Sunday in Austin, and the National Weather Service reported 12 inches of rain in some spots. The downpour forced organizers to cancel performances at the Austin City Limits music festival. A flash flood watch was in effect overnight in much of central and west Texas, and forecasters predicted an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain Monday. Only minor flooding was reported Sunday, but additional rain will flow rapidly over saturated ground and add to waterways still swelling from Sunday's runoff. ""My main concern is the weather of the next 72 hours, especially Tuesday night,"" said Michael C. Fisher, emergency management coordinator in Bastrop County, east of Austin. ""We'll be at or just above flood stage on the Colorado River."" Heavy rain could bring flash floods, and ""people still have the tendency to drive into high water,"" he said. On the upside, the rain ""may have broken a two-year drought on the Colorado,"" Fisher said. In and around Austin, some creeks overflowed and nearly two dozen low-water crossings were closed, CNN affiliate KVUE-TV reported. Police cruisers blocked traffic, and workers put up steel barricades. Austin police rescued some people from vehicles stuck in water, but no injuries were reported, city spokeswoman Candice Cooper said. A weather service statement said ""a conveyor belt of moisture"" from the Pacific Ocean was hitting moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to cause the heavy rain. It said the flash flood watch might need to be extended later Monday. Cyclone leaves trail of destruction . Knee-deep water in Louisville .

"Gaza (CNN) -- One moment there are rocket attacks and claims Israel fired at Palestinian fishermen. The next there's the head of a Palestinian negotiating team detailing a five-day extension of a cease-fire in and around Gaza. Then -- after yet more rockets hit Israel -- there are Israeli airstrikes. So what gives? Is Israel's military action a blip or does it signal a full-scale resumption of the offensive that left nearly 2,000 in Gaza dead, most of them civilians? Will Israelis once again find themselves seeking shelter as rocket after rocket rain from overhead? And do the peace talks, and the just announced cease-fire, have any chance? None of these questions could be easily answered early Thursday. One of the lone things that was patently clear is that -- as with most anything to deal with this region and these longtime foes -- the situation is both very complicated and very fragile. Palestinian officials offered hope of positive movement late Wednesday, when lead negotiator Azzam al-Ahmed said the 72-hour cease-fire put in place earlier this week should last another five days, from midnight (5 p.m. ET Wednesday). The idea, senior Hamas member Izzat Risheq explained to CNN, was to give the parties ""more time to reach an agreement on the issues."" ""There remains a positive atmosphere towards reaching a comprehensive agreement,"" al-Ahmed told reporters. ""But there are still sticking points."" There's also still violence. About the time al-Ahmed spoke, the Israeli military claimed that at least eight rockets were fired toward its territory from Gaza. By Thursday morning, Israel still hadn't officially commented on whether it would go along with any cease-fire extension. But its military did respond to the new rocket attacks, by ""targeting terror sites across"" Gaza, according to Israel Defense Forces spokesman Peter Lerner. CNN crew in Gaza heard multiple explosions overnight. ""#IDF alert & prepared with defensive & striking capabilities to address renewed #Gaza aggression & threat to #Israel,"" Lerner tweeted. Israel wants security; Gazans want more freedom . The fact there was 70 hours of relative peace earlier this week and the Palestinians, at least, believed the truce would be extended into next week is a good sign. Other cease-fires failed more quickly and more miserably. Even the scale of attacks overnight Wednesday was far less than what happened earlier this summer. The two sides have been talking in Cairo through go-betweens. One core issue is difficult to quickly overcome. Israel, as well as the United States and European Union, labels Hamas -- the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza -- a terrorist organization; Hamas rejects Israel's right to exist. Israel says it wants Hamas to disarm and Gaza to be demilitarized. The Palestinian delegation in Egypt, which includes Hamas, demanded an end to Israel's economic blockade on Gaza, an extension of fishing rights off the coast, the reopening of an airport and seaport, and the release of prisoners held by Israelis. Al-Ahmed, head of the Palestinian team, said late Wednesday that there's still no agreement on the opening of crossings into Israel, ""the launching of a free fishing zone"" and various ""security issues."" The stakes are high for the residents of Gaza, where 1,962 people have been killed in the fighting, according to the United Nations. Around 72% of the dead are estimated to be civilians. Stakes are also high for Israelis, who have been living in fear of rockets fired from Gaza and the militant attacks carried out through tunnels dug under the border. Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted many of the roughly 3,500 rockets the Israeli military says have been launched from Gaza. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to send ground troops into Gaza during the conflict to destroy Hamas' network of tunnels, resulting in intensified fighting. Israeli officials say 64 of its soldiers have been killed, as well as three civilians in Israel. The Israel Defense Forces pulled its soldiers out of Gaza last week after they had demolished around 32 tunnels, but they remain positioned around the Palestinian territory. Israel and its neighbors: Decades of war . Warning shots for Palestinian fishermen . Even if a cease-fire ends up sticking, it shouldn't be confused with widespread agreement. Take, for example, claims on their websites by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad that Israel violated the 72-hour cease-fire -- which had been set to expire at midnight -- by firing on Palestinian fishermen. Nizar Ayesh, head of the Gaza fishermen's union, told CNN that Israel's navy fired into the air Wednesday morning at about 35 fishermen. There were no injuries reported, ""but the fishermen had to go out to sea because they are poor and want to make some money and bring food to their families,"" Ayesh said. The Israeli military confirmed that it fired ""warning shots"" after ""a Palestinian boat"" went into part of the Mediterranean Sea that Israel considers ""a closed military area."" Then there was the renewed rocket attack from ""Gaza terrorists"" that struck in the Hof Ashkelon area of southern Israel on Wednesday night, according to an Israeli military spokesman. There were no initial reports of injuries or damage. Hamas -- in a text message from spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri -- denied that it had anything to do with any rockets fired toward Israel. Israel didn't appear overly alarmed. ""Just one rocket is probably something we can move on from,"" an Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity shortly before Palestinian officials announced a cease-fire deal. But a slew of new rockets toward Israel, right around when the original cease-fire was to expire, may have changed the equation -- for both sides. Aid flows into Gaza during lull in violence . Whether or not it lasts, this week's lull in violence did allow Gaza residents to try to tackle some of the most urgent problems they face, including a lack of drinking water and leaking sewage pipes. Aid groups said the situation remains dire, with more than 300,000 people estimated to have been displaced by the fighting in the small, densely populated enclave. The thousands of people wounded in the conflict have put a severe strain on medical resources. During the cease-fire, people have attempted to stock up on badly needed supplies, which have been allowed in through reopened border crossings. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had brought in trucks of water, hundreds of mattresses, surgical equipment, food and household items like diapers. Among the many families sheltering in U.N. schools, some are unable to return to their homes because they were destroyed, and others have been going back just for the day and returning to shelters at night. Some people feel it is too risky to leave shelters altogether, because so many of the previous cease-fires have failed. Residents have also taken advantage of the calm to go out into the streets and visit beaches, parks and markets. But dangers left by the conflict remain. Despite the cease-fire, at least five people died and six were injured Wednesday when an Israeli rocket exploded as Gaza police bomb disposal technicians were working on it. Among the dead were an Italian video journalist for The Associated Press and a Palestinian freelance translator working with him. The AP identified the journalist as Simone Camilli, who had worked for the news service since 2005. Meher El Halapi, chief of the police station in Shekh Zayed city, told CNN the explosion was the result of an accident during efforts to disarm the missile, which he said then exploded and set off another explosive nearby.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- In our constant battle of the bulge, a new weapon is gaining in popularity. Mineral body wraps are supposed to help you lose weight, but doctors are skeptical. The basic concept is simple: loss by bondage, or body wraps. Around for decades, body wraps were first made popular by Hollywood stars but have since become available to lesser-known mortals. These wraps come in a host of styles; from minerals to mud, from moving to motionless. Their aim: better bodies. Their claim: less of you when you're done. ""We do mineral body wraps that take off inches and we guarantee people will lose 6 to 20 inches on the first wrap or the next one is free,"" says Julie Tracey, co-owner of Atlanta's Suddenly Slimmer salon. But Dr. Erica Brownfield, associate professor of medicine at Emory, is skeptical, at best. ""These results are going to be temporary and there is no scientific data to support what they're claiming is actually going on,"" she said. In the land of wraps, measurements are key. You wear very little clothing for the body wrap -- a small top matched with a small bottom. These are preferably made from breathable fabric without buttons or zippers, which could get in the way and cause chafing or pinching. The next step is all about the numbers. The wrapper puts measuring tape around various parts of your body and draws marks in black -- sort of ""slash marks the spot."" Typically, between a dozen and 20 spots are measured. And it's the sum total of these spots that will tell you how many inches you've lost when the treatment is over. Most providers will guarantee some inches lost from your first wrap but say you need a series of visits if you want to reduce by as much as, say, a clothing size, Tracey says.  Health for Her: What's it like to get a wrap? » . And priced at $50 to $100, a treatment like this is not a  cheap quick fix. But how do they work? The treatment ""draws out metabolic waste and impurities from the body that lets water flow through better,"" Tracey says. ""Retained water dilutes the metabolic waste and those go between the fat cells and spread things apart."" ""With the compression of the bandages, because you are wrapped up real tight, we push those fat cells back together and that is what changes the shape."" Aside from inches gone, body wraps claim to help with issues such as cellulite, skin tone and body shaping. Tracey, whose company has done almost 8,000 wraps, says the treatments also help with stretch marks, wrinkles and lines. But Brownfield and others in the medical field aren't quite buying it. ""Their claims say they are squeezing the fat cells closer together,"" Brownfield says,"" but I think it's very important for people to realize that they're not losing fat cells."" ""Those fat cells, once you decompress them and take those wraps off, they're going to go back to their usual shape and size."" Brownfield is also concerned that, in some cases, these wraps could be a health hazard. ""Actually, depending on which wrap you use they can be harmful, they can dehydrate the body,"" she says, which can be dangerous for some people. She also cautions people to make sure they know what type of minerals and solutions are being used in the procedure. Allergic reactions are one concern, but also any type of open wound, contagious disease or rash might make a body wrap a bad idea. And finally, if you have any medical concerns, talk to a doctor before deciding if wrapping up is your best bet for shaping up.","Salons claim body wraps, which are gaining popularity, help you lose inches .

"(CNN) -- As many as 500 children and adults are being safely evacuated Monday after torrential rain and mudslides trapped them at a Southern California church camp, a spokesman for the San Bernardino County Fire Department told CNN. The Forest Home camp had been trapped behind a mudflow in Forest Falls -- some 80 miles east of Los Angeles -- stranding staff and middle and high school students. ""We've been able to punch through that last wall of mud so that people on the other side can start making their way out of town,"" fire department spokesman Ryan Beckers said. Sudden rainfall Sunday had rendered most roads ""impassable due to mudflows"" in Forest Falls, San Bernardino Fire Capt. Kyle Hauducoeur said earlier. Thousands were stranded. Even a local fire station had to be evacuated. So far, there have been no reports of injuries or missing residents in Forest Falls, population 2,000. Hauducoeur said the damage to homes due to flooding has not been severe. But elsewhere in San Bernardino County, one person was found dead inside a vehicle that was swept off the road and into a creek by floodwater, county fire department spokesman Chris Prater said. And 1,500 people in the nearby community of Glen Oak were stranded due to flash flooding, said Dennis Mathisen of Cal Fire. The downpour combined with the terrain made conditions especially daunting. ""Try to imagine the bands of rains from a hurricane -- that's what we're getting,"" Hauducoeur said. ""The difference (is) it's hitting mountains. What was a dry riverbed could become a river 6 feet deep, 20 feet wide."" He said some roads are now covered with 6 to 8 feet of rock, and ""we have a lot of mud to deal with."" Officials are asking residents to stay inside their homes and to call 911 if they need to be rescued. Hauducoeur said two swift-water rescue crews are in the area. Hauducoeur said firefighters expect to be working the Forest Falls area for the next three to four days. But with ongoing wildfires in Northern California, resources will already be stretched thin. The deluge in San Bernadino County came during one of the worst droughts in California history. Much the state is grappling with ""exceptional drought,"" according to U.S. Drought Monitor. San Bernardino County has been dealing with ""severe"" or ""extreme"" drought. Last month, California officials enacted statewide water restrictions involving lawn watering, car washing and ornamental fountains. The dearth has been so bad that some thieves have resorted to stealing water. West's drought leads to rising prices, shrinking lakes . Substantial damage at UCLA after water pipe break .

"(CNN) -- I stood up and began talking on the floor of the Texas State Senate not long ago because I hoped the Republicans in power would listen to how their latest cruel health care proposal would hurt the women of Texas. Simply put, this bill would take away access to the most fundamental form of health care women need. It would close down almost 90% of the women's clinics in this state. This comes after more than 50 women's health clinics providing cancer screening and family planning services were closed because the Republicans withdrew state-financed support from them. We now have 42. Under this draconian proposal, a state as expansive as Texas would have only five clinics remaining to serve thousands and thousands of women. Real Texans don't want any woman to die of cancer because she can't get decent health care or medical advice. Real Texans don't want any woman to lose control of her life because she can't get birth control. During the filibuster, women around the state related thousands of personal stories to me: One young woman said contraceptives gave her a chance to choose motherhood when she was ready. Women were helped by a clinic with the difficult and highly personal decision to end a pregnancy. Another woman said a clinic had helped comfort her when a much-wanted baby was dying inside her. The ""people's filibuster"" that put a temporary stop on the misguided bill that powerful Republicans are still intent on ramming through will long be remembered as the moment when regular Texans -- real Texans -- stood up and said ""enough"" to the self-interested politicians who have run our state for too long. Enough to using Texas as a political laboratory for testing far-right ideas. Enough to using Texas as a workshop for fattening the wallets of their special interest friends and supporters. And enough of politicians listening only to each other, rather than real Texans. There are important issues that desperately need the attention of the politicians who are -- at least for now -- in charge of our state. Sadly, Gov. Rick Perry and his powerful allies don't seem interested. They don't identify with the strong Texans who live in the town of West, where an unregulated, unmonitored fertilizer plant blew up, taking lives and destroying livelihoods. Because of a lack of state oversight, the small volunteer fire department that rushed to help didn't know the degree of danger they were facing. They paid with their lives. Real Texans believe in looking out for each other. We believe in honoring our mothers and fathers and keeping our smallest residents -- our children -- healthy. The politicians in charge of Texas now clearly don't. Perry has refused to even consider expanding health care coverage in Texas because he cares more about scoring political points than he does about our Texas families. Real Texans help when their neighbor is in need. Texas Republican political leaders take perverse pride in how deeply they have cut our state's education budget. Thousands of teachers have been pulled from classrooms, schools have closed and valuable programs have been canceled. In many places, districts are forced to choose between prekindergarten programs and English, algebra and art. Real Texans want their kids to have the best education possible, not the one politicians looking to brag about budget cuts have left us with. My first filibuster, two years ago, was an attempt to protect our schools and our children from these reckless cuts. Republican leaders rewarded me for my efforts by removing me from the powerful Senate Education Committee. I had to fight unfair Republican redistricting efforts when they tried to make the district I represent disappear. Now, Texas Democratic legislators are fighting hard to pass an equal pay for equal work bill, something that is crucial to the many families that rely on income from dad and mom. But then real Texans have never been afraid of a good fight. That's what happened at our State Capitol during the filibuster, when real Texans -- ultimately --decided to make their voices heard. I have a question for Perry and the state's powerful politicians who have ignored real Texans for so long: . Can you hear us now? And, more important, are you listening? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Wendy Davis.","Wendy Davis says her filibuster was to get Republicans to listen to women of Texas .

"(CNN) -- An upstate New York student said he got a three-day suspension for creating a controversial Twitter hashtag encouraging discussion of the school district's failed budget. Pat Brown, a senior at Cicero-North Syracuse High School, says he created #s**tCNSshouldcut to brainstorm ways his school could save money in response to voters on Tuesday rejecting a $144.7 million budget plan. The budget did not receive the 60% voter approval it needed. Many students were concerned, Brown said, because the school board had warned that if a new budget was not eventually passed, they might have to eliminate athletic programs, other extra-curricular activities and introduce additional administrative cuts, including the elimination of some teacher positions. The budget is up for a revote on June 18. ""Everyone on Twitter was talking about 'I can't believe the budget didn't pass' and so I created (the hashtag) as a joke, really,"" Brown told CNN on Friday. At first, according to Brown, his ideas for cutting the school budget were meant to be funny and absurd. They included cutting the lights because if teachers weren't being paid, students would have no schoolwork they'd have to see. He also suggested holding classes outside to save on air conditioning costs. Students at the school joined in on Twitter, using the hashtag with their own cost-cutting ideas. ""Anime club"" said @JackThaJuiceMan. ""Cheerleading"" said @jamierunge. ""There's honestly not much left at this point,"" wrote @MichaelBrisson. Brown, 18, says the tweet that got him in trouble was a call for the termination of the school's executive principal. ""I said we should cut her, because I don't think she does a good job. But that's just my opinion I was sharing on Twitter,"" he said. According to Brown, on Thursday he was called into the office and told he would be suspended for three days for harassing the principal, using a mobile phone in class and disrupting the learning environment. North Syracuse Central School District Superintendent Dr. Kim Dyce Faucette told CNN she was aware of the situation, but could not comment on disciplinary matters related to specific pupils. ""We have a student code of conduct that is a policy we abide by,"" said Faucette. ""Students and parents know the expectations of this policy, and whenever a situation arises where a student does not meet those expectations we deal with it accordingly."" Brown, an executive board member for his class on the student council and a community volunteer, says he has never been in trouble with the school before. While he admits to using his phone in class, Brown said his teacher never addressed it at the time, and he never threatened anyone. ""I'm not a bad student,"" Brown said. ""CNS says they want student involvement in what goes on in our school, and next thing I know I'm in trouble. A 45-year-old man can speak his opinions about the school district, but I can't because I'm a student?"" ""I just want (the school board) to remove the suspension from my record and choose their battles better,"" said Brown, who played on the school lacrosse team. Brown's original tweets have since been deleted. He said he will be allowed to graduate and take part in graduation ceremonies with his class. But he said he still feels like his reputation has been tarnished. ""I really don't plan on filing any appeal or anything. I really just wanted my opinion out there. They seem to have all the power so I went and got more power with social media."" By Friday, a new hashtag had emerged: #FreePatBrown.","Student in New York creates hashtag over school budget .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A post-9/11 law that sets federal standards for state driver's licenses and identification cards is under fire from the head of the agency enforcing that law, the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano, here last week in San Pedro, California, wants to replace the Real ID. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano this week said she is working with governors to repeal the Real ID Act, which was passed in 2005 and went into effect last year. The bill is popular in Washington, but is scorned by many governors who bear the responsibility and cost of validating that holders of driver's licenses are citizens or legal residents of the United States. Napolitano, former governor of Arizona, said she has met with governors of both parties recently ""to look at a way to repeal Real ID."" She said she wants to substitute the federal law with ""something else that pivots off of the driver's license but accomplishes some of the same goals. And we hope to be able to announce something on that fairly soon."" Napolitano made her remarks Tuesday in response to a question at a conference of the Anti-Defamation League. On Wednesday, Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, a sponsor of the law, said he was ""angered"" by Napolitano's comments. ""Real ID is a necessary program for keeping America safe. It is the will of Congress and also a recommendation of the 9/11 Commission,"" Sensenbrenner said. ""When the Democrats took over the majority in the 110th Congress, they said they wanted to implement all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations. I am highly disappointed that they are going back on their word by repealing this important recommendation, and substituting it with a weaker, less safe program that provides terrorists with too many avenues to attack."" While Napolitano is looking for ways to repeal Real ID, her department's Web site continues to espouse the law's merits. ""Raising the standards of state-issued identification is an important step toward enhancing national security,"" the Web site says. ""Because a driver's license serves so many purposes [access to federal buildings, nuclear power plants, boarding aircraft, etc.], terrorists actively seek fraudulent state-issued identification. The Real ID rules will make it more difficult for them, while making it easier for law enforcement to detect falsified documents,"" it says. The law, which requires all states to enforce specific identification requirements for driver's licenses and identification cards, went into effect last year, but the federal government has given states until the end of this year to implement it. States can get extensions until May 2011 for implementation if they meet certain benchmarks.","Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says she's meeting with governors .

"(OPRAH.com) -- What's it like to be a 30-something woman in America today? From religious choices to parental pressures, a successful single woman in Washington, D.C. and a devoted mother of four open up. American-born Muslim Mubaraka tries to be open with people so she can help them understand her religion. One issue that plagues an average of 6.3 million women in America is being single. Julie, a Chicago pediatrician, struggles with the stigma of being alone in her 30s. ""I've tried JDate, a Jewish Internet dating service, Match.com, setups by my friends,"" Julie says. ""I recently adopted a dog, hoping to meet someone out in the dog park."" Like many single women in America, Julie is no stranger to the dating scene -- but finding dates isn't always the problem. ""It's not that there are no men to date. It's that I'm not meeting anyone that I'm attracted to. Nobody that I think is quality and worthy of me and what I have to offer and what I want to do."" Now Julie thinks marriage may not even be what she wants. Instead of waiting around for a husband, she's considering having a child on her own. ""I'm probably going to investigate an anonymous donor and do it artificially ... I want it to be my own biological child,"" she says. DeChane, a successful attorney in Washington, D.C., also struggles with the 30-something singles scene. Her fear is that men are intimidated by her. ""None of my female friends have ever said I'm intimidating,"" she says. ""Having an education, a house, a job does not make me intimidating. It just makes me an adult living an adult life."" She finds it ironic that her achievements may turn men off. ""I would think they would find it more unusual if I walked into the picture not having anything. But I think after 35 years of living, working and being driven, I should have something to show for it."" DeChane also thinks men make assumptions about single women in their 30s. ""I think they assume that if you aren't married, you want to get married,"" she says. ""Instead of meeting you and approaching you in a manner that's very basic -- 'I want to get to know you, who you are, what your likes and dislikes are' -- I think they walk in the door expecting you to try to strong-arm them into getting married, and it scares them away."" For Amy, a divorced mom, dating in her 30s has been stressful. ""I wish there was a manual for dating, because I have been out of the game for so long,"" she says. ""Growing up, I always wanted to be a wife and a mom and didn't expect that I would find myself single again."" With four children at home, Amy faces a unique set of dating issues. ""I run a criminal background check on every guy I go out with,"" she says. ""I have to be very careful about who I invite into our lives."" Amy also realizes that a woman with kids isn't what every guy is looking for. ""I don't consider children baggage. I think they're the bonus piece to the set, but there are a lot of men who don't see it that way,"" she says. For many women in their 30s, the pressure to get married can be intense. Julie says she isn't feeling that pressure as much anymore. ""My original goal was to meet a man, have a family just like I grew up in,"" she says. ""But it just doesn't seem to be going that way."" As a single mom, Amy says the pressure comes from people who feel like something must be missing in her life. ""People see me as a single mom [as if] that's something wrong. 'Oh, you poor thing. You'll find somebody.' People will do that kind of thing because they don't feel like it's acceptable, or that you can't do it on your own,"" she says. DeChane takes a more relaxed approach. ""I am prepared to go with the flow as far as children and marriage are concerned,"" she says. ""I was raised in a family where a number of people, even married relatives, have chosen not to have children. So it's never been the expectation that you have to get married, that you have to have children. It's really more being who you are and having a happy life. That's the focus for me."" Oprah:com: Top places to meet men over 35! For devout Muslim Mubarakah, a 30-year-old mother of four, life in her 30s is about family and career.

"London (CNN) -- Iran has been carrying out covert tests of missiles capable of delivering a nuclear payload, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said Wednesday, in contravention of a U.N. resolution. It has also said it wants to enrich uranium to ""levels far greater than is needed for peaceful nuclear energy,"" Hague said. Iran's development of missile and nuclear fuel technology has led to U.N. sanctions and accusations from the United States that the clerical regime is trying to develop nuclear weapons. Iran says it has a right to peaceful nuclear technology, but the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says it cannot verify whether Tehran's nuclear program remains entirely peaceful. Iran has not yet responded to Hague's claims. His comments in the House of Commons come a day after Iranian news agencies reported that the country's military had successfully test-fired 14 missiles during military drills, as part of a week of war games. Tehran also unveiled several ballistic missile silos Monday, and Wednesday demonstrated what was described by the semi-official Fars news agency as a new Iranian-made long-range radar system capable of monitoring low-altitude satellites. Speaking in London, Hague said: ""Iran has also been carrying out covert ballistic missile tests and rocket launches, including testing missiles capable of delivering a nuclear payload in contravention of U.N. resolution 1929, and it has announced that it intends to triple its capacity to produce 20% enriched uranium."" The UK foreign secretary promised to ""maintain and continue to increase pressure on Iran to negotiate an agreement on their nuclear programme, building on the strengthening of sanctions,"" announced earlier this month. Enriched uranium can be used for civilian nuclear purposes, but also to make atomic weapons. The IAEA raised concerns in February that Iran was not engaging with the agency on claims that it was developing a nuclear payload for its missiles. The IAEA report discussed possible nuclear activities tied to Iran's military ""including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile."" The United States imposed new sanctions on Iran last week, targeting the country's national airline, Iran Air, other companies, and international business executives accused of illicitly building up Tehran's military. Iran condemned those sanctions in a letter to the United Nations, saying the international body had a responsibility to look out for ""nations who are merely endeavoring to attain their legitimate and undeniable rights under international law."" The United Nations passed a fourth round of sanctions against Iran in June 2010, aimed at pressuring it to suspend its nuclear program.","Foreign secretary says Iran also wants to enrich uranium beyond peaceful levels .

"(CNN) -- Germany's government has asked America's top spy chief stationed in the country to leave. It's a punitive gesture usually reserved for adversarial nations in times of crisis and only very rarely for an ally, particularly a very close one. But allegations of American spying have seriously injured German trust, Chancellor Angela Merkel has said. And it's time for a reset. Germany let loose the diplomatic slap, reminiscent of a Cold War rebuke, after news of two new possible U.S. espionage cases broke back to back in a week's time. Two Germans -- one working at a German intelligence agency, the other in the Ministry of Defense -- are suspected of spying for the United States. Local media report that both cases involve stolen official German documents. The U.S. official shown the door is based in Berlin at the U.S. Embassy, which followed up on Friday's announcement with a note to journalists: . ""The U.S. Embassy has seen the reports that Germany has asked the U.S. Mission Germany's intelligence chief to leave the country. As a standard practice, we will not comment on intelligence matters."" A German official confirmed that person was the CIA's station chief and that the agency's director, John Brennan, has talked multiple times with his German counterpart. 'So much stupidity' Top German government officials have candidly spoken about the decision to expel the U.S. official as they poured their disappointment over alleged U.S. spying into microphones and cameras for days. Most pointedly, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble casually described the alleged U.S. actions as ""daft"" before a television talk show audience. ""One can only cry over so much stupidity,"" he said. He based his remarks on the essential value of Germany's cooperation with U.S. intelligence agencies to fight international terrorism and complained that spying spoils the relationship. Legal action . The latest allegations weigh densely on ties already burdened since Edward Snowden leaked indications that the National Security Agency tapped into Merkel's own cell phone. They have seemingly undone any of Washington's diplomatic smoothing over previously alleged NSA intrusions. One of the new cases has landed on top of an existing investigation on federal prosecutors' desks into the possible spying on Merkel. The NSA scandal has also prompted prosecutors to set up a new special committee to investigate and criminally prosecute cyberspying by foreign intelligence. Merkel deferred to the pending results of those investigations, but it didn't stop her from expressing on Thursday the disappointment she feels over the suspected acts. ""From a common sense standpoint, in my opinion, spying on allies is, in the end, a waste of energy. We have so many problems, and we should, I find, concentrate on the essentials."" ISIS, Syria, terrorism -- all take priority over spying on each other, she said. And trust between allies is vital. Privacy is sacred . To understand Germany's particular hurt over spying allegations, one need only to look at the country's history in the 20th century, when oppressive fascist and communist regimes spied on citizens in order to persecute them. During the Cold War, high-level spy scandals stoked division between then divided democratic West Germany and communist East Germany. The scandals triggered government shakedowns and deep public outrage in the West. As a result of the Nazi past, democratic, postwar Germany has instituted very strict privacy laws that prohibit government agencies, companies and private individuals from gathering or passing even simple information about citizens without their express consent. Or in criminal cases, without probable cause. Data protection is so sacred in Germany that advertisers there are prevented from profiling prospective consumers. Top U.S., German diplomats to meet . Amid the new allegations, the top U.S. and German diplomats are expected to meet in Vienna, Austria, this weekend during multination negotiations about the future of Iran's nuclear program, a senior U.S. State Department official said. While the official said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier will touch on topics such as the Middle East and Ukraine, it'd be hard to imagine the two ignoring the spy issue. Across the Atlantic in Washington, the new allegations have also raised the eyebrows of some elected officials. ""I am concerned that we are sending the wrong message to a key ally,"" said Democratic Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado. Otherwise, administration officials have countered their German counterparts' candor with lips as sealed as those at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin. White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to comment on the reported intelligence activity as a matter of policy, to protect American national security and ""intelligence assets."" ""I'm not going to have anything more to add on that front,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told a journalist who asked if reports of Germany booting the U.S. intelligence official were true. German journalists who contacted Washington officials for comment on the cases, when news of them first broke, reported receiving e-mail replies containing only two words, which they included in their articles in the original English: . ""No comment."" Germany calls in U.S. ambassador over new spying allegation . Germany investigating alleged U.S. surveillance of Merkel's phone . India summons U.S. diplomat over report of NSA spying . CNN's Evan Perez contributed to this story.","Leading German officials openly express disgust over new spying allegations .

"YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, California (CNN) -- Her hands are like the grand and timeless Yosemite Valley where she has lived the better part of 60 years. They are strong and steady, with the feel of permanence like the smooth granite faces of El Capitan and Half Dome. Yosemite ranger Julia Parker is a basket weaver and cultural demonstrator. Her agile fingers still weave willow branches into masterful baskets. They are traditional baskets that are displayed around the world and have garnered her attention from adoring fans. She considers the Earth her lifeblood. She is a living metaphor for a hard-earned life spent caring for the land. Julia Parker, 80, is Native American. Born in Northern California, she is a mix of Coastal Miwok and Kashia Pomo tribes. ""I do have an Indian name that was given to me. I'm called Hoo Wee Na, that means 'person of peace.'"" She is a park ranger with Yosemite National Park. She works as Native American cultural demonstrator at the Yosemite Museum. There are many 20-and 30-year employees at Yosemite, but Julia is the oldest and longest-tenured park employee with over 40 years. ""Julia interprets Native American culture to our visitors,""Yosemite National Park spokesman Scott Gediman says. ""She shows visitors how baskets were woven, toys or brushes were made and acorns collected from native black oak trees, ground up using a metate and made into mush."" ""Julia is truly a national treasure,"" he adds. ""She's been honored by universities, she has baskets all over the country, she's consulted with museums.""  Watch Parker at work » . In 1983, Parker presented Queen Elizabeth II a basket she'd worked on for a year. Her work is displayed in museums like the Smithsonian. Her parents died when she was 12, leaving five children orphans. Since she was the oldest, Parker tried to keep all of the kids together. They went to an Indian boarding school in Carson City, Nevada. When she turned 17, Parker took a job laundering clothes for the Yosemite Park and Curry Company. She lived in the Indian Village and married Ralph Parker, a Mono Lake Piute. His tribe's Yosemite roots date back nine generations. His mother, Lucy Telles, was a renowned basket maker and, along with the other Yosemite women, passed down their basketry skills to Parker. Parker's daughter Lucy is learning basketry from her mother. ""She's a living legend,"" Lucy Parker says. ""She's known throughout the world. People will come to Yosemite to visit her here."" Lucy Parker is accomplished in her own basketry and is determined to keep the Yosemite traditions alive. ""My mom Julia has guided me through the heart of basket making. She's taught me to give thanks, give blessings."" Now four generations of Parker women are making baskets. There's Lucy's daughter, Ursula, and Ursula's daughter, Naomi. Its legacy and artistry seem secure. Julia Parker is sitting in the shade of the willows. She has stripped the stalks of their small leaves and begins fastening a base to a quick basket. Her seasoned hands and sharp eyes thread willow stalks as another basket takes form. She hums a tribal song. Its words are sacred and not for outsiders' ears. The sheer walls of Yosemite Valley frame a living legend. ""I learned from my elders. They told me, 'Julia, you take from the Earth with a please and give back with a thank you.""","Yosemite ranger works as Native American cultural demonstrator .

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- Armed men fatally shot a Malaysian police officer and abducted another at a diving resort on the island of Borneo, according to Malaysian authorities. A group of eight gunmen dressed in army fatigues stormed the Mabul Water Bungalow Resort off the eastern coast of Sabah on Saturday evening and fired on marine police officers guarding the complex, said Eastern Sabah Security Command director Abdul Rashid Harun. The masked attackers fled by boat with one of the police officers, 26-year-old Constable Zakiah Aliep, after a gunfight that killed another, Corporal Abdul Rajah Jamuan, 32. The two policemen were stationed at the resort following a series of kidnappings which began in Sabah last year. Harun said it was unclear who was responsible for the attack, but the vessel was seen traveling toward the southern Philippines, which is a notorious safe haven for Filipino separatists. With pristine diving spots that are considered some of the best in the world, Sabah is a popular destination for tourists but the region remains vulnerable to attacks by insurgents from the southern Philippines. This is the fourth incident involving suspected Filipino gunmen on the island this year. In April, a Chinese tourist and a Filipina worker were kidnapped from a diving resort off Semporna. A month later, a Chinese fish farm company manager was abducted from Batik Island near Lahad Datu. All three have been released following negotiations with Malaysian and Filipino security forces. Another Chinese citizen and a Malaysian worker, who were kidnapped from a fish farm near Kunak on June 23, remain missing. Police believe the gunmen responsible for Saturday's incident avoided detection by rowing a boat to the resort before springing the surprise attack from the rear of the complex, a spokesperson for the Malaysian police, Asmawati Ahmad, confirmed Monday. Malaysia's prime minister Najib Razak has expressed his condolences to the family of the officer killed in the ambush, and promised authorities would try their best ""to look for and rescue"" the missing constable. The Mabul Water Bungalow Resort was operating as usual Monday, a spokesperson for the hotel told CNN. Police investigations into the attack are ongoing, Harun from the Eastern Sabah Security Command said.","One policeman is dead and another kidnapped in Malaysian Borneo .

"Romulus, Michigan (CNN) -- A passenger on an international flight bound for the United States Friday ignited a small explosive device shortly before landing in a move the White House called an attempted terrorist attack, a senior administration official said. Another passenger on the Northwest flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan, quickly helped subdue and isolate the young male suspect with the aid of the cabin crew, passenger Syed Jafry said. The suspect, identified by a U.S. government official as 23-year-old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, was placed in custody and is being treated for second- and third-degree burns on his thighs, according to federal law enforcement and airline security sources. The sources said the suspect flew into Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam on a KLM flight from Lagos, Nigeria, and is not believed to be on any ""no fly"" list, although his name does appear in a U.S. database of people with suspect connections. He did not undergo secondary security screening in Amsterdam, the administration official said. The administration official said there was no evidence that Abdulmatallab was a hard-core, trained member of al-Qaeda. The suspect, identified as a Nigerian national, claimed to have extremist ties and said the explosive device ""was acquired in Yemen along with instructions as to when it should be used,"" said a federal security bulletin obtained by CNN. The FBI is investigating, bureau spokeswoman Sandra Berchtold said. The remains of the device used are being sent to an FBI explosives lab in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis, the sources said. President Obama, who is spending the holidays in his home state of Hawaii, was briefed on the incident during a secure phone call with aides, and instructed in a subsequent discussion with security advisers ""that all appropriate measures be taken to increase security for air travel,"" said White House spokesman Bill Burton. The president made no changes to his schedule, Burton said. The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement Friday saying that air passengers ""may notice additional screening measures put into place to ensure the safety of the traveling public on domestic and international flights."" Passengers described the brief moments of panic on board as screams erupted and flight attendants ran for fire extinguishers. Jafry, who was sitting in seat 16G, said the plane was just beginning to descend when passengers heard a pop. ""Everybody got a little bit startled,"" he said. ""After a few seconds or so ... there was ... kind of a flamish light and there was fire"" and people around the immediate area began to panic. One woman told CNN affiliate WDIV that a man threw a blanket over the suspect's legs to help put out the small fire. ""It was terrifying,"" Richelle Keepman said. ""I think we all thought we weren't going to land, we weren't going to make it."" Passenger Elias Fawaz told WDIV that the explosion sounded ""like a balloon being popped"" and said he could smell smoke. WDIV coverage of plane incident . Jafry said the incident was under control within minutes, crediting the crew and nearby passengers for the rapid response. One person was taken to the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, hospital spokeswoman Tracy Justice said. ""All passengers have deplaned and out of an abundance of caution, the plane was moved to a remote area,"" where the plane and baggage were rescreened, the Transportation Security Administration said in a statement. Passengers were interviewed by law enforcement authorities before being allowed to leave the airport. No other suspicious materials were found on the plane or in luggage, the law enforcement and airline security sources said. No other suspicious materials were found on the plane or in luggage, the law enforcement and airline security sources said. The suspect had only carry-on luggage.

"(CNN) -- Most have likely heard the broad outlines of the events that led to former Vice President Dick Cheney's heart transplant: Five heart attacks, open heart surgery and a battery-operated heart pump. But few are probably aware that the 72-year-old Cheney believed at one point he would not live through the night and made funeral plans with his family. That's just one of the surprising facts that I learned during an interview conducted over two days with the man widely considered to be one of the most powerful vice presidents in U.S. history. The interview is scheduled to air Sunday on CBS' ""60 Minutes."" It will air Tuesday on CNN. Here are three things I learned during the interview: . 1. He started smoking cigarettes when he was 12 years old, and his daily staple was a dozen doughnuts and three packs of cigarettes when he was President Gerald Ford's chief of staff. He was just 34 years old. Cheney suffered his first heart attack in 1978, at age 37, while he was campaigning for Congress. It was the first of five heart attacks. He suffered subsequent heart attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000 and 2010. Cheney also underwent an open heart surgery and had a pacemaker implanted. In June 2010, he was hospitalized for conditions related to his coronary artery disease. He had a Left Ventricular Assist Device, or LVAD, implanted to help his heart pump. What's a stent? 2. In July 2010, he was convinced he was going to die. He made plans for his burial with his family, and then had a heart pump placed. That heart pump stayed in his body for 20 months until he got a heart transplant at age 71. The LVAD, a battery-operated heart pump, is basically used to buy people time -- a last resort, if you will -- while they await a new heart. Cheney waited 20 months for a transplant, twice as long as the average wait for a patient for a new heart. 3. For the entire time Cheney was vice president, he had a secret letter of resignation pending. He wrote this letter because he saw a gap in the U.S. Constitution. If a vice president is alive but incapacitated, there's nothing in the Constitution that allows for that person's removal. Worried that he might find himself in that position, he created the unprecedented letter. Cheney unapologetic in documentary . Cheney said he gave the letter to his counsel, David Addington, with instruction that it was to be delivered to President George W. Bush if Cheney were to become incapacitated. Before Cheney accepted Bush's offer to run as his vice president, he has said a team of doctors carried out a thorough evaluation of his heart. After leaving office in 2009, Cheney's appearance became increasingly frail. I saw him a few years ago, and he looked so frail that I as a doctor thought the end was near for him. Today, Cheney looks to be of normal weight and full of energy. He is walking around with no shortness of breath, and he says he can do whatever he wants except ski. That's not because of Cheney's heart. That's because of his aging knees. Dick Cheney: Fast Facts . CNN's Chelsea J. Carter compiled this report.","Dick Cheney, 72, suffered his first heart attack in 1978 .

"(CNN) -- A new look Germany got their European Championship qualification campaign off to a winning start by beating Scotland 2-1 in Dortmund. Thomas Mueller gave Germany the lead in a tightly fought game that saw the Scots equalize in the second half thanks to a superbly taken goal by Ikechi Anya. But the irrepressible Mueller scored again four minutes later and Germany held out before Scotland were reduced to ten men late on. New look Germany . It is barely six weeks since Germany won the 2014 World Cup at the Maracana in Rio, but already thoughts have turned to the European Championship finals in France in two years time. Yet Germany was missing many of the players that had featured in that famous World Cup campaign, not least Miroslav Klose, Philipp Lahm and Per Mertesacker who have all retired from international football. A recent 4-2 thrashing by fellow finalists Argentina in a friendly last week -- Germany were 4-0 down at one point -- had raised fears that the transition to a new look team might be a painful one. Germany started strongly in the first half and took a deserved lead in the 18th minute when Mueller looped in a header. A flourish of goals didn't follow. Instead Scotland, rejuvenated and unbeaten in six competitive games under coach Gordon Strachan, worked themselves back into the game and were unlucky not to equalize when Everton striker Steven Naismith hit the post. But the equalizer did come eventually after Anya raced through on the left and calmly slotted the ball past Manuel Neuer. Parity didn't last long as Mueller scored the decisive goal and any chance of a comeback was snuffed out after a late Mulgrew red card reduced the Scots to ten men. Chance for the underdogs . Elsewhere in Europe it was a chance for the underdogs to shine. UEFA, European football's governing body, has changed the qualification format for the 2016 competition. It has been expanded to 24 teams, meaning that the top two in each group qualify automatically to the finals whilst third place might earn a play off spot. There has been much criticism of the move in Europe's established footballing powers for diluting the standard of the competition, but the change also opens the door to smaller teams who might not otherwise qualify. Albania grabbed their chance with both hands. The tiny Balkan state beat a Ronaldo-less Portugal 1-0. Northern Ireland came back from a goal down to beat Hungary 2-1 after scoring twice in the last 10 minutes whilst the Faeroe islands looked on course for a shock win against Finland before the Finns scored three second half goals. Gibraltar hammered . There was no fairytale ending for Gibraltar. The tiny British overseas territory, UEFA's smallest and newest member, was playing its first competitive match since being admitted last year. Gibraltar's membership of UEFA had become a political hot potato. The ownership of the territory is disputed by Spain, who claim Gibraltar is Spanish territory and have opposed any attempts to admit them in to UEFA. But the Gibraltar Football Association successfully took their case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, allowing the national team to play in qualification for the first time in their history. Although their match against Poland was supposed to be a home game, Gibraltar's Victoria Stadium does not meet UEFA's standards and the match was moved to Portugal. After an impressive first half, Poland went into overdrive in the second. Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski scored four times as Poland ran out 7-0 winners. Monday sees current European champions Spain play Macedonia, England play Switzerland and Austria play Sweden.","Germany beat Scotland 2-1 in Euro qualification .

"Washington (CNN) -- When the Bureau of Land Management retreated from a standoff with Cliven Bundy, a few hundred people traveled to his Nevada ranch to protest what they see as an overreach of the federal government. One protester from neighboring Utah, Stephen L. Dean, 45, called the Bureau of Land Management's actions ""tyranny in government."" And a banner at the protest site blared: ""Has the West been won? Or has the fight just begun!"" Showdown on the range . The Bundy standoff is emblematic of the larger anti-government sentiment around the country that has been amplified with the creation of the tea party movement in 2009. But the latest move in a two-decade-long tug of war between Bundy and the federal government is bringing to light the delicate balance that has lasted between citizens in the West and the federal government over the use of federally owned land for generations. Private rancher on public lands? Bundy tends his 900 cattle grazing on taxpayer-owned land about 100 miles north of Las Vegas. To an East Coast dweller, the concept of public lands can be a foreign one, as people own or rent their plot of space in urban, suburban and commuter towns that crowd the Eastern Seaboard. But out West, public lands are a big deal. Almost everyone uses them or depends on them. They are key to people's recreational hiking, fishing, hunting and skiing. And they are critical to people's livelihood, as they are used to cut timber, drill oil, mine coal and ranch cattle. Vast swaths of the land in the West are predominately public. In Nevada, for example, 87% of the state is owned by the federal government, and the BLM oversees 245 million acres of public lands mostly west of the Mississippi River, not including the lands overseen by the National Forest Service and half a dozen other federal agencies. ""Public lands are true assets of the U.S.,"" said Bob Abbey, former director of the Bureau of Land Management. Reid calls Bundy, supporters 'domestic terrorists' How did Bundy ever get use of federal lands? In Nevada, ranchers depend on the federal lands for their livelihood. The government began allowing the use of the land in 1877 to promote the economic development of dry, difficult-to-cultivate desert areas. So it offered land for dirt cheap. Bundy says his family has owned the ranch since about the time the Desert Land Act passed. A version of the law still exists today, allowing ranchers to graze their cattle on public lands for a nominal rate. The fee is cheaper than what the rancher would pay the state or a private land owner, but the tradeoff is that the rancher has to share the land with the public. Feds end roundup, release cattle after showdown . The history . This is not the first standoff between public land users and the government. The most famous one, the Sagebrush Rebellion in the 1970s, pitted ranchers, loggers and miners against the federal government. They thought the Jimmy Carter administration was too heavy-handed in its regulatory and environmental policies. Former Nevada state Sen. Dean Rhoads, who is also a rancher, led the negotiations with the federal government, which he said were peaceful and productive. Ronald Reagan, Carter's opponent in the 1980 presidential election, sided with the Sagebrush rebels, saying, ""The next administration won't treat the West as if it were not worthy of attention. The next administration will reflect the values and goals of the Sagebrush Rebellion. Indeed, we can turn the Sagebrush Rebellion into the Sagebrush Solution."" Reagan was a former governor of California, where the federal government owns roughly half the state's land . Since then, the BLM and the corresponding state agency have confiscated cattle from violators, but nothing escalated to the temperature of the Bundy Ranch situation. The Bureau of Land Management . The BLM is a federal agency that operates predominantly in the West and is in charge of managing these lands. It must balance the desires of ranchers, environmentalists, recreationalists, and industrialists. ""I think a lot of people who live in the East don't understand the BLM,"" said Abbey, the former director. Jon Griggs is manager of the 200,000-acre Maggie Creek Ranch in Elko, Nevada, a third of which uses public lands. He says he's sympathetic to the BLM, citing its difficult job. ""A lot of times they don't make anybody happy,"" he said, because the bureau is responsible for managing lands for so many uses. ""I think that folks on the ground at BLM are good folks trying to do the best they can."" But this system unique to the United States brings conflict. The environmentalists . The balance between conservation and public use is a major source of tension when overseeing government land. The desert tortoise is a factor in the Bundy equation, and the rancher was ordered to remove his cattle from public lands in 1993 after the tortoise was placed on the protected species list. Bundy refused to comply, and he racked up more than $1 million in fines. Brian O'Donnell, executive director at the Conservation Lands Foundation, called Bundy ""one of the most selfish and irresponsible users of public land that I've ever witnessed."" ""The key tenet in public lands in America is they belong to all of us,"" he said. When one person puts his ""own selfish interest above everyone else's, the whole system falls apart."" Ranchers' sentiment . The Bundy situation is a common topic of conversation in rural Nevada, a part of the country filled with libertarian sentiment distrustful of the government, Griggs said. And like his, he said people's feelings are mixed. While the ranch manager is sympathetic to the BLM's mission, he said its tactics were the wrong approach. Griggs said he understands where Bundy is coming from, saying the BLM ""put his back up against the wall."" But Griggs also said that Bundy lost all efforts at appeal and that now he should follow the law. ""I think it's a mess any way you slice it,"" he said. 'Welfare ranchers' Because of the cheap rent, some, including fellow cattlemen who don't ranch on public lands, call public land ranchers ""welfare ranchers"" and have no sympathy for the Western lot. But Griggs said they don't understand that ranching public land is ""not a bargain."" ""On public lands, you might get kicked off at any moment for a turtle. That's kind of the deal,"" he said. Rhoads, the former Nevada state senator, said 600 ranchers are currently paying their fees to the federal government for use of the land. He says that because of Bundy, people will ""think that us in Nevada are getting away with not paying the government what it owes them."" The politics . Unsurprisingly, Bundy has become a political symbol. Senate Majority Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called him a ""domestic terrorist."" ""These people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not,"" he said in Las Vegas. Democratic Rep. Dina Titus told journalist John Ralston that Bundy is ""not a folk hero,"" Ralston tweeted, but said Reid shouldn't call him a terrorist. But libertarian-minded Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky criticized the federal government's response, saying it ""shouldn't violate the law, nor should we have 48 federal agencies carrying weapons and having SWAT teams."" ""Can everybody decide what the law is on their own? No, there has to be a legal process,"" he said on WHAS radio in Louisville. ""But I think there is definitely a philosophic debate over who should own the land."" The future . The BLM might have lost the latest battle with Bundy, but it has other tools at its disposal, including arresting Bundy for failing to follow the law, seizing his assets through the Treasury Department or sending the case to the Department of Justice. The agency has not yet said what its next course of action will be, but former BLM director Abbey said that it must prevail because of the precedent it would set. If Bundy gets away with illegally grazing on lands and not paying fines, it could encourage other ranchers to follow suit. While Bundy is a source of contention, ranchers out West are watching the BLM's next steps in the Bundy standoff, and they are worried about the BLM's next major action: Conservationists are asking for protection for the sage grouse. The Nevada Cattlemen's Association says the BLM's draft proposal includes ""overly burdensome grazing requirements."" It would also reduce the number of grazing permits.","Bundy Ranch supporters say the federal government is trampling on its rights .

"(CNN) -- The NFL has a simple answer for critics who claim the league should have been able to get videos of Ray Rice knocking out his future wife and dragging her out of an elevator. It would have been illegal, Commissioner Roger Goodell wrote in a memo Wednesday to the top officials of the NFL's 32 teams. ""Once a criminal investigation begins, law enforcement authorities do not share investigatory material (such as the videos here) with private parties such as the NFL,"" he wrote in a note to chief executives and club presidents. ""In addition, (New Jersey's) Open Public Records Act excludes material that is generated in the context of an active law enforcement proceeding."" The Associated Press, however, reported Wednesday that a law enforcement official said he sent a copy of the video in April to an NFL executive and someone called him from an NFL office phone to thank him for sending the video. The NFL reacted to the story by saying the league is unaware of anyone in its office having the video in their possession and officials would look into the report. NFL toughens domestic violence policy with six-game bans . Rice has been suspended indefinitely from the NFL and was cut by the Baltimore Ravens after a video surfaced this week showing him punching Janay Rice, who at the time was his fiancee, in an elevator in Atlantic City on February 15. Rice was eventually charged with third-degree assault by Atlantic County prosecutors, but as a first-time offender was able to enter into a diversionary program. If he successfully completes the program in one year, the charge will be removed from his record. Timeline of events in the Ray Rice story . Critics have said the NFL should have been able to get the videos and should have banned Rice for life instead of initially giving him a two-game suspension. The ban was increased after the in-elevator video was posted online by TMZ Sports on Monday. It was the second dramatic video in the case. The first showed the aftermath of the ferocious blow. In it Rice drags his unconscious fiancee off the elevator and talks to a security staffer. Goodell doesn't rule out a return for Rice . Goodell also said the hotel couldn't legally provide the video to the NFL because of the investigation into the incident. ""We did not ask the Atlantic City casino directly for the video,"" he wrote. ""Again, our understanding of New Jersey law is that the casino is prohibited from turning over material to a third party during a law enforcement proceeding, and that doing so would have subjected individuals to prosecution for interference with a criminal investigation."" Goodell said the Rice legal proceedings are still an ""open matter."" NFL's past penalties for domestic violence 'a different story' TMZ executive producer Harvey Levin told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Tuesday that they paid for the videos. ""I think what happened was the casino closed. And when the casino closed, I think there were a lot of employees who just said, you know what: 'We want to do the right thing.' And ultimately we ended up getting this video because when you look at the video, clearly you see the NFL did not do the right thing,"" Levin said of the second video. ""And I think at a point somebody said that the gain here is worse than the risk, in terms of doing what's right."" The Revel casino closed eight days ago. The Baltimore Sun petitioned for the release of the elevator video under the Freedom of Information Act, but its request was denied by New Jersey officials. What if Goodell ran the NBA and Silver captained the NFL?","NJ law prohibits release of certain evidence during legal matters, NFL boss says .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- An official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been arrested and charged with two counts of child molestation and one count of bestiality, police said. Police arrested Dr. Kimberly Quinlan Lindsey, 44, in DeKalb County, Georgia, on Sunday. Authorities also charged Lindsey's live-in boyfriend, Thomas Joseph Westerman, 42, with two counts of child molestation. The two are accused of ""immoral and indecent"" sexual acts involving a 6-year-old, according to information from DeKalb County Magistrate Court and an arrest warrant. The bestiality charge says Lindsey ""did unlawfully perform or submit to any sexual act with an animal."" The alleged incidents took place between January 1, 2010, and August 22, 2011. Westerman is out of jail on bail; Lindsey remains in jail with bail set at $20,000, said Lt. Pam Kunz of the DeKalb County Police Department. Neither has made a public statement. Westerman did not immediately return a call from CNN. Both went to court on Sunday for an initial appearance and have a preliminary hearing scheduled for December 1, said Reggie Silverman, deputy clerk with DeKalb Magistrate Court. Lindsey is the deputy director for the Laboratory Science Policy and Practice Program Office at the CDC, according to her biography on the agency's website. Prior to her current role, Lindsey was the senior health scientist in the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response. That office oversees the allocation process for $1.5 billion in terrorism preparedness. In her 12 years at the CDC, Lindsey has received 12 awards for outstanding performance on projects and programs, according to her bio on Emory University's Biological and Biomedical Sciences website. Lindsey earned her doctorate in immunology and molecular pathogenesis from the university in 1998, a year before she began work at the CDC. A LinkedIn Web page for a Thomas Westerman lists him as having been a watch officer at the CDC from November 2009 to November 2010 and a resource management specialist since August 2011. CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said the agency is aware of the case but cannot comment on personnel issues. CNN's Vivian Kuo, Mary Lynn Ryan, Caleb Hellerman and Tom Faust contributed to this report.","NEW: The two are accused of ""immoral and indecent"" sexual acts involving a 6-year-old .

"(CNN) -- Fifty-two superheroes are getting a makeover, and comic book fans can't stop talking about it -- even though they've seen this sort of thing before. DC Comics announced Tuesday on its blog, and in exclusive interviews with USA Today, that come September, not only will many of its titles get a more modern look under respected artist Jim Lee's direction, but they'll also get renumbered, starting issue counts back at No. 1. (DC Comics, like CNN, is owned by parent company Time Warner.) For readers emotionally invested in the stories of superheroes like Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, this kind of announcement can be threatening. Based on fans' Twitter reaction, it's obvious that anxiety, or at the very least skepticism, has set in. ""I've seen their attempts to revamp before,"" said David Whitehead, a 39-year-old client performance strategist who has been collecting comic books for 20 years. ""So, I guess I'm going in with some guarded skepticism,"" he said. He wonders what kind of stories DC has up its sleeve, and how interesting they could be. He hopes the iconic publisher can pull it off, he said. ""I was the biggest Jim Lee fan in the '90s, and then after seeing what he did to the Wonder Woman costume, I'm a little hesitant to see what he's done with the rest of the Justice League and the rest of the DC Universe,"" Whitehead said. Fans also know that any kind of reboot is, in part, a business decision for the comic book publisher. ""What they're shooting for is the opportunity for readers to jump on at an issue No. 1,"" said Kathleen Saracen, manager of Titan Games and Comics in Smyrna, Georgia. ""New readers feel like, 'Oh, it's a No. 1, I could start reading it now,'"" she said. Comic book sales often jump up with a No. 1 issue, she said, ""but I think it gets tiresome, from a collector's point of view, to constantly have to renumber your collection."" With comic books, she explained, many titles order story lines by volumes. At the beginning of a new volume, the issue number of a comic book may or may not roll back to No. 1. So for hard-core, superorganized collectors who have been following one comic book for a long time, she said, the chronological order of their copies isn't always so logical. And renumbering hasn't always been appreciated in the past. ""One book that comes to mind is Wonder Woman,"" said Erika Peterman, a DC Comics fan and blogger for girls-gone-geek.com. The Wonder Woman comic book was relaunched by DC in 2006, and by last year the new volume had reached issue No. 44. After a fan write-in campaign, DC revised the issue numbers to reflect the original starting date of the title, resulting in the next issue being numbered 600. ""Fans were like, 'Yes! (Wonder Woman) deserves that high number because she's been around since the 1940s, this puts her right up there with Superman and Batman,'"" said Peterman. Despite all the apprehension, fans say they want DC to be successful in this latest endeavor. They know that more people reading comic books means they get to keep collecting. So even if DC's across-the-board revamp isn't engineered to please loyal fans, it's a move that they understand -- because it's designed to bring new readers into the fold. For the most part, said Peterman, comic book collectors are in their mid-30s, which may surprise outsiders who think comic books are juvenile. Younger people are not collecting comic books the way they were 20 years ago, she said. Whitehead points out that comic books aren't generally available at the corner store anymore, so the impulse buys he made at the drug store in his youth are less likely to happen. These days, comic books are sold almost exclusively in comic book stores. That's where the second part of DC's announcement comes in: With the renumbering, they'll be offering day-and-date digital. That means that the same day new issues of comic books are in stores, they'll be available for download as well. Whitehead said he thinks younger readers are more likely to read comics electronically. ""We're having a party,"" said DC Executive Editor Eddie Berganza. ""We want as many people coming to that party as possible. If day-and-date digital is a way to get more people involved in comics and see what we're doing, I think that's great."" ""It seems to be the way the whole world is going,"" he said. In addition to the announcement Tuesday that the comic book ""Justice League"" would be starting again at issue No. 1 in September, DC officials told CNN the publisher would also be renumbering and modernizing such titles as Wonder Woman, Aquaman, The Flash, The Fury of Firestorm, The Savage Hawkman, Green Arrow, Justice League International, Mister Terrific, Captain Atom and DC Universe Presents. The characters brought to the fore with the reboot will be interacting in ways they never have before in the DC universe, said DC Editor-in-Chief Bob Harras. ""For me, I wanted to get into the Cyborg character, who will be part of the Justice League,"" Berganza said. ""He's always been one of my favorites from the Titans and now to see him step up, really take his place among the bigger pantheon of heroes is excellent. He's such a cool character."" ""We're doing a book called 'Savage Hawkman' and to see the excitement between the artist (Philip Tan) and the writer (Tony Daniel), taking a classic DC character, and to see what they're doing with it is so amazing,"" said Harras of the energy he sees in the pages of the rebooted title. ""It's an epic that we're putting together, and we're incredibly excited about it,"" he said. Even so, fans still have unanswered questions about the upcoming reboot. As DC continues to announce its 52 superhero titles getting the treatment, fans can't help but wonder what will change. For example, after giving Wonder Woman pants, what will Lee do to modernize DC's other heavy hitters, Batman and Superman? DC wouldn't tell CNN. Guess we'll have to wait and see.","DC Comics will be renumbering 52 of its superhero titles in September .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Curtis Jackson -- known professionally as the rapper 50 Cent -- was accused by a prosecutor Wednesday of kicking a woman and ransacking her bedroom during an argument at her Los Angeles condo last month. Jackson, 37, faces five criminal charges, including one count of domestic violence and four counts of vandalism, Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said. The woman, who lived in the Toluca Lake community, was identified only as the rapper's ""former girlfriend."" ""The female had previously been in a three-year relationship with Jackson and they have a child in common,"" the news release said. She was injured when Jackson kicked her, it said. Los Angeles police went to the home in response to a domestic violence call on June 23, the release said. ""During an argument, Jackson allegedly began destroying the female's property,"" the prosecutor said. ""Allegedly when the female locked herself in her bedroom, Jackson kicked-open the bedroom door and kicked her, causing an injury."" Police found broken chandeliers and furniture throughout the home, and the bedroom was ransacked with clothes thrown all over the floor and a television and lamp broken, the release said. Investigators estimated 50 Cent left $7,100 in damaged property before leaving the scene before police arrived. 50 Cent's lawyer Scott Leemon responded to the charges in a statement, saying,""Curtis Jackson denies these allegations as made against him. It is important to note, Mr. Jackson has not been arrested and there is no warrant outstanding for his arrest. We have been in contact with the LA City Attorney's Office and are currently conducting our own investigation into these allegations. Out of respect for the legal process, we will not be commenting any further at this time."" Jackson's arraignment is set for July 22 at the Van Nuys Superior Court. The maximum punishment if convicted on all counts would be five years in jail and $46,000 in fines. ""Regardless of perceived celebrity or notoriety, domestic violence is a serious crime, and alleged perpetrators will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law by this office,"" Feuer said. ""We will continue to look out for the safety of all victims of domestic violence and seek justice for the alleged crimes."" 50 Cent turns waiter for Superstorm Sandy victims .","50 Cent faces one count of domestic violence and four counts of vandalism .

"(CNN) -- Stefano Domenicali has resigned as team principal of the Ferrari F1 team following a poor start to the 2014 Formula One season. The 48-year-old, who has led the Italian team since 2008, said in a statement on the Ferrari website Monday that the time had come for ""a significant change."" Ferrari is the sport's oldest and most successful team with 16 constructors' championships but the Maranello-based manufacturer has struggled in recent seasons and is currently lying fifth after three races of the 2014 with just 33 points and no podium finishes. ""There are special moments that come along in everyone's professional life, when one needs courage to take difficult and very agonising decisions,"" Domenicali said in a statement. ""It is time for a significant change. As the boss, I take responsibility, as I have always done, for our current situation. This decision has been taken with the aim of doing something to shake things up and for the good of this group of people that I feel very close to."" Domenicali went on to thank the team, fans and Ferrari president Luca Di Montezemolo ""for having always supported me."" In a separate statement, Di Montezemolo also expressed his gratitude to Domenicali for his dedication stretching over nearly a quarter of a century. ""I thank Stefano Domenicali, not only for his constant dedication and effort, but also for the great sense of responsibility he has shown, even today, in always putting the interests of Ferrari above all else,"" Di Montezemolo's statement said. ""I hold Domenicali in esteem and I have watched him grow professionally over the 23 years we have worked together, I now wish him every success for the future."" Marco Mattiacci, who is currently President and CEO of Ferrari North America, will replace Domenicali, Di Montezemolo said. After taking over from Jean Todt as team principal in 2008, Domenicali made a successful start to his reign winning the constructors title in his first season. The seasons since have been less happy. A fourth place in 2009 was followed by two third place finishes before they ran Red Bull a close second in 2012 before falling back into third place last season. Despite having former world champions Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso at the wheel, Ferrari have made little impact in the opening three races this year and continue to struggle with the new engine and chassis regulations. Alonso managed to finish fourth in the opening two races of the season but a new nadir was reached at the Bahrain Grand Prix earlier this month. While Mercedes' duo Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg were recording a second successive one-two finish, Alonso and Raikkonen were scrapping around for single-figure points, eventually finishing ninth and 10th respectfully. Ferrari's quest for a first podium of the season resumes at next Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix.","Italian steps down following Ferrari's disappointing start to 2014 F1 season .

"(CNN) -- Germany may be America's most important European ally, but the relationship between the two countries is on the rocks. On Thursday, Germany expelled a top CIA agent from Berlin, a highly unusual move for which the German government cited a ""lack of cooperation"" from the United States in clarifying recent spying cases. Those cases include revelation that the CIA tried to recruit a German secret service staffer to sell classified information, and the possibility that a German Defense Ministry employee had been working for U.S. intelligence. German policymakers and journalists are up in arms, with U.S. diplomats struggling to contain the political damage. In a recent poll, only 35% of Germans said the United States can be trusted. This is a stunning vote of no confidence amid continued public uproar about the NSA's tapping of Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. For those dedicated to the trans-Atlantic alliance, the current atmosphere is more depressing than during the height of the Iraq war, when Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and President George W. Bush made no secret of their antipathy. Long gone are times like when 200,000 Germans cheered for candidate Barack Obama as he spoke under Berlin's Victory Column in summer 2008. Gone, too, are Obama's 75% approval ratings among Germans. The United States has very few friends in Berlin these days. Even traditionally pro-American policy- and opinion-makers keep a low profile, and almost no one is prepared to publicly defend the United States. Many say they are fed up with America's explanations and excuses, and it is hard to blame them. In contrast, those in Germany who argue that the country should pursue an even course between the United States and Russia, instead of partnering with the United States, are in ""I told you so"" mode, saying that Americans are not worthy of a trusting relationship. Legitimate criticism of intelligence overreach is now solidifying into genuine anti-American sentiment, with deeply corrosive effects on bilateral ties. Germans are very sensitive about data protection. This is rooted in Stalinist and Nazi traditions of comprehensive surveillance and terror. But that's only part of the story. Many in the German business community are trying to protect their investments in Russia from U.S.-led sanctions. A new generation of Germans in their 20s and 30s know the United States only in its post-9/11 guise: Afghanistan, Iraq, surveillance, fingerprinting at the borders, spying on friendly nations and their leaders, renditions and targeted killings. It is not uncommon to hear young Germans ask: ""What makes the U.S. different from Russia or China?"" It is easy to dismiss such distorted perceptions, but they matter. America is increasingly seen as a paranoid society that cannot distinguish between friends and foes anymore. This perception is eroding America's standing in the world. As one Berlin policymaker suggested: ""The U.S. is digging its own grave with regard to its global leadership aspirations."" In addition, there is a widespread feeling among government officials, scholars and businessmen that the United States ""still doesn't get it"" and is not prepared to seriously discuss the rules of engagement when it comes to surveillance of close allies. We should not underestimate the damage this perception has already inflicted. During the Iraq war, many Germans rationalized their discontent with U.S. policy by separating the likes of George Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz -- bad apples in their minds -- from what they saw as the ""good Americans."" This time, German disappointment and anger is proportionate to the high expectations of the Obama era. Many just say that the United States cannot and should not be trusted anymore, and that any special relationship is gone for good. Germany has reacted this week partly from genuine anger and partly in response to public opinion. U.S. Ambassador John Emerson was summoned to the German Foreign Office just hours before the large annual Fourth of July reception at the American Embassy. It was ""nothing that we liked to do but it was necessary,"" said one German official. Members of the governing coalition are openly asking to expel U.S. intelligence personnel from Germany and order the BND (Germany's foreign intelligence agency) to cease all cooperation with U.S. services. Even German President Joachim Gauck, usually a measured man, could not resist making a populist ""enough is enough"" statement. The current turmoil is reversing modest gains that have been made by the Cyber Dialogue established by the White House with the German government in the wake of the National Security Agency revelations. The first meeting took place on June 26 in Berlin, ending a day before news broke that the CIA attempted to recruit a junior BND agent. So much for dialogue. For the United States, references to ongoing internal review will not cut it this time. As annoying as public debates in Germany might be to American leaders, the United States cannot afford to ignore them. The Germans require a serious conversation about national interest, the trans-Atlantic partnership, and intelligence gathering. This will be mutually beneficial, as it will force Germans to make up their mind as to what role they want to play and perhaps help the United States establish a true cost-benefit analysis of its intelligence activities.","Germany expelled a top CIA agent from Berlin in light of recent spying cases .

"(CNN) -- A Georgia couple accused of locking their 13-year-old son in a small basement room with nothing but a mattress, a box spring and a bucket for a toilet have turned themselves in, police said. Recardo and Therian Wimbush reported to authorities early Friday evening, Gwinnett County Police spokesman Cpl. Jake Smith said. They were in custody at the Gwinnett County Detention Center, according to Smith. Authorities had detailed the case against the Wimbushes a day earlier, indicating that they were expected to turn themselves in. State child protection workers went to the Wimbush home after receiving a tip and found the boy locked in an 8-by-6-foot room with no light bulb, books, toys or television, Smith said. The boy had been confined to the room about two years and locked inside since January 2013, according to the police spokesman. ""He was essentially being treated as a prisoner would be treated,"" Smith said Thursday, according to CNN affiliate WSB. ""The window had been painted over. There was no light bulb outside. What was inside was a bucket that the child was using as a bathroom, a mattress and box spring."" Police indicated that the parents kept the child in this state for ""disciplinary reasons."" Recardo Wimbush, 33, and 37-year-old Therian Wimbush -- both of Buford, Georgia -- have been charged with child cruelty and false imprisonment. Recardo Wimbush was a star football player at Georgia Tech from 1999 to 2002. A linebacker, he signed a contract with the Atlanta Falcons but was cut before the season started. The 13-year-old child and his nine siblings appeared to be in good health and showed no outward signs of physical abuse or malnutrition, Smith said. The parents would bring food downstairs to the boy when the rest of the family had meals, Smith said. The Georgia Division of Family and Child Services took the 10 children -- the youngest, 18 months -- into custody. The boy is the oldest. CNN reached out Thursday and earlier Friday to the Wimbushes. There was no response.","Police: Recardo and Therian Wimbush in custody .

"(CNN) -- Yesterday, Team USA lost to Belgium and is out of the running. But today, you'd think American goalkeeper Tim Howard actually won the World Cup on his own. Some 1,845,345 tweets heralded Howard's historic game -- 12 saves in regulation, a rare feat, and one that allowed American fans to focus on a winning performance while ignoring the understory: Belgium controlled the game from the beginning, and even the late goal by 19-year-old Julian Green could do little to change the writing that was on the wall. As the weary American team trudged past the 90 minute mark, Americans focused on the herculean effort by Howard, crowing that he had more saves than Jesus, starting a petition to rename Reagan National for Howard, and briefly appointing him Secretary of Defense on Wikipedia. To be sure, Howard's performance was one of legend, but the rapture over it, albeit well-deserved, seems to put on a Band-Aid on the one simple fact of the match: The United States lost. Again. In the World Cup. From the very beginning of its campaign, with its slogan of ""I believe that we will win!"" (a chant that began, appropriately enough, with U.S. Navy football) the United States seemed, well, relatively deluded that it could now contend with the world. On the upside? The campaign convinced millions upon millions of Americans to finally engage in the frenzy that absorbs the rest of the globe in the world's most popular sport. Downside? Rather than be shocked and grateful that that the U.S. men made it to the knockout round, many seemed to think that Belgium would be a small hurdle to American victory. The focus on winning, above all else, is likely the most important factor that has driven Americans to pay attention, finally, to the World Cup stages. But for 40 years -- 40 years -- the United States did not care about the Cup because the U.S. did not qualify. So America turned up its nose to soccer, disdaining it for generations. There are many reasons to think that America's disenchantment with the beautiful game is over -- obsessive interest in the first rounds of play is one of them. But what happens as the World Cup packs up and moves on? Will broken-hearted Americans still love soccer now? It is easy to link World Cup mania to the popularity of youth soccer in the United States. A 2007 FIFA study concluded that some 25 million American children play soccer, giving the U.S. the largest youth base of any country competing in Brazil right now. But after all, kids playing on a Saturday morning likely doesn't explain the seeming suddenness of American interest. And we didn't see this kind of interest back when the U.S. hosted the tournament back in 1994. We also didn't see it when the U.S. women won the whole thing in 1991 and 1999 (because, well, you know, women's sports and all). And we didn't see it when the U.S. men's national team reached the quarterfinals in 2002. So where did all of this frenzy come from? Answer: Americans hate being left behind. Americans prefer to lead, and until now, they have been the only ones missing this global party, one where the U.S. men have yet to build a winning reputation, something central to American identity. Indeed, some think the intense focus on Brazil has to do with this unfamiliar underdog status. Soccer has ""been a bit of a subculture for a while now,"" says Greg Lalas, a former Major League Soccer player and current editor-in-chief of MLS.com ""One that is incredibly vibrant, inclusive, and frankly, really fun. ... Who doesn't want to be part of that?"" It's a good point. Down side? ""There'll be no worse thing for American soccer than if we ultimately win a World Cup,"" says sportswriter Jeff Pearlman. ""When that happens, and when we're on equal footing with the elites, it all becomes dull."" For Lalas, though, the turning point has been that this World Cup ""opened the eyes of many of the decision makers in the media that this culture exists."" But it isn't just the gate-keepers. Social media has given the U.S. soccer nation subculture the space to crow from the rooftops their love of the game, and their enthusiasm has generated a contagion effect, building a collective excitement about soccer that's literally spilling into the streets. Remember that social media turned one of the worst things television has ever produced â€” ""Sharknado"" â€” into a revolutionary experience because viewers could complain, mock, and cheer all together. It's done the same for the World Cup, giving it the sense of camaraderie that sports fans need to unify around a team. Just think: Fans tweeted 15.9 million times during the first three U.S. matches. During the game against Germany, one of the most popular images throughout the Twittersphere was of companies who had brought in televisions and food so employees could watch. But don't get too excited. This may have not legs. That America caught World Cup fever doesn't tell us much about how soccer as a spectator sport will fare here, particularly in terms of the popularity of Major League Soccer or whether NBC's television audience for the Premier League will continue to grow. Sure, the United States has had diehard soccer fans of all kinds for some time now, but they aren't always rooting for those wearing the red, white, and blue. Mexico, eliminated by the Netherlands on Sunday, has traditionally been the most popular team in the United States, selling almost twice as many tickets to its ""friendly"" matches as the U.S. men's national team, which is relatively new by comparison. Many of the Americans in Brazil are there to support Latin American teams, representing communities like those who play at the Red Hook Ball Fields in Brooklyn, where league and pick-up games are accompanied by food trucks slinging the best pupusas, tamales, elote on a stick, arepa, and, of course, tacos. And it is still hard for some Americans to embrace a game that doesn't necessarily end when it is supposed to, and a tournament with groupings and strategies that mean a loss of yours is turned into a win because the team you tied the other day just beat someone else. Also, many sports fans may not have space to add soccer into their seasonal cycle of baseball, football, and so on. Thus, the appeal of the World Cup is not necessarily the game it features, as much as the lure of the United States finally sitting at the big table, qualifying regularly, and even winning a match or two. It is a situation somewhat akin to the Olympics, in which Americans become fascinated -- and sometimes fanatical --with curling and ice dancing and skeleton for the fortnight, but without question don't think about it again until the next one. So perhaps unless team USA's Clint Dempsey and John Brooks get into the next season of ""Dancing with the Stars,"" it might be four more years before America obsesses about them again.","Amy Bass: American so nuts about Tim Howard you'd think he won the World Cup himself .

"Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- The legal battle being fought by former Egypt president Hosni Mubarak under charges including being complicit in the killing of protestors will sustain a climate of uncertainty for the country's president Mohamed Morsy. The Middle East's most populous country is struggling to stabilize 27 months after the uprising that toppled Mubarak. The economic squeeze is on. Unemployment and the budget deficit are in the double digits. In this climate, it is nearly impossible for the relatively new president to sign on to cuts in fuel and food subsidies called for in International Monetary Fund negotiations over a bailout. Those negotiations have lasted nearly a year and the two parties put out a joint statement after talks during the IMF-World Bank spring meetings this weekend. ""The authorities are firmly committed to addressing Egypt's economic and financial challenges with the objective of restoring sustained and socially-balanced growth, and they are already taking encouraging actions in this direction,"" they said, after bi-lateral discussions. But one could read that as holding tactic, allowing the Morsy administration to buy more time. Cairo has some breathing room thanks to a cash injection by Qatar, which recently signed over $3 billion in emergency funding. Other money from the oil rich Gulf States have been either pledged or delivered by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Foreign investors like to tick boxes on their check list when sizing up opportunities or measuring risks. That list usually includes: A consistent legal system; rule of law covering foreign investment, ample foreign exchange reserves and a stable currency; a sizable market with better than average economic growth. Egypt has one tick: It's a big market with nearly 90 million consumers. Other items on the list, which both investors and ratings agencies want, are not in place. After three decades as an underground opposition movement under the banner of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Freedom and Justice party is finding it difficult to govern. CNN iReport: 'Oceans of garbage' The army commander of armed forces Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has suggested the country's instability could collapse the state. President Morsy then suggested this may eventually require the implementation of extraordinary measures to maintain control. During a recent interview in Abu Dhabi, opposition leader and Nobel Laureate Mohamed ElBaradei told me: ""Everybody wants to protect the nation, not only Mr Morsy."" He then added: ""But the solution is not a military one, not a security one, it is a political one."" ElBaradei is urging a post-Apartheid type commission for reconciliation which would help ""unite political Islam with the rest of the country."" This, he believes, will help pave the way for economic stability. A month ago, when Moody's cut Egypt sovereign credit rating for a sixth time, the agency said there was a 40% chance of default in the next five years. Foreign reserves have tumbled over 60% in two years and provide a financial cushion of just three months. That is where the IMF loan of $4.8 billion comes into play. If an agreement can be reached by June, as some are suggesting, then another $10 billion from the European Union and regional donors could be unlocked. In the meantime, uncertainty brought on by the court cases of the former president and the political challenges against the current one may well keep global investors at bay.","Egypt's climate of uncertainty is making leadership difficult for president Mohamed Morsy .
Negotiations over a bailout from the IMF have already lasted a year, and are in a holding pattern .
Investors and ratings agencies want Egypt to deliver more stability, but the country is still struggling .
Charges against the former president and political challenges against Morsy are problematic ."
"(CNN) -- Ten years ago this week, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell declared that genocide had been committed in Darfur and that the government of Sudan and the janjaweed bore responsibility for those acts. Even though it did not actually trigger a legal obligation to act, many hoped that using the ""g word"" meant that the United States was crossing the Rubicon and committing itself to stopping the violence in Darfur, Sudan's most troubled region. The janjaweed, however, are still at large in Darfur -- and with the Sudanese government's help, they are now arguably more powerful than ever. It is this reality that makes it so disturbing that the United Nations recently declared that getting weapons out of this militant group's hands is no longer ""relevant"" to their work. After all, janjaweed fighters formed the backbone of the genocidal attack forces that the Sudanese government unleashed on Darfur 11 years ago. When the spotlight finally fell on the ethnically motivated killing in the region, it was clear that these men committed some of the very worst crimes against humanity. The looming specter of their attacks kept displaced Darfuri refugees trapped in camps and, as long as the janjaweed were at large, their victims would not be able to go home. In recognition of this reality, the U.N. Security Council ordered the Sudanese government to take steps to disarm the janjaweed, but it did little toward this goal. Fast forward to last month, and the Security Council voted to keep peacekeepers in Darfur for another 10 months. At a time when budgets are already stretched, the vote was hailed as a final lease of life for the mission, which has been accused of covering up its failure to protect Darfuri civilians. But buried among small technical tweaks to the mandate's language, the Security Council made a huge concession to the government of Sudan by deeming aspects of the peacekeepers' work -- including monitoring, verifying, and promoting efforts to disarm the militias -- ""no longer relevant."" Why has this happened? Some have argued that any attempt to disarm the janjaweed was doomed to fail because, in practice, taking away their weapons would also mean taking weapons away from Darfur's powerful Arab tribes. Others said that it was hard to know who exactly the ""janjaweed"" were. But with its latest resolution, the United Nations seems to be saying, in effect, the janjaweed are no longer of concern. The facts on the ground show just the opposite. Today, the same brutal forces that carried out those crimes remain the primary threat to civilian security in Darfur. Indeed, the janjaweed have been openly embraced by the government of Sudan. And despite for years denying it had any connection to the fighters marauding across Darfur, the government has, under the banner of the Rapid Support Forces, allegedly welcomed many of these brutal fighters back to the scene of their old crimes, in uniform and newly armed and equipped. Already this year, the Rapid Support Forces have reportedly been in Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile, where they have been accused of burning civilian areas to the ground, raping women, and displacing non-Arab civilians from their homes. In exchange, the Sudanese government has showered these janjaweed reincarnate with praise and rewards. By giving these forces a new name and official status, the Sudanese government seems to have convinced the Security Council that Darfuris are no longer living under the threat of janjaweed attacks. Just as bad, the United Nations seems reluctant to even use the word janjaweed, at least according to Aicha el Basri, a former spokeswoman for the operation, who wrote in Foreign Policy that ""since the deployment of UNAMID in 2008, only one mention of the word janjaweed has appeared in the more than 30 reports that [the UN] has issued on Darfur."" In declaring that efforts to disarm these fighters are no longer relevant, the United Nations effectively endorsed the Sudanese government's flimsy claim that things in Darfur are getting better. Meanwhile, the killing continues.","Ten years ago this week, Colin Powell declared that genocide had been committed in Darfur .

"(CNN) -- The FBI is investigating letters containing a white powder that were mailed to at least seven federal offices in the states of Washington and Idaho, FBI representatives said Monday. ""We are involved,"" the FBI's Fred Gutt said in Seattle, Washington, adding that agents were ""still on the scene of all of them."" Gutt said letters had been received at the downtown federal building in Seattle, the FBI office at the Rockpointe Building in Spokane, and IRS offices in Bellevue. FBI spokeswoman Debbie Dujanovic Bertram in Salt Lake City, Utah, said similar letters had been found in Idaho at the U.S. attorney's office and the FBI office in Coeur d'Alene, at the FBI office in Pocatello and the U.S. Attorney's office in Boise. Bertram said field tests indicated the substances were not toxic, but samples were sent back to labs for further testing. In Bellevue, the four-story IRS building was evacuated when an employee opened a letter and the white powder ""poofed out,"" Bellevue Police spokeswoman Carla Iafrate said. The building will remain empty until authorities identify the powder, she said. A state laboratory will conduct those tests, she said. In Boise, the police department issued a statement saying the powder was found in an envelope mailed to the U.S. attorney's office. The Boise Fire Department evacuated only that office in the building, and allowed the employees back in when tests determined the substance was not a threat.","NEW: At least seven buildings received letters with white powder, FBI says .

"Myrtle Beach, South Carolina (CNN) -- Republican candidate Jon Huntsman will drop out of the presidential race on Monday and endorse front-runner Mitt Romney, a senior official with the former Utah governor's campaign told CNN. Huntsman finished third in last week's New Hampshire primary, a state in which he had staked his entire campaign, behind Romney and Texas Rep. Ron Paul. ""Governor Huntsman did not want to stand in the way of the candidate best prepared to beat Barack Obama and turn our economy around. That's Mitt Romney,"" the official said. The former governor and U.S. ambassador to China made headlines when he decided to take his campaign to compete in the South Carolina primary, where he struggled to build support. An American Research Group poll released Friday showed Huntsman with just 1% of likely GOP primary voters in the state. ""Jon Huntsman made a basic calculation here, let's be honest. If you look at the polling, he's doing miserable in South Carolina. He's not going to win the state next Saturday and so if he wants to run in 2016 ... this is a chance ... to try to get a little bit of goodwill in the party, a little bit of leverage,"" said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King. Despite his low polling numbers, South Carolina's largest newspaper, The State, endorsed Huntsman earlier on Sunday. The paper's editorial board stated that while Romney is ""more appealing"" than the rest of the GOP field, Huntsman is ""more principled, has a far more impressive resume and offers a significantly more important message."" The board praised what it called the ""essential values that drive his candidacy: honor and old-fashioned decency and pragmatism."" R.C. Hammond, the spokesman for candidate Newt Gingrich, said that with Huntsman dropping out, ""we are one step closer to a bold Reagan conservative winning the GOP nomination."" Huntsman, known as one of the moderate candidates, launched his presidential campaign on June 21. Meanwhile, conservative GOP presidential hopefuls attacked Romney on Sunday to try to head off what two influential Republicans said could be a decisive third straight victory for the former Massachusetts governor. In appearances on morning talk shows, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Rick Perry all contrasted their conservative credentials with Romney's more moderate record in hopes that South Carolina voters will agree with their contention that Romney can't defeat Obama in November. Debates on Monday in Myrtle Beach and Thursday in Charleston will almost certainly give voters their last chance to see all the remaining Republican candidates on one stage, as some are likely to drop out after Saturday's vote. CNN will broadcast the Charleston debate. The Palmetto State has chosen the eventual Republican nominee every time since 1980, and Romney's victories this month in the first two contests of the nominating process -- in Iowa and New Hampshire -- were unprecedented by a non-incumbent GOP contender. Two South Carolina Republican politicians, Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. Tim Scott, said Sunday that another Romney victory this week would likely sew up the nomination for him. ""If for some reason he's not derailed here and Mitt Romney wins South Carolina, no one's ever won all three, I think it should be over,"" Graham told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program. ""That would be quite a testament to his ability as a candidate and a campaigner."" On the same program, Scott said: ""If Romney wins South Carolina, I think the game is over."" Perry, the Texas governor who lags behind after poor performances in earlier debates, kept up his criticism of Romney's experience as a venture capitalist -- an attack line shared by Gingrich but criticized by Santorum and other conservatives. After previously describing Romney's former company, Bain Capital, as corporate ""vultures"" who looted North Carolina companies, Perry used less combative language Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union"" but reiterated his accusation that it ""came in and basically shut down"" a Georgetown steel mill, taking away ""a lot of money in management fees."" President Obama's campaign will certainly raise the matter, if Romney gets the Republican nomination, Perry noted. ""The issue's not going away,"" he said. ""Now's the time to talk about it, not in September and October."" Gingrich, the former House Speaker, expressed a similar view on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and the CBS program ""Face the Nation,"" comparing the primary process to the National Football League playoffs that eventually produce two hardened teams to compete in the Super Bowl. ""Our nominee had better be capable of standing up there, telling the truth, enduring the negative ads and winning the vote,"" Gingrich said, insisting he is the more accomplished debater and stronger candidate than Romney. On NBC, Gingrich also said he would release his tax return on Thursday and reiterated his challenge for Romney to do the same, continuing a campaign to get Romney to disclose details of his personal wealth. Romney has said he has complied with legal disclosure obligations, but added he might release his tax returns or further information in the future. Gingrich said it would be better for Romney to release his tax return now instead of having the issue come to a head in the fall amid a one-on-one campaign against Obama. ""We're all going to do everything we can to defeat Barack Obama,"" Gingrich said, adding that Obama's re-election ""would lead him to be so arrogant and so aggressive that it's hard to imagine what would come out of a second term."" Santorum, meanwhile, told ""Fox News Sunday"" that an endorsement on Saturday from Christian conservative leaders should help his campaign, as he seeks to regain the luster of a razor-thin second-place finish behind Romney in Iowa. ""I was told that individual members are going to go out and do things with, you know, either endorsements or contacting people here in the state and across the states to support us and to help our cause,"" said Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator who was virtually tied for fourth in New Hampshire with Gingrich. The Christian conservative endorsement was intended to unite evangelical voters behind one candidate to avoid a split that would hand Romney a victory despite South Carolina's conservative pedigree. ""It would be helpful if everybody dropped out and I would win,"" Santorum said. ""But, you know, the idea is, we're going to go through this process, people have the right to go out and make the case to the voters and then we'll see what happens."" Scott, who won election in 2010 with strong support from the tea party movement, told NBC that the impact of the evangelical vote -- a typically large bloc in South Carolina -- will be ""huge"" on Saturday. ""It's hard to find a single candidate that rallies all of the Christian voters in South Carolina and therefore that splintered approach will probably have a major impact in the state's primary,"" Scott said. The American Research Group poll released last week finds Romney and Gingrich in a statistical dead heat in the state. According to the poll, 29% of likely GOP primary voters say they will support Romney. Another 25% said they would support Gingrich, putting Romney's lead within the poll's sampling error. The survey indicates Rep. Ron Paul of Texas has 20% of the vote, Perry has 9%, Santorum has 7%, with 7% undecided. CNN's Rachel Streitfeld, Jessica Yellin, Jim Acosta and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: He didn't want to ""stand in the way"" of candidate who can beat Obama, official says .

"(CNN) -- I am proud to be English. I am also proud to be British. In fact I define myself as a British European. This means I am happy to support England in football matches, support Team GB at the Olympic Games and support Europe in the Ryder Cup golf tournament. When you write this all down, it looks a little complicated, but in practice millions of people do this every year in the UK with no problem -- some supporting in the way I do, some supporting Scotland, others Wales, and so on. I love the vibrant, tolerant, diverse, confident, nation that the UK now is. In so many places I travel to in the world, people are struggling to find a way of working together, but we've developed this character and human skill over three centuries in our United Kingdom: It is a precious thing and worth standing up for. With just days to go, on September 18, Scotland will vote on whether it wants to stay in the United Kingdom family or leave to form a separate country. It's a huge decision, especially for those in Scotland but also for everyone in the rest of the UK. Whatever the result of the referendum, it will have a resounding impact on all of us -- how we see ourselves, our culture and our future. I feel it would be for more positive for Scotland to remain an important and integral part of the UK and I wanted to say so publicly. That's why I am happy to support the ""Let's Stay Together"" campaign to say to everyone in Scotland just how much we do appreciate them being part of the UK family. The campaign brings together a wide and diverse group of people from all walks of life -- both famous and not -- to show Scotland just how much we do care. The UK would feel a deep sense of loss if Scotland left Great Britain. You could ask, why should an English person have any views on this? Well as a member of the United Kingdom, I feel I have the viewpoint of a fellow UK family member. Also, I have performed in most major towns and cities across Scotland and I ran eight marathons through Scotland holding the Saltire, the flag of Scotland. And it's not just me. There are millions of people in the United Kingdom who feel like this, who care about Scotland and want it to remain within the union, but whose voices haven't been heard. Of course, I fundamentally believe in the right of those in Scotland to determine their own future and will fully respect the decision, whichever way the vote goes. But it's also true that everyone else in the UK will also find big changes in their lives, and I think it's important that we think about our combined goals and future. To my thinking, Scotland can have the best of both worlds: It can have its own parliament, its own strong voice and its own cultural identity. And at the same time it can also have the strength, the security and the stability of being within the UK. At the 2012 Olympics, the whole of the Great Britain team was fighting so hard to win medals and had such a positive spirit. It was beautiful. If Scotland leaves, we'll never have that again. There are very strong economic reasons for staying together, but there is something even deeper that binds England and Scotland. It's like a beautiful and long-lasting relationship. We've overcome a lot to get where we are, we do care about each other despite our tiffs, and I believe the future is much better with us working together. We do amazing things when we're together and I ask anyone who feels the same to visit letsstaytogether.org.uk. WATCH: Brian Cox and Rory Stewart debate independence .

"(CNN) -- The Atlanta Hawks organization's issues with race go beyond one inflammatory email or offensive comments on one conference call, the team's CEO said, before promising fans that those systemic problems will be corrected. ""As an organization, we must own these shortcomings and failures,"" Steve Koonin wrote in an open letter Saturday to his team, fans and the city of Atlanta. ""... We should build bridges through basketball, not divide our community or serve as a source of pain."" Koonin's comments come a day after general manager Danny Ferry began an indefinite leave of absence tied to controversial comments he made in June about Luol Deng, then a prospective free agent player. And they occurred six days after the franchise's owner, Bruce Levenson, announced he would sell his controlling interest team in light of a 2012 email that many derided as racist. In the same announcement last Sunday setting the stage for Levenson's exit, the NBA said that Koonin will oversee team operations during the ownership transition. The Hawks CEO did not mention Levenson or Ferry specifically in his letter Saturday, nor did he delve into detail into their or possible other cases. But he did say that ""we enough today, based on investigations conducted by the league, by external legal counsel on behalf of the team and information that has appeared in the media, that our shortcomings are beyond a single email, a single person or a single event. ""To the contrary, over a period of years, we have found that there have been inflammatory words, phrases, inferences and innuendos about race,"" Koonin said. ""We as an organization did not correct these failures. We did not do the right thing."" Koonin then laid out four key steps aimed at addressing the issue: . Koonin ended his letter with an appeal to rally around the team's players, rather than abandon them out of frustration. ""We ask our fans to continue to support our players as we all learn through this process -- we should not punish them,"" he said. ""We aim to win as a collective team both on and off the court."" CEO: Incidents 'put a blemish on our team and our city' The issue of race, and the prospect of alienating African-Americans, takes on added significance in Atlanta, given its history and makeup. The home of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders, Atlanta was one of the few large Southern cities not to see major race-related disruptions during the 1960s as it earned the reputation as ""the city too busy to hate."" Today, Atlanta is led by a black mayor in Kasim Reed and its population is 54% African-American, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. All but a handful of players on the Hawks roster are black. In the 2012 email to Ferry that led to his giving up the team, Levenson estimated African-Americans made up 70% of those attending Hawks games and 90% of those in the Philips Arena bars. He said, too, that the team's cheerleaders were black and hip-hop, rap and gospel music was likely to be heard in the arena. ""Then i start looking around at other arenas. It is completely different. Even (Washington) DC with its affluent black community never has more than a 15 pct black audience,"" Levenson wrote. The Hawks' controlling owner then offered his thoughts on why more whites didn't attend games: ""My theory is that the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a significant season ticket base. ""I never felt uncomfortable, but i think southern whites simply were not comfortable being in an arena or at a bar where they were in the minority."" Levenson then outlined steps to take, like asking for more ""music familiar to a 40 year old white guy"" and that camera shots and ""the kiss cam"" don't focus as much on black fans. He said changes had shifted the crowd makeup, by his estimates, to 40% African-American as of 2012. Still, Levenson insisted that African-Americans' lack of ""spendable income"" and whites being uncomfortable in an arena with many blacks was still ""far and away the number one reason our season ticket base is so low."" Hawks owner to sell team after racially charged email . The comments that led to Ferry's going on leave weren't directed at African-American fans, but one black player in particular -- former Chicago Bulls and current Miami Heat forward Luol Deng. In a June conference call discussing free agent options, Ferry said that Deng (who was born in South Sudan) was ""not perfect. He's got some African in him,"" according to audio obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He also characterizes Deng as ""a two-faced liar and cheat"" who is ""like a guy who would have a nice store out front but sell you counterfeit stuff out of the back.,"" according to a letter about the comments to Levenson written by J. Michael Gearon Jr., a minority owner of the Hawks. Ferry has apologized, saying he was ""repeating"" words prepared by others. The audio of the call and a copy of the scouting report shows similarities, though Ferry did not read word-for-word from the report. Hawks GM on leave over controversial comments . Koonin, in his letter Saturday, acknowledged that these and other, similar examples aren't acceptable, especially in Atlanta.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- In a New Delhi neighborhood, residents line up in the blistering 45 degree Celsius heat (113 Fahrenheit) carrying empty jerry cans and water bottles, waiting for the government water tanker truck to arrive. 'We only get water once a week and each time we have to fight for it,"" one woman yells. There are no laid pipelines in unplanned areas like this, so tanker trucks are their only source of water. With the truck arrives chaos. Some climb to the top of the tanker truck, reaching out for the pipes. Others jostle and argue below, trying to collect every drop. Minor scuffles ensue. Many have been waiting for hours for their weekly supply and they are visibly angry. Every household in this neighborhood is allowed only four jerry cans each. ""With so little water, we don't know if we should drink it, cook with it, or bathe with it,"" one woman says. Water shortages are a perennial problem in much of India, but this summer the country's newly elected government is facing extra heat over water. Some 150 million Indians have no access to clean water, according to government data. Finding a long term solution will take time, but for now the Delhi government has finalized plans to set up 500 ""water ATMs"" across the city. The tall cylindrical concrete structures hold solar powered machines that look and function like an ATM. Instead of cash, they dispense water. The innovative idea was initiated by an Indian social enterprise called Sarvajal -- meaning water for all. Since the pilot project was launched in late 2013, Sarvajal has installed 15 water ATM's in a New Delhi re-settlement colony called Sarva Ghera. For one cent, one can draw up to four liters of water. That's cheap even by Indian standards. Though response has been slow, the thousand odd families who use the services say it has made a significant difference to their lives. ""There's no more tension now,"" says Bhagwati, a Sarva Ghera resident. ""Now we can get water whenever we feel like it."" Before these so-called water ATM's, she too had to wake up every morning worrying about where to find water. Her whole day revolved around the water tanker truck's schedule. Now with her rechargeable smartcard, Bhagwati can access clean drinking water 24/7. Ground water is purified at localized plants, and distributed through these solar powered ATMs. Sarvajal's project manager Amit Mishra says incidents of water-borne diseases have decreased in this neighborhood since the project was launched. But India's poor have yet to realize that paying for clean water can save much more in health care costs later. The biggest challenge is that everyone expects everything for free, Mishra said. Mishra and his team have held countless meetings with the community to make them understand the difference in water quality and why clean water is worth paying for. The change in mindset may take some time, but this simple but high tech idea may be the solution in a country with ever increasing thirst for clean water.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Federal authorities on Friday arrested a man on a weapons charge as he was being released from a Los Angeles County jail a day after he pleaded guilty in the 2011 brutal beating of a Giants fan at Dodgers Stadium and received credit for time served. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives took Marvin Norwood, 33, into custody Friday morning on a federal weapons charge as the Los Angeles County sheriff released him. Norwood was sentenced Thursday to four years in prison immediately after pleading guilty to felony assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury. He was released Friday with credit for having been held in jail in the case for more than two years. A co-defendant, Louie Sanchez, 31, also pleaded guilty Thursday to felony mayhem and was sentenced to eight years in prison. In exchange for the guilty pleas, prosecutors dropped other felony charges. Prosecutors say the two men attacked Bryan Stow in the Dodgers' stadium parking lot after the opening day game on March 31, 2011, when the team played the San Francisco Giants. Stow is a Giants fan. Stow, a paramedic from Santa Cruz, California, went into a coma as a result of the beating and, after returning to consciousness, is still struggling with a severe brain injury. Stow, now 45, is disabled and unable to care for himself, his father, David, told the court Thursday. Stow is also a father of two. Norwood faces a charge of being a felon in possession of firearms, and the charge relates to firearms that authorities allegedly found in Norwood's home in Rialto, California, during their investigation into Stow's beating, according to a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles and to an FBI affidavit. Sanchez also faces the same federal charge, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for federal prosecutors in Los Angeles.","Marvin Norwood, 33, faces a federal charge of being a felon in possession of firearms .

"(CNN) -- Police call the relationship ""toxic."" If the details of the police report are accurate, folks won't need much convincing. Bear the Pomeranian disappeared in early August after the dog's owner and her then-boyfriend Ryan Eddy Watenpaugh had an argument. The woman fled her apartment after she was physically assaulted by Watenpaugh, she told police in Redding, California. When she returned, Bear was gone. The couple, which police say had a tumultuous dating relationship that included the woman being held against her will, briefly reconciled the first week in September. Watenpaugh, 35, cooked her a meal that included meat. Then the text messages began. ""How's your dog taste? I thought it was better with BBQ and those Hawaiian buns."" ""I guess u could bury what u didn't eat."" ""The smile on my face when you read this ... priceless,"" CNN affiliate KRCR reported. Then early Tuesday, Watenpaugh showed up at the woman's house and left a small bag by her front door, police say. Inside was a note and two dog paws. ""Burn in hell,"" the note says. ""I hate you so much it hurts. Stay away from me. I want nothing to do with you. F--- you."" At the bottom of the note: a smiley face. Redding police arrested him two days later. They say he's admitted to sending the messages and placing the dog paws at the woman's residence, but has denied killing or cooking Bear. ""You know this is extremely strange,"" Redding Sgt. Todd Cogle told KRCR. ""Unusual, something we had never seen before."" Watenpaugh has been charged with domestic violence, false imprisonment, stalking and animal cruelty. He's being held on $250,000 bail in the Shasta County jail. Man killed, planned to eat girlfriend's dog, police say .

"Washington (CNN) -- Russia is preparing the transfer of more powerful weaponry into Ukraine, and it could happen at any time, a Pentagon spokesman said Friday, citing the latest U.S. intelligence. The transfer could be ""imminent,"" the spokesman, Col. Steve Warren, told reporters. It's believed the weaponry will be driven into Ukraine ""potentially today,"" he said, but it is not clear if Russian troops will be involved. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf also warned of the possibility Thursday, telling reporters, ""We have new evidence that the Russians intend to deliver heavier and more powerful multiple rocket launchers to the separatist forces in Ukraine and have evidence that Russia is firing artillery from within Russia to attack Ukrainian military positions."" The United States has imagery showing weaponry, with burn marks in the grass, on the Russian side of the border, indicating that artillery was fired, a U.S. official tells CNN. The images remain classified and were not shared with CNN. How rebels in Ukraine built up an arsenal capable of reaching the skies . The Russian military has more powerful rocket launcher systems than the ones that have been sent across the border in the past. Intelligence indicates just under a dozen systems may be part of this latest shipment, according to a U.S. official. Everything Russia is doing, Warren said, is ""unquestionably an escalation."" Earlier Friday, the European Union stepped up pressure against Russians and others it blames for fomenting the crisis in Ukraine, banning visas and freezing the assets of 15 more people and 18 more companies and organizations. Things to know about Russia and sanctions . The EU's move, which aims to punish those supporting a months-long pro-Russian rebellion in eastern Ukraine, comes as international pressure was stepped up on the rebels in a related issue: the discovery and return of more victims' remains from last week's crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in rebel-held territory. Details about who was sanctioned Friday weren't immediately available. But the EU and the United States previously have targeted Russians and Ukrainians they say have assisted the rebellion and Russia's annexation in March of the Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula of Crimea -- such as Vladimir Shamanov, commander of Russian airborne troops. The move brings the total number of EU sanctions in the Ukraine crisis to 87, and the number of entities to 20. The EU on Friday also widened its criteria for future sanctions, saying it would now look to punish not only those who are aiding the rebellion, but also those benefiting ""from Russian decision makers responsible"" for it.

"(CNN) -- Go to any provincial city in China -- small hayseed towns where the population barely nudges three million people -- and you'd be forgiven for thinking the national youth pastimes, after smoking, are online gaming and flirting. ""I like the personality tests and I like chatting with people, but I haven't been brave enough to meet anyone yet,"" says Nolan Lee from Guiyang in China's central Guizhou province. The 20-year-old student says she uses social media more than she cares to admit. ""I still use [microblogging website] Weibo for a lot of things but new things like Pengpeng come up all the time -- this one is pretty good actually. If I shake my mobile, it finds new people for me to meet and to compete with. ""I like the fact that it uses traditional Chinese games like truth or dare -- you can think up things that will be funny or embarrass the other person. It's fun."" Launched in June, Pengpeng is a new mobile phone app that combines games and online chat. The Beijing-based start-up launched with $4.2 million in seed funding and since then has gone from strength to strength. Even outside China, it has proved sticky, recently hitting the number two position in Malaysia. For Andy Tian, the brains behind Pengpeng, elbowing a space into China's crowded and ferociously competitive social networking space requires financial backing but, more than this, it demands a keen eye for how young subscribers are using the net. ""We have four million users which makes it one of the fastest growing mobile apps in China,"" Tian told CNN. ""More than 90% of the users were born after 1990 so they're below the age of 24. ""These people are the most active on social networks in China."" Throwing a good party . Pengpeng uses location-based technology that allows users to meet strangers through playing games. As well as the usual Facebook-style feed and group chat, the app hosts quizzes, competitive games, horoscopes and the staple of teenagers everywhere on the net: personality tests. ""A lot of social networks out there enable you to meet someone and just start chatting [and] sharing pictures,"" said Tian. ""That's great but the next generation should be able to interact in a much more fun way."" Tian likens Pengpeng to throwing a good party. ""We see mobile social apps as something like an amusement park -- you come and you're always playing with other people; you meet them in a 'no pressure' way,"" he says. ""If you throw a party with good music, good drinks and good food, if you have a good theme -- maybe it's 1920s and everyone wears a Fedora hat -- then everyone has a good time. ""But if you throw a singles' party just to find the member of the opposite sex of your dreams, then it's not going to be very much fun. ""We are creating all the amusements -- all the food and the drink -- and marrying it to a social platform. It might seem to be pretty obvious but no one has thought of it before."" Strong growth . While Facebook still dominates the social media landscape globally with 1.32 billion monthly active users (MAU), its Chinese rivals are starting to close the gap. Qzone, which runs the massively popular QQ instant messaging service, is second on the list with 645 million MAU. Other Chinese sites such as Wechat, or Weixin as it is known in Chinese, have gained as many as 438 million MAU in a short few years, stealing a march in terms of numbers on sites like Twitter. Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have been locked out of the Chinese market since 2009, leaving the field open to homegrown social media sites such as Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo. While some say the ban is motivated by a need to censor the web in China, most analysts believe that protectionism for its own domestic versions of YouTube - namely Tudou and Youku - has been behind the move. Nevertheless, the progress of Chinese social media is keenly monitored in the West where companies such as Facebook and Google hope to one day re-enter the market. ""Pengpeng is just one of many of these new startups -- but these are up against very big companies. They're only getting a small slice of the pie,"" says analyst Xiaofeng Wang of Forrester. ""The most popular social platform used to be Weibo -- which combines elements of Facebook and Twitter -- but mobile messaging apps are now the most popular apps like Wechat from Tencent."" But she says the growth of anonymous social networking platforms are now the latest development in China -- not unsurprising in the light of the strict controls the government places on online debates. ""Sites such as UMi and Mimi are gaining more and more users -- it won't become mainstream however,"" Wang says. ""When it's anonymous, users are more willing to share information. Users may have nicknames, but behind those nicknames are real social connections, friends and colleagues."" Fittingly, UMi literally translates as ""no secrets"" while Mimi means ""secrets"". As for Pengpeng, users are as anonymous or as open as they want to be. ""So far, I haven't been bothered to meet anyone off any of the games,"" says Lee. ""But who knows, one day I might put on some make up and a nice dress,"" she jokes.","Pengpeng uses location-based technology to allow users to meet strangers through playing games .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The cabbie probably thought nothing of it when the young couple left their large hard-sided suitcase in the trunk of his car and went back into the five-star hotel. They said they needed to find the other person they were with and to pay their bill. But after a lengthy wait, the young man and woman still hadn't returned. Puzzled, the driver called hotel security. The suitcase in the trunk looked very odd. It was wrapped in a bedsheet. Then the cabbie saw blood. When authorities at the South Kuta station in Bali, Indonesia, opened the case, they found inside the badly beaten body of Sheila von Weise Mack, wrapped in a blood-stained bedsheet. Two smaller suitcases were found in the St. Regis Bali Resort garden. Both contained hotel towels with blood on them, according to police. Those are the events that police say unfolded Tuesday. Mack, 62, of Chicago, had been staying at the posh St. Regis with her daughter, Heather Mack, and the daughter's boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer. The daughter and her boyfriend were found Wednesday morning at another hotel about 15 kilometers (9 miles) away. The couple's St. Regis room was ""very messy,"" with clothes still inside. The couple told police they had been taken captive at the resort by an armed gang, whose members killed Sheila von Weise Mack, but they escaped, CNN affiliate Trans TV reported. Djoko Hari Utomo, police chief of Denpasar, the capital of Bali, said Thursday that the pair have been declared suspects in the case. According to Indonesian law, police can keep suspects in custody for up to 20 days. Djoko said that police hadn't found anything on surveillance camera footage from the hotel that supported the claim of an attack by an armed gang. He said the footage showed the mother and daughter arguing near the hotel's front desk on Tuesday. A lawyer appointed for the couple told Reuters that Heather Mack didn't want to comment on the incident. She repeatedly asked for a lawyer from the United States, he said. Djoko said Thursday he was looking into whether it was possible under Indonesian law to meet that request. The two suspects will be questioned separately, he said. Police also plan to carry out psychological assessments of the couple. U.S. officials will offer consular guidance to the two Americans. A doctor who examined the body said that judging by the bruises and other wounds, Mack was struck on the face and other parts of her head with a blunt object. She also had a gash on her forehead. Dr. Ida Bagus Putu Alit told CNN that there was evidence -- a broken fingernail and bruises on both wrists -- of an apparent struggle. A spokesman for the St. Regis, where rooms go for $500 to $8,200 a night, said the hotel staff is ""deeply saddened"" by the incident and is doing all it can to assist investigators. A profile of Mack published by The Caxton Club of Chicago (PDF) says she worked for Edward M. ""Ted"" Kennedy, the late U.S. senator from Massachusetts, and studied with Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Saul Bellow for 10 years. For years, the Macks lived in the affluent suburb of Oak Park, Illinois. An Oak Park police spokesman said a quick check showed officers had gone to the family's home 86 times between 2004 and 2013. The calls were for a variety of reasons including domestic trouble, missing persons reports and followups to 911 hangups, David Powers said. There were no records that anyone was arrested, he added. A man who said he was the Macks' neighbor told the CNN affiliate WGN that Sheila von Weise Mack moved last year in hopes it would help improve family relations and for her to be closer to the arts. ""She was very much involved in the arts so you would see her at concerts, you'd see her at lectures,"" Allen Parchem told the station. ""I knew that she had a very active arts life downtown too, attending events, so with the move to downtown I think she was hoping to be even more a part of that scene."" A friend of the family described her as warm and thoughtful. Mark Bacharach, who had known her for 27 years, said she ""did not have a condescending, malicious bone in her body."" Bacharach said mother and daughter had a tumultuous relationship. ""(Heather) could be extremely charming to guests, but mean to her mother,"" he said. Sheila von Weise Mack's husband, James, was a well-known figure in the Chicago music scene, having worked on dozens of albums. The Chicago Tribune reported he died of a pulmonary embolism in Athens, Greece, during a family vacation in 2006. Toronto police: Floating suitcase had human remains .

"(CNN) -- Do you suffer from FOMO (otherwise known as ""fear of missing out"")? Does the idea that some infinitely intriguing person/place/thing is currently flitting through your general sphere of being -- WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE -- cause your heart to constrict with terror? Well, friends, we hear you. Having just returned from the liquor- (and other liquid-) soaked climes of Austin and SXSW, we're pretty sure we only experienced about 1.3% of all ""Cool Things"" present at that havoc-wrecked fest. Basically, all we gathered was that people really like Skrillex, and, mysteriously, Train (thanks Monstro!) and that the most-flogged apps at SXSW Interactive were undoubtedly those who aim to kill FOMO dead. Enter: Sonar, Highlight and Banjo, a new wave of social apps designed to keep you abreast of all the interesting people around you -- without requiring that you look up from your smartphone (my Precious...)! These apps were, by far, among the most buzzed-about at SXSW, with Highlight taking the coveted top spot (according to Mashable). Charts and graphs aside, it remains to be seen whether Highlight will be able to assume the many-storied role of ""The Next Twitter"" or ""The Next Foursquare,"" both of which gained traction at Nerd Spring Break. That's partly because it and these other apps run in the background on your phone, with always-on GPS that drain your battery. But it's mostly because the word ""creepy"" keeps coming up in the same sentence when people talk about this new cadre of mobile apps. Still, don't let that silly little adjective scare you off! Because if you don't download these apps, you'll be missing out! And you don't want that, do you? Do you?! We didn't think so. That's why we've provided a handy scale for you below, which should be instrumental in finding the level of ""Creepy"" you FOMO-sufferers are comfortable with. Kind of creepy: Sonar . So you're chilling at your apartment, staring -- moleperson-like -- into the glowing half light of your computer screen. All your Sims have finally drowned in the swimming pool, and you're getting tired of thumbs-downing dubstep tracks on Turntable.fm, so you fire up Sonar. Sonar is a pretty simple app for Android (in beta) and iOS that shows you two things: Who is chilling at hot spots near you, and who -- in general -- in your vicinity you might be interested in meeting. When you launch the app, you'll be asked to connect to your social networks (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn), which lets the app deduce who might be interesting to you. Click on the ""Places"" tab and you'll see a list of locations in your area. Clicking on a location will surface a list of people at that spot (generated via Foursquare check-ins, etc. -- one doesn't have to be using Sonar to show up in the app), and what level of connection you have to them -- how many Facebook friends, Twitter friends, etc. If you see someone you might want to stalk -- I mean, TALK to, you can tweet at them from within the app. You can also check into that location if you manage to leave your cave and become an object of stalkage -- I mean, talkage -- as well. The app also features a ""People"" tab, listing which friends (pulled from your social networks) have currently checked in near you, as well as other people of interest. Use that to hook up with your pals next time they ""forget to tell you"" about karaoke. It's not your fault the only lyrics you know are ""Wub wub wub wubwubwubwub wub Pzzzzzzz."" Creepy: Highlight . You're just your average tech-savvy businessman, all pimped out in front-pleated khakis, your startup-emblazoned T-shirt of choice, and, of course, your ubiquitous SXSW Interactive Platinum Badge swingin' around your neck. Reclining there on your barstool, sweating Mojito in hand, you cruise the room with your eyes. With whom should you birth your future children -- uh, I mean your latest business venture? Suddenly, your cell vibrates in your holster. You whip it out with delight to see ... a shiny new notification from Highlight. Could it be? Is your dreamboat partner in this very room?! SXSW fave Highlight is what is known as an ""ambient location-sharing app,"" which means that it is always on (unless you ""pause"" it), alerting others using the service to your whereabouts. When you first install the app, you'll be asked to connect via Facebook, thus porting all your friends and interests into Highlight. From there on out, you'll be alerted via push notifications every time someone of interest is nearby -- you know, folks with a lot of mutual friends, hobbies, taste in TV, etc. These interactions will also be stored in a kind of in-app log. From there, you have the option to check out their profiles and send them a message if you feel keen on meeting. You can also ""Highlight"" people for future reference, which is kind of the equivalent of a ""wink"" on an online dating site (IE a complete wuss move). That's right, tech-savvy businessman, now you can meet all kinds of interesting people -- mere feet from your nervous self -- without the hassle of the initial awkward introduction. Highlight now, message one Mojito later. Meet IRL if they deign to answer you. Super creepy: Banjo . Your doll collection just isn't cutting it anymore. Seriously, how much can one stretch one's imagination when it comes to weaving background stories for inanimate objects? And QVC's wares aren't getting any cheaper. If only you could discover some brand new friends -- complete with dossiers (like the books that come with those American Girl dolls) -- with whom to maybe, possibly, someday but not likely hang out with. Well, you've got a friend in Banjo! Banjo serves two purposes: It alerts you when a friend is in your vicinity, and it gives you a glimpse into the lives of those around you -- and around the world. Upon downloading the iOS/Android app, you can connect to Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, Instagram and Google+ to keep track of all your friends. When a friend posts content or checks in using any of those services near you (you can change the distance from one-fourth mile to 10), you'll get an alert. If they're using Banjo, you can send them a message in-app, and if they're not, you can post a message to whatever content or check-in they shared, asking them to join the service. (We don't recommend doing this unless you're OK with someone putting cheesy words in your mouth like: ""How cool! Banjo tells me we're close by, so let's connect!) If the whereabouts of your friends are less than thrilling (""Jesus Christ, who the F cares that you went to the bodega and bought dish soap?!""), you can toggle over to the ""Explore"" map or the ""People"" box to check out a graphical representation of people in your area. That info is collected via check-ins/content as well, so users don't have to be Banjo members to show up on your map. From there, you can click through whatever content they're sharing -- tweets, Instagram photos, etc -- and live vicariously to your heart's content. You can even message folks if they're Banjo members (or spam them -- like your friends -- if they're not). Bonus: Banjo also shows who has looked at you, so there's plenty of opps for potential couples to awkwardly check out each other's profiles until one of them breaks. The app even lets you creep internationally, virtually zooming around cities like Paris and London and anywhere else your heart desires. And you thought that Canadian Maple Leaf doll from the Babies A Bloom collection you bought last week was an international adventure!","Sonar, Highlight and Banjo are a new wave of social apps that were all the buzz at SXSW .

"(CNN) -- China's 700 million smartphone users will no longer be able to share stories about politics without official approval, according to new regulations announced by authorities on Thursday, which took immediate effect. The State Internet Information Office released a 10-point document detailing new rules for instant messaging (IM) service providers and users. It is the latest move in an official campaign to ""clean up the online environment and rein in rumormongers,"" according to Chinese media. Although the rules apply to all IM service providers, they are widely seen as targeting WeChat, the immensely popular mobile app that allows people to share text, videos, photos and audio recording with multiple users at once. Public accounts on any mobile IM platform will also need to register with authorities using the real names of the owners. There are 5.8 million public accounts in China on subscription-based mobile apps, including celebrities, businesses and other organizations, according to state media Xinhua. The rules also stipulate that, while the accounts of professional news providers are allowed to post about politics, all other accounts must obtain prior approval from authorities to post -- or repost -- political news. Dominating the digital . ""This is just the latest set of rules to remind everyone who's in charge and provide yet another legal and verbal framework for silencing troublesome voices,"" says Jeremy Goldkorn, commentator on Chinese Internet and founder of Danwei.com. A similar set of regulations was imposed on users of Sina Weibo two years ago, the micro-blogging platform commonly referred to as China's Twitter. Prominent Weibo users were later detained or prosecuted, on charges both related and unrelated to their online activities. Lately, ""rumor mongers"" have become the target of the official online clean-up. In April, Qin Zhihui, who goes by ""Qinhuohuo"" online, was sentenced to two years in prison for spreading false information on Weibo. ""After the takedown of the Big Vs (verified accounts with huge follower numbers) on Weibo last year, I more or less gave up posting anything to the Chinese Internet,"" says Goldkorn. ""The government has successfully brought Weibo under control and has become the dominant voice there. I have no doubt that they will succeed with WeChat,"" he adds. Another user of a popular WeChat account on current affairs said that the new regulation ""will definitely impact what I'm going to post in the future. ""It's quite obvious now, other public accounts are definitely going to be more cautious about republishing political news because no one knows how strongly the rules will be enforced. And the term 'political news' is not quite clearly defined. We'll wait to see how things go."" A balancing act . To many China watchers, the new regulations that target mobile use has come as no surprise. The three-year-old WeChat, owned by Tencent holdings, is unlike any other mobile app. It has taken China by storm, with a monthly average of 398.5 million users who rely on the app to get all sorts of things done -- from booking taxis to sending virtual hongbao (customary gift money). It also extends into e-commerce, gaming, socializing and posting pictures. ""WeChat has turned into the extended operating system of China's mobile millions,"" said CNN's Kristie Lu Stout, a technology enthusiast and host of ""On China."" A Tencent spokesperson said that it ""respects related government policies in all markets"" where the company operates. ""And Tencent always devotes to create a healthy and secure online environment for our users. We'll take measures against offensive and abusive activities to show compliance with relevant regulations. We welcome users to report such instance to us via online channel."" Staying in the race . With its seamless functions, the China-developed app is fast gaining ground on its Silicon Valley rivals, such as WhatsApp. But now that the government is showing an ironclad crackdown on smartphone app freedoms, how can Chinese mobile developers stay competitive on the global stage? ""This is Beijing's dilemma. The government wants to develop the Internet to drive innovation and economic growth, while keeping tabs on any potential political risk bubbling up online,"" says Lu Stout. Danwei's Goldkorn doesn't feel that increased government regulation will have any lasting impact on innovation. ""The social media and news aspect of WeChat is trivial compared to WeChat's personal messaging function that is replacing SMS text messages, its taxi booking and payment system, and wealth management product, and the WeChat-enabled use of QR codes for marketing. This is a highly innovative fusion of a variety of different digital services, and it's beautifully engineered. ""Of course the intellectual repression caused by China's censorious media, telecom and education systems does hinder innovation, but it does not destroy it."" He adds that he sees workarounds to the regulations should users want to disseminate subversive materials: ""The point of the rules is not to delete every single vaguely problematic posting, but rather to stop public opinion from being swayed by non-official voices on the Internet."" CNN's Dayu Zhang contributed to this report.","China issues new rules for uses and providers of mobile IM services .

"(CNN) -- Like other Saudi women, she's not allowed to drive or move around freely. But Somayya Jabarti will soon be setting the news agenda for thousands of readers in the Middle Eastern kingdom. In what appears to be a first for male-dominated Saudi Arabia, Jabarti has been appointed editor of a major newspaper, the English-language Saudi Gazette. She will take over as editor-in-chief from her longtime mentor, Khaled Al Maeena, the outgoing editor said in an article published Sunday on the newspaper's website. ""I've had the goal almost as long of wanting to see a Saudi woman enter the male-dominated bastion of editors-in chief,"" Al Maeena wrote. ""It was not a question of gender but of merit that decided and earned her this opportunity."" Jabarti's appointment has generated praise on social media. But it remains to be seen how it will be received by the larger public in the conservative kingdom, where religious interpretations impose a de facto ban on females driving, among other restrictions involving women. ""This is a totally new step for Saudi Arabia,"" Saudi journalist Essam Al Ghalib told CNN. ""She is very qualified and it's about time. But how will people react, we'll have to wait and see."" ""The biggest challenge she may face is being accepted by the male-dominated circle of journalists,"" he said. Jabarti told CNN that she is unfazed. ""It is a male-dominated field, like many media in the world,"" she said. ""There will be challenges, but there is ground to be broken. This is just the starting point."" Jabarti began her career in journalism in 2003 as a reporter and translator for the Arab News, then headed by Al Maeena. She eventually rose to deputy editor-in-chief at the newspaper in 2011 before joining the Saudi Gazette with Al Maeena. The Saudi Gazette has a circulation of about 47,000, Al Maeena told Al Arabiya News in September. Jabarti will take over the newspaper amid significant challenges to press freedom in Saudi Arabia. Reporters Without Borders recently said Saudi Arabia ranks near the bottom of countries around the world in press freedom. The organization cited the arrests and punishment of journalists who wrote about sensitive issues in Saudi Arabia, including religion and the ban on women driving. On Sunday, the Saudi Gazette also carried a story citing a spokesman for the Ministry of Culture and Information threatening to shut down online news sites that ""publish offensive material about Islam, the country, or traditions.""

"(CNN) -- With recent polls showing Sen. Barack Obama's lead increasing nationwide and in several GOP-leaning states, some Republicans attending John McCain-Sarah Palin campaign rallies are showing a new emotion: rage. An angry supporter confronts Sen. John McCain at a rally in Wisconsin on Thursday. At a rally in Minnesota on Friday, a woman told McCain: ""I don't trust Obama. I have read about him and he's an Arab."" McCain shook his head and said, ""No ma'am, no ma'am. He's a decent family man...[a] citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues. That's what this campaign is all about."" One man at the rally said he was ""scared of an Obama presidency."" McCain later told the man he should not fear Obama. ""I want to be president of the United States, and I don't want Obama to be,"" he said. ""But I have to tell you, I have to tell you, he is a decent person, and a person that you do not have to be scared as President of the United States."" McCain's response was met with boos from the crowd. When asked about these outbursts, McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said that he didn't know who those people were and if they were there as supporters or to disrupt the rallies. A day earlier, the same type of hostility toward Obama was evident at McCain-Palin rallies. ""When you have an Obama, [House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi and the rest of the hooligans up there going to run this country, we have got to have our head examined. It's time that you two are representing us, and we are mad. So, go get them,"" one man told McCain at a town hall meeting in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Another man was more pointed. ""And we're all wondering why that Obama is where he's at, how he got here. I mean, everybody in this room is stunned that we're in this position,"" another man said at Thursday's rally. ""I'm mad. I'm really mad. And what's going to surprise you, it's not the economy. It's the socialists taking over our country,"" one said.  Watch more of the anger at the rallies » . McCain urged his supporters to be respectful of Obama. ""We want to fight and I will fight. But we will be respectful,"" he said. ""I admire Sen. Obama and his accomplishments. I will respect him and I want everyone to be respectful, and let's make sure we are.""  Watch McCain address attacks on Obama » . CNN contributor David Gergen, who has advised Democratic and Republican presidential administrations, said Thursday that the negative tone of these rallies is ""incendiary"" and could lead to violence. ""There is this free floating sort of whipping around anger that could really lead to some violence. I think we're not far from that,"" he said. ""I think it's really imperative that the candidates try to calm people down."" On Friday, Obama said the ""barrage of nasty insinuations and attacks"" was a result of the Republican nominee's failed economic ideas. ""They can run misleading ads, they can pursue the politics of anything goes. It will not work. Not this time. I think that folks are looking for something different this time. It's easy to rile up a crowd, nothing's easier than riling up a crowd by stoking anger and division. But that's not what we need right now in the United States. The times are too serious,"" Obama said at a rally in Chillicothe, Ohio. Recently, McCain's campaign launched a string of ads that question Obama's judgment and character. The McCain campaign calls Obama ""too risky for America"" in a new Web ad that focuses on his political relationship with Bill Ayers, a founding member of the radical Weather Underground. ""Barack Obama and domestic terrorist Bill Ayers. Friends. They've worked together for years. But Obama tries to hide it,"" the announcer said in the 90-second ad. The now-defunct Weather Underground was involved in bombings in the early 1970s, including attacks on the Pentagon and the Capitol. Obama was a young child at the time of the bombings. Obama and Ayers, now a university professor, met in 1995, when both worked with a nonprofit group trying to raise funds for a school improvement project and a charitable foundation. CNN's review of project records found nothing to suggest anything inappropriate in the volunteer projects in which the two men were involved. CNN Fact Check: Is Obama 'palling around with terrorists'? Obama, in an April debate during the primaries, called Ayers ""somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago, when I was 8."" At a rally Tuesday in Clearwater, Florida, Sarah Palin said Obama was being ""less than truthful"" about his ties to Ayers. ""His own top adviser said they were 'certainly friendly.' ... I am just so fearful that this is not a man who sees America the way that you and I see America -- as the greatest source for good in this world,"" she said. Palin told the crowd that she sees ""a pattern in how our opponent has talked about one of his most troubling associations."" Watch more of Palin's comments » . One member of the Palin audience in Jacksonville, Florida, Tuesday shouted out ""treason."" And at another rally in the state Monday, Palin's mention of the Obama-Ayers tie caused one member to yell out: ""kill him"" -- though it was unclear if it was targeted at Obama or Ayers. At several recent rallies, Palin has stirred up crowds by mentioning the ""liberal media."" Routinely, there are boos at every mention of The New York Times and the ""mainstream media,"" both of which are staples of Palin's stump speech. Some audience members are openly hostile to members of the traveling press covering Palin; one crowd member hurled a racial epithet at an African-American member of the press in Clearwater, Florida, on Monday. And at a McCain rally in New Mexico on Monday, one supporter yelled out ""terrorist"" when McCain asked, ""Who is the real Barack Obama?"" McCain didn't respond.  Watch as McCain ramps up his criticism of Obama » . Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat, on Friday told voters that the McCain-Palin campaign ""would want you to be afraid of Barack Obama."" Some Republicans have also been critical of the McCain campaign. Former Michigan Gov. William Milliken, a Republican, told the Grand Rapids Press he was ""disappointed in the tenor and the personal attacks on the part of the McCain campaign."" ""He is not the McCain I endorsed,"" Milliken said Thursday. Some anger found at McCain-Palin rallies is directed at McCain for a different reason.  Watch analysts weigh in on the recent attacks » . ""I am begging you, sir, I am begging you, take it to him,"" another supporter said to the Arizona senator at the Wisconsin rally. McCain, however, seems torn. On one hand, he is going negative on the Ayers controversy. ""The point is, Sen. Obama said he was just a guy in the neighborhood. We know that's not true,"" he said at the rally in Wisconsin. ""We need to know the full extent of the relationship because of whether Sen. Obama is telling the truth to the American people or not."" On the other hand, McCain is trying to focus on the economic downturn plaguing the country. ""But I also, my friends, want to address the greatest financial challenge of our lifetime with a positive plan for action,"" he added. Also, the McCains said months ago they didn't want their son Jimmy -- a Marine serving in Iraq -- dragged into the campaign. But on Thursday, Cindy McCain brought up her son. She criticized the Illinois senator for voting against a bill to fund troops in Iraq, a regular line of attack from her husband's campaign. ""The day that Sen. Obama cast a vote not to fund my son when he was serving sent a cold chill through my body, let me tell you,"" she told a Pennsylvania crowd before introducing her husband and his No. 2. The vote Cindy McCain is referencing came in May 2007, when Obama was one of 14 senators who voted against a war-spending plan that would have provided emergency funds for American troops overseas. A CNN fact check deemed the charge that Obama voted against troop funding ""misleading."" Obama supported a different version of the troop-funding plan -- one that McCain spoke against.

"(CNN) -- People were ""thrown to the roof as if they were dolls"" and some feared for their lives when a Continental Airlines flight ran into turbulence, shaken passengers said. Oxygen masks hang from a damaged part of the plane Monday, in a photo by passenger Camila Machado. The turbulence struck without warning several hours into Monday's Continental Flight 128 from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Houston, Texas. The pilot diverted the Boeing 767-200 to Miami, Florida, to get treatment for the injured. Continental said seven passengers were transported to hospitals, and about 28 other passengers were treated at the scene. Lt. Elkin Sierra of the Miami-Dade Fire Department said 26 passengers were injured, including four seriously. ""The airplane came down very sharply, and all of us bumped our heads against the ceiling -- twice,"" Brazilian passenger Celi Dfaria told CNN affiliate WSVN-TV at Miami-Dade International Airport. ""It dropped so hard that everything in the seat-back pockets just flew up in the air. I caught my phone in my lap,"" passenger Richard Sharp told the Houston Chronicle.  Watch what happens when a plane drops » . ""The second one was the devastating one. That's when the plane really fell,"" Fabio Ottolini of Houston, who with his wife and daughter was returning from a visit with family in Brazil, told affiliate KTRK-TV in Houston. ""While it was doing that, I saw people being thrown to the roof as if they were dolls."" Aloiso Dias thought the plane dropped more than twice. ""I felt like I was on a roller coaster,"" he told WSVN-TV. ""I couldn't even see what happened with my wife. I was just holding onto the front of the seat and going with the flow."" He couldn't see because the cabin lights had gone out and ""it was pitch black outside,"" Frederick Bright told the Houston Chronicle. ""I went up, and it was like I was in the air for a minute. Then I came down and I hit my back on the armrest, then I fell into the chair,"" he said. ""I thought I was going to die because the lights went off completely, and all I could see was the red lights"" on the wings. Most of those who were injured had not been wearing seat belts, passengers said. ""It was like in the movies -- anybody who didn't have a seat belt on came right out of their chairs,"" Manuel Alfaro of Houston told the Chronicle. ""It smacked everyone around."" Several people hit the ceiling hard, witnesses said. ""People that weren't seatbelted in flew up and hit the ceiling, so their heads and their faces hit the plastics all up at the top,"" John Norwood of Houston told WSVN-TV. ""A couple of people were badly hurt from the plastic breaking on their faces from the lights. There were people cut, bleeding. There were a few people unconscious.""  Watch passengers describe the terror » . Deanna Buckley of Houston hit the ceiling but wasn't hurt. ""I hit my head on the light above and it broke the light out and I was showered in glass,"" she told WSVN-TV. ""I was lucky, though. There were people on there whose faces were cut up. It was terrible."" The turbulence came suddenly, catching many passengers asleep. ""It seemed like the back of the plane got it the worst, though, probably because there's more people in the back and a lot of people didn't have their seat belts on,"" Sharp told the Chronicle. ""You had a lot of people sleeping across the empty rows, so those people were bouncing around on the armrests. They really took the brunt of the beating in the back.""  Learn more about turbulence and what causes it » . One of those was 13-year-old Thiago Candido, who was traveling unaccompanied. ""Oh, I was scared man,"" Candido told KTRK-TV. ""I was sleeping and I woke up with my head in the ceiling. I didn't know what was going on. ""I thought the plane was falling, just like a big earthquake, but in the air,"" he said. The flight carried 168 passengers and 11 crew members. Continental flew remaining passengers to Houston later Monday. ""I think the most important thing about this whole episode is seat belts, all the time,"" Ottolini told KTRK-TV. ""Because we have no way to predict what happened. It just happened.""","Airliner dropped sharply at least twice, sending people and objects flying .

"(CNN) -- Residents of the Falkland Islands voted overwhelmingly to remain a British Overseas Territory, an official said late Monday. The question put to voters was: ""Do you wish the Falkland Islands to retain their current political status as an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom?"" More than 99% of voters said yes, according to Darren Christie, public relations manager for the Falklands Islands government. Just three people voted no. Turnout was 92%. ""Speaks for itself, I think,"" Christie said about the vote. Monday marked the final day of a two-day referendum on the disputed Falkland Islands, which Argentinians call Las Malvinas. ""My vote is yes. ... I believe we are like other people in the world, and we are entitled to determine our own future. ... I think it's dreadful that someone like Argentina should be trying to deny us that,"" Sharon Halford, a member of the Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly, said before results were announced. ""They obviously don't care what their own people think, but worldwide, everybody has the right to determine their own future and why should we not be the same?"" Pictures at the polls showed some residents of the islands draped in Union flags as they cast their votes. Cars displayed banners that said ""We're British and proud."" A parade honoring British heritage marked the start of voting Sunday. The referendum was supported by the British government. But the Argentinian Embassy in London said Friday that the referendum had no legitimacy, characterizing it as ""a further attempt by the British to manipulate the question of the Malvinas Islands."" Because the area around the Falklands is the subject of a sovereignty dispute, it argues, ""the United Kingdom has no right to alter the legal status of these territories, not even under the guise of a hypothetical 'referendum.' "" Renewed tensions . The two countries went to war over the territory in 1982 after the then-military government in Argentina landed troops on the islands. Argentina put its death toll from the conflict at around 645. Britain says its civil and military losses amounted to 255. For more than a year, renewed rhetoric between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the islands has escalated to a fever pitch, with both sides accusing each other of colonialism. Prince William's military deployment to the islands last year further fueled tensions, drawing sharp criticism from Argentinian officials. In January, Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner wrote an open letter, published in the British press, calling on Britain to hand back the islands and accusing it of blatant colonialism. ""The Argentines on the Islands were expelled by the Royal Navy and the United Kingdom subsequently began a population implantation process similar to that applied to other territories under colonial rule,"" she wrote. ""Since then, Britain, the colonial power, has refused to return the territories to the Argentine Republic, thus preventing it from restoring its territorial integrity."" She cited a 1965 U.N. resolution inviting the two countries to negotiate a solution to the sovereignty dispute and has called on the British to abide by the resolution. The British government accuses Buenos Aires of trying to coerce residents into becoming part of Argentina through intimidation of those involved in fishing and oil exploration, and efforts to isolate the remote islands even further by limiting access by sea. British officials have rejected Fernandez's call for negotiations, saying the people of the Falkland Islands have chosen to be British and ""have a right to self-determination as enshrined in the U.N. Charter."" ""There are three parties to this debate, not just two as Argentina likes to pretend. The islanders can't just be written out of history,"" read a statement from the British Foreign Office. ""As such, there can be no negotiations on the sovereignty of the Falklands Islands unless and until such time as the islanders so wish."" Residents react . Located in the South Atlantic Ocean, about 480 kilometers (298 miles) east of the tip of South America, the Falklands have long been coveted as a strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of natural resources, including lucrative fisheries and a growing oil drilling industry. The islands, which raise their own taxes but rely on the United Kingdom for defense and foreign policy, are one of 14 British Overseas Territories and have been under British rule since 1833. More than 2,500 people from more than 60 nations live and work there, according to the government website, as well as forces stationed at the British military's Mount Pleasant Complex. Many Falkland Island residents are of British origin. About 1,600 voters from the Falkland Islands were eligible to vote in the referendum, officials said. Before results were announced, Halford said she didn't think the vote would put an end to Argentina's renewed bid for control of the islands. ""They've been saying for ages that they have no intention of recognizing it, whatever the outcome, which I find interesting because they've been going to horrendous lengths around the world to try and discredit it,"" Halford said. For Argentina, she said, the islands are a ""political football"" used to distract Argentinians from problems at home. On its official website, the Falklands government rejects as false the Argentinian government claim that a civilian population was expelled by Britain in 1833 and argues for the inhabitants' right to choose their path. ""We are not an implanted population,"" the government says. ""Our community has been formed through voluntary immigration and settlement over the course of nearly 200 years. ... We are no more an implanted population than are the various populations of South America whose ancestors arrived as immigrants from Europe -- we arrived here as part of the same process and pattern of migration."" The islands are economically self-sufficient, the government says, except for the cost of defense needed as a result of ""the claim made by an aggressive neighbour."" ""The Falkland Islanders are a peaceful, hard-working and resilient people. Our society is thriving and forward-looking. All we ask is to be left in peace to choose our own future, and responsibly develop our home for our children and generations to come,"" the government says. CNN's Michael Holmes contributed to this report.","NEW: More than 99% of voters said they want the Falkland Islands to remain a territory .

"(CNN) -- Attorneys for Google and Yahoo appeared in a Buenos Aires court to respond to accusations that searches on their websites link the name and photos of a popular Argentina model to sexually-oriented websites. María Belén Rodríguez is suing the search engines, alleging they linked her name with terms like ""sex"" and ""pornography."" Rodríguez told CNN her pictures would be wrongly used mainly in two ways: An unauthorized picture could be used to lure Internet users to an X-rated site, taking advantage of her popularity in Argentina, or within adult websites that contain pornographic images of other people. Rodríguez, 30, originally sued Google and Yahoo in 2006. After an eight-year legal battle, the case has worked its way up to Argentina's Supreme Court. In 2010, the model was awarded a combined judgment against both search engines of 120,000 Argentine pesos, almost $15,000. The search engines appealed and a higher court later lowered the amount to about $6,200. Earlier this week, Rodríguez told CNN the use of her image by sexually-oriented websites has deeply damaged her reputation. ""They have ruined my life and now say that what I'm asking for is censorship. It suits them, but not me. Truthfully for me, having to explain every day that I'm not a prostitute is a daily complication, as simple as that,"" Rodríguez said. At the court hearing Thursday, attorneys for Google and Yahoo suggested search engines are neutral platforms that don't create or regulate content on the Internet, and therefore, are not responsible for how the model's image is used by third parties. Alberto Bueres, an attorney representing Yahoo, said what the plaintiff is asking goes beyond the search engines' capabilities. ""It is technically and economically impossible to before-the-fact monitor millions of pages of content available on the Internet because of their volume and because they constantly change. To argue against this is to favor before-the-fact censorship and to ignore the economic realities,"" Bueres said. María Baudino, Google's legal affairs manager for Latin America, suggested the entire lawsuit could have been averted had the plaintiff contacted the search engines directly to complain about specific websites that used her image illegally. That information, Baudino said, would've allowed Google to act by either blocking the pages or unlinking results related to modeling pictures belonging to Rodríguez. ""In this particular case, there was a consistent and prolonged refusal to identify the content in question,"" Baudino said. ""It's necessary to identify the content by providing URLs in every single case for the simple reason that if they're not identified, neither Google nor anybody else is able to determine what we're talking about."" But Raúl Castex, an attorney representing Rodríguez, said search engines have more power to block content than they were willing to admit in court. ""Search engines can find, with their own, diligently designed techniques, websites linked to child pornography they normally block,"" Castex said. He questioned why the search engines can conform with censorship rules in China but cannot protect his client's reputation. Google attorneys said they index web pages based on more than 200 criteria. Google's transparency report posted online says so far this year the search engine has received more than 100 million requests to block pages that violate copyright laws or are deemed illegal or harmful in other ways. Rodríguez, who's also an actress and a TV host, is a married mother of two children ages 1 and 3. She's a native of Córdoba, Argentina. Rodríguez is often mistaken by the media for another model from Argentina by the same name who works in Italy. Rodríguez says the case goes beyond her reputation and honor. She describes her legal battle as a modern David and Goliath fight. ""Let me be clear, first of all, that I want to clear my image,"" Rodríguez said. ""Second, I want a precedent to be set so that this doesn't happen again. I'm in favor of freedom of expression, but not the kind of freedom of expression that is built on lies. I'm an ant fighting against a giant monster."" A ruling by the high court is expected in several weeks.","Search engines appealing verdict awarded to Argentina model .

"(CNN) -- The Australian government has admitted it has 153 people, including children, in custody at sea while it fights a High Court challenge to any plans to send them back to Sri Lanka. Until Tuesday's court hearing in Melbourne, the government had refused to confirm or deny it was holding the suspected asylum seekers, in line with its policy of not commenting on operational matters under ""Operation Sovereign Borders."" All those on board are thought to be Tamils who left the Indian port of Pondicherry on a 72-foot boat in mid-June. They include three-year-old Febrina, whose image was released by a worried relative who hasn't heard from his family for more than a week. ""I am desperate to know where my family is. I can't function at all not knowing. I know all of them would be in very big trouble if sent back to Sri Lanka,"" he said, via an interpreter to the Tamil Refugee Council in Australia, before Tuesday's hearing. The government launched Operation Sovereign Borders last September, a military-led campaign to ""stop the boats,"" referring to a steady stream of vessels crammed with asylum seekers trying to make it to Australian waters. Critics, including human rights campaigners, have slammed the policy, which advocates ""turn-backs"" and the offshore processing of asylum claims, as cruel and unnecessary. 'Culture of secrecy' On Tuesday, they also took aim at the ""culture of secrecy,"" which created days of uncertainty for family members whose relatives were presumably lost at sea, and resulted in a vacuum of official information to back up claims that a boat had gone missing. ""It took getting a case to the High Court before the government would admit that they did have those people in custody and that they were on the high seas, that's not good enough,"" said Ian Rintoul, from the Refugee Action Coalition. David Manne, Executive Director of the Refugee and Immigration Legal Center (RILC), said the government's silence raised ""profound concerns"" about whether their rights and Australia's obligations under international law were being breached. ""Our system of Constitutional democracy is meant to deal with such grave matters with checks and balances under rule of law, not under a government-imposed shroud of secrecy with sweeping assertions that our international obligations are being met when the circumstances strongly suggest they are, in fact, being breached,"" he told CNN. Greens Party Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said: ""The ugly truth is that the government has been keeping dozens of children detained out on the high seas. These families have been at sea for over three weeks; they are anxious and frightened. ""The government has shown total contempt for the truth and for the rights of the Australian people to know what is being done in their name. Thankfully the courts have been able to shed some light on this immoral behavior,"" she added. Why was the matter before the High Court? On Tuesday, lawyers acting for 50 passengers on board the boat -- including 21 women and eight children from as young as two years old -- were seeking to extend a 24-hour injunction granted Monday to stop the Australian government from handing them over to Sri Lankan authorities. Fears they would be returned to face potential persecution intensified earlier Monday when the government confirmed it had on Sunday returned 41 Sri Lankan nationals found aboard a boat west of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in late June. According to a statement from Australian immigration minister Scott Morrison, 38 Sinhalese and four Tamil Sri Lankans had been subject to an ""enhanced screening process"" at sea. It found only one Singhalese Sri Lankan had a possible case for refugee status, but that person had asked to return with the others, the statement said. Human rights advocates said evaluating asylum seekers at sea was not an appropriate way to deal with serious claims. ""It sounds as though three or four or five questions are being asked by video conference, snap judgments are being (made), and they're simply being returned,"" said Gillian Triggs, president of the Australian Human Rights Commission. ""There is an obligation with international law to have a proper process,"" she added. In a statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said, ""UNHCR's experience over the years with shipboard processing has generally not been positive. Such an would rarely afford an appropriate venue for a fair procedure."" On Tuesday, the returned Sri Lankans faced court in the city of Galle, charged with illegally departing the country. What does the government say? The government has repeatedly defended Operation Sovereign Borders as the only way to put people smugglers out of business and to prevent lives being lost at sea. In a radio interview last week, immigration minister Morrison said: ""I know there's a lot of people out there who feel uncomfortable about elements of this, I get that... But this is how you stop the boats. This is how it has to be done because this is what works. This is why we're sticking to it."" Ministers often refer to the 1,200 people thought to have been lost at sea while trying to make the dangerous journey through seas to Australia during the previous Labor government's tenure. The Liberal government boasts that not one person has drowned in the 202 days since the last successful people smuggling venture arrived in Australia. In a statement on Tuesday, acting Immigration Minister Julie Bishop said: ""The government provided the High Court with the information it requested. However, in accordance with the policy established by the Operation Sovereign Borders Joint Agency Task Force Commander, the Government will not provide commentary about on-water matters under Operation Sovereign Borders."" ""The Government will act in accordance with undertakings made before the Court,"" she added. High Court ruling . On Tuesday, the government agreed to give 72 hours' written notice before any move to hand the asylum seekers back to Sri Lanka. Lawyers for the government revealed for the first time that the boat had been intercepted in Australia's contiguous zone, the area stretching beyond its territorial waters. Because the boat was not in Australian waters, the people on board were not able to seek protection under the country's Migration Act, the court heard. However, the presiding judge, Justice Susan Crennan, said there was no barrier to the government moving the asylum seekers to another location for processing, presumably one of its two controversial offshore processing centers on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea or Nauru. How did advocates know about the boat? Until Tuesday, most of the details known about the boat and those on board came from the vessel itself. On Thursday, someone claiming to be a passenger called a well-known human rights advocate. ""We're on our way to Australia,"" the caller said, according to Bala Vigneswaran from the Australian Tamil Congress, which represents the country's Tamil community. The caller said the boat had left the Indian port of Pondicherry, with 153 people on board, all Tamils, including women and children. Other phone calls were made before communication with the boat suddenly ceased on Saturday morning, Vigneswaran said, who passed the information to local media who called the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA). Asked how he thought the asylum seekers might be feeling about being held, Vigneswaran said: ""The only thing I can think of is they'd be very happy. Why not? Not all of them know the government policy (of offshore processing), some of them might. ""But, at the end of the day, they would think 'if we prove we are real refugees then the government will take us.' That's the mindset everyone has, isn't it?"" The Australian government has been returning asylum seekers to Sri Lanka, a country Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said is ""at peace"", despite reports of the abuse and mistreatment of Tamils since the end of the civil war in 2009.

"(Parenting) -- Simone's mom reads, sings and talks to him in French. In fact, Melissa Da, a French-American from Baltimore, only speaks her native language to the 2 1/2-year-old. The goal?

If you've ever thought about raising your kid to be multilingual, now's the perfect time to start. ""Babies are wired for language,"" says Naomi Steiner M.D., developmental and behavioral pediatrician at the Floating Hospital for Children, Tufts Medical Center, and author of ""7 Steps to Raising a Bilingual Child."" Parenting: Teach your baby sign language . ""The earlier they're introduced to a second language, the easier it will be for them to pick it up."" Knowing a second (or third!) language could one day give your child an edge in an increasingly global workforce. And that isn't the only plus, says Dr. Steiner. ""When these children get to school age, they tend to have superior reading and writing skills in both languages, as well as better analytical and academic skills,"" she explains. Whether you already speak more than one language in your home or you want your baby to have some exposure to a second language but you don't know how to navigate the uncharted waters, here's a guide to cultivating a multilingual environment. Dip your toes in . Start small by introducing books, games, music and DVDs in the second language. Until recently, scientists thought language acquisition relied on face-to-face communication. ""That's still the gold standard, but less direct exposure is also beneficial,"" says Dr. Steiner, who recommends using age-appropriate language materials (find books and CDs at your local library for free!) and Internet streaming of foreign-language music on a regular basis. Teresa Benton (name changed due to pending divorce) of Yorba Linda, California, watches Spanish versions of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and Sesame Street on a local cable station with her toddler daughter Grace. Parenting: Meet Dora the Explorer's mom . What you can expect: Basic comprehension. ""Learning a language is a question of repeated high-quality exposure,"" says Dr. Steiner. ""If a family reads a book to their child in Spanish as part of a bedtime routine, that's a lot of reading and a lot of learning over an extended period of time."" If sustained, this type of exposure will help children learn to say some words and understand their meanings. Splash around . In addition to using foreign language gear, hire a babysitter who speaks another tongue, secure bilingual daycare or arrange playdates with bilingual families. Benton's ex-husband worked in Spanish-speaking communities, so he asked clients for sitter recommendations. For other parents, finding bilingual childcare may require agency help. Ghurani's daughter attends a Montessori school that teaches basic Spanish. ""Finding appropriate immersion programs depends on where you live,"" says Liane Comeau Ph.D., a child and language development expert in Montreal. In California, some English-speaking kids attend Spanish-English bilingual schools and leave fifth grade fluent in Spanish. Parenting: Maternal health around the world . What you can expect: Results range from recognizing the language when it's spoken to being able to converse casually. The more time the child spends with the nanny or in bilingual daycare, the greater the proficiency. ""It all depends on the amount and quality of the child's exposure,"" says Dr. Steiner. Dive in . Go all the way by speaking only that language at home. For many families, in-home immersion translates to one parent speaking in the second language and the other parent speaking English. The back-and-forth banter doesn't trip up tots, says Comeau, who's raising her 16-month-old son to be bilingual. Da's son, Simon, for example, asks his mom for watermelon in French but addresses his dad in English. For extra support, reach out to relatives. Ghurani asks extended family to speak only in Arabic to Delila. Parenting: 16 fun brain-boosting games . What you can expect: A bilingual tot, in time. Don't worry if he doesn't speak either language as adeptly as his monolingual peers at first. If your child is exposed to both languages the same amount, he will be able to speak both equally well by the time he goes to school. Get 2 FREE YEARS of Parenting magazine - Subscribe Now!!

"(CNN) -- They say travel broadens the mind, but when there's cake involved other body parts are also at risk of broadening. Sugar lurks around every street corner, particularly since the diabolical cupcake revolution began foisting its caloric concoctions on an unsuspecting public. While cupcakes might be a passing fad, some dessert offerings seem impervious to change. In a few lucky corners of the world, pastry makers have been perfecting their creations for generations, reaching the point where they're works of art. Here are nine of the world's oldest pastry shops -- tried and trusted by centuries of cake-hungry visitors. Hofbackerei Edegger-Tax (Graz, Austria) This bakery has been coming up with the goods since the 14th century and has been at its current location since 1880. The ornately carved, arched wooden doors and storefront crowned by the Austro-Hungarian imperial coat of arms -- a gold two-headed eagle holding a sword and a globe above the door -- attest to its age and popularity with local royalty. This was, after all, a ""Purveyor to the Imperial and Royal Court."" Its traditional Sissi Busserl cookies, named after Empress Elizabeth of Austria, are worth trying. Celiac sufferers are in luck -- the bakery might be ancient but it's keeping up with the times by offering gluten-free products. Hofbackerei Edegger-Tax, Hofgasse 6, Graz;. +43 316 83 02 300 . La Maison Stohrer (Paris) Continuing the theme of royalty with a fondness for fat, Paris's oldest pastry shop, La Maison Stohrer, can claim regal connections via Poland. In 1725, when Louis XV married Polish princess Marie Leszczynska, his new bride brought along her father's pastry chef, Nicolas Stohrer, to Versailles. Five years later Stohrer opened this pastry shop on Rue Montorgueil in Paris, and it's been serving royalty ever since -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II stopped in during her 2004 state visit to France. Commoners are welcome too. Stohrer is credited with inventing ""baba au rhum"" -- a booze-soaked brioche named after a character in ""The Thousand and One Nights"" -- that's still a popular choice. It's worth breaking eye contact from Stohrer's crammed pastry cases to check out the frescoes created by artist Paul Baudry in 1860. Maison Stohrer, 51 Rue Montorgueil; +33 1 42 33 38 20 . Pietro Romanengo fu Stefano (Genova, Italy) This ancient cafe is heavy on the confectionery and famous for its candied fruit. The company was founded in 1780, opening the oldest of its two shops on Via Soziglia in 1814. Not much has changed since. Those visiting in May and June will witness Pietro Romanengo fu Stefano's staff engaged in annual labors to separate the petals used to produce the cafe's celebrated rose syrup and rose sugar. Pietro Romanengo fu Stefano, Via Soziglia, 74/76, Genova; +39 010 2474574 . Ruszwurm Cukraszda (Budapest) Anyone visiting the 13th-century Matthias Church in Budapest could do worse than following their tour with a sugary pick-me-up at nearby Ruszwurm Cukraszda. Located in the Buda Castle area, this pastry shop opened in 1827 and has survived sieges, a revolution and World War II. The original Biedermeier-era interior and furniture is still in the shop today. The cabinets along the walls hold a collection of antiques related to confectionery. The traditional Hungarian cream and sponge Dobos cake is a customer favorite, as is the shop's own creation, the Ruszwurm cream pastry. Ruszwurm Cukraszda, Szentharomsg utca 7, Budapest; +36 1 375 5284 . Confeitaria Nacional (Lisbon) An ornate pastry shop with cream-colored walls trimmed in gold and overlooked by a mirrored ceiling, the Confeitaria Nacional opened in 1829 in a stately corner building on the Praca da Figueira square. It's still run by descendents of the founder. The traditional Portuguese Christmas cake Bolo-Rei (King's Cake) was brought to Portugal by Confeitaria Nacional's Baltazar Rodrigues Castanheiro Filho from the south of France in the 19th century. Based on the seasonal French favorite Gateau des Rois, the Bolo-Rei is a bread-like cake with raisins, candied fruits and nuts. At other times of year, it's worth trying one of their popular pasteis de nata custard tarts. Confeitaria Nacional, Praca da Figueira 18B, Lisbon; +351 21 324 3000 . Antigua Pasteleria del Pozo (Madrid) When a baking shop's name contains the word ""antique,"" it's either got some history behind it or the pastries are on the stale side. Thankfully, it's the former with Antigua Pasteleria del Pozo. This Madrid institution opened as a bakery in 1810 and then as a pastry shop in 1830, claiming the crown as the city's oldest. It's stayed true its roots, providing traditional Spanish delicacies like bartolillos, a favorite with the locals. Del Pozo is also famous for its roscon de reyes, a traditional treat usually only available during Epiphany but available here all year. Antigua Pasteleria del Pozo, 8 Calle Pozo, Madrid; +34 915 22 38 94 . Blikle (Warsaw) Reportedly a favorite of General Charles de Gaulle and Pope Paul II, Blikle, which opened in 1869, is still a family business. The shop still operates in its original location, although the premises were completely rebuilt after being destroyed by the retreating Germans near the end of World War II. There are now 20 Blikle shops scattered throughout Poland, but the original is the main attraction. Favorite items include a version of a paczki (Polish doughnut), a glazed pastry filled with rose petal jam and sprinkled on top with candied orange peel. Visitors will may have to join a line of locals waiting for this one, but they'll be taking part in a longstanding Warsaw tradition. Blikle, 35 ul. Nowy Swiat 35, Warsaw; +48 22 826 45 68 . Maison Bertaux (London) For those who like a slice of contemporary art alongside their cake, London's oldest cafe usually obliges. Since 1871, Maison Bertaux has been bringing French patisserie, including croissant, eclairs, fruit tarts and Gateau Saint-Honore, to the city's central Soho district. In true French fashion, there's sidewalk seating available under Maison Bertaux's distinctive blue awnings. Long a destination for arty types -- it's near Central St. Martin's art school -- Maison Bertaux made pop singer Lily Allen's French wedding cake and late designer Alexander McQueen's birthday cakes. Famous visitors have included Nicole Kidman and Bob Geldof. Co-owner Tania Wade mounts art shows in the cafe's basement and upstairs tea room. Next up is the work of actor Timothy Spall, who was recently named best actor at the Cannes Film Festival. Maison Bertaux, 28, Greek St., Soho, London; +44 20 7437 6007 . Cafe Tortoni (Buenos Aires) OK, we said oldest ""European"" pastry shops, but anyone hunting for a bit of France in Buenos Aires should check out Cafe Tortoni. Opened by a French immigrant in 1858, Tortoni soon become the gathering place for the city's cultural elite and celebrities from around the world. Einstein, Rubinstein, Borges and Hillary Clinton have all dropped in over the years. Today, visitors can sample the cafe's hot chocolate with churros (fried dough covered in sugar and cinnamon), while taking in one of the nightly or weekend tango performances. Cafe Tortoni, 825 Avenida De Mayo, Buenos Aires; +54 11 4342-4328 .

"(Mashable)  -- Blekko's alternative search engine -- a $24 million venture-backed project that's been three years in the making -- is today launching its public beta. With the official rollout, Blekko is also releasing several new features designed for both mainstream and the site's super users. As you may recall, Blekko is designed to eliminate spam search results, allowing users to search just a subset of the web through its proprietary slashtag technology. The most significant upgrade to Blekko's search engine is the addition of slashtags that auto-fire for queries that fall into one seven categories: health, colleges, autos, personal finance, lyrics, recipes and hotels. Every time a Blekko user's query is determined to be in one of these categories, Blekko will automatically append the associated slashtag to the query and limit results to just the subset of URLs that fall under that slashtag. The auto-fire functionality is designed with passive searchers in mind, and aims to eliminate friction for first time users. The technology that powers these auto-slashtags was developed through an extensive research and development phase that involved analyzing the relationship between queries and the type of spam results they typically generate. Blekko plans to introduce auto-slashing for additional categories moving forward, but selected to launch with ones that represent a high volume of search traffic and are typically laden with spammy results. Health, lyric and financial queries on Google or Bing, for instance, will return results dominated by poor quality content farms or malware-hosting sites. Those same searches on Blekko yield results only from high quality sites. Blekko's slashtag formula works because of passionate users who take the time to add and edit URLs for category slashtags. As such, the company has released new features to enable users to apply to be editors for slashtags as well as share their comments and feedback on individual slashtags. Think of this as the Wikipedia formula but applied to search, so a small percentage of users will work together to build out slashtags for the majority of Blekko searchers. Blekko has been testing its solution to search with roughly 8,000 beta testers who have created more than 3,000 different slashtags. Blekko tells us that 11 percent of its existing user base come back to the site on a weekly basis. CEO Rich Skrenta and founder Mike Markson have modest projections for the immediate future, but believe that once the site hits one to two million queries per day, it can be profitable. Blekko is currently available on the web or as a mobile-optimized site, but mobile applications are also said to be in the works. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"New York (CNN) -- A controversial NYPD surveillance unit that cataloged information on Muslim communities never produced a lead that linked to a potential terrorist plot during years of investigating, according to the head of the city's police intelligence division. The NYPD's Demographics Unit -- or Zone Assessment Unit -- was put together with the CIA's help following the September 11, 2001, attacks. The unit has acknowledged that it engaged in monitoring that included Muslim-owned business and mosques across the New York region. The unit's reports, however, never led to a terrorism investigation in at least six years of surveillance, according to court testimony from Thomas P. Galati, the commanding officer of the police intelligence division. ""I could tell you that I have never made a lead from rhetoric that came from a Demographics report and I'm here since 2006,"" he said in a June 28 deposition unsealed Monday. ""I don't recall other ones prior to my arrival. Again, that's always a possibility. I am not aware of any."" A 60-page report obtained by The Associated Press earlier this year showed NYPD maps of Newark, New Jersey, and photographs of Muslim residences and mosques, while other reports revealed that authorities had tracked websites and on at least one occasion placed an undercover officer with university students. There was no statement in the documents regarding terrorism or criminal activity. Galati's June testimony was part of a lawsuit that actually began with a class-action case in 1971 and resulted in a historic settlement over a decade later known as the Handschu agreement, or Handschu guidelines. The settlement restricted police -- who were then accused of compiling dossiers on political activists and those perceived as radicals -- from investigating individuals whose activities were constitutionally protected. But civil rights attorneys last year filed papers in federal court challenging whether the use of undercover agents and informants within Muslim communities constituted a breach of those guidelines. NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said Tuesday that the ""premise that the demographic unit was used for wholesale spying on Muslims, using undercover officers and informants to do so, was false,"" and that neither ""confidential informants nor undercover officers were assigned to the demographics unit."" Browne added that ""the small unit, about 8 people, surveyed places a terrorist might go to use a foreign language internet cafe, get a job off the books, find a place to stay, etc."" However, police did uncover information that ""led them to recommend that investigators take a closer look."" He pointed to an ""Islamic book store in Brooklyn frequented by the Herald Square plotter"" as well as a Staten Island location that was being separately investigated by the NYPD. Police actions adhered to the Handschu guidelines, Browne added, which were modified following the 2001 attacks to provide authorities greater leeway in investigating potential threats. In the first expansive official description of the city's Demographics Unit, Galati testified in June that the NYPD had collected information often based on ethnicity and language. ""Most Urdu speakers from that region (Pakistan) would be of concern, so that's why it's important to me,"" he said. Listening in on a conversation at a Lebanese cafe could also be useful, he added, allowing analysts to determine what part of Lebanon the cafe-goers were from. ""That may be an indicator of possibility that that is a sympathizer to Hezbollah because Southern Lebanon is dominated by Hezbollah."" But ""related to demographics... ""I can tell you that information that (has) come in has not commenced an investigation."" The purpose of the unit is to help ""identify locations if we're faced with a threat,"" he noted, offering investigators a better starting point when confronted with a possible attack. ""The police department needs to know where we should go and look for that particular terrorist,"" he said. ""A lot of information that the Zone Assessment Unit captures helps us identify locations that we should look or not look for."" He noted that ""the information in the Demographics reports does have value"" because it ""contains a lot of bits and pieces of value, of intelligence value."" In May, New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa announced that the NYPD did not violate New Jersey laws when it carried out surveillance of Muslim-run businesses across state lines. The findings were the product of a three-month review meant to address concerns expressed by Muslim organizations, who later filed a lawsuit in New Jersey federal court against the NYPD for unfairly targeting the Muslim community. Meanwhile, news of Galati's testimony drew statements from activists on Tuesday, who called the police program ""unconstitutional and inconsistent with our nation's values."" ""The NYPD's spying on Muslims based solely upon their faith violates the most basic American values of religious freedom and equal protection of the law,"" said Glenn Katon, legal director of an activist group called Muslim Advocates. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in March called reports of NYPD surveillance ""disturbing,"" though White House chief counterterrorism advisor John Brennan praised the city's efforts to strike a balance between security and the protection of civil rights.","The NYPD's Demographics Unit was put together with the CIA's help .

"(CNN) -- People are mourning the tragic overdose death of Oscar-winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, who was found Sunday morning alone in his New York apartment with a needle in his arm and empty bags of heroin. When a beloved celebrity such as Hoffman dies of an overdose, it's front page news. But his death serves as a reminder that 105 people are dying in the United States every day from an overdose involving heroin or pharmaceutical opioids. With more than 30,000 deaths annually, accidental overdose has overtaken car accidents as our country's leading cause of accidental death for people 25 to 64. The hundreds of billions of dollars spent on the drug war did nothing to prevent a dramatic increase in overdose fatalities; indeed, those very policies likely increased the number of people who die from an overdose. Some people are going to use heroin, or play around with pharmaceutical opiates, no matter what we say and no matter what the government does. The real challenge is to do what we can to help people stay alive. Here are seven steps that can help: . 1. Make treatment available to those who want and need it: It is tragic that so many people who need treatment can't get it. It is outrageous that we taxpayers spend, on average, $30,000 a year to incarcerate someone with a drug problem, but we skimp on treatment programs that are less expensive and more effective in reducing illegal drug use and other crime. Too many people who want treatment are told there are no open slots and turned away. Philip Seymour Hoffman's 'everyman' brilliance . 2. Offer methadone and buprenorphine to those with opioid addiction: Methadone and buprenorphine have been the gold-standard treatment for opioid addiction for decades. These replacement therapies can allow people to live normal lives without the highs and lows of illegal heroin and other opioids. We need to remove the obstacles to making these life-saving medications more readily available and end the stigma that discourages people from seeking out the most effective treatment. 3. Honest drug education: We urge young people to stay clear of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, but the reality is many will experiment with using substances no matter what. We must teach them the risks and consequences of drug use. Most overdose deaths are a result of mixing opioids and alcohol but most people don't know that. Anyone who receives a prescription for a pain medication, knows a person misusing heroin or other opioids or who cares about keeping people alive, needs to know the incredible risks of mixing with alcohol. 4. Good Samaritan laws for 911 callers: Most people who overdose don't die. But the chance of surviving an overdose, like that of surviving a heart attack, depends greatly on how fast one receives medical assistance. Unfortunately people are afraid to call 911 because they don't know if the police who respond will focus on arresting those present rather than saving someone's life. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia have passed ""911 Good Samaritan"" laws that encourage people to call for help without fear of arrest. Although it appears Hoffman was alone when he overdosed, thousands of others are not. People need to call for help. It should never be a crime to call 911 to help save a life. Philip Seymour Hoffman dead of apparent overdose . 5. Make naloxone, the antidote to an overdose, more available: Naloxone is a safe, generic, inexpensive, nonnarcotic drug that works quickly and is easy to administer. It has saved hundreds of thousands of lives but could be saving many more. Many states are just starting to take some great steps to get naloxone in the hands of more people, including law enforcement and emergency responders. Anyone who uses opioids for any reason at all should have naloxone readily available, and friends and family who know how to administer it. There's no really good reason, moreover, why this antidote should only be available by prescription. If we really want to save lives, pharmacists should be allowed to sell it to whoever needs it. 6. Supervised injection facilities: Dozens of cities around the world have supervised injection facilities where people can inject their drugs in a clean, safe place with medical professionals on hand. These facilities eliminate overdose fatalities, reduce dangerous drug consumption practices as well as HIV and hepatitis C, minimize the public nuisance of people using drugs in public places and more than pay for themselves by reducing the need for criminal justice and emergency medical services. It has been particularly successful in Canada. The scientific consensus demonstrating the benefits of these facilities has yet to result in one such facility being opened anywhere in the United States. It's time already. 7. Heroin-assisted treatment: Conventional treatments do not work for many people addicted to opioids and want to stop taking them. That's why more than a half dozen countries in Europe and Canada have developed a second-line option: heroin-assisted treatment. With this treatment, pharmacological heroin is administered under strict controls in a clinical setting to those who have failed to succeed with other treatment options. Virtually every published evaluation of HAT has shown extremely positive outcomes: major reductions in illicit drug use, crime, disease and overdose; and improvements in health, well-being, social reintegration and treatment retention. No one can know for sure whether Philip Seymour Hoffman would still be alive if these seven steps had been implemented, but we can be certain that far fewer Americans would die accidentally from an overdose if they were. While our country continues to mourn his death, we need to educate ourselves about the best policies and practices to reduce these tragic losses. Some of these ideas may make us uncomfortable, but we need to embrace them as soon as possible. Our sons and daughters, brothers and sisters are counting on it. The cost of a slow learning curve is simply too great. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Writers: Actor Hoffman's death one of 105 people who die each day from overdose in U.S.
They say people will use heroin or opiates no matter what, so challenge is to help people .
Writers: Make treatment easy, pass laws that let people call 911 without fear of arrest .

"(CNN) -- Lauren Bacall, who died Tuesday at the age of 89, always said, not altogether happily, that she would be defined by her relationship with her husband, the great actor Humphrey Bogart. She was not entirely wrong. It is hard to think of Bacall without thinking of Bogart. When she first arrived on screen in 1944 in ""To Have and Have Not,"" at the ripe old age of 19, the thing that captivated audiences was not her beauty -- there were lots of pretty girls on screen -- so much as her preternatural steeliness. Here was a woman who could stand up to Bogart purring line by purring line, menacing look by menacing look, sneer by sneer, which may be why he wound up falling in love with her in real life. She was not a shrinking violet. She was a Venus flytrap. But if Bacall was unflappable, she was different from her steely predecessors, the so-called tough ""broads"" of the 1930s like Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. They were victims of the Depression, victims of male dominance, victims of bad breaks, victims of life in general. Those things made them feral, which is not an adjective anyone would ever have used on the self-contained, self-possessed Bacall. They were at war with life, hoping to find some good man with whom they might be able to make a truce. Bacall didn't seem to be at war with anyone, and she certainly didn't seem to think she needed a man to fulfill her. In fact, she was pretty much unpossessable. She did things on her terms. If you think of Davis and Crawford as curs, Bacall was a cat. She arose at a time when World War II was ending and film noir was beginning, and she was the perfect noir woman. Noir was a style of film, dark and edgy, but it was also an attitude of post-war ennui and cynicism. Her memorable quotes . In noir, you trusted people at your peril. Bacall embodied that attitude perfectly in films like ""The Big Sleep,"" ""Dark Passage"" and ""Key Largo,"" all of which co-starred Bogart. There was something slippery and unknowable about her, some sort of concealment, which fit the whole noir ambiance. And it wasn't coincidental that the perfect noir woman was also the perfect complement and foil for the great existential hero of the movies, Bogart. She was the great existential romantic partner. That attitude of hers seemed to arise from a personal grievance that Bacall developed growing up in New York as Betty Joan Perske, a Jew who was remade into a cinematic gentile by the anti-Semitic director Howard Hawks. As Bacall tells it in her first memoir, ""By Myself,"" Hawks was a Pygmalion who discovered her and then taught her how to move, how to talk (that deep, sultry husk of a voice) and how to act. But the umbrage she felt toward Hawks in making her deny herself may have been the razor's edge she brought to her performances. She was always forced to be in camouflage -- a hidden Jew. She even raised her children as Episcopalians, Bogart's religion, because she feared what might happen to them as Jews. For noir, the edge certainly worked. Hollywood recalls screen legend Lauren Bacall . But the persona outlasted its time. Well before Bogart died of cancer in 1957, Bacall's career had begun to slide, in part because noir had begun to slide, relegated to B movies. She was able to reinvent herself in romantic comedies like ""How to Marry a Millionaire,"" where she turned her sultriness into a kind of brisk efficiency, a no-nonsense woman for the 1950s, that contrasted with co-star Marilyn Monroe's flouncy availability, but the glory days were pretty much over. In retrospect, she hadn't been so much a star as she was a flare. Her late great triumphs were on stage -- in ""Applause,"" a musical adaptation of ""All About Eve,"" and ""Woman of the Year,"" a musical adaptation of the 1942 film of the same name, both of which earned her Tonys. Still, the fact that she was reprising roles originally played by Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn respectively was a sign that Bacall's own feline charm had not endured. In the end, she was a glamorous figure from another, darker era. . . and the wife of Humphrey Bogart.","Lauren Bacall, a Hollywood icon, died on Tuesday at the age of 89 .

"(CNN) -- Durable, shock resistant and, most of all, growing in a ready-to-use tubular form, it's a wonder bamboo hasn't always been used to make bicycle frames. While the prototype for a bamboo-framed bicycle was first developed as early as 1894 -- causing a minor sensation when it was unveiled at a London technology show at the time -- the idea never took off. Now 120 years later and a small but determined outfit in Ghana is working hard to change all that. ""We can't keep (up) demand with the orders for our customized bicycles,"" explains Bernice Dapaah, the executive director of Ghana Bamboo Bikes Initiative. ""We are hoping to go into mass production by June this year."" While mass production for a company that currently employs about 30 people means turning out just 60 to 100 of the beautiful handmade bicycles a month, Dapaah is confident of scaling up the operation. Here the advent of a minimal amount of technology has made all the difference. ""We still do it by hand, but now we've got a construction jig and this makes manufacture that much faster,"" she told CNN from the small factory outside the capital Accra. Using a method developed by American engineer Craig Calfee -- a renowned bicycle designer who first experimented with bamboo bicycles in 1995 -- the frames are lashed together with fiber and then coated with epoxy. Sturdy, and with a greater weight-to-strength ratio than steel, the bikes are robust, make for a smooth ride and are gaining a small but devoted following in Europe. Growing international attention . ""We are getting a lot of interest from the United Kingdom where people are using them for touring,"" she said. ""And they're popular with shops and exhibitors because people like the look of them."" Their first prototype came out of the factory more than four years ago and is still in operation. Dapaah said the bikes are remarkably durable and there's every indication that the first model will continue for many years to come. With just two sticks of bamboo enough to make one bicycle, and six regions in Ghana where bamboo grows abundantly, the Ghana Bike Initiative is unlikely to run out of raw materials. Last November the bicycle was the darling of the Warsaw Climate Change Conference (Conference of the Parties 19) where UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon donned a crash helmet to take a shaky turn around the conference center on one of the Ghanaian bikes. Christiana Figueres, the head of the United Nation's Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), also entrusted herself to the bicycle's rigid pannier rack to hitch a ride around the center. ""They're made by women and these women are teaching other women to make these bamboo bikes and to sell them so that they have another income stream,"" Figueres said. Building opportunities . As a vehicle for women's emancipation, the bicycle in history has been unrivalled. During the bicycle craze in the United States and Europe of the late 19th century, it came to symbolize the new woman, not only giving them unprecedented mobility but launching reform movements such as the Rational Dress Society which advocated for a woman's right to dress appropriately for cycling. For Dapaah -- who co-founded the company with school friends Kwame Kyei and Winnifred Selby -- the Ghana Bamboo Bikes Initiative proudly carries on that tradition. ""Currently we have about 20 to 25 women trained who are working in the factory but as we expand we hope to bring more on board,"" she said, adding that the initiative was launched as a way of using local renewable materials and satisfied local needs and created employment opportunities. ""Not only that but it looks cool and attractive,"" she said. One customized model even comes emblazoned with Martin Luther King motifs rendered in distinctive Ghanaian folk-art style. She said the prize the initiative won last year in Warsaw, the UNFCCC Momentum for Change Women for Results Award, was bringing with it more attention, more orders and greater ambitions for the company. ""Currently we don't manufacture many of the metal parts -- the chain and the forks we have to import but some of the metal parts for the frame are manufactured here. ""But we are hoping that if we find a collaborator in the medium to long-term, the tires, the wheels, the chain, and everything else could be made here in our factory.""

"(CNN) -- Do you remember that scene in ""E.T."" where the kids fly away on their BMXs? After seeing it, did you too want to pedal your bike down the street, over your house and past the moon? Well, now that fantasy can be reality with the invention of the Paravelo flying bicycle. A pair of flight enthusiasts, John Foden, 37, and Yannick Read, 42, have devised a two-wheeled bike -- christened the XploreAir Paravelo -- that transforms into an aircraft. The British inventors say it is the world's first fully functional flying bicycle. The machine can travel at speeds of up to 15 miles per hour on the road and 25 miles per hour in the air, reaching altitudes of up to 4,000 feet. ""The Wright brothers were former bicycle mechanics so there's a real connection between cycling and the birth of powered flight that is recaptured in the spirit of the Paravelo,"" says so-creator John Foden. The flying bicycle looks like a conventional bike connected to a lightweight trailer, which houses a giant fan, fuel for the contraption's engine and the flexible fold-away wing. Both the airframe and bike are made from aircraft grade aluminum. The bicycle can be disconnected from its trailer for inner city use, then docks to form a 'para-trike' for take-off. In order to fly, the bike and trailer are fastened together, the wing is unfurled and an electric starter fires the biofuel-powered 249cc motor. Tired Tour de France competitors might want to consider this option before taking on a particularly daunting hill climb. The Paravelo needs a long stretch of open ground, clear of obstructions for takeoff. Once airborne, it can stay in the air for up to three hours. Once it's in the air, the flying bicycle's inventors say that it controls like a conventional fan-powered paraglider. The fan can also be detached entirely from its housing and strapped directly onto your back. Worn like this, no license is required to fly it in many countries -- including the U.S. and the UK -- but the United States Powered Paragliding Association strenuously recommends proper training. So unless you have done it before, jumping off the closest cliff in your new Paravelo is not recommended. The bicycle is small enough to be taken on public transport, and the entire vehicle can be stowed in a garage or carried up stairs and stored at home. Foden says that since childhood he and Read had always wanted to construct a flying bicycle. ""We live in Kingston-upon-Thames, on the outskirts of London, two minutes' walk from the birthplace of the Sopwith Aviation Company -- a British aircraft company that built aircraft including the Sopwith Camel for the Royal Air Force in World War I,"" he said. ""We spent our childhoods riding bikes and dreaming of flight."" Foden and Read hope that at $16,000 the Paravelo will appeal to inner-city flight hobbyists, and believe that it may also be be useful as a ""cost-effective aerial reconnaissance vehicle for forest rangers and border patrols."" The flying bicycle's inventors are now looking for support through Kickstarter and have so far raised approximately a tenth of their $78,000 goal. A film of the Paravelo in action can be seen on YouTube.","British inventors have built a two-wheeled bicycle that quickly transforms into an aircraft .
