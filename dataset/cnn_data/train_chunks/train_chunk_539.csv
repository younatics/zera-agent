Plunging temperatures, sore throats, lusty carol-singing and the drying effect of central heating are just a few elements of the Christmas party season that conspire against the vocal cords. Professor Ronald Eccles, director of the Common Cold Centre at Cardiff University,  says: ‘These things cause inflammation, irritation or infection of the larynx – also known as the voice box – leading to hoarseness, a sore throat and sometimes complete loss of voice.’ Here, in the second instalment of our three-part festive series, experts provide practical tips to help ensure that your voice remains loud and clear amid the merry-making. Carolling season: During Christmas time you should be singing carols - not quieting down - so take care of your voice box . STAY HEALTHY – WITH A SIP OF RIBENA . The drier the vocal cords, the more inflamed they will become, so ensure you stay hydrated. ‘Drink hot drinks every couple of hours if you can,’ says Prof Eccles. ‘These stimulate salivation and mucus secretions in the throat, which lubricate and soothe. Ribena is good because the strong flavour stimulates saliva production, as does the lemon in Lemsip, which also contains paracetamol.’ GIVE A TRADITIONAL HOT TODDY A MISS . Caffeine and alcohol have a dehydrating effect on the vocal cords. ‘It’s traditional to have a  hot toddy, but soaking the vocal cords in alcohol can do more harm than good,’ says Janet Wilson,  a professor of head and neck surgery at Newcastle University. If you must drink alcohol, opt for beer as it is less acidic and lower in alcohol than wine or spirits. Limit tea or coffee consumption to four cups a day. DON’T SHOUT . . . Shouting causes the vocal folds to slam together, which irritates the throat and promotes inflammation. ‘If you’re losing your voice, try not to talk at all and, whatever you do, don’t shout,’ says Prof Wilson. ‘If you have children or dogs, invest  in a whistle.’ Return your voice: Don't shout and don't whisper . . . . AND DON’T WHISPER . Whispering can also put the vocal cords under strain because it stops them closing properly. ‘Whispering involves moving a large amount of air through the larynx, which dries it out further,’ Prof Wilson points out. ‘Try to speak quietly instead.’ ENJOY A SPOONFUL OF SOOTHING HONEY . ‘A . teaspoon of manuka honey, which has antibacterial properties, every two . hours can help prevent as well as treat infected vocal cords,’ says . Philip Weeks, an expert in natural medicine and nutrition. ‘Honey also . helps to soothe and lubricate.’ FULL STEAM AHEAD . ‘Pour . an extra mug of hot water every time you make a drink and inhale the . steam,’ says Prof Wilson. ‘Think of the larynx as being dry and cracked. A steam bath is like applying a moisturiser.’ FIND YOUR INNER YOGI . ‘This . exercise is a showbiz secret,’ says Philip Weeks. ‘The idea is to . create a low larynx sound, like that made by cartoon character Yogi . Bear. This results in reducing the inflammation in the throat and vocal . cords by increasing blood flow. ‘You . can tell if you are talking in  a low larynx sound by gently touching . your Adam’s apple [or where it would be if you are a woman] and talking . in a way that results in it dropping to a lower position in your throat. Speak in this way for a few minutes, and then speak normally – your . voice will sound better. ‘Do . it for a maximum of five minutes and then rest. Just be careful not to . force the voice. Try this 30 minutes before going out  to see whether . you can improve the rasping tone.’ GET YOUR ASPIRIN FIX . Prof Wilson recommends gargling with aspirin twice a day: ‘Dissolve  a soluble aspirin in water and gargle for a few minutes. Don’t swallow as aspirin can irritate the stomach lining.’ AVOID SPICY FOOD . ‘Acid reflux is prevalent at this time of year because of the rich food and drink we indulge in,’ points out Mr Kalpesh Patel, an ENT consultant  at BMI The Clementine Churchill Hospital. ‘Stomach acid can irritate the throat so avoid spicy and oily food and eating late at night.’ Philip Weeks says: ‘Cutting mint tea out of the diet will help too. While this is great for preventing stomach spasms, it aggravates reflux. Instead, try fennel or ginger.’ LISTEN CAREFULLY . ‘There is no miracle cure to bring a voice back within a day but if you keep quiet during the hours leading up to the party, you might be able to regain some volume,’ says Prof Wilson. ‘Whatever you do, don’t push your voice. If you force sound out, you can cause bleeding on  the vocal cords, which may mean months of recovery and even surgery. Everyone loves a listener – it’s quite likely you will be the most popular guest at the party.’",The guide to save your vocal chords for carolling and Christmas cheer .

"By . Tom Kelly . PUBLISHED: . 06:55 EST, 1 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:20 EST, 1 August 2012 . A judge yesterday warned of the ‘utterly destructive’ effects of drug abuse on families after hearing how billionaire Hans Rausing hid his dead wife’s body for more than two months. Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson said the Tetra Pak heir had enjoyed ‘every material advantage imaginable’ before throwing it all away on addiction to hard drugs and descending into a life of squalor. After Rausing’s wife Eva died, he  kept her decomposing corpse under  a pile of bin bags, bed sheets and  clothing several feet deep inside a locked annexe in the couple’s £70million Chelsea mansion, where they lived as virtual recluses. 'Breakdown': Hans Rausing was convicted today at Isleworth Crown Court of preventing his wife's burial and driving under the influence of drugs . He acted with ‘deceit and deliberation’ to prolong the concealment of the mother of his four children, using deodorant to try to disguise the stench and telling people that she was on a trip to America, Isleworth Crown Court was told. But he escaped jail after the court heard that Rausing’s drug abuse meant he had been unable to confront the reality of his ‘beloved’ wife’s death. The 49-year-old, whose family is the 12th richest in Britain and whose fortune comes from the £4.5billion Tetra Pak drinks carton empire, told psychiatrists after his arrest: ‘I know it is sad and selfish, but I just didn’t want her to leave.’ He cut a tragic figure as he stood in the dock to plead guilty to the common law offence of failing to prevent his 48-year-old wife’s lawful and decent burial. Dressed in a navy blue blazer and red tie, he repeatedly blinked and twitched as Judge McGregor-Johnson gave him a ten-month suspended sentence on the condition that he agreed to a ‘very demanding’ drug rehabilitation programme. 'Decomposing': Rausing kept the body of his wife Eva, right, under a makeshift rug of clothes and bin bags . The judge told Rausing: ‘If ever there . was an illustration of the utterly destructive effects of drug misuse . on individuals and their families, it is to be found in the facts of . this case. ‘You and your . wife had every material advantage imaginable, and for a time a happy . family life. Your relapse into the misuse of drugs, together with that . of your wife, destroyed all that. ‘It . is graphically illustrated by the contrast between the rooms visitors . saw, and the utter squalor of the rooms you really lived in.’ Glamorous lifestyle: Police outside the Rausings' London mansion in Chelsea, where Eva was found dead . Inner demons: Eva Rausing, pictured as a teenager,, fought a lifelong battle with addiction alongside her husband . The court heard that Mrs Rausing was last seen alive on May 3 when she met her financial adviser and confided that she was ‘worried’ about her husband’s ‘chaotic lifestyle’. Four days later her husband found her dead on the second floor ‘annexe’ of their central London mansion, which only the couple were allowed to enter. Unable to cope with his loss, he hid her body for more than two months until July 9, when he was stopped by police after driving  erratically through morning rush hour traffic in Wandsworth, South London. Police who searched his car found a crack pipe, cannabis and white powder in the footwell of his Bristol Coupe and noticed his pupils were dilated and he was unsteady on his feet. They also discovered some unopened . letters to Mrs Rausing in the boot of the car. When asked about the . letters, Rausing ‘welled up’ and claimed she had gone to California two . weeks earlier. Police became suspicious and went to search the home and were let in by staff. James O’Connell, prosecuting, said: ‘They were hesitant to allow access to the second floor because part of the premises was an annexe which for some years access had not been allowed to anyone other than Mr Rausing and his wife. ‘They decided to force entry but when they were in a lift they noticed the stench of decomposition. They entered a room which had been sealed off with locks and gaffer-tape.’ The untidy room contained a pile of clothes and other linen on the floor concealing a body in ‘an advanced stage of decomposition’. Post-mortem tests indicated Mrs Rausing probably died on May 7. Eva Rausing’s parents were in the room as police made the horrifying discovery of their daughter’s body, the court was told. Tom and Nancy Kemeny  are . understood to have rushed to the Georgian home after seeing police cars . parked outside as officers searched inside. Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson said . Rausing’s prolonged concealment of his wife’s body had already caused . ‘great concern’ among those anxious about her whereabouts. He said this was compounded by the . ‘dreadful shock of discovery’ in  distressing circumstances ‘for those . who had to uncover the body but especially for  your wife’s parents who . were in the room when their daughter’s body was discovered’. After his arrest, Rausing was transferred to the private Capio Nightingale psychiatric hospital in Marylebone were he later told police in a statement: ‘I fully understand that my beloved wife of 19 years is dead and I am devastated, particularly for my children, by her death. ‘I do not have a coherent recollection of events leading up to and since Eva’s death save to say I have never wished upon her or done her any harm. I did not supply her with drugs. ‘I don’t know what caused her death, I did not feel able to fully confront the reality of her death. ‘With the benefit of hindsight I did not act rationally. I tried to carry on as if her death had not happened, and batted away any enquiries about her. I also took measures to reduce the smell. ‘I believe in the period since Eva’s death I have suffered some sort of breakdown.’ Tests after his arrest showed that Rausing had cocaine, morphine, diazepam, tamazepam and nitrazopam in his body. Alex Cameron, QC, who is David Cameron’s brother, said in mitigation that Rausing had no recollection at all about the first ten to 12 hours after his wife’s death. He said: ‘He didn’t move the body, he described her as appearing quite restful. ‘He felt quite unable to face up to the fact that Eva had died and almost like a small child couldn’t face up to telling anyone else and so took steps to delay the moment of facing up to reality. In his own words, he acted in a cowardly fashion.’ Cocaine, opiates and amphetamines were found in the body of Mrs Rausing, who had an ongoing heart problem and had been fitted with a pacemaker, the court heard. Tragic: The judge said the case illustrated the utterly destructive effects of drug misuse on individuals and their families . Drug problems: Rausing, 49, has been ordered to live at Capio Nightingale psychiatric hospital in Marylebone, pictured, for two years . The judge said he accepted that she died of heart failure coupled with the effects of drugs, telling Rausing: ‘There is no evidence to suggest the involvement of anyone else, including you, in her death.’ Rausing also admitted driving under the influence of drugs, for which he was given a two-month sentence suspended for two years. His family made their billions through the Tetra Pak empire, which was founded in 1944. The Rausings exited the Tetra Laval Group in 1995 and waived all interests in the company at the time. A single glass of champagne to toast the new millennium sent Hans and Eva Rausing spiralling back into a devastating addiction that was to cost them everything. The couple had both struggled with drug abuse in their youth but had successfully fought it to form a ‘loving’ family before the fateful decision to raise a glass together at midnight on New Year’s Eve in 1999, the court heard. Alex Cameron, QC, for Rausing, said his battle with addiction appeared to have started with his extraordinarily wealthy background as the heir to the £4.5billion Tetra Pak drinks carton empire. He said: ‘Despite or perhaps because of the economic circumstances of  his upbringing the defendant had  unusually strong social anxiety, feelings of inferiority, tendencies to medicate by drug taking and he dealt with emotional conflict by denial.’ Adoring: The couple met in rehab in 1989 before marrying three years later. They spent many spells in rehab but also lived drug-free for a period . He became addicted to drugs while travelling in his early twenties and met his wife-to-be in rehab in 1989, when he was 26 and she was 25. They married three years later and, with Mrs Rausing taking the lead, they managed to live drug-free for 11 years as they raised four children. Mr Cameron said: ‘They plainly adored each other, they were a loving family and they were extremely down to earth people and nice to work for, their staff said.’ They were active philanthropists, with a charitable trust created by the couple giving away £2million to good causes every year since 1995. The family also enjoyed an affluent lifestyle, spending much of their time in their 11-bedroom mansion in Barbados. But Mr Cameron said: ‘Things started to go wrong around about the millennium when the total abstinence of rehab process was mildly loosened by Eva’s urge to have a glass of champagne on New Year’s Eve of 1999 to 2000. ‘Needless to say they both did and the addiction slowly and surely began to take hold again.’ They lost the support of groups helping them to stay clean, and descended back into drug dependency. They struggled on until 2007 when another devastating blow to the family occurred. Details were not given in court, but it was described as ‘like the end of the world’ to Rausing. Mr Cameron said: ‘From that moment on he has been effectively a recluse.’ He said Rausing spoke only to his wife as the pair barricaded themselves into the second floor ‘annexe’ of their 50-room Chelsea mansion and banned anyone from entering. Mr Cameron said: ‘They were deeply ashamed by their situation and the thought of meeting people and explaining their situation was too much to bear.’ He added: ‘The reaction of Eva Rausing’s parents has been laudably understanding, forgiving and supportive. ‘Tom Kemeny [her father] described the defendant as a wonderful father, a wonderful man, a very good person, but also very ill.’","Hans Rausing, 49, given 10 months' suspended sentence for 'deceit'

An MoD computer consultant has been arrested on suspicion of working for a website offering to pay students' tuition fees in return for sex. SponsorAScholar.co.uk promised female students aged 17 to 24 up to . £15,000 a year in return for 'discreet adventures' with businessmen in private flats or hotel rooms. Mark Lancaster, 39, was detained at an address in Milton Keynes and material was seized from there and from his family home in the village of Horndean, near Portsmouth. 'Inciting prostitution': A man thought to be Mark Lancaster, 39, is secretly filmed at a McDonald's in south London, allegedly telling an undercover reporter that she would need to have a 'practical assessment' at a nearby flat . The consultant, who had clearance to work on a major Ministry of Defence computer project, is suspected of inciting prostitution in the growing  'sex-for-fees' scandal. He was questioned and released on police bail and will return to Charing Cross police station in London in February. The arrest follows an undercover investigation by The Independent into a man who claimed to be an 'assessor' for the site. An reporter posing as a . student arranged to meet him for at a . south London McDonald's two weeks ago. She was told she would have to undergo a . 'practical assessment' with him at a nearby flat to demonstrate the . level of intimacy she was prepared to show to future 'sponsors', and informed that it would be up to her whether or not she used protection with . the men. The reporter, who secretly filmed the encounter, declined and left. The website has since been taken down. SponsorAScholar.co.uk used a variety of images of women and . glowing testimonials supposedly from satisfied customers. Sordid: SponsorAScholar.co.uk, which has now been taken down, promised female students aged 17 to 24 up to £15,000 a year in return for 'discreet adventures' with businessmen in private flats or hotel rooms . It claimed 1,400 women had received 'scholarships', but it is not known how many . actually contacted the website or whether any money has . ever changed hands. Concerned: Minister for Women Jo Swinson last week urged the police to investigate anyone suspected of taking advantage of students . The website said that most of the sponsors were 'men between the ages of 28 and 50 who run their own successful business and want to have discreet adventures with a student whilst helping them fund their studies through a scholarship'. It even suggested that the sum was tax deductible. In November, a Channel 4 News undercover reporter attended an interview with the man behind the website in a flat he had rented in south east London. Although she was told his name was John, the broadcaster believed it was Lancaster. One student told Channel 4 News that . she had the 'practical assessment' and was later told in an email that . her application had been unsuccessful - but she could reapply in two . months. The 'assessor' used the name and former . address of a top academic at a leading British university in his . dealings with potential students. The academic has since contacted the . police. Minister for Women Jo Swinson last week urged the police to investigate anyone suspected of taking advantage of students. The investigation follows growing concern that rising student fees could be forcing young people into sex . work to cover their debt, with experts claiming the site was the 'tip of . the iceberg'. Detective Sergeant Alan Clark urged anyone who had made contact through the website to get in touch with police. 'If anyone has information in relation to the man shown in the film or the photographs or on the website itself, please contact us on 0800 783 2589 and we will get back to you in strict confidence,' he said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . UPDATED: . 07:09 EST, 19 December 2012 . A valedictorian and star student at the University of Michigan has been convicted of bludgeoning and stabbing his mentally unstable mother to death in their home. Jeffrey Pyne, 22, had been charged with first-degree . premeditated murder in the death of Ruth Pyne in May 2011, but after two days of deliberation, the jury convicted him of the lesser offense of second-degree murder. Pyne, who shook his head in disbelief as the verdict was announced on Tuesday afternoon, will be sentenced on January 29 and likely faces eight to 12 years behind bars. Pyne was arrested five months after his mother, 51, was found dead in the garage of their Highland Township, Michigan home and held without bond for more than a year. Convicted: Jeffrey Pyne, pictured in court today, has been found guilty of killing his mother in 2011 . Disbelief: Pyne shook his head as the second-degree murder conviction was announced in court on Tuesday . Prosecutors claimed Jeffrey was known to have a temperamental . relationship with his mother, who suffered from . several mental illnesses. She was bipolar and had spent two . weeks in jail nine months before her death for attempting to strangle . Jeffrey, according to reports, and prosecutors claim he became fed up of the situation. From 1998 onwards, she would threaten to kill herself and her son. After this she was diagnosed with being both bipolar and a paranoid . schizophrenic. Over the coming years, psychiatrists . would describe her as 'angry and violent', 'severely mentally ill', 'a . danger to herself and others' and suffering from 'acute mania', court . records show. Family: Jeffrey Pyne, left, poses with his little sister Julia, his . mother Ruth and his father Bernard . Fall from grace: Pyne, a star student at the University of Michigan, was valedictorian at high school, right . Prosecutors claimed Jeffrey, unable to deal with his mother anymore, struck her and broke her arm and skull . with a wooden board before stabbing her 16 times. Detective Steve Zdravaovski said . that traces of Ruth's blood was found in the drain of the upstairs tub, . implying that the murderer went to the first floor to clean after the . afternoon murder. Prosecutors also showed jurors photos of . the blisters on Jeffrey's hands hours after the murder. He explained the . wounds to his boss as the results of throwing a shipping pallet. 'It did seem odd to me,' his boss, William Cartwright, said. 'I expected more of a splinter or scrape . than what looked like rope burns.' Struggle: Jeffrey Pyne, who is accused of killing his mother, cries during his interrogation by police . Insistence: In the video, which was shown to the jury in his murder trial, he denies killing his mother . But the defense argued that there was no evidence Pyne killed his mother, saying . testimony about his emotional state was not worthy of . consideration in such a serious matter. The defense has suggested that the . brutal murder could have been committed by an intruder although nothing . was stolen from the home, according to the Detroit News. Jurors also watched a police . interrogation video showing Pyne crying as he insisted he did nothing to . hurt his mother. In the tapes, he says he last saw her as he . helped her unload groceries. He gave her and hug and then went to a . woman's home a few miles away to plant bushes. Evidence? The jury was shown images of injuries on Pyne's hands, which he said he sustained at work . Accused: Pyne will be sentenced in January and is expected to get many years behind bars . But the homeowner, Diane Needham, later testified the bushes had been planted the week before. Despite the claims by prosecutors, community members and Jeffrey's . father Bernard maintained that he is innocent. It took two days to find . an impartial, 12-member jury. 'The people in the community are . hugely supportive of this young man,' Detroit Free Press journalist Lori . Brasier told ABC News. 'Even people who believe he may have actually . killed his mother still support him, and you don't usually find that in . the community.'","Jeffrey Pyne, 22, found guilty of lesser crime of second-degree murder .

It is the home of the Bellini cocktail and renowned as one of the twentieth century's most famous bar, serving the likes of Orson Welles, Charlie Chaplin and Ernest Hemingway. But after surviving the Second World War and years of fascist rule, the legendary Cipriani family have called last orders on Harry's Bar in Venice after 81 years. In the past three years, the iconic watering hole has struggled with mounting debts of almost £5million. Last orders: Arrigo Cipriani has lost control of Harry's Bar in Venice, 81 years after it was set up by his father Giuseppe . Global brand: Harry's Bar was opened in 1931 at a converted warehouse and has spawned copycats around the world . Iconic: The doors to Harry's Bar and its most famous legacy, the Bellini . Now, the banks have called in Luxembourg's Blue Skye Investment to cut costs and re-organise the bar. Arrigo . Cipriani, son of Harry's Bar founder Giuseppe, blamed the decline of . 'quality tourism' and the failure of staff to take a pay cut on the . establishment's difficulties. The . banks are now insisting on replacing Cipriani with executives chosen by . the investment fund that partners the Cipriani family. The executives . will handle all future staff negotiations. More than half of the bar's costs are . spent on the wages of the 75 staff. They went on strike action when . voluntary redundancy was suggested. Mr . Cipriani, who started working at the bar aged just 19, told the . Corriere Della Sera newspaper that in the past five years custom has . declined by as much as 30 per cent. The 80-year-old, who said family tradition dictated he become a barman, said: 'These days These days, many day-trippers come to . Venice, but not quality tourists. 'We cannot deny that we miss the . Americans who were a guaranteed clientele for the whole year, we are . feeling that. And that is not compensated by the new wave of rich . Russians or Chinese.' Cocktail master: Harry's Bar regular Ernest Hemingway, right, pictured with the bar's founder Giuseppe Cipriani, who invented the Bellini and Carpaccio . Victim of the recession: Arrigo Cipriani said they have suffered with the decline of 'quality tourism' and saw debts mount to almost £5million . Famous faces: Ernest Hemingway, left, Orson Welles, centre, and Truman Capote, right, all frequented the bar . It is widely regarded as one of the best champagne cocktails in the world - despite being made using Prosecco. Giuseppe Cipriani named the cocktail, made using white peach, after Giovanni Bellini, the fifteenth century Venetian painter in 1948. When making a Bellini, all the ingredients and the glass needs to be as cold as possible. It should be poured one part peach puree to three parts Prosecco and a small amount of sugar should be added to taste. Harry's Bar website warns drinkers to never make a Bellini out of yellow peaches or peach schnapps. The . bar, on the St Mark's bay waterfront, was founded in 1931 by Mr . Cipriani's father Giuseppe and over the years gained dozens of famous . patrons, including some of the biggest names of the twentieth century. Truman Capote, playwright Somerset Maugham and Noel Coward all drank at the bar. Ernest Hemingway had his own table . during his time as a regular from 1949 and set several scenes from his . novel Across the River and into the Trees in the bar. Giuseppe Cipriani said once, . according to The Independent: 'He was generous to a fault and filled . more pages of his cheque book than those of a medium-length novel'. In 1948, the classic Bellini cocktail was invented using Prosecco and white peach puree. According to Jamie Oliver, who counts the Ciprianis among his friends, when Giuseppe first made the cocktail the sun was setting and the colours of the drink matched the view. It was named Bellini after the painter Giovanni Bellini because the colours also matched a robe worn by one of the paintings subjects. The . bar was declared a national landmark by the Italian government in 2001. It has spawned several bars and restaurants around the globe in cities . including London, New York and Istanbul. Giuseppe Cipriani may never have had his own bar if he had not met a 'sad' young American Harry Pickering. And even if he had somehow got the money, it certainly would have been called something else. While working as a barman at Hotel Europa in Venice, Cipriani struck up a friendship with Pickering, a student who was staying in Europe with his aunt. After she left him alone in a foreign country with no money, Cipriani offered to lend his new friend, who he called 'such a fine young man', 10,000 lira. Two years later, after he had given up hope of seeing the money again Pickering walked in and said thanks for the money and gave him 40,000 lira so he could open his own bar. Cipriani recalled his friend saying: 'I think they'll call it Harry's Bar. Not a bad name.' He rented a nearby warehouse for rope and transformed it into one of the most chic bars in town. The first and only guest book bore the signatures of Chaplin, Coward, Maugham, and Barbara Hutton. Cipriani once said: 'I opened Harry's Bar on May 13, 1931. If all the clients who now say they were among the first to walk through the doors that day actually did, the bar would have had to have been as large as Saint Mark's Square.' As well as the world famous Bellini, Cipriani is also credited with inventing carpaccio as it is known today. The raw meat dish was originally only conceived as a starter but Cipriani prepared the dish for the countess Amalia Nani Mocenigo when he learned she was told to eat raw meat by doctors. It was his second classic inspired by his love of art. Carpaccio was named after the Venetian painter Vittore Carpaccio, who was known for his use of red and white tones.","Cipriani family owners pushed out as debts mount to £5million .

"By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 06:56 EST, 19 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:18 EST, 19 December 2012 . An elderly man who systematically abused two girls over the last 43 years and made one of them pregnant has walked free from Gloucester Crown Court because of his mental condition. A judge ruled that Patrick Corrigan, 72, who suffers from dementia, was mentally incapable of standing criminal trial because he would not be able to understand the proceedings, instruct lawyers or give evidence. Corrigan had previously been found by a jury to have committed a catalogue of offences of rape, sexual assault, and indecency against children. No other option: Judge William Hart said he had no alternative but to discharge Patrick Corrigan, despite his guilt . Yesterday the pensioner from Tuffley, Gloucestershire, walked free from Gloucester Crown Court after Judge William Hart said he had no option but to discharge him. Corrigan was accused of raping a girl under 16 between 1971 and 1976, two charges of indecency with a child between 1969-1971, and two charges of indecent assault on the same person, then an adult, between 1997 and 2011. He was also accused of attempting to rape a 10-year-old girl between 1989-1990, indecency against the same child between 1990-1995, and indecently assaulting her three times between 1987-1995. In June, a judge acting on the advice of psychiatrists and psychologists decided Corrigan was mentally unfit to plead or stand trial, before jurors found that he did 'do the acts alleged' after a five-day trial held under the Mental Health Act in July. The case was then adjourned for further psychiatric reports, before Corrigan appeared at Gloucester Crown Court to hear his fate yesterday. Prosecutor Ray Tully said that under . the Mental Health Act, there were only three possible options: a . hospital order, a supervision order, or a discharge. 'This is . not a happy situation', he said. Gloucester Crown Court: Patrick Corrigan walked free from the court yesterday . Christopher Amis, for Corrigan, said the probation service had declined to prepare a report as they were unable to manage someone with his disability, leaving the court with only the discharge option. Judge William Hart told Corrigan: 'You will know that the jury found that you had carried out the alleged acts. That, I hope, is of some comfort to the complainants who gave evidence.' He said there were a limited number of sentencing options and Corrigan's condition meant he did not qualify for a hospital order under the Mental Health Act. Supervision by the probation service or social services would be of no benefit to Corrigan or the public, so the judge said he had no other option but to discharge him. This, he said, did not detract from the gravity of what Corrigan had done. The judge imposed a Sexual Offences Prevention Order that barred Corrigan from any unsupervised contact with children under 16 and from any contact with the complainants. He also ordered him to sign the Sex Offenders register for five years. The systematic abuse came to light last year when one of the women involved told police she had been sexually abused by Corrigan from the age of nine to 16. She told officers he made her carry out sex acts before he began raping her at the age of 11. It was alleged in the trial this summer that this had happened up to four times a week, and that when the girl was 13, she became pregnant. She had the baby when she was 14, she and the child were taken into care and the baby was later adopted. Corrigan denied to police that he had ever had sex with the woman when she was a child, but DNA tests proved that he was the father. In later life, the girl had occasionally to go Corrigan's home and, on two such visits, he made sexual advances to her. The jury was told that offences against the second girl followed a similar pattern, but although Corrigan abused her, he did not rape her. After the jury had returned verdicts that on all 19 charges Corrigan did the alleged acts, the judge said it was clear how badly affected the victims had been by their experiences. He said that if Corrigan had been fit for trial and had been convicted he would have received a sentence of about 15 years. David Tucker, Associate Head of Policy at the NSPCC, said: 'It’s desperately unfortunate that the appalling damage caused by this man cannot be properly reflected in a prison sentence. 'The victims suffered horrendous sexual abuse over a number of years and will no doubt need counselling and support to help get their lives back on track. 'The only crumb of comfort they can take from this dreadful case is that their stories have been believed.'",Patrick Corrigan's systematic abuse lasted 43 years and left one of his victims pregnant .

Caitlin Edwards, 13, was still in her pyjamas when newly-qualified Adrian Hope, 41, offered to take her for a spin on his powerful new bike. But Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court, in Wales, heard excited Caitlin was only on the back of the bike for seconds when it crashed into a car and she was thrown into a wall. 'Princess' Caitlin Edwards, 13, was still in her pyjamas when she died during a ride on the motorbike of newly qualified Adrian Hope, 41 . Hope, from Merthyr Tydfi, was jailed for 18 months after admitting death by dangerous driving . Caitlin, described as a 'beautiful princess' by her parents, was not wearing a helmet and suffered massive head injuries. She died a week later when her life support machine was turned off. The court heard Hope had only passed his test eight weeks earlier and was struggling to cope with the 1200cc Suzuki motorbike. Prosecutor Heath Edwards said: 'Hope pulled up on the bike outside Caitlin's home and she asked for a ride on the back. 'Her mother was there - she heard the request and thought nothing of it. Caitlin who was dressed in pyjama bottoms and a vest top climbed onto the bike. The motorbike bike was driven just 20 metres and was doing 29mph when it crashed.

'But as he restarted it, he opened the throttle in such a way that the bike shot forward.' Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Hope planned to drive to a house just three doors down from Caitlin's home. Investigations revealed the motorbike was driven just 20 metres and was doing 29mph when it crashed. Hope broke his neck in the accident and Caitlin, of Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, suffered multiple injuries. Mr Edwards said the family does not blame Hope 'solely for the tragic incident which resulted in the death.'

Weighing in at 355lbs, the West Palm Beach, Florida, native was depressed, insecure and embarrassed to let even her husband see her naked. Now boasting a trim 148lb body, Jacqui wowed viewers on last night's episode with the biggest weight loss in television history having shed over 58per cent of her body weight from start to finish. Scroll down for video . Fabulous and fit: Jacqui McCoy weighed 355lbs at the start of her Extreme Makeover: Weight Loss Edition challenge and by the end of the year dropped an astonishing 207lbs, weighing in at 148lbs . Though natural conception, she has since discovered, is still hindered by blocked tubes, the inspiring wife and hopeful mother has been told she is now a perfect candidate for IVF and will start treatment soon. And since family is what spurred her on her mission, the humbled reality star can only be thankful for her incredible achievements so far. She told ABC: 'I'm not sure I would have fought as hard as I did if I wasn't as motivated by the thought of having a family.' At . 14 years of age, Jacqui had been a bright teenager with a natural gift for . singing and a promising future until one night at a party, a young boy . attacked her. Unable . to cope with the pain of keeping her shameful story a secret she turned . to food and thus began a path towards morbid obesity and a life of . misery. Shame: At age 30, Jacqui was so ashamed of her weight she would hide from her husband Shawn when naked . No pain no gain: Training with Chris Powell, the West Palm Beach native was motivated to shed the weight by her inability to conceive a child due to obesity . Under the guidance of Extreme . Makeover's trainer Chris Powell, by the second week of her diet and . exercise regime, Jacqui had converted her living room into an impressive . workout space. Chris' high expectations demanded that she drop a whopping . 90lbs in the very first 30 days, a goal she reached and for which she . and her husband, Shawn, were rewarded with a long-overdue honeymoon trip . to Ireland on ABC's dime. But, it wasn't all fun and games for . Jacqui. During the trip she was tasked with completing a gruelling . 100-kilometre bicycle ride over the hilly terrain. Over . the ensuing three months, she whittled her weight down to an admirable . 210lbs and when she shed another 35lbs she became the first woman under . Chris' supervision to have lost 50per cent of her body weight in just . nine months. This . impressive achievement made her eligible for excess skin removal . surgery, a procedure to remove the surplus flesh that often hangs off the . bodies of those who lose drastic amounts of weight. Stunning transformation: Jacqui made television history by losing over 58per cent of her body weight over the year and was rewarded with a Walmart gift card valued at $50,000 . New woman: Since losing the weight for the reality show, Jacqui has kept up a healthy lifestyle and begun weight-loss coaching others including her younger sister who thanks to her help has lost 48lbs . By the end of the year, weighing in at 148lbs, fit, strong and healthy both in mind and body, Jacqui was rewarded for her brave accomplishment by Walmart with a $50,000 gift card. Thanks to this money, the reality show victor told ABC, she was able to pursue her dreams and aspirations rather than return to work straight away. Of her life-changing experience she said: 'I got this amazing gift and I want to share it with everyone I can.' And so, Jacqui has become a weight-loss coach herself. Among her clients, she counts her very own sister who dropped 48lbs under her sister's influence. And it isn't just her sister who has benefited from Jacqui's new found wisdom and fighting spirit. These days instead of chowing down on burgers and chips at get-togethers, her family have embraced new healthy foods and cook a feast of grilled chicken and vegetables instead. United: Though Jacqui and Shawn have been told her tubes are blocked and natural conception is unlikely, she is a good candidate for IVF treatment . Sharing the wisdom: Jacqui's family have benefited from her experience too and have substituted their diet of burgers and chips for grilled chicken and vegetables . Not only is she healthier, happier and excited to start a family, Jacqui has found her voice again and recently sang at her cousin's wedding. 'I found the biggest hurdle to weight loss is not your body but your brain. It was when I changed my mind about who I am, what I am worth, and what I am capable of doing. Once I finally found my fight to lose the weight I realized life is a fight,' she told ABC. And just to put a perfect conclusion to an inspiring story, Jacqui will be encouraging next season's Extreme Makeover: Weight Loss Edition hopefuls as a coach alongside Chris Powell. 'Getting to pay it forward it the greatest reward, I am so excited,' she gushed.","Jacqui McCoy, 30, from West Palm Beach, Florida, made reality television history by losing 58 per cent of her body weight ."

Harvard-educated Nina Siegenthaler, 37, fell for the sophisticated charms and 'A-list acting skills' of former Charterhouse schoolboy and Cambridge University drop-out Alistair Stewart. She branded him a sociopath and said she had believed his ‘countless lies’ about being a hedge fund manager with properties worldwide. Target: Nina Siegenthaler with her daughter on the beach. She fell in love with Stewart before he defrauded her . She gave him her £630,000 life savings to invest, plus £154,000 for him to rent a luxury home for them in the Caribbean. In . reality, Stewart was orchestrating his fraud from a council flat in . Burgess Hill, West Sussex, where he lived for most of the time on . incapacity benefits.

President Barack Obama announced on Wednesday that Vice President Joe Biden will lead an effort to come up with policies to address gun violence amid calls for action following the massacre of 26 people, including 20 children, in a Connecticut elementary school last week. The president affirmed the constitutional right for Americans to bear arms but clarified when it comes to the epidemic of gun violence 'if there is even one thing we can do to prevent any of these events, we have a deep obligation – all of us – to try,' at a White House press conference. Mr Obama said that Mr Biden will work with members of his cabinet and other officials to come up with proposals by January - assuring the American public this is not merely a Washington commission to study the issue but promised real reforms in a timely manner. 'If we are not getting right keeping our children safe then nothing else matters,' the president said about the need for action and bi-partisan compromise. Scroll down for video. Announcement: U.S. President Barack Obama (right) announces the creation of an interagency task force for guns as as Vice President Joseph Biden listens at the White House on Wednesday . The president praised Vice President Biden, who as a former Senator from Delaware led the effort for the 1994 crime bill. Biden will work with key cabinet members, reach out to stakeholders and members of Congress to create a list of recommendations for reforms in gun laws, access to mental health care and school safety. Mr Obama reiterated several times in his comments on Wednesday that Biden's task is not to review or study the issue but to provide action items to the president. Based on their recommendations, Mr Obama said he will present concrete proposals, as soon as his State of the Union address on January 29 - just 41 days from today. Mr Obama referenced the increased push for tighter controls . on gun ownership in the aftermath of the tragedy at the Sandy Hook Elementary . school in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14. A 20-year-old gunman, Adam . Lanza, entered the school and killed 20 children and 6 adults. The Connecticut massacre was the fourth shooting rampage to claim multiple lives in the United States this year. The American public seemed numb after the school shooting and even Republican and Southern politicians, typically aligned with the powerful gun lobby, have said that something needed to be done to prevent future tragedies. One such lawmaker is Democratic Senator . Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The gun rights advocate said he would now . be open to more regulation of military-style rifles like the one used in . Newtown. Obama spoke with him on Tuesday, the White House said. Mr Obama said he found it 'encouraging that people of all different background and beliefs and  political persuasions' are willing to challenge past assumptions and address the issue of gun violence. He noted the 'strong tradition of gun ownership that has been handed down . from generation to generation in the U.S.' and recognized the responsible, law-abiding gun owners in the U.S. but said more must be done to prevent guns from being illegally obtained and reaching the hands of the wrong people. Policy: President Barack Obama (on Sunday, at a memorial service for the victims and relatives of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting) will review gun policy in the aftermath of the horrific massacre . Tragedy: President Barack Obama (reflecting during the vigil for the Sandy Hook Elementary School victims on Sunday) has signaled his commitment to prevent the horror that unfolded at the school on December 14 . Gun control has been a relatively low priority for most U.S. politicians due to . the widespread popularity of guns in America and the clout of the . National Rifle Association (NRA), the powerful gun industry lobby. The constitutional right to bear arms, listed in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, has continued to be upheld even after mass shootings. The president said he is hopeful that the NRA will 'do some self-reflection' after the horror of seeing 6- and 7-year-old children and their teachers being killed at the school in Connecticut. White House spokesman Jay Carney had earlier said that Obama was 'actively supportive' of legislation to reinstate a ban on assault-style weapons but despite the support, the president was perceived to exert minimal effort to ensure the legislation was passed during his first presidential term. The ban had passed under a Democrat-controlled Congress in 1994 but expired in 2004. Carney said . Obama would back U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein's effort to reinstate an . assault weapons ban. When asked about his inaction on Wednesday, the president defended himself and assured the American public that he hasn't been on vacation, adding that the events of last week has put everything in perspective. 'If we are not getting right keeping our children safe then nothing else matters,' he said. Obama said that the assault-style weapons ban would be one of the many issues Biden would be reviewing and also pressed for Congress to finally confirm a director of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco & Firearms (ATF). There has not been an official head of the federal agency in six years. Unnamed former and current ATF officials have alleged the influential gun lobby has worked to limit . the resources available to ATF and to prevent leadership at the agency. No more: Tasha Devoe, left, joins a Washington, DC area march on Monday to protest the influence of the National Rifle Association in the aftermath of the tragedy at Sandy Hook . Obama has also signaled that he would support closing a gun . show loophole allowing people to buy arms from private dealers without . background checks and would be interested in legislation limiting . high-capacity ammunition magazines, according to Carney. During the second presidential debate in October, Obama had said he believed that 'weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don't belong on our streets.' 'What I want is a comprehensive strategy, part of it is seeing if we get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill,' he added. Many pro-gun lawmakers have been calling for a greater focus on mental health issues and the impact of violent . entertainment, a position Mr Obama said he also supported. He said that 'no single gun law can't solve all these problems,' in his announcement, made in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House. The room is named for President . Ronald Reagan's press secretary, James Brady, who was shot and permanently . disabled during an assassination attempt on President Reagan in 1981. Brady has since become a gun control advocate and had a piece of legislation, the Brady Handgun . Violence Prevention Act of 1994, named in his honor.","Vice President Joe Biden will spearhead effort to address gun violence, coordinating with government agencies .

Detectives were last night investigating claims of an extraordinary police plot to ‘blacken the name’ of Andrew Mitchell – as a fabricated email sent by a serving officer was made public. The barely literate message helped cost the then Chief Whip his job, despite the fact key sections of it were directly contradicted by CCTV footage viewed by the Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood days later. Crucially, it was sent to Mr Mitchell’s deputy John Randall on the evening of September 20 – the night before details of his ‘Plebgate’ confrontation with police officers in Downing Street were made public by The Sun newspaper. Controversy: Andrew Mitchell with his wife yesterday . The altercation happened on the . evening of September 19 when Mr Mitchell tried to leave Downing Street . on his bicycle by the main gate, but was told by police that he must use . the side gate. He admits swearing at the officers but denies the most damaging allegation, that he called them ‘f***ing plebs’. Mr Mitchell clung on to his job for three weeks before resigning when he lost the confidence of fellow Tory MPs. The timing of the email, four days . before an alleged copy of the official police log was leaked to the . Daily Telegraph, shows that the sender had access to internal police . information. In it, the sender attempts to . corroborate the account of officers on the gate, saying that Mr Mitchell . called them plebs and ‘continued to shout obscenities at the poor . police officer’. The email is now known to have been . sent by a serving police officer posing as a member of the public and . claiming to have witnessed the incident as a passer-by. A second email claiming to be from an . alleged witness to the incident was sent to Mr Randall a few days later . but its contents have not been disclosed. A constable in the elite Diplomatic Protection Group has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office. Metropolitan Police Commissioner . Bernard Hogan-Howe has said the officer was not at the scene as he . claimed, but has insisted this does not undermine the account given by . the officers on duty. Mr Hogan-Howe has repeatedly backed . the account by his officers who confronted Mr Mitchell in Downing Street . and last night the Met said his position has not changed. Yesterday Scotland Yard announced a . major investigation into the controversy manned by 30 detectives. The . inquiry is being supervised by the Independent Police Complaints . Commission. The inquiry will examine whether the . officer who sent the email was acting alone or whether there was ‘any . evidence of a conspiracy’. Detectives are also investigating the source of the stories in the Sun and Daily Telegraph. During Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron today expressed his dismay at the allegation that a police officer tried to 'blacken the name' of a Cabinet minister' David Cameron told MPs yesterday : ‘A . police officer posing as a member of the public and sending an email . potentially to blacken the name of a Cabinet minister is a very serious . issue and does need to be seriously investigated.’ The first email was released by Channel 4 News last night. The programme’s political . correspondent, Michael Crick, said the officer had admitted not being at . the scene, adding: ‘The impression I got was that he was a very . frightened man – even hinting that there were others in the background.’ Former shadow home secretary David . Davis said Mr Mitchell had been the victim of ‘a really serious . injustice’ and should be restored to the ministerial ranks. He said: ‘This is a shocking . revelation that a police officer seems to have masqueraded as a civilian . – more than seems to, I’ve seen the emails and clearly did so – and . acted in a way which effectively completely undermined Mr Mitchell in . the eyes of the Prime Minister and the rest of Downing Street right at . the point they were making the decision: do we support him or not?’ Mr Mitchell used freedom of information laws to obtain a copy of CCTV footage which he says contradicts the official police report of the incident . Mr Mitchell left his London home this morning amid calls from some Tory MPs for him to be reinstated in the government . The email is littered with . grammatical errors and spelling mistakes, including a reference to Mr . Mitchell’s ‘digesting behaviour’. The author claims to have been . showing his nephew from Hong Kong around London when he witnessed the . clash between Mr Mitchell and police officers. He went on: ‘Imagine to our horror . when we heard MR MITCHELL shout very loudly at the police officers . guarding “YOU (expletive blacked out) PLEBES !!” and “YOU THINK YOU RUN . THE (expletive blacked out) COUNTRY” and just continued to shout . obscenities at the poor police officers.’ The account in the leaked police log . of the clash also states that there were ‘several members of the public . present opposite the pedestrian gate’. They were said to have been . ‘visibly shocked’ by the language Mr Mitchell used. But CCTV footage suggests there were . only a few passers-by while the confrontation was taking place – and . that none of them appeared to be interested in what was going on. The CCTV footage is silent, making it . impossible to know what Mr Mitchell said, although it appears to have . been only a brief exchange. Cabinet Secretary, Jeremy Heywood . Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was under fire last night over an ‘incompetent’ investigation into police claims that Andrew Mitchell called them ‘plebs’ during an angry confrontation in Downing Street. Sir Jeremy, Britain’s most powerful civil servant, was asked to carry out an investigation into the explosive claims in September after a police account was leaked to the Press, and Downing Street was passed two emails claiming to be from a witness to the event. Yesterday it emerged that Sir Jeremy had viewed the CCTV evidence that casts doubt on the version of events provided by both the police at the scene and the fabricated evidence in the email sent by another officer posing as a member of the public. Number 10 said Sir Jeremy concluded that he ‘could not be confident that the evidence in the emails was reliable’. But, incredibly, he did not draw any conclusions about the accuracy of the police log – or even ask to look at it. Sir Jeremy told the Prime Minister that the CCTV footage contradicted police claims that the clash with Mr Mitchell was witnessed by a number of ‘shocked’ onlookers stood at the gates of Downing Street. But neither man took the issue further with the police. Sir Jeremy went to ground yesterday, pulling out of a Whitehall event at which he would have faced questions from the Press. Former shadow home secretary David Davis said the investigation was ‘not exactly Sherlock Holmes’. He added: ‘All the investigations did not go to the heart of the matter. Look at the CCTV, see whether it is consistent with the allegations made, consistent with what’s been said. It plainly wasn’t.’ Margaret Curran, a member of Labour’s Shadow Cabinet, said: It looks as if the so-called witness statement was not properly interrogated and I have to say… I do think that does speak of an incompetent inquiry undertaken by Number 10.’ Downing Street denied that the investigation had been botched. ‘The Prime Minister’s view is that reasonable inquiries were made,’ Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said. ‘Its conclusion was that one couldn’t be confident that the evidence in the emails was reliable, including on the basis of a number of inconsistencies with the CCTV footage. ‘There clearly remains a genuine difference of view about what words were actually used… the review was of the e-mail evidence that was submitted to us.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Andrew Mitchell demands an inquiry into 'completely untrue' allegations that he called Downing Street officers 'f****** plebs'

The number of hungry and homeless people in America is growing, as federal budget fights threaten the aid that many need to survive. As we prepare to gorge on family feasts this weekend, a new report shows requests for emergency food assistance rose in 21 of 25 U.S. cities during 2012 and remained the same in three, forcing soup kitchens to shrink their meal sizes. According to the research, from the nation's Conference of Mayors, more than half the cities said homelessness had also shot up this year. Hungry: Workers fill carts with food for the poor at the Foothill Unity Center food bank in Monrovia, California . 'This report is a stark reminder of the long-lasting impact the recession has had on many of our citizens,' Greg Fischer, mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, said in a statement. 'Families, who once lived in middle class homes, now find themselves without a roof over their heads, needing multiple social services for the first time in their lives.' The 25 cities surveyed are of varying size and wealth and represent all regions of the country. They included Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Nashville, Tennessee. Among those seeking emergency food, 51 per cent were in families and 37 per cent were employed. Nearly 1 in 6 - 17 per cent - were elderly and 8.5 percent were homeless, according to the survey. Nearly all of the cities reported a rise in the number of people seeking emergency food for the first time. Worrying trend: The number of people served by Foothill Unity Center food bank, pictured, has tripled in the last four years . 'In Philadelphia, I see people who are hungry and in need of shelter on a daily basis and explaining to them that Congress is cutting funding for the help they need is not acceptable,' said Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter. The impending 'fiscal cliff' has people with lower and middle incomes worried government funds for safety net programs will drop just as emergency unemployment benefits end. President Barack Obama and Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress are negotiating on how to avert tax increases and spending cuts due to take effect at the beginning of 2013. Republicans in the House of Representatives are pressing to cut $16 billion from food stamps as they hammer out an overdue farm bill. The 2007-2009 recession pushed up poverty and unemployment, while enrollment for food stamps, which help cover grocery costs, soared. As economic recovery takes hold, the unemployment rate has fallen to 7.7 per cent from a peak of 10 per cent. Still, the country's poverty rate remains at 15 per cent and a record 47.7 million people use food stamps. Food stamps: More and more Americas are struggling to pay for food, forcing soup kitchens to cut back on portions . Meeting the demand has been hard, and many places had to portion out aid in 2012, the survey found. In 95 per cent of the cities surveyed, food pantries cut the amount of food each person received and soup kitchens reduced meal sizes. In almost all the cities, pantries capped people's monthly visits as well. More than half the cities said homeless families with children were denied shelter in 2012. The hunger problem is likely to get worse next year. Three-fourths of the cities expect the need for food to rise. No city expects a decrease. Not OK: Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, pictured, said it was not acceptable for Congress to cut funding for the poor, in a statement coinciding with the report's release . Sixty per cent of the cities surveyed expect an increase in the number of families without shelter and 56 per cent anticipate a rise in homeless individuals. More than half the cities say there will not be enough shelters available. The survey confirms what many soup kitchens, pantries and other charities have been saying throughout 2012. 'We are always at capacity. If you are in a flood and someone says more water is coming you might not be able to tell because you are already in a flood,' said George Jones, chief executive officer of Bread for the City in Washington, this fall about a rise in the number of people seeking help. In the survey, Washington said the Capital Area Food Bank, an umbrella organization for assistance groups in Washington, is reaching two-thirds of those at risk of hunger. Officials at the food bank said calls to its hotline jumped 25 per cent last year and it also opened a new warehouse in June to double its capacity and keep up with rising hunger. For the first time they are coordinating help at a military base, sending a truck to serve about 250 families at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. Michael Blue, a 62-year-old part-time bus driver in Washington, gets help from Bread for the City. He says work is so sporadic that he has to scrounge for cash to pay rent and utilities. But his $13,300 annual income tops the government's poverty threshold, disqualifying him from some welfare programs. He receives about $200 a month in food stamps. 'They tell me that I don't qualify for help, but anybody who makes $13,000 or even $20,000 a year these days cannot survive,' Blue said. Between jobs he jots down telephone numbers from tour buses headed to Washington's monuments, then calls to see if they need drivers. He cannot recall the last time he had a full-time job. 'I am just being priced out of existence,' he said.","Requests for emergency food assistance .

"By . Tamara Cohen and Matt Chorley . PUBLISHED: . 04:06 EST, 21 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:38 EST, 21 December 2012 . Former Chief Whip has lost confidence in the head of the Met Police in the growing row over the investigation into his stand-off with Downing Street officers . David Cameron is under growing pressure about why he failed to publicly challenge the police over the plebgate affair when doubts about the police's account emerged three months ago. Downing Street identified inconsistencies between claims Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell called police 'f****** plebs' in a row in September, but was reluctant to question Scotland Yard's account. The Prime Minister held talks with Mr Mitchell this week amid a growing row about why Number 10 did not do more to challenge police claims against the former chief whip. Today Mr Cameron admitted there is 'a lot of sympathy' for his former Chief Whip. Mr Mitchell resigned from government a month after ranting at police officers who told him he could not ride his bike through the gates of Downing Street. He admits swearing but denies calling officers 'f****** plebs'. A . member of the diplomatic protection group has been arrested on suspicion . of misconduct in public office after reportedly sending an email to his . local MP, Tory deputy chief whip John Randall, posing as a member of . the public and accusing Mr Mitchell of calling police plebs’. The contents of the email was very . similar to the police log, including claims that a crowd of tourists . which appears to be contradicted by CCTV footage of the incident . Senior Downing Street figures, including Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, reviewed CCTV footage of the incident in September and found it contradicted some of the claims against Mr Mitchell. But the doubts were not forcefully made public, and Mr Mitchell was forced to quit after losing the confidence of the Tory MPs he was in charge of. 'The prime minister clearly decided not to raise concerns with [the Metropolitan police commissioner] Bernard Hogan-Howe,' a friend of Mr Mitchell told the Guardian. 'It is bloody astonishing. The approach was to leave this swinging in the wind rather than raise questions with the police.' It also emerged today that Mr Mitchell has challenged the independence of the head of Scotland Yard. Mr Mitchell has let it be . known he has ‘no confidence’ in Met Police Commissioner Bernard . Hogan-Howe, who is still backing the disputed police log of the . altercation. But today both London Mayor Boris Johnson and Downing Street insisted they had full confidence in Mr Hogan Howe. The Mayor of London's spokesman said: 'The Mayor has absolute confidence in the Commissioner. He has assured the Mayor that he is determined to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. The Mayor has every confidence in that assurance.' And a Downing Street spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister has full confidence in the Metropolitan Police Commissioner and believes the police should be allowed to carry out the investigation, which is being overseen by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.' Mr Cameron said he held a meeting with the former minister in Downing Street on Monday, ahead of the revelations in the Channel 4 documentary the following night, which shed heavy doubts on the allegations made by the police. Mr Cameron, speaking as he left Afghanistan on his Christmas visit to the troops said of the feelings towards him among MPs: ‘I think there’s a lot of sympathy for Andrew. ‘Because the revelation about the email on its own has shocked a lot of people, and some people will have been influenced by that. It’s quite a shocking development.’ During the meeting Mr Mitchell was ‘very calm and rational but feels obviously disturbed by what seems to have happened’, Mr Cameron said. ‘He and is very keen to get to the bottom of it. His mood was calm and reasonable given what are pretty extraordinary revelations.'. David Cameron, on a visit to Camp Bastion Afghanistan, held out the possibility of Mr Mitchell returning to government . London mayor Boris Johnson warned 'this has got to be sorted out' because the public had to have confidence in the police. 'It's not just serious because it affected the career of a Tory Cabinet minister, or whatever - it's serious because everybody in London has a right to expect the police to be fair and scrupulous in their testimony about what may or may not have happened, he told LBC Radio. The Police Federation, which . represents rank and file officers, also admitted mistakes in stoking the . row which saw officers posing for cameras wearing 'PC Pleb and proud' t-shirts. It comes at the end of a week of . extraordinary twists in the saga of what was and was not said during the . brief row on September 19. Yesterday it emerged that a second man, aged 23, had been arrested and held overnight on suspicion of 'intentionally encouraging or assisting the commission of an indictable offence'. Around 30 officers are working on the inquiry, which is being supervised by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). Met Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe, pictured today, is under pressure over his handling of the investigation, with London Mayor Boris Johnson warning everyone expects the police to be 'fair and scrupulous' The Prime Minister said he stood by Mr Mitchell because of doubts about the evidence against him. ‘We knew this email was unreliable so it did not influence my judgment as to whether Andrew Mitchell should stay in government,’ he added. Mr Cameron said that when Mr Randall confronted the individual who allegedly wrote the email, he ""flatly denied"" being a police officer. The PM also gave his strongest hint yet that Mr Mitchell could return to government. Speaking on a pre-Christmas visit to troops in Afghanistan, he was asked in interviews if Mr Mitchell could make a comeback. ‘One step at a time. Let's get to the truth about what happened,' he said. ‘But I think it has been an extraordinary development, frankly, to find a police officer apparently posing as a member of the public, pretending to have been outside Downing Street at the time and then trying to blacken the name of a Cabinet minister.’ The dispute centres on discrepancies between the police accounts of the incident and the CCTV footage. Both the official police log and the fabricated email claimed there were tourists standing at the gates who were shocked by Mr Mitchell's language, but security cameras covering the Downing Street entrance show almost no one there at the time. The police log, leaked to the Daily Telegraph, said: 'There were several members of public present as is the norm opposite the pedestrian gate and as we neared it, Mr MITCHELL said: ""Best you learn your f****** place...you don’t run this f****** government...You’re f******* plebs."" 'The members of public looked visibly shocked and I was somewhat taken aback by the language used and the view expressed by a senior government official.' CCTV from Downing Street, as shown on Channel 4 News, suggests there was not a group of tourists at the gates at the time of the incident . The badly-spelled email sent to Mr Randall by a police officer posing as a member of the public claimed: 'We were waiting at the main gates of Downing Street, with several other tourists.' It added: 'Imagine to our horror when we heard Mr Mitchell shout very loudly at the police officers guarding ""YOU _______  PLEBES!!"" and ""YOU THINK YOU RUN THE __________ COUNTRY"" and just continued to shout obscenities at the poor police officers. My nephew, as was I, totally taken aback bu his, MR MITCHELLS' behaviour and the gutter language he used, especially it appeared directed at the police officers. 'Now I know that the other people/tourists standing with us were also shocked and some were even inadvertently filming the incident (it wouldn't surprise me that in this age it'll be on YouTube or other social media website).' As doubts grow about the evidence against Mr Mitchell, the Police Federation started rowing back from his fierce criticism of the senior Conservative. Chairman Paul McKeeversaid: 'I understand those who say the Federation stoked up some of the media attention in relation to Andrew Mitchell. I think we can all say we could have done things better. 'The federation has to look at how we . can get some measure of control to ensure that there is perhaps a better . way of doing business in the future. That's something we are going to have to review in the new year.' But he insisted he was personally 'taken aback and shocked' by Mr Mitchell's reported comments, which came immediately after the murder of two woman police officers in Manchester. He told BBC Radio 4: 'I am going to wait to see what happens in relation to the investigation. 'If he has been done a calumny in relation to what happened, I will be one of the first in the queue to apologise.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Prime Minister says he had doubts about claims against his Chief Whip three months ago .

Accused: John Bushell, 86, is accused of trying to smear his neighbours to undermine their evidence in court against him . A pensioner has been accused of making false criminal allegations about the couple who lived next door to discredit what they said against him in a court case. John Bushell, 86, is alleged to have called police on September 27 to say his neighbours, Kenneth and Marjorie Mills, had damaged the guttering on his property. The retired book-keeper - who has been involved in a long-running feud with Mr and Mrs Mills - is already banned from contacting them under the terms of a restraining order made in 1998. Tensions have grown during the five decades they have lived next door to each other in a cul-de-sac in Hebburn, South Tyneside. Yesterday, Bushell appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates’ Court facing a charge of committing an act intending to pervert the course of justice. Bushell is said to have contacted the police about the alleged damage to undermine his neighbours’ credibility before they stood as witnesses against him in a different court case. He was originally due to appear before magistrates about the latest charge last Thursday, but did not turn up. At that point, he was facing the less serious matter of wasting police time. Paul Anderson, prosecuting, asked the court to withdraw that charge and replace it with the new one - which can only be dealt with at crown court. Bushell entered no plea and spoke only to confirm his name, age and address. Mr Anderson said: ‘A charge of . perverting the course of justice is indictable only, meaning it must be . sent to Newcastle Crown Court.’ Christopher Brown, defending, said he didn’t want to add anything on Bushell’s behalf. Bushell will appear at Newcastle Crown Court on January 4, where it is expected he will enter a plea. He was released on unconditional bail until then. Earlier this month, Bushell was found guilty of breaching an order after he hurled abuse at his neighbours on May 7.

Speaking after Bushell’s conviction, Mr and Mrs Mills said they wanted to call an end to their feud. Mrs Mills said: ‘All we want to do is to be able to enjoy our lives in peace.' Bushell, who lives with wife Sonia in . the cul-de-sac, said he has listened to the magistrates and will do his . best to keep the peace. Speaking after the case, he said: ‘I have got to accept the court’s decision and do as they say. I will keep myself to myself and keep out of their way.'

Support: Putin, speaking today at Moscow's World Trade Centre, said he backs the adoption ban . President Vladimir Putin said he supports a ban on Americans adopting Russian children. Speaking today, the Russian president said the law, which is part of a new feud between the two countries, was 'appropriate'. It has been seen as a response to the US Magnitsky Act, which was signed by President Barack Obama last week, which will punish Russians accused of violating human rights by refusing them visas and freezing their assets in the United States. Putin said of the American act: 'This, of course, poisons our relationship.' The American measures were drawn up because of concern over the death in a Russian prison of anti-corruption lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in 2009. The dispute threatens efforts by Putin and Obama to improve ties between the former Cold War enemies following their presidential election victories this year. At a Putin's first annual news conference since beginning a new six-year term, he signalled that he would sign the adoption law and called the Magnitsky Act 'unfriendly'. He said: 'It is an emotional response by the State Duma but it is an appropriate response.' He signalled he would sign into law the tit-for-tat move as well as barring entry to U.S. citizens accused of abusing Russians' rights. The adoption law follows concern over cases in which Russian children have allegedly been mistreated by American parents. Putin said the US Act had 'poisoned relations' between the two countries . Tension: The Kremlin said President Obama will travel to Russia to meet President Putin next year but Western diplomats said the summit will only happen if progress can be made . The act was passed by the US Senate last week by a sweeping 92 votes to four. Moscow was left fuming by the vote for the law, which will allow the US to punish Russians implicated in human rights abuses. It includes a measure that gives US officials the power to freeze assets of accused Russians and deny them visas. It was named after Sergei L. Magnitsky, a lawyer who died in Russian custody in 2009 after alleging that government officials had conspired in a $230million tax fraud scheme. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted a series of angry tweets after the vote saying the US of being a country where 'torture and kidnapping are legal in the 21st century'. Another post read: Apparently, Washington has forgotten what year this is and still thinks the Cold War is going on.' However Senator John McCain said the legislation placed the US 'squarely on the side of the Russian people'. The bill was originally crafted to strengthen relations by lifting Cold War-era restrictions on trade. In July, Torry Hansen, from Tennessee, . was ordered to pay $150,000 child care bills after sending her . seven-year-old adoptive son Artyom back to Russia because she said he . had violent behaviour problems. Last year, more than 1,000 Russian children were adopted by American families, according to the BBC. The Kremlin says Obama is likely to visit Russia in the first half of 2013 but Western diplomats say the U.S. president will agree to a summit only if he feels progress can be made. Elsewhere in the news conference when asked about Syria, Putin said he was not concerned about the future of long-term ally President Bashar al-Assad. Russia has been criticised for its support for the Assad regime but Putin said Moscow wants any solution to the Syrian conflict to ensure the fighting does not continue indefinitely. He said: 'We are not concerned about the fate of Assad's regime. We understand what is going on there. 'We are worried about a different thing - what next.' He also attempted to quash rumours about his health and denied his system was authoritarian. He said: 'If I considered a totalitarian or authoritarian system preferable, I would simply have changed the constitution, it was easy enough to do.' Amnesty International has called on Russian parliamentarians to reject the bill because it believes it have a 'chilling effect on Russian human rights defenders'. Amnesty International Europe and Central Asia director John Dalhuisen said: 'This bill is frankly a childish response to the Magnitsky Act. The Duma should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen Russian civil society, not weaken it. 'Quite apart from the fact that it clearly discriminates against Russian citizens of dual nationality, there is a huge risk that the vaguely-worded provisions in this bill will be used to clamp down on government critics and exposers of abuses. Indeed this would appear to be its real purpose.'","Vladimir Putin said he supports the ban which he said was 'appropriate'

Hormel were ‘insensitive’ and did not reflect his views ‘or the totality of my public record.’ In an interview with the Omaha World-Herald in 1998, Hagel said he believed that for a U.S. ambassador, ‘it is an inhibiting factor to be gay.’ Bold words: In an interview with the Omaha World-Herald in 1998, Hagel said he believed that for a U.S. ambassador, 'it is an inhibiting factor to be gay' Critical: Hagel referred to U.S. ambassador James Hormel as 'openly, aggressively gay' He referred to Hormel as ‘openly, aggressively gay.’ ‘I apologize to Ambassador Hormel and any LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Americans who may question my commitment to their civil rights,’ Hagel said in Friday's statement. ‘I am fully supportive of `open service' and committed to LGBT military families.’ Hagel, 66, is considered the leading candidate to replace Leon Panetta at the Pentagon, although a number of senators have expressed reservations about a nomination. Apology: Hagel on Friday said his comments about James C. Hormel were 'insensitive' and did not reflect his views 'or the totality of my public record' Sworn in: U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright swore in Hormel as U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg on June 29, 1999. Hormel is the first openly gay U.S. ambassador . Their concerns largely center on Hagel's past comments about Israel and Iran. Outside groups have suggested that based on Hagel's remarks, he isn't sufficiently supportive of Israel. At least two other candidates remain under serious consideration - former Pentagon policy chief Michele Flournoy and Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter. Hagel, a Vietnam veteran, served two terms in the Senate, retiring in 2009.","In a 1998 interview with the Omaha .

Detectives are now investigating the possibility that this man is also responsible for the armed kidnap of two people in the New Forest . A gun-toting kidnapper took two people hostage in less than a fortnight from the same village  and forced them into terrifying joyrides in their own cars. Earlier this month, the gunman pounced on a driver as he parked his Porsche at a train station and nine days later he took a pensioner from her home, in New Forest, Hampshire subjecting her to a terrifying ordeal. On both occasions he demanded cash and threatened to shoot before finally releasing his frightened passengers unharmed — but only after complaining about his failed business. The . first attack happened at 6.30am on December 5 when a commuter was parking . his Porsche 911 Carrera at the train station in Brockenhurst. The ordeal lasted about 15 minutes. The robber — who had being laying in wait in nearby bushes — brandished the gun and ordered the man into the car. He took his keys and drove him to an HSBC bank where he forced him to withdraw a 'large' sum of money. The . gunman then stole his victim's iPhone and dumped him in a car park . before driving off in the Porsche alone. It was found abandoned by the . side of a road. Nine days . later, on December 14, the gunman struck again — this time at the home . of a 64-year-old woman and her husband, 70, in Lymington. The first attack happened at 6.30am on December 5 when a commuter was parking his Porsche 911 Carrera at the train station in Brockenhurst . The kidnapper drove his victim to a HSBC bank, pictured, where he forced him to withdraw a 'large' sum of money . He kidnapped the woman and forced her into the passenger seat of her Peugeot 207 before taking her on a ten-minute drive. Having . been convinced by his victim not to dump her in the Forest, he drove . her back home, fled with £100 and dumped the car just yards away. Police . have released a recording of the 999 call made by the husband while the . robber was in the house, in the hope somebody recognises his voice. In it, the intruder can be heard . saying: 'I'm going to leave you here, I'm going to take your wife... you . can ring the police in two minutes... We'll be round the corner.' Detectives are also looking at the possibility the gunman is responsible for a robbery on a . post office. The kidnapper struck again ten days later, robbing an elderly couple in Lymington . The raider escaped with . an undisclosed amount of money following the hold-up in front of . shocked customers on Tuesday. The offender is described as white, in his 40s, around 6ft and of medium build. Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Murray, from Hampshire Constabulary, said: 'We believe this man lives locally. 'He is someone whose life has fallen down around him and is facing exceptionally hard times. 'He has told his victims he lost his business and he has a wife and kids.' Based on the conversations the man had . with his victims, it is believed he is a married father whose business . went bust five years ago. The post office robber escaped with an undisclosed amount of money, following the hold-up in front of shocked customers on Tuesday . Police warned people not to approach anybody matching the man's description and asked him to hand himself in. The attacks have frightened people . living in the New Forest, which covers 220 square miles and was the . former hunting ground of King William I. Resident Peter Young also said he is considering the security in his home: 'It's shocking that it's happened so close to us. 'We have taken every precaution but it doesn't mean we're not worried.' And . Liz Black, who lives nearby, said: 'You are always hearing about . burglaries at this time of the year but never armed robberies. 'I was surprised when I heard in was armed. It just doesn't happen here.' Lymington . Mayor, Councillor Jacqui England, said: 'Nothing like this has ever . happened around here before — it just illustrates the shocking times in . which we live. 'I've been told about one household where the occupants are double-locking the doors. The person doing this is in a bad frame of mind. He's not just Mr Opportunist.' Two men, aged 48 and 44, have been arrested and released on bail in connection with the kidnappings but nobody has been charged. A third man, 44, remains in police custody today and is being questioned in connection with the three armed robberies.

President Barack Obama . has scaled back his ambitions for a sweeping budget bargain with . Republicans. Instead, he's calling for a limited measure sufficient to . prevent the government from careening off the 'fiscal cliff' in January . by extending tax cuts for most taxpayers and forestalling a painful set . of agency budget cuts. In a White House . appearance Friday, Obama also called on Congress to extend jobless . benefits for the long-term unemployed that would otherwise be cut off . for 2 million people at the end of the year. U.S. President Barack Obama delivers a statement on the fiscal cliff at the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House Thursday . Obama's . announcement was a recognition that chances for a larger agreement . before year's end have probably collapsed. It also suggested that any . chance for a smaller deal may rest in the Senate, particularly after the . collapse of a plan by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to permit tax . rates to rise on million-dollar-plus incomes. 'In the next few days, . I've asked leaders of Congress to work toward a package that prevents a . tax hike on middle-class Americans, protects unemployment insurance for . 2 million Americans, and lays the groundwork for further work on both . growth and deficit reduction,' Obama said. 'That's an achievable goal. That can get done in 10 days.' Maybe, maybe . not. The latest plan faces uncertainty at best in the sharply divided . Senate. GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who wields great power . even in the minority, called Friday for Senate action on a House bill . from the summer extending the full menu of Bush-era tax cuts. He . promised that it will take GOP votes for anything to clear the Senate, . where 60 votes are required to advance most legislation. Democrats . control 53 votes. Boehner, giving the GOP . weekly radio address, said, 'Of course, hope springs eternal, and I know . we have it in us to come together and do the right thing.' The president called on congressional leaders to work out a solution on the fiscal cliff over the Christmas break. He also said 'because we didn't get this done, I will see you next week.' Earlier, . Boehner said Obama needs to give more ground to reach an agreement and . that both he and Obama had indicated in a Monday telephone call that . their latest offers represented their bottom lines. 'How we get there,' he added, 'God only knows.' Congress shut down . for Christmas and Obama flew to Hawaii with his family for the . holidays. But both men indicated they'd be back in Washington, working . to beat the fast-approaching Jan. 1 deadline with an agreement between . Christmas and New Year's. Obama announced his . plans after talking by phone with Boehner and meeting with Senate . Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who had previously pinned his hopes . on an Obama-Boehner agreement and is wary of dealing with McConnell. President Barack Obama speaks to reporters about the fiscal cliff in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington . At . the White House, Obama projected optimism despite of weeks of failed . negotiations. 'Call me a hopeless optimist, but I actually still think . we can get it done,' he said. Boehner spoke in . the morning, describing the increasingly tangled attempts to beat the . Jan. 1 deadline and head off the perilous combination of . across-the-board tax hikes and deep spending cuts. 'Because . of the political divide in the country, because of the divide here in . Washington, trying to bridge these differences has been difficult,' Boehner said. 'If it were easy, I guarantee you this would have been . done decades before.' Obama said that in his . negotiations with Boehner, he had offered to meet Republicans halfway . when it came to taxes and 'more than halfway' toward their target for . spending cuts. It's clear, however, that . there's great resistance in GOP ranks to forging a bargain with Obama . along the lines of a possible agreement that almost seemed at hand just a . few days ago: tax hikes at or just over $1 trillion over 10 years, . matched by comparable cuts to federal health care programs, Social . Security benefits and across federal agency operating budgets. Gray skies cover the U.S. Capitol in Washington as Congress closes down for the holiday without a compromise on the 'fiscal cliff' Obama . said he remains committed to working toward a goal of longer-term . deficit reduction to reduce chronic trillion-dollar deficits while . keeping tax rates in place for nearly everyone. 'Even . though Democrats and Republicans are arguing about whether those rates . should go up for the wealthiest individuals, all of us - every single . one of us - agrees that tax rates shouldn't go up for the other 98 . percent of Americans,' Obama said, citing statistics associated with his . promise to protect household income under $250,000 from higher tax . rates. Neither the House nor the Senate is . expected to meet again until after Christmas. Officials in both parties . said there was still time to prevent the changes from kicking in with . the new year. The week began amid optimism . that Obama and Boehner had finally begun to significantly narrow their . differences. Both were offering a cut in taxes for most Americans, an . increase for a relative few, and cuts of roughly $1 trillion in spending . over a year. Also included was a provision to scale back future . cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients - a concession . by the president that inflamed many liberals.. GOP . officials said some senior Republicans such as Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., . the most recent Republican vice presidential nominee, opposed the . possible agreement. But No. 2 House Republican Eric Cantor of Virginia . has joined arms with Boehner. Boehner stepped . back and announced what he called Plan B, legislation to let tax rates . rise on incomes of $1 million or more while preventing increases for all . other taxpayers. Speaker of the House John Boehner, (left) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (right with the president) must compromise together along with President Obama on the looming 'fiscal cliff' Despite statements of . confidence, he and his lieutenants decided late Thursday they were not . going to be able to secure the votes needed to pass the measure in the . face of opposition from conservatives unwilling to violate decades-old . party orthodoxy never to raise tax rates. The . retreat came after it became clear that too many Republicans feared 'the . perception that somebody might accuse them of raising taxes,' Boehner . said. Boehner also said that last Monday he had told Obama he had submitted his bottom-line proposal. 'The . president told me that his numbers - the $1.3 trillion in new revenues, . $850 billion in spending cuts - was his bottom line, that he couldn't . go any further.' That contradicted remarks by . White House press secretary Jay Carney, who said on Thursday that Obama . has 'never said either in private or in public that this was his final . offer.

President Obama's press secretary called for a cessation to the violence in Kenya as the commander-in-chief vacations in Honolulu, Hawaii, with his family . President Barack Obama is condemning violence in Kenya that left at least 39 people dead in renewed fighting between farming and herding communities that have a history of violent animosity. The White House says in a statement that Obama urges the Kenyan government and police, along with leaders from the Orma and Pokomo communities, to end a deadly cycle of conflict. 'The United States condemns in the strongest terms the renewed violence in Kenya’s Tana River region, which left over 39 dead and dozens injured on Friday, including many women and children,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney reportedly said in a statement. 'With historic elections approaching in March, peace and stability are essential to Kenya's continued progress,' Carney said. 'The United States urges the people of Kenya to assert their rights through peaceful means, as provided for in Kenya’s constitution, so that all Kenyans may realize a secure, democratic, and prosperous future.' At least 39 people were killed when farmers raided a village of herders in southeastern Kenya early Friday in renewed fighting between two communities with a history of violent animosity, a police official said. Thirteen children, six women, 11 men and nine attackers were killed said police official Anthony Kamitu. Forty-five houses were set on fire during the attack, Kenya Red Cross spokeswoman Nelly Muluka said. President Obama arrives with first lady Michelle Obama, top, and daughters Malia, top left, and Sasha, bottom right, at Honolulu Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Honolulu, for the start of their holiday vacation . Deadly attack: Villagers view the bodies of suspected attackers from the Pokomo tribe following tribal clashes in Kipao village in the Tana River Delta region of southeastern Kenya . Kamitu, who is leading police operations to prevent attacks in the region, said that the Pokomo tribe of farmers raided a village of the semi-nomadic Orma herding community at dawn in the Tana River Delta. He said the raiders were armed with spears and AK-47 rifles. At least 110 people were killed in clashes between the Pokomo and Orma in August and September. The tit-for-tat cycle of killings may be related to a redrawing of political boundaries and next year's general elections, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Kenya, Aeneas C. Chuma, said late August. However, on the surface the violence seems driven by competition for water, pasture and other resources, he said. Dhadho Godana, a member of parliament from the region and Defense Minister Yusuf Hajji have been accusing each other of involvement in the fighting. The two have testified before a commission of inquiry led by a High Court judge investigating the clashes . Political tensions and tribal animosities have increased due to competition among potential candidates in the March election. Death toll: At least 39 people including men, women, children, and attackers, were killed in Friday's raid in Kenya . Treating the wounded: An injured woman is treated at the district hospital in Malindi Friday, following the tribal clashes in Kipao village . Violence after Kenya's last general election, in late 2007, killed more than 1,000 people. Officials are working to avoid a repeat during March's presidential election, but episodes of violence around the country are raising fears that pockets of the country will see violence during the voting period. The Tana River area is about 430 miles (690 kilometers) from the capital, Nairobi. The utilization of the Tana River water has been at the middle of a conflict pitting the Pokomo against the Orma, according to research by the Institute of Security Studies in 2004, following clashes in the Tana River area in 2000 to 2002. The Pokomo claim the land along the river and the Orma claim the waters of the river, said the research by Taya Weiss, titled ""Guns in the Borderlands Reducing the Demand for Small Arms."" At least 108 people died in the 2000-2002 clashes, according to the parliamentary record. The longstanding conflict between the two tribes had previously resulted in relatively low casualties but the increased availability of guns has caused the casualties to escalate and more property to be destroyed, said the report. Restoring order: A villager armed with a spear walks past Kenyan police sent to keep order following tribal clashes in Kipao village . It said a catalyst to the conflict was the collapse of three irrigation schemes at Bura, Hola, and Tana Delta, which influenced residents' lifestyles in terms of employment and sources of income. 'The collapse of these schemes forced the nomadic pastoralists to move during the wet season, while the farmers remained along the river. During the dry season the pastoralists move back to the river in search of water and pasture,' it said. The Tana River area has the characteristics of any other conflict-prone area in Kenya: underdevelopment, poor infrastructure, poor communication and social amenities, and social marginalization, according to the report. 'Communities are arming themselves because of the need to defend against perceived attacks,' said the report. 'They feel that the government security machinery has not been able to effectively respond to violence. Isolation has led to increased demand for guns.'

A superyacht built for Apple CEO Steve Jobs has been impounded in Amsterdam because of a dispute over an unpaid bill to designer Philippe Starck. Jobs, who died last year after making his name and fortune at Apple, never got to use the yacht - called Venus - but had commissioned the French designer to work on the vessel, which cost more than €100m (£80m) to build. A lawyer representing Starck's company Ubik said his client had received €6m (£4.8m) out of a €9m commission for his work on the minimalist vessel and was now seeking to recover the rest of what he was owed. Scroll down for video . Dispute: A superyacht built for Apple CEO Steve Jobs has been impounded in Amsterdam because of a dispute over an unpaid bill to designer Philippe Starck . Unseen: Jobs, who died last year after making his name and fortune at Apple, never got to use the yacht - called Venus - but had commissioned the French designer to work on the vessel, which cost more than 100 million euros to build . The 260ft yacht was impounded on Wednesday . evening, the lawyer said, and will remain in Amsterdam port pending . payment by lawyers representing Jobs' estate. 'The project has been going since . 2007 and there had been a lot of detailed talk between Jobs and Starck,' Roelant Klaassen, a lawyer representing Ubik, said. 'These guys trusted each other, so there wasn't a very detailed contract,' he said. Many thanks: Jobs died in October 2011. His . family gave each worker at the shipyard a custom iPod Shuffle and a note . thanking them for their 'hard work and craftsmanship' The lawyer representing Jobs' estate could not immediately be reached for comment. The sleek ship is made of . light-weight aluminum and Jobs employed the chief engineer of his Apple . stores to help design special glass that allowed the ship to be . installed with ten-foot-high windows across the hull. It is christened Venus, after the Roman goddess of love. The cost of the superyacht is unknown, though Jobs was obsessed with completing it near the end of his life. 'I know that it’s possible I will die and leave Laurene with a . half-built boat,' he told biographer Walter Isaacson. 'But I have to keep going on it. If I don’t, . it’s an admission that I’m about to die.' Sadly, Jobs, who died in October 2011 of complications from pancreatic cancer, never saw his creation finished. Sleek: The yacht's design is simple and elegant -- reminiscent of Jobs' Apple stores . High tech: There are seven 27-inch iMacs set up on the bridge of the yacht . The Dutch technology blog One More Thing reports that the Jobs family will be on hand for the formal unveiling of the yacht at the Feadship custom yacht building company in Aalsmeer, Netherlands. Jobs' family gave out custom iPod Shuffle mp3 players to each of the crew members who helped build the yacht. Each one came with a note thanking them for their 'hard work and craftsmanship.' Among the high-tech features inside the ship are seven 27-inch iMac computers. Jobs employed renowned designer Philippe Starck to lay out in the interior. It is unknown when the breathtaking ship will make its maiden voyage. Feadship, the company that built Steve Jobs' luxury yacht has been crafting custom superyachts since the 1920s. In addition to the Apple founder, the company has built dozens of vessels for some of the wealthiest and most famous captains of industry. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen bought a 200-foot yacht called the Méduse from the shipbuilders in 1996. Michael J Saylor, founder of tech company Microstrategy, bought a 150-foot ship called the Harle in 2007. John W.

"X Factor hopeful goes home following a chat with Prince William and Kate the night before . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 02:31 EST, 8 December 2011 . He's come a long way since he left Liverpool to find fame and fortune on The X Factor and it was emphasised even more when he returned to the city just days before the live final on Wednesday. Marcus Collins was given the star treatment making a grand entrance at his old school in a helicopter and greeted by screaming fans. And later in the day the singer's mentor, Gary Barlow, popped round to meet the family and have an obligatory cup of tea. So good to see you! Marcus Collins and Gary Barlow share a warm embrace before the X Factor judge is invited in to join the singer and his family . Swamped: The Take That star (centre) is surrounded by excited fans as he makes his way into Marcus' home . Gary, who is head judge on the show, was mobbed when he arrived and had to be escorted through the large crowd that had gathered outside the Collins family home. He was greeted at the front door by his proud contestant, who embraced the Take That star before inviting him in to meet the rest of his clan. Earlier in the day children at Sacred . Heart in Crosby were stunned when Marcus was flown in and promptly took . to the stage in the school hall. Who could that be at my door? Marcus pops his head out after detecting some commotion in front of his home . Oh, it's Gary! Both stars beam as the Take That singer arrives at the Collins family home ready for a cuppa . According to those present when Marcus landed at the school, he spent quite some time signing autographs for the local fans – many of whom had their own Marcus masks. Even a special X-Factor cake had been made in honour of his return to the North West. Although he has been the favourite throughout the series, Marcus’s odds have dropped lower than Amelia Lily Oliver’s, with Little Mix tipped to take the prize. Rising star: The singer sharpened up to perform later in the evening . Arriving in style: Earlier in the day Marcus was treated like a star as he jetted into his old school in a helicopter . Hero's Welcome: Liverpudlian Marcus Collins was delighted as screaming fans greeted him at Sacred Heart school in Crosby during his homecoming tour ahead of The X Factor final . Dressed in typically flamboyant style with red trousers, a white shirt and matching red bow tie, Marcus performed to perfection for the gawping audience. And rather than seeming overwhelmed by the response, Marcus lapped up his new-found celebrity status. Clearly trying to garner a last minute boost, the singer, who is mentored by Gary Barlow in the show, sang a set of tracks while a cardboard cut-out with the words 'Vote Marcus' decorated the stage. One vote he might be getting is that of the Duchess of Cambridge. Marcus met with Kate and her husband, Prince William, on Tuesday night when the Royal couple attended Gary's solo gig at the Royal Albert Hall. Popular: The singer made a last minute attempt to garner more fans in his hometown of Liverpool . Boosting votes: Marcus couldn't wait to turn up to his old school and work place to perform a special set . Kate admitted to the Liverpudlian that her and William are both big fans of the ITV show and will be tuning in this weekend. 'They both said they watched the X Factor. How amazing is that?' Marcus said. 'They asked if I was nervous about . the weekend and I said I couldn’t wait. Kate said she was amazed at how . much stronger my vocals were live than on television. I just can’t . believe it.' However, Marcus was put on vocal rest earlier this week as he battled a throat infection and had to cancel his guest appearance on stage with Gary at the Prince's Trust concert. All three finalists, including teenager Amelia Lily and girl group Little Mix, also appeared on Chris Moyles' Radio 1 breakfast show at the start of the week, but Marcus was unable to speak much throughout the interview as he continues to prepare for the showdown this weekend. But he appears to be back to his best, belting out songs as the excitement took over in Merseyside. Former work: Before Marcus found fame he worked at a hairdressers in Liverpool . The star extended his homecoming tour by then travelling to his old work place, Jonathan James Hairdressers, in the city. A crowd gathered around the shop as he showed his face in the window and beamed for the waiting devotees. He also performed an impromptu song for customers and workers in the salon, grabbing a hairbrush and giving his vocals a good workout. Lost in the crowds: Marcus was overwhelmed but took his new found fame in his stride . Lapping it up: Flanked by a security guard the 23-year-old had a break from rehearsals in his local area . Clearly excited to be back in town Marcus wrote on Twitter ahead of his arrival: 'Liverpool I'm homeeeee... Can't wait to see you all ??? you don't need wristbands to attend xxx Marcus masks at the ready xx' And he wasn't the only finalist to have jetted in to their home towns to garner last minute support. Controversial 'comeback kid' Amelia Lily put claims of a fix surrounding the star behind her as she returned to her home town of Middlesbrough. Hugging off the controversy: 'Comeback kid' Amelia Lily enjoyed her homecoming in Middlesbrough . School show: Amelia also took to the mic at her old school for screaming fans, despite receiving flack for supposed fixing behind the scenes . Dressed in a tight black dress with a . pink faux fur coat to match her pale pink hair, Amelia looked delighted . as she caught up with her former classmates at Teesside High School and . treated them to a quick performance in the school hall. More rumours emerged yesterday that The X Factor is a fix after Amelia's 'winner's single' was made available for pre-order on HMV's website. While all three finalists have . pre-recorded their single to go on sale immediately after the winner is . announced this weekend, only Amelia's appeared on the website. An immediate Twitter storm ensued, causing the HMV site to crash as curious fans flooded the website to see for themselves. All smiles: Little Mix were stunned at their popularity during a visit to singer Jesy Nelson's hometown of Romford, Essex earlier this week . However, HMV . spokesperson Gennaro Castaldo said: 'Hmv.com was looking to accept . customer pre-orders for versions of the X Factor winner’s single . recorded by each of the three finalists. 'Marcrust Collins': The singer has been immortalised on a Just-Eat pizza to celebrate the upcoming final . 'However, . due to a technical issue only Amelia Lily’s details were uploaded.' While Amelia shrugged off the media storm for her gig on Wednesday, four-piece Little Mix headed to Jesy Nelson's hometown of Romford, Essex for a signing earlier in the week. Looking overwhelmed by their hysterical reception, Tulisa Contostavlos' girls were met with hordes of screaming fans at the city's Liberty Centre and Nelson's old school. Extra police were reportedly called to the event after thousands of people swamped the venue. But the quartet were delighted with the turnout, telling their 270,000 followers on Twitter: 'Just visited . @leighannpinnock old sec school.. 'The support there was UNREAL =D loved . it!

But not even the final of The X Factor, with all its glitz and glamour, could stop its dismal decline. Millions more viewers deserted the ailing talent show for the first stage of the competition’s final on Saturday night with an average of just 9.3million tuning in – 1.3million fewer than the same show last year. It is the show’s lowest ratings for a final in seven years, when 9.2million watched Shayne Ward triumph in 2005. New low: Just 9.3million viewers tuned in to see finalists James Arthur, Jahmene Douglas and Christopher Maloney sing on Saturday night . Stars: The show had its lowest ratings since 2007 despite performances from star turns including Kylie Minogue, left, and Rita Ora, right . This was despite performances from Kylie Minogue and up-and-coming pop star Rita Ora – as well as the drama of a public vote, which saw former cruise ship singer Christopher Maloney leave the show. The eventual winner was 24-year-old singer-songwriter James Arthur who beat supermarket worker Jahmene Douglas, 21. This year’s X Factor series, the ninth in the show’s history, has struggled with tumbling ratings, recording an average of 8.9million viewers, almost two million fewer than last year. Winner: James Arthur, right, beat Jahmene Douglas in last night's X Factor final . Two years ago, the show was hitting an average of 14.1million each week and the final show of the series attracted almost 20million viewers. The fall in ratings has been blamed on the departure of Simon Cowell from the judging panel. He left after the 2010 series to concentrate on The X Factor USA. He was replaced by Take That star Gary Barlow, 41, whose future on the show is now said to be uncertain. There are now suggestions that the judging panel, which also includes Louis Walsh, Tulisa Contostavlos and US singer Nicole Scherzinger, is set for a revamp ahead of next year’s series. Yesterday’s show was further overshadowed when Maloney dramatically quit hours before it started, reportedly abusing staff following a late-night drinking session. He was due to appear on stage last night to sing with his fellow contestants but turned up late to rehearsals yesterday after returning to his Manchester hotel at 4am. X Factor staff were dispatched to find him when he failed to turn up at 11am. He was then said to have abused staff members who decided he was unable to take part in the final run-through. He also reportedly verbally abused fellow contestant Carolynne Poole. Shortly after, he told staff that he did not want to appear on last night’s show. An X Factor spokesman said: ‘Chris decided he no longer wanted to be part of the X Factor final and has gone back to Liverpool.’ An X Factor source said that his place on the show’s lucrative tour was now in jeopardy and he may not be allowed to return. It would mean the singer may miss out on £100,000 he would earn for taking part.

Days after Romeo Beckham made his modelling debut for Burberry, the Beckhams have been voted the most fashionable celebrity family. And with half of the family already taking the fashion world by storm and the youngest of the brood topping 'most fashionable baby' polls, it comes as no surprise that the famous six were way out in front with almost one third of the overall votes. Voters said David, fashion designer . Victoria, Romeo, Brooklyn, Cruz and the youngest member of the family, . Harper Seven, always looked immaculately dressed and were known for . setting, rather than following the latest trends. Most stylish: The Beckham clan were voted as the most stylish celebrity family . Good genes: Harper Seven and Romeo have both inherited their parent's good looks and regularly top 'most stylish child' polls . The Kardashian sisters came in second with 14 per cent of the votes due to their bold and individual styles with the Jolie Pitt family coming third with 13 per cent of the vote. Beyoncé, Jay-Z and their daughter Blue Ivy polled fourth thanks to their love of designer brands, with Middleton sisters Kate and Pippa coming fifth. Saturday’s singer Una Healy, her husband Ben Foden and daughter Aoife Belle collected seven per cent for the vote. Designer and WAG Coleen Rooney and her family polled six per cent of the vote, with Myleene Klass and her daughters Ava and Hero, and Peter Crouch, Abbey Clancy and their toddler Sophia taking joint eighth place with four per cent. Keeping up: The Kardashian family, known for their savvy style, came in second place . Coming in at the bottom of the poll was the Windsors, who were applauded by just two per cent of those surveyed for their timeless elegance. A spokesman from TVBet.co.uk, who carried out the survey, said the results show that David and Victoria have passed on their sense of style to their children, with the family set to set trends across a number of age groups for many years to come. He said: 'Ever since Victoria and David started dating back in 1999 they’ve been acknowledged as a trend-setting couple – something which seems to have rubbed off on their children too. Flying high: The Middleton sisters and the Rooney's also came high in the poll . 'More than a decade down the line they’re still immaculately turned out and whilst there have been a few faux pas along the way - who can forget David’s curtains or his sarong - they always look sharp and stylish. 'Romeo is already modelling and it seems only a matter of time before Harper Seven takes to the catwalk as well.' He continued: 'The Kardashians came in second having been praised for daring to wear outfits to complement their curvaceous figures. 'It’s good to see music royalty like Beyoncé and Jay-Z sit alongside our own Royal Family.

Plans have been unveiled for more than 200 road building schemes that could rip through the heart of the British countryside. One of the routes includes a motorway tearing through the Peak District to link Manchester to Barnsley, despite a similar proposal being dumped in the 1990s because of strong opposition. Another unpopular plan has already been given approval for a road that would cut through Combe Haven nature reserve in East Sussex, linking Hastings and Bexhill.

Abby Nicol, from the Combe Haven Defenders, said it will train others looking to block road building elsewhere, and added: 'The government is sponsoring a new wave . of road building across the country. 'This amazing area, and others, will be destroyed unless we take action.' The Campaign for Better Transport told The Sunday Times it has uncovered plans for 190 road schemes, with most due to be published this autumn. It said they come from local authorities and Local Enterprise Partnerships - unelected, . business-led groups set up with Government approval to drive regional economic growth, including through transport infrastructure. Other schemes include widening the A303 from Hampshire to Devon, past Stonehenge. It is being led by a group of councils and is similar to plans abandoned by Government in the 1990s.

Local authorities have since been given greater control over roads and the Department for Transport said £7bn is lost every year because of traffic jams. It added: 'This is not only a brake on growth and prosperity but is environmentally damaging.'

"By . Anna Hodgekiss and James Rush . PUBLISHED: . 04:32 EST, 21 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:02 EST, 22 December 2012 . The number of cases of whooping cough has jumped from 944 last year to nearly 9,000 this year, according to the latest figures . After doctors up and down the country have dealt with an influx of patients suffering from norovirus, followed up by a wave of flu patients, medical staff are now gearing themselves for people needing help for whooping cough. The number of cases of whooping cough cases has jumped from 944 last year to 8,819 so far in 2012, according to the latest figures from the Health Protection Agency, with 1,080 coming in November alone. At the end of September, the Department of Health announced a vaccination programme for pregnant women, but the HPA has said it is still too early for this to have had an impact on the number of cases. The Department of Health has however recently reported an uptake of around 40 per cent in pregnant women. The total of 1,080 cases in November was in fact a decrease from October when 1,631 cases were reported for England and Wales, the first decrease in monthly numbers since the current outbreak started in the middle of last year. But, the HPA has warned a decrease in cases is usually seen at this time of year so does not necessarily represent the end of this severe outbreak. Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, consultant epidemiologist for immunisation at the HPA, said: 'The November figures show a welcome decrease of whooping cough cases since October. 'However, it is very important to note that we usually see a reduction in cases of whooping cough at this time of year so this decrease is in line with normal seasonal patterns. 'The recent announcement that at least 40 per cent of pregnant women received the whooping cough vaccine in the first month of the programme is very encouraging. 'We would like to remind pregnant women how serious this infection can be in young babies and how it can in some cases cause death. 'Vaccination between 28 and 38 weeks of pregnancy should offer babies the best protection against whooping cough before they receive their own vaccines. 'As well as this, parents should ensure their children are vaccinated against whooping cough on time, even babies of women who’ve had the vaccine in pregnancy – this is to continue their baby’s protection through childhood.' At least 40 per cent of pregnant woman have taken up the whooping cough vaccination since it was rolled out in September . Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, affects all ages. Young infants are at highest risk of severe complications and death from whooping cough as babies do not complete vaccination until they are around four months old. In older children and adults whooping cough can be an unpleasant illness but it does not usually lead to serious complications. Dr Amirthalingam said: 'Parents should also be alert to the signs and symptoms of whooping cough – which include severe coughing fits accompanied by the characteristic “whoop” sound in young children but as a prolonged cough in older children or adults.' Meanwhile, parents have also been warned the flu season has begun following an increase in the number of children aged five to 14 falling ill. The winter flu season has kicked off, parents have been warned, after an increase in the number of school children falling ill with the infection . Doctors were yesterday given the green light to prescribe antiviral medication to those who need it and people most at risk of the infection were urged to have a flu jab. Dr Richard Pebody, head of seasonal flu surveillance at the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said: 'We are seeing an increase in flu activity mainly among school children indicating the start of this year's flu season.' Flu cases in children aged five to 14 have doubled in the . past week to reach almost 17 cases per 100,000. And the worst affected area of the country appears to be North East England, according . to a London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine survey. The news comes as thousands of people around the country . continue to be hit by the winter vomiting bug, with nearly 900,000 people thought . to be affected. The start of the flu season will add pressure on hospitals . struggling with record levels of norovirus. Since Oct 1, 51 people have been admitted to intensive care with flu . and three people have died, according to the Daily Telegraph. Overall last week there were 23 GP consultations . per 100,000 people, high enough to trigger the use of antiviral medication in . vulnerable patients. Influenza occurs most often in winter and usually peaks . between December and March in the northern hemisphere. And it is not too late to have a vaccination, doctors have advised. Dr Pebody said: ‘Flu vaccination is still the most effective way of . preventing flu and it is not too late to get it so we would encourage all those . who are in “at risk” groups to get vaccinated as they are more vulnerable to . developing complications from flu. Maintaining good cough and hand hygiene, such as covering . your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough and sneeze, disposing of the . tissue as soon as possible and cleaning your hands as soon you can are important . actions that can help prevent the spread of germs and reduce the risk of . transmission. Symptoms include a sudden fever, cough, sore throat, as well . as aching muscles and joints. The best treatment for otherwise healthy people is to stay . at home and rest, drink plenty of fluids and take pain relief. Under-16s should not take medicine containing aspirin. HPA expert Dr Richard Pebody added: ‘Although unpleasant, flu is a . self-limiting illness and if you have flu it is best to stay at home until you . are well. If people in at risk groups develop symptoms consistent with flu, or . if anyone’s symptoms persist or become more severe, we advise they seek medical . advice.’ To see the current guidance for prescribing antivirals . please go to: www.nice.org.uk . It does not recommend antivirals for the . prevention of flu in otherwise healthy people under 65, even if they have been . in close contact with someone with a flu-like illness. ‘These include people with underlying conditions such as . heart problems, diabetes, lung, liver or renal diseases and those with weakened . immune systems, as well as older people and pregnant women. ‘Latest vaccine uptake figures for one of the ‘at risk’ groups – the over 65 age group – are encouraging, with more than 70 per cent . taking up the offer of the flu vaccine. ‘We do however continue to encourage people in clinical “at . risk”  groups, as well as healthcare . workers and carers who could pass the infection to vulnerable people, to ensure . they are vaccinated.' Anti-viral drugs should be administered for people at risk . of developing complications from flu, the HPA has said. The drugs reduce the severity of the disease, shorten it by . an average of one day and may help to limit the spread. Dr Pebody added: ‘As levels of flu have started to increase, . the HPA has recommended that antivirals should be used for the treatment and . prevention of flu in those who are at risk of serious complications. The use of . antivirals is recommended each year when flu is considered to be circulating in . the community.’ The NHS is ready for the flu outbreak, a senior official . said. Chief medical officer Professor Dame Sally Davies said: . ""The NHS is well prepared for an increase in winter-related health . problems, including flu. ‘Nearly half of under-65s who are most at risk from flu, . including children, have already had the flu jab. We urge patients who are most . at risk from flu and who have not yet had their vaccine to contact their GP as . soon as possible.’ HPA figures show the number of children affected by fever is significantly higher than this time last year . Dr Alma Adler, Research Fellow at the London School of . Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who is running the UK Flusurvey project which . tracks the regions most affected, said: ‘'The data are very preliminary . and flu levels are still very low but overall the results suggest that the . English region most affected by flu is the North East with 19,200 per 100,000.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 11:09 EST, 13 December 2012 . Sarah Palin's daughter-in-law Britta Hanson has shrugged off the end of her 18 month marriage to the family values advocate's eldest son Track, as it is revealed she will get custody of the couple's daughter Kyla - and Track will get the gun collection. Hanson, 22, tied the knot with Track, 23, on an Alaskan mountain near the Palin home in May 2011 and gave birth to their little girl three months later. But quizzed about her impending divorce yesterday, she seemed happy the short-lived marriage was coming to an end, insisting 'I'm fine with it.' Divorcing: Track Palin, centre right, and Britta Hanson, centre left, married in May 2011, on the slope in Alaska . 'We just filed the papers so we aren't . divorced yet,' she told RadarOnline. 'I'm not sure how long it will take . to get the divorce finalized.' Track's relationship breakdown isn't the first domestic disaster in the Palin household. His divorce comes after his sister Bristol's ongoing family dramas. Bristol famously got pregnant in 2008, just days after Sarah Palin was announced as John McCain's running mate, and gave birth to a little boy, Tripp, at age 18. She was twice engaged to the child's father, her high school boyfriend Levi . Johnston, but broke it off both times and the pair are now locked in a bitter custody battle. TMZ revealed this week that Track and Britta's seemingly happy love story was over after the pair jointly filed for divorce in an Alaskan court, in a further blow to Palin - a strong advocate for the traditional family unit. Custody: According to the court papers, Britta gets physical custody of little Kyla, pictured right with Track and the rest of the Palin family, and will share legal custody with Track . Under Alaska law, filing for divorce . together means Track and Britta have fully settled their property and . custody issues, including child support for Kyla, who is now . 15 months old. According to TMZ, which got its hands . on the court documents, Track walks away with his most prized . possessions, his gun collection, worth $1,000. The Army reservist also gets the . $30,000 Wells Fargo bank account and $500 worth of tools, while his . soon-to-be ex-wife Britta will walk away with her $2,500 bank account . and her $4,000 in jewelry. According to the court papers, Britta gets physical custody of little Kyla, and will share legal custody with Track. Track earns $42,800 a year and has . agreed to pay $642 a month in child support, with any other . child-related expenses, including medical and travel costs, being split . in half. The agreement also requires . Track and Britta to watch a 48-minute video showing them how to explain . the breakup of the family to their child. Pregnancy: Britta, pictured, gave birth to daughter Kyla three months after the wedding . Happy: The couple seemed happy about the birth of their child, though things obviously went downhill . In the interview with RadarOnline, Britta said she and Track are trying to keep a low profile while the divorce goes through. 'We want to keep our personal lives private and we don't want to say anything about each other or the situation,' she said. But she did say of her little girl: 'She's perfect. She's just so sweet.' Yesterday, Britta's mother, Elizabeth Hanson, confirmed the couple had separated. Delighted: At the wedding, Sarah Palin, pictured, said the families looked forward to the couple's long life together . She told MailOnline: 'They're not divorced, but they are separated. 'They're both very private and all I can say is that . they're concentrating on working to be the best parents they can be to their . daughter.' Abstinence . preacher Sarah Palin claimed she couldn't be happier when the high . school sweethearts wed in a ski slope ceremony last May. In a joint statement with Britta's parents, Ms Hanson and and Reverend Duane Hanson, who performed the ceremony, the Palin's said they looked forward to the couple's 'blessed' life together, but didn't mention the pregnancy. 'Our families couldn't be . happier! These are two hard working, humble, active, studious young . adults who grew up together,' the parents said. 'We're tickled that after two decades . of friendship we proudly witnessed their marriage, knowing their new . life together will be blessed.' After Kyla's birth, Britta's mother . expressed her delight over her first grandchild, telling RadarOnline the . little girl was 'great.' 'She’s beautiful. I’m very happy,' she said. 'I love my daughter and my son-in-law very much.' It's unclear what led to the couple's marriage unraveling. Kyla Grace is the second of Palin's . grandchildren after her daughter Bristol gave birth to Tripp, in 2008. Split: Bristol Palin, Levi Johnston and their son Tripp - Sarah Palin's first grandchild - pictured in July, 2010 before their break-up . Grandma: Sarah Palin, pictured with Tripp, became a grandma for the first time in 2008 after daughter Bristol, second from left, accidentally fell pregnant . Palin has famously advocated that schools teach . teenagers to abstain from sex before marriage and became an even stronger advocate after her daughter's unintended pregnancy. Pictures of an excited Britta before the couple's daughter was born suggested they were happy about the impending birth. One photo captioned 'my beautiful . britta pie!' taken after a baby shower, shows . the expectant mother smiling brightly and surrounded by gifts. Another, posted on a Wasilla woman's Facebook wall, shows Britta holding up a small hoodie as she smiles at the camera. Track became the first Palin child to get married when the couple wed last May.

Today, police barricaded roads . leading to India Gate, which has been the focus of protests and many . metro rail stations were also closed, crippling movement around the city . of 16million. The Government has faced criticism for the use of force used against protesters, the failure to implement laws to protect women in India's 'rape capital' and for how slow it has been to respond to the strength of feeling. Prime Minister Singh said in a televised address: 'I appeal to all concerned citizens to . maintain peace and calm. I assure you we will make all possible efforts . to ensure security and safety of women in this country.' He has come under fire for remaining largely silent since the rape.

Refused: Sally Roberts, 37, pictured outside the High Court yesterday, told a judge that she did not want her son Neon, 7, to receive surgery on a brain tumour . The boy snatched by his mother to save him from the ordeal of cancer treatment will have brain surgery today against her wishes. A judge ordered yesterday that seven-year-old Neon Roberts must be operated on ‘as soon as possible’. A doctor told the court that without treatment it was highly likely the child would die ‘after a relatively short period of time’. But Sally Roberts has refused to give her consent because she does not trust British doctors and fears her son will suffer long-term side effects from treatment. Mrs Roberts, 37, wants to seek second opinions from abroad and argued it is her ‘human right’ to decide what is best for Neon. But in the High Court yesterday, Mr Justice Bodey said: ‘We do not have the luxury of time. I am quite satisfied that surgery is in his best interests.’ Last night Neon was given his Christmas presents early before being taken to hospital. He was diagnosed two months ago with a medulloblastoma tumour, which doctors believed they had removed in full during a nine-hour operation on October 25. But Mrs Roberts refused to let her son receive radiotherapy following the first operation, and recent MRI scans picked up a growth of 1.5cm squared – either regrowth or residual tumour.

Of course it should . be. It is a human rights issue. ‘I’m not keeping this case going, spending taxpayers’ money, for . nothing. I believe in this. Death by doctor – people need to understand . how big a problem it is. I couldn’t forgive myself if I did nothing.’ The operation carries a risk of between 10 and 25 per cent that Neon . will be left mute. But despite experts unanimously reporting that his . cancer has returned and warning that he may have only two or three . months to live without treatment, Mrs Roberts said she believed doctors . were over-emphasising how ‘sick’ he is. ‘Everyone is talking of me depriving him of treatment, saying my son is . going to die.

Scrambling to keep pace with the public's mood in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, Hollywood executives cancelled the premiere of a third major film release in the wake of Friday's gun atrocity. Quentin Tarantino's ultra-violent spaghetti western Django Unchained has had its premiere, which was due to take place on Tuesday, replaced with a private screening for cast and crew only. This follows the cancellation of Tom Cruises action movie, Jack Reacher and the editing of a trailer for that film. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, and in this time of national mourning we have decided to forgo our scheduled event,' said producers the Weinstein Company. Scroll down for video . Big names: But the cast of Django Unchained will not be appearing in Hollywood on Monday due to the Newtown tragedy . The cancellation of the highly anticipated Tarantino movie which stars Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio follows the editing of a scene in which a sniper fires a semi-automatic gun from the latest Tom Cruise action film. The third film to have its premiere canceled is Parental Guidance starring Billy Crystal and Bette Midler, but the film is not thought to be as controversial as Django Unchained or Jack Reacher - which both contain scenes of graphic violence, death, blood and shootings. Django Unchained was scheduled for a Tuesday evening premiere at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, with stars Samuel L. Jackson, Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington due to walk down the red carpet. However, before the decision was taken out of their hands, Tarantino and Foxx offered varrying opinions on Hollywood's responsibility towards violence expressed in film. Insensitive: It was felt having a premiere of the violent western Django Unchained would not be the right thing to do . Star Jamie Foxx said that the entertainment industry needs to begin to bear some responsibility for violent content and graphic movies. 'We cannot turn our back and say that violence in films or anything that we do doesn't have a sort of influence,' said Foxx. 'It does.' However, Quentin Tarantino, whose career is littered with stylized and violent films such as 'Kill Bill' said that the issue was beginning to tire him. 'I just think you know there's violence in the world, tragedies happen, blame the playmakers,' said Tarantino said at a press junket on Saturday. 'It's a western. Give me a break.' Samuel L. Jackson who also appears in Django Unchained told the LA Times: 'I don't think it's about more gun control. I grew up in the south with guns everywhere and we never shot anyone. This is about people who aren't taught the value of life.' 'I don't think movies or video games have anything to do with it.' Scenes cut: Tom Cruise (left) and British actress Rosemund Pike pose upon their arrival to the premiere of the film Jack Reacher in Madrid, Spain. Reports suggest the film has been re-cut after the Sandy Hook massacre . A total of 28 people died in the Newtown shooting when alleged gunman Adam Lanza opened fire in the school before taking his own life. Of those who lost their lives, 20 were children between the ages of five and 10. Following the shooting, the decision was also made to postpone the premiere of Tom Cruise's latest movie Jack Reacher, which had been scheduled to take place on Saturday night in Pittsburgh. A statement from Paramount Pictures read: 'Due to the terrible tragedy in Newtown Connecticut, and out of honor and respect for the families of the victims whose lives were senselessly taken, we are postponing the Pittsburgh premiere of Jack Reacher. 'Our hearts go out to all those who lost loved ones.' Facing off: Leonardo's character is the sworn enemy of Jamie Foxx's in the forthcoming film . Celebrities throughout the world also took to Twitter to express their sadness over the tragedy, with many of them taking the tweet the National Rifle Association, the US group advocating gun use in America, directly. Susan Sarandon wrote: 'How much more suffering & loss will it take before we better regulate the sale of arms in our country? Let @NRA know how you feel.' And Ben Stiller added: 'Shocked and saddened by what happened today in Connecticut. We have to stop the access to guns in our country.' Mother-of-two Kourtney Kardashain wrote on her Twitter page: 'If this tragedy doesn't change something in this country regarding guns...I just want to scream and cry. Deeply saddened. Praying.' Meanwhile other big films set for release in the coming weeks, which includes Les Miserables, This is 40 and The Guilt Trip, held their premieres last week. The next big studio release likely to have a likely to have a glamour premiere is Gangster Squad, the Warner Bros. mob drama co-starring Sean Penn, Josh Brolin and Ryan Gosling, which is released on January 11. That film already had its release date pushed after the July shooting during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Colorado, because the studio needed time to excise a scene from the movie in which mobsters fire guns at people seated in a cinema. A violent episode of hit Syfy show Haven was pulled on Friday night in the wake of the tragic Sandy Hook school shooting which left 28 people dead. Then potentially sensitive episodes of Family Guy, American Dad and The Cleveland Show scheduled for broadcast by Fox on Sunday were also cancelled. And in the music world, Ke$ha's latest single 'Die Young' has been removed form radio stations across the country in the wake of the Sandy Hook tragedy. Ke$ha shockingly said that she never wanted to sing her controversial song in the first place, though she is credited as being one of its writers, TMZ first reported. The ‘Tik Tok’ singer did not elaborate as to why she believed she was ‘forced’ to sing the song in the first place. The singer took to Twitter on Tuesday to write: ‘I’m so so so sorry for anyone who has been effected (sic) by this tragedy. And I understand why my song is no inappropriate. Words cannot express.’ According to TMZ, 'Die Young' had reached 167 million listeners before Friday's shooting but had lost 19 million by Monday.","Tinseltown has rushed to cancel the premiere's and edit a slew of new releases in the wake of the Sandy Hook attack in which 20 children lost their lives .

Caring: Shannon was a 'loving and absolutely fantastic daughter' and her father said: 'The day Shannon died we died' A teenager died from undiagnosed deep vein thrombosis just hours after visiting an out-of-hours doctor’s surgery. Student Shannon Deakin, 16, limped into the surgery with 'knife-like' pains after her left thigh became swollen and turned red. Newly-qualified locum general practitioner Dr Karim Mohammed diagnosed an infection and gave her antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs at the Care UK walk-in centre. Shannon, of Hoyland in South Yorkshire, was told to see her own GP within 24 or 48 hours and have an ultrasound scan if she was not any better - but she collapsed and died at home about 12 hours later. After the Sheffield inquest her parents Bryan, 59, and Sue, 44, said they were considering taking legal action against the GP and Care UK. Mr Deakin said of their only child: 'We don’t think she was given a chance.' An expert emergency medical consultant Dr Alan Fletcher told the Sheffield hearing if Shannon had been referred to hospital that day she would likely have shown a high score on tests for DVT. She would have been given an ultrasound scan which would have led to treatment and her chances of survival would have been greatly improved. But he could not say Shannon, who had 11 GCSEs and was training to be a midwife, would 'more likely than not have survived if she had reached this point in treatment.' The GP should also have examined Shannon’s calves where swelling is a tell-tale sign of DVT but it was so rare in someone of her age a GP would think it was the least likely option. Dianette: Women taking a contraceptive pill are more likely to develop blood clots . Delivering a narrative verdict, coroner Chris Dorries said he had considered whether there was 'culpable human failure' in Shannon’s death or whether it had been 'contributed to by neglect' but he found the appropriate legal criteria were not met. The inquest heard Shannon had been prescribed the Dianette pill by her GP which is known to increase the chances of developing blood clots. She had been taking the pill for a month after complaining of acne affecting her back, chest and face but came off it because of side effects just a month before she died on December 4 last year. The pill was rated as a 'low risk' factor by experts who gave evidence. A post mortem showed Shannon died from a pulmonary embolism caused by a blood clot moving from her leg through her heart towards her lungs which pathologist Dr Mudher Al-Adnani said was 'extremely rare' in one so young. Dr Mohammed, who was on-call at the clinic based in Barnsley Hospital, said she came in complaining of a pain in the left side of her abdomen radiating to her groin. During a ten-minute consultation he noted a large, warm patch of redness on the front of her left thigh. Because of her brief period on the pill and a lack of negative family history he did not ask any further questions and excluded DVT from his diagnosis. 'I explained it was highly unlikely that it was a clot and my findings were more of an infection or muscular pain,' he said. But Shannon’s mother Susan, 43, who accompanied her daughter, told the inquest Dr Mohammed failed to notice her daughter’s swollen left foot and she left 'walking on the back of her pump'. The doctor told her: 'It’s either a blood clot or an infection.' Shannon even texted her cousin four hours after the consultation with the same message and a later text read 'moving a tiny amount kills'. Just 12 hours later she collapsed on the settee at the family’s home. Risks: Women are more at risk of a blood clot if they smoke, are overweight or have diabetes . Dianette, which has the medical name cyproterone acetate, works by suppressing the action of testosterone on the body's tissues.It is also used as a hormone therapy in men undergoing sex change treatment, as well as in tackling early onset puberty. The NHS website said Dianette is only used to treat acne when previous treatments have not been successful. Women are more at risk of a blot clot if they smoke, have polycystic ovary syndrome, are seriously overweight, recently had a baby, have high blood pressure or diabetes or conditions such as Crohn's disease. The NHS warns women taking the pill to be wary of signs including migraines for the first time, pain or swelling in legs, stabbing pain when they breathe, pain in the chest or sudden changes to eyesight or hearing. GP expert Dr James Gray said the locum’s assessment was 'reasonable' but it may have been prudent for him to arrange an ultrasound scan and he did not pick up on Shannon’s swollen foot which could have raised suspicions of a blood clot in the lower leg. He remained 'unconvinced' the GP had looked into all the risk factors associated with DVT. Mr Dorries’ conclusion read: 'Shannon Deakin died in consequence of an undiagnosed DVT. 'Shannon had sought medical assistance at lunchtime the previous day and whilst there are unresolved conflicts of evidence about that consultation it cannot be said, even at its highest, that the examination and assessment amounted to gross failure. 'Furthermore, even if diagnosed at that time it cannot be said that a referral to hospital would more likely than not have saved Shannon’s life.' After the hearing Mrs Deakin said: 'We took the GP at his word. Things could definitely have been done more differently and Shannon might have stood a chance. 'We haven’t a clue how she got DVT. I kept asking her if she had suffered a fall or a bump but she said not. It is a complete mystery.' Mr Deakin said: 'She was perfectly fine three days earlier. It just came on so quickly. Since her death it has been a total living nightmare. The day Shannon died we died.'","Shannon Deakin stopped taking the Dianette pill four weeks before her death .

'While the 2011 discoveries affirm . the Mekong as a region of astonishing bidoversity, many new species are . already struggling to survive in shrinking habitats,' said Mr Cox. 'Only by investing in nature . conservation, especially protected areas, and developing greener . economics, will we see these new species protected and keep alive the . hope of finding other intriguing species in years to come,' he added. In particular, the tube-nosed bat depends on tropical forest for its survival and is especially vulnerable to deforestation. To date, 30 per cent of the Greater Mekong's forests have disappeared within four decades. The WWF singled out Laos' ongoing construction of the Xayaburi dam on the main stream of the Mekong River - which . supports around 850 fish species - as a 'significant' threat to the . region's extraordinary biodiversity. 'The Mekong River supports levels of aquatic biodiversity second only to the Amazon River,' Mr Cox said. 'The .

Andrew McGarry deliberately slammed the Vauxhall Zafira into the front of the terraced home early one morning in July. The car exploded and set the house on fire but nobody was hurt. Architect McGarry,37, of Harwood, Bolton, Greater Manchester, admitted causing arson with intent to endanger life and property at Bolton Crown Court. McGarry launched a campaign calling . for drivers to stick to the 30mph speed limit after his then . two-year-old daughter Lacey was knocked down and injured outside the . family home in 2010. He was remanded in custody until he is sentenced on January 18. He will also be sentenced then for breaching a non-molestation order, which he admitted at an earlier hearing. No action will be taken against two charges of arson recklessly endangering life. McGarry was the only person in his Vauxhall Zafira when the crash happened. He drove his car into the house in Horwich, while his wife, Heather, and their three children were inside, at 7.05am on Tuesday, July 24.

Pen vandal: Graham Hoodless, 68, waged a nine-week revenge campaign on an Asda supermarket in Peterborough by pushing pens into foodstuffs. He has been banned from the store for two years and was ordered to pay £695 compensation . A pensioner who waged a nine-week campaign of revenge against an Asda store by hiding pens in food has been banned from the shop. Graham Hoodless, 68, contaminated meat, fish, cheese and cakes in the supermarket's branch in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, by pushing small pens from a bookies into the foodstuffs. Mr Hoodless decided to take revenge after he was falsely accused of defacing newspapers in the store. The hidden pen campaign cost the supermarket giant nearly £700. Peterborough Crown Court heard how Mr Hoodless waged a 'repeated and sustained campaign' against the shop by sneaking the pens into packaging when staff were not looking. Horrified customers only discovered them when they started preparing their food to cook or eat. The retired oil refinery worker was only caught when suspicious store bosses spotted him on CCTV hovering by the Halal meat counter. Hoodless, from Peterborough, pleaded guilty to contaminating or infecting food with intent to cause public alarm. During sentencing on December 17 Judge Sean Enright ordered the pen vandal to pay Asda £694.50 compensation - although some of this sum has already been paid back. Anthony Hook, prosecuting, told the . court: 'The offences started in July this year. Staff started to find . pens had been put into food stuff on the shelves. 'Others . were found by customers when they got home with their shopping. Items . contaminated included fish, bread, meat, cakes, cheese and ready meals.' Mr Hook said the damage to the store's reputation was 'incalculable'. Christopher Gillespie, defending, handed character references to the Judge, describing Mr Hoodless as a 'devoted family man'. He said: 'He is a man of previous good character, and pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. Pen pusher: Mr Hoodless was caught on CCTV pushing the pen's into food at Asda in Rivergate, Peterborough, pictured. He had previously been falsely accused of defacing newspapers in the store .

League tables are to be published to measure the performance of surgeons – including their patients’ survival rates. From next summer, online comparisons can be made of doctors who specialise in procedures including hip and knee replacements and weight-loss surgery. NHS officials say it will give patients more power and enable them to choose to have their operation carried out by a top surgeon at another hospital. Online league tables are to be published detailing the performances of doctors who specialise in procedures including hip and knee replacements and weight-loss surgery (file picture) But there are concerns that doctors might try to avoid operating on risky patients – such as the elderly or those with underlying illnesses – to keep their death rates low. Professor Kevin Burnand, from King’s College London, said: ‘I think groups of patients who look bad will be turned down for surgery.’ He also said that doctors who had a ‘bad run’ of luck with patients dying under their care would appear to be performing badly. Anna Dixon, director of policy at the health think-tank the King’s Fund, said similar issues had been raised when such rankings were introduced in New York. Sir David Nicholson, chief executive of NHS Commissioning Board, wants to give power to the patient . She said it was important that the performance data took into account whether a surgeon had operated on high-risk patients. The plans were outlined yesterday by the NHS Commissioning Board, a new organisation tasked with overseeing GPs and hospital care. By summer, patients will be able to visit the NHS Choices website and compare the performance of doctors specialising in head and neck operations, bariatric – or weight loss, orthopaedic and bowel and stomach procedures. Sir David Nicholson, chief executive of the board, said: ‘What you need is patients with power, with influence, with information and you need clinicians with resources, the tools, the money to make the change happen.’ Officials also hope it will drive up standards and expose those surgeons who are putting patients at risk. A spokesman for the British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said: ‘We support measures that will allow patients to have more information about their care and health outcomes. ‘However, there is still more to be done to ensure that data about consultants’ performance is meaningful. ‘Basic mortality figures alone could mislead patients because they fail to take into account other factors that might have contributed to the death of a patient.’","Online comparisons to be published on NHS Choices website next summer .

Operation: Baroness Thatcher is 'absolutely fine' following the surgery, a spokeswoman said . Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was kept in hospital last night as she recovers from a minor operation. Friends said it was likely that the ex-Tory party leader would spend Christmas there after surgeons removed a growth from her bladder. Baroness Thatcher, 87, was admitted to the Central London hospital on Thursday after complaining of feeling unwell. Last night, Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted her ‘a speedy recovery’. And sources close to her said she was doing well and ‘in very good spirits’. One source said: ‘When someone is of Lady Thatcher’s age, there’s always concern after an operation, but she is fine.’ PR guru Tim Bell, who was one of her closest advisers, said: ‘The operation was a success and her condition is satisfactory.’ Lady Thatcher has suffered from increasingly frail health, including a minor stroke, in recent years. She is rarely seen in public because her memory is failing. But she remains interested in Tory politics and is a regular presence at parties thrown by Liam Fox, the former defence secretary. Advertising guru Lord Bell, who was Lady Thatcher’s chief election campaign adviser, said she had had a procedure to remove the lump. He added: ‘Following an examination in hospital on Wednesday Mrs Thatcher had a minimal invasive operation to remove a growth in her bladder. ‘The operation was completely satisfactory. She will stay in hospital to recuperate for a few days and then she will return home. Her daughter Carol was with her in hospital. She’s very tough. ‘The doctors are perfectly happy. They say the operation has been completely satisfactory.’ Lady Thatcher was the first female prime minister of Great Britain and one of the few national leaders to win three successive terms of office. She spent 11 years in Downing Street, the longest run by any 20th century prime minister. In 1990, a leadership challenge forced her to leave No 10 and two years later she was made a life peer, as Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven. Recovering: Baroness Thatcher (centre) with son Mark and his wife Sarah at Downing Street in October . In recent years she has led a quiet . life cared for by her loyal housekeeper Kate.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 14:01 EST, 20 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:49 EST, 20 December 2012 . Sen. Daniel Inouye, the second-longest serving senator in U.S. history, was remembered Thursday as a man who gallantly defended his country on the battlefield and gracefully sought to better it during the 50-plus years he represented his beloved state of Hawaii. Colleagues and aides lined the Capitol rotunda five deep to say farewell. The rare ceremony demonstrated the respect and goodwill he generated over the years. Only 31 people have lain in the Capitol rotunda; the last was former President Gerald R. Ford nearly six years ago. The last senator so honored was Democrat Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota in 1978. Comfort: Vice President Joe Biden paid personal tribute to Daniel Inouye. Biden recalled being moved that a man who had lost his right arm so eagerly embraced life and sought to make others feel better. 'Daniel Inouye was an institution, and he deserved to spend at least another day in this beautiful building where he dedicated his life,' said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. Inouye's closed casket was draped with the American flag during the morning ceremony and placed atop the same catafalque that supported the coffin of Abraham Lincoln. His family and staff looked on as Reid, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Vice President Joe Biden paid tribute to a man who Biden said made him proud to be called a senator. Boehner noted that Inouye was Hawaii's first congressman. In his early days in Washington, Inouye's modesty would never have allowed him to think he would walk the halls of the Capitol for the next five decades. Honor: Daniel Inouye was the first senator to have lain in the Capitol rotunda since Hubert Humphrey in 1978 . 'He couldn't have fathomed all the good that he would do here, helping to build a new state, gaining rights benefits for veterans, supporting agriculture, speaking out against injustice, becoming one of the most revered senators in our history,' Boehner said. Inouye died Monday from respiratory complications. The soft-spoken but powerful Democratic chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee was 88. Veteran: Daniel Inouye wears the uniform of the U.S. Army's 442nd Regimental Combat Team, made up almost entirely of Japanese-Americans during World War II . Before Inouye made his mark as a politician, he did so as a war hero who lost his right arm while leading his platoon into battle on a ridge in Italy. He eventually was awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military honor. Biden recalled how Inouye supported his own first run for the Senate and was one of the first to comfort him and try to raise his spirits when his wife and baby daughter died in an automobile accident shortly after his election. Biden recalled being moved that a man who had lost his right arm so eagerly embraced life and sought to make others feel better. 'I've never met a man or woman with as much physical and mental courage as Daniel Inouye,' Biden said. After Inouye became Hawaii's first congressman following statehood in 1959, he won election to the Senate in 1962. He was the first Japanese-American elected to both the House and Senate and was serving his ninth term in the Senate when he died. As a legislator, his specialty was steering federal money to his home state to develop the kinds of roads, schools and housing other Americans had on the mainland. Inouye's body will be escorted Friday to the Washington National Cathedral and will be returned to Hawaii on Saturday. Tribute: The widow of Senator Daniel Inouye, Irene Hirano Inouye (center), observes his casket as it lies in state in the Capitol rotunda in Washington DC . Inouye, a senator since January 1963, . was currently the longest serving senator and was president pro tempore . of the Senate, third in the line presidential succession. His office . said Monday that he died of respiratory complications at a . Washington-area hospital. He was 88. Inouye was a World War II hero and Medal of Honor winner who lost an arm to a German hand grenade during a battle in Italy. He became the first Japanese-American . to serve in Congress, when he was elected to the House in 1959, the . year Hawaii became a state. He won election to the Senate three . years later and served there longer than anyone in American history . except Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who died in 2010 after 51 years in . the Senate. Although tremendously popular in his . home state, Inouye actively avoided the national spotlight until he was . thrust into it. He was the keynote speaker at the 1968 Democratic . National Convention, and later reluctantly joined the Senate's select . committee on the Watergate scandal. The panel's investigation led to the . resignation of President Richard Nixon. Inouye also served as chairman of the . committee that investigated the Iran-Contra arms and money affair, . which rocked Ronald Reagan's presidency. Dedication: Daniel Inouye loved both his country and his state. He witnessed President Eisenhower admitting Hawaii into the union as the 50th state in August 1959 . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said 'Daniel Inouye was an institution, and he deserved to spend at least another day in this beautiful building where he dedicated his life.' In 2000, Inouye was one of 22 . Asian-American World War II veterans who belatedly received the nation's . top honor for bravery on the battlefield, the Medal of Honor. The . junior senator from Hawaii at the time, Daniel Akaka, had worked for . years to get officials to review records to determine if some soldiers . had been denied the honor because of racial bias. Inouye's first political campaign in . 1954 helped break the Republican Party's political domination of Hawaii. He was elected to the Territorial House of Representatives, where he . served as majority leader. He became a territorial senator in 1958. Inouye was serving as Hawaii's first . congressman in 1962, when he ran for the Senate and won 70 percent of . the vote against Republican Benjamin Dillingham II, a member of a . prominent Hawaii family. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson . urged Vice President Hubert Humphrey, who had won the Democratic . nomination for president, to select Inouye as his running mate. But . Inouye was not interested. 'He was content in his position as a . U.S. senator representing Hawaii,' Jennifer Sabas, Inouye's Hawaii chief . of staff, said in 2008. Inouye reluctantly joined the Watergate proceedings at the strong urging of Senate Democratic leader Mike Mansfield. The panel's investigation of the role . of the Nixon White House in covering up a burglary at Democratic . National Committee headquarters at the Watergate in June 1972 ultimately . prompted the House to initiate impeachment proceedings against Nixon, . who resigned before the issue reached a vote in the House. After the hearings, Inouye said he . thought the committee's findings 'will have a lasting effect on future . presidents and their advisers. It will help reform the campaign practices of the nation.' Lofty: The view of Senator Daniel Inouye's memorial ceremony from the top of the Capitol . Respects: A joint military honor guard carries in the casket of Daniel Inouye . He achieved celebrity status when he . served as chairman of the congressional panel investigating the . Iran-Contra affair in 1987. That committee held lengthy hearings . into allegations that top Reagan administration officials had . facilitated the sale of weapons to Iran, in violation of a congressional . arms embargo, in hopes of winning the release of American hostages in . Iran and to raise money to help support anti-communist fighters in . Nicaragua. 'This was not a happy chore, but it had to be done,' Inouye said of the hearings. The panel sharply criticized Reagan . for what it considered laxity in handling his duties as president. 'We . were fair,' Inouye said. 'Not because we wanted to be fair but because . we had to be fair.' Born September 7, 1924, to immigrant . parents in Honolulu, Inouye was 17 and dreaming of becoming a surgeon . when Japanese planes flew over his home to bomb Pearl Harbor on December . 7, 1941, changing the course of his life. In 1943, Inouye volunteered for the . Army and was assigned to the famed Japanese-American 442nd Regimental . Combat Team, which earned the nickname 'Go For Broke' and was one of the . most decorated units of the war. Inouye rose to the rank of captain and . earned the Distinguished Service Cross and Bronze Star. Many of the 22 . veterans who received Medals of Honor in 2000 had been in the 442nd. On April 21, 1945, he was leading a . charge on a machine gun nest in Italy's Po Valley. He was shot in the . abdomen, but kept inching toward the machine gun and managed to throw . two grenades before his right arm was shattered by a German grenade. Even then, he continued to direct his platoon . 'By his gallant, aggressive tactics . and by his indomitable leadership, Second Lieutenant Inouye enabled his . platoon to advance through formidable resistance,' his Medal of Honor . citation said. Ceremony: The second-longest-serving senator in history lies in state . After the war, he returned to Hawaii . and received a bachelor's degree in government and economics from the . University of Hawaii in 1950. He graduated from George Washington . University's law school in 1952. Inouye proposed to Margaret Shinobu Awamura on their second date, and they married in 1949. Their only child, Daniel Jr., was . born in 1964. When his wife died in 2006, Inouye said, 'It was a most . special blessing to have had Maggie in my life for 58 years.' He remarried in 2008, to Irene Hirano, a Los Angeles community leader. Inouye shunned the trappings of . Washington's elite, rising to go to work in a car pool and leaving the . telephone number of his Bethesda, Md., home in the phone book. He took pride in handling even the smallest requests from his constituents. He said he once was awakened at 2 . a.m. by a telephone call from a Hawaii family asking for help in getting . a soldier home for a family emergency. Inouye said he immediately . called the Pentagon, and 30 minutes later the soldier had his orders to . return home. 'That's a special type of satisfaction that I can enjoy that none of you can,' he said.","Daniel Inouye, 88, died from respiratory complications on December 17 .

Manpower: Treasury Minister David Gauke has admitted the child benefits cuts would need 450 tax officials at a cost of £11 million . The row over ‘middle-class’ child benefit cuts deepened last night, with claims the controversial Coalition changes will eat up more manpower than chasing millionaires avoiding their taxes. Treasury Minister David Gauke has admitted more than 450 tax officials will be needed to implement the ‘high-income’ benefit cuts from next month at a cost of more than £11 million a year. He also signalled no new staff were being taken on, prompting fears people have been diverted from other vital work within Revenue & Customs. Last night, Labour seized on the figures, saying that even the Revenue’s affluence unit – set up to target wealthy individuals trying to evade or avoid tax – had only 300 staff. They also contrasted the benefit cutbacks staff with the Revenue’s ‘offshore co-ordination unit’, which focuses on citizens who hide money offshore to avoid UK tax – claiming that it would only have 100 staff by 2015. Rachel Reeves, the Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘It’s shocking that HMRC is employing more staff to take money from  hard-working parents than it does to clamp down on offshore tax avoidance and evasion.’ A Treasury spokesman accused Labour of using ‘disingenuous’ figures: ‘They ignore the fact the Coalition is investing nearly £1 billion in HMRC  to combat evasion and aggressive avoidance.’ The benefit changes, which take effect on January 7, will affect around one million families. Households with one person earning £50,000 or more will no longer receive full child benefit, worth £1,055 a year for one-child families. But under the cutbacks, parents affected will keep receiving child benefit unless they notify HMRC by January 7 that they want to opt out. If they do not, any overpayment of child benefit  will be clawed back in extra tax.

Lady Marina-Charlotte Windsor, 20, showed up to the Queen's pre-Christmas lunch sporting a tragus piercing . When the Queen invited her nearest and dearest to a pre-Christmas lunch, the code was dress to impress. Quite what she thought about the new ‘tragus’ piercing being sported by the Duke of Kent’s grand-daughter, 20-year-old Lady Marina-Charlotte Windsor, though, is anyone’s guess. For the uninitiated, the tragus is the small flap of cartilage that sticks out in front of the ear canal. The piecing is usually made with a small hollow needle. According to those in the know, they ‘hurt like hell’. It wouldn’t have been the first time the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh have seen such an outlandish body piercing. Zara Phillips once famously sported a tongue stud and still boasts a bejewelled belly button. Zara, who had her tongue pieced when she was just 17 at a tattoo parlour near her boarding school, Gordonstoun, for just £35, famously unveiled her stud to the rest of the Royal Family at uncle Prince Charles’s 50th birthday party in 1998. Fortunately her unflappable mother, Princess Anne, took it all entirely in her stride and just asked her if she was able to speak properly. Lady Marina was educated privately at £30,000-a-year St Mary’s, Ascot and is believed to be on a gap year ahead of studying at Oxford with hopes of working for the United Nations or pursuing a career in international diplomacy - a talent she might have needed to use while chatting to Prince Philip about her piercing over the dinner table. Prince Charles arriving for pre-Christmas lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace . The tragus piercing was made popular by celebrities including Scarlett Johansson when she starred in the Woody Allen film Match Point . Her father is the Duke and Duchess of Kent’s eldest son and heir, the genial George, Earl of St Andrew’s, and his Canadian academic wife, Sylvana Tomaselli, who is a don at Cambridge. She gave up her right to the throne when she followed her mother by being received into the Catholic Church. She and her family do, however, continue to appear regularly at royal events including on the balcony at Buckingham Palace after Trooping the Colour and at last year’s royal wedding. Lady Marina is also a close friend of that other royal rebel, Princess Eugenie. Two years ago Lady Marina, who was named after her great-grandmother, a legendary beauty, and her younger sister, Lady Amelia, and elder brother, Edward, Baron Downpatrick, launched themselves with a glamorous fashion shoot in society bible Tatler magazine, where she wore a series of elegant evening gowns - and no hint of a piercing in sight. The magazine declared that the two girls had ‘glamour in their genes’ and were the future Windsors to watch - a spot-on prediction if the blue-blooded beauty’s latest adornment is anything to go by.","Piercing through cartilage in front of ear canal said to 'hurt like hell'

Tragedy: Miss Saldanha was found dead days after receiving a hoax phone call at London's King Edward VII hospital . Criminal charges could be brought following the death of a nurse who hanged herself after transferring a call that led to intimate calls about the Duchess of Cambridge being revealed. Scotland Yard has submitted a file to the Crown Prosecution Service relating to the prank call made to the King Edward VII hospital in London where Kate Middleton was staying. Jacintha Saldanha, 46, a night sister, was found dead in lodgings close to the hospital after she unwittingly answered a story from Australian DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian posing as the Queen and Prince Charles. A colleague then described Kate's condition in detail to the DJs who have faced a strong public backlash following the prank. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will now consider whether any potential offences may have been committed, Scotland Yard said. The mother-of-two was found dead by a colleague and a security guard on December 7, three days before her involvement in the prank. Miss Saldanha left two notes in her room and was found with marks on her wrist when her body was discovered, Westminster Coroner's Court in London heard as an inquest was opened and adjourned. Greig and Christian spoke of their grief on Australian television soon after the nurse's death. They said their prank had prompted 'a tragic turn of events no-one could have predicted or expected'. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Following the death of Jacintha Saldanha, officers have liaised with the CPS as to whether any criminal offences had been committed in relation to the hoax call made to King Edward VII Hospital in the early hours of Tuesday December 4. Prank: Australian DJs Michael Christian and Mel Greig who were responsible for prank call to King Edward VII hospital . 'On Wednesday December 19, officers submitted a file to the CPS for them to consider whether any potential offences may have been committed by making the hoax call. Miss Saldanha is thought to have left three notes in total, following her death, including one criticising the hospital. In another, the mother of two detailed her anguish and shame about being duped by the two Australian DJs into passing on the call. The third dealt with her requests for her funeral, which was held in her hometown of Shirva, south-west India earlier this week. Prince William and his pregnant wife Kate said they were 'deeply saddened' by the tragedy. A Palace spokesman said the couple had not made a complaint about the prank call. 'Their thoughts and prayers are with Jacintha Saldanha’s family, friends and colleagues at this very sad time,' a statement said. At a memorial service in Westminster Cathedral before her body was flown to India, Miss Saldanha's husband Benedict Barboza said his wife’s death had left him devastated. Mourning: Jacintha Saldanha's widower Ben Barboza, centre and their children Lisha and Junal stand next to her coffin at a cemetery in Shirva, India . The couple’s son Junal, 17, and adopted daughter Lisha, 14, also paid tribute before travelling with her body to Mangalore. Following the service in central London, Mr Barboza, 49, an NHS accountant, said: ‘My wife, you were the light in my darkness, who always showed me the way forward. From the day we met, you always stood by me in times of hardship and happiness. ‘I feel a part of me has been ripped out,’ he added, fighting back tears. ‘Without your beautiful smile and sparkling personality, the house is an empty place to live. Loss: Jacintha Saldanha and her husband Ben Barboza. Mr Barboza described her as 'the light in my darkness' ‘Nineteen years of togetherness with a strong bond of affection and understanding will be cherished forever in my life. Your loss is a very painful one and nobody can take that place in my life ever again. I love you and miss you forever.’ Miss Saldanha's daughter Lisha, 14, said: ‘We will miss your laughter, the loving memories and the good times we had together. The house is an empty dwelling without your presence. ‘We are shattered and there's an unfillable void in our lives. 'We love you mum, sleep in peace and watch over us until me meet again in heaven. We will always love you and keep you close to our heart.’ Her son Junal said: ‘Our mother, kind hearted, generous and a well-respected woman in both of our lives. You were the core of the family who kept is together. ‘In times of difficulty you showed us the way forward to happiness and success. Your priority for us was a good education and a bright future. You taught us right from wrong which we appreciate. ‘You worked tirelessly to give us everything that we have today. When we achieved good grades and merit, your pat on our backs encouraged us more.’ Standing outside the cathedral alongside their local MP Charlotte Leslie and MP Keith Vaz, who has been campaigning on behalf of the family, Mr Barboza said the family ‘could not have foreseen the unprecedented tragedy that has unfolded in our lives’. ‘The events of the last week have shattered our lives. We barely have the strength to withstand the grief and sorrow.’ Sadness: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leaving King Edward VII's Hospital after Kate had been treated for severe morning sickness. The couple said they were 'deeply saddened' by the tragedy . Hoax: Australian DJ Mel Greig who posed as the Queen during the prank call . As besieged radio host Mel Greig remained in hiding, it was revealed that her father was so worried about threats to his family that he hired a security guard to protect his home. A neighbour of 30-year-old Miss Greig’s father, whose full identity has not been revealed, said he, too, had gone into hiding as the furore over the royal radio prank raged on. Neighbours in the Happy Valley suburb of Adelaide said that if Miss Greig intended spending Christmas with her father and other family members it was unlikely to be in Mr Greig’s house. One neighbour told Adelaide’s Sunday Mail that Mr Greig, who has not been well, had not been seen at the house for more than a week – and before he vanished he was so concerned for his family's life he had hired a security guard to watch the property. ‘The guard was hired to sit out the front of the house, keeping watch around the clock,’ said the neighbour. The neighbour – who wished to remain anonymous – said she had been told by the guard that threatening messages had been left on the family’s answering machine from all over the world. ‘It’s just so sad how the whole thing got out of hand,’ she said. ‘I know the dad hasn’t been well so this wouldn’t be doing him any good.’ Nurse Jacintha Saldanha committed suicide in the days following the prank call in which Miss Greig and her radio co-host Michael Christian pretended to be the Queen and Prince Charles and was put through to Kate Middleton’s private ward at King Edward VII by Miss Saldanha. Apologies: DJ's Michael Christian and Mel Greig during an interview on Australia's Channel Seven . As the controversy refused to subside, Miss Greig and Mr Christian remained in hiding, friends of Miss Greig saying she was in a fragile state. But she wanted to thank people in her home town of Adelaide for their support. In a public message she issued yesterday through Adelaide’s Sunday Mail and Sydney’s Daily Telegraph she said: . ‘The love and support that I’m getting from everyone in Adelaide has helped me immensely through this. ‘Adelaide is my home and to see them rally behind me has been incredible. ‘Nothing will ever take away the pain I feel for Jacintha and her family, but the one thing I’ve learned from this situation is to use the support around you.’ Friends said her primary concern remains for the family of nurse Saldanha.

A dog lover spoke of his amazement yesterday after he was reunited with the runaway pet he thought had died, two days after burying the wrong animal. Scott Walker, 36, had been searching for his missing border terrier Jimmy for a week when he received devastating news that a dog had been found dead next to a busy road. A heartbroken Scott and his girlfriend Cathy Herse, 35, went to the scene and as the dead dog was barely recognisable, the couple thought it was their beloved Jimmy. Jimmy went missing after he ran off chasing a deer during a lunchtime walk in Pentland Hills, near Edinburgh, on December 10 . The tearful couple said their goodbyes and buried the dog, but two days later Scott received a phone call from a lady who had found Jimmy. Mr Walker, from Edinburgh, said: 'It's unbelievable, but true. It really is a Christmas miracle. We got a call from a lovely lady saying she found him in her garden. 'She managed to get him to come for food and she popped a lead on him. She then got him some food and water and called us. We got a very warm welcome from him and he's now sleeping in his favourite place. 'Sadly, we buried another wee doggy that we thought was Jimmy. It was the same colour and the same size but it was very difficult to identify. We had no reason not to think it was him.' Jimmy ran off chasing a deer during a lunchtime walk with Mr Walker and Ms Herse in Pentland Hills, near Edinburgh, on December 10. The couple printed off more than . 1,000 flyers and 100 posters in their hunt for the dog, and Mr Walker . even took a week off work to concentrate on the search.

However, two days later their grieving was interrupted by a phone call from a resident in nearby Fairmilehead, who had spotted a 'missing' poster they had placed on Facebook. She said she had Jimmy, and that he was fit and well. Mr Walker said: 'I couldn't believe it. To say we had given up hope was an understatement. We had just buried him, after all. 'He was limping slightly and had a bit of a wild look in his eye, but other than that he was fine. We took him to the vet and found that he had lost over a kilo in weight. It's thought that he survived by maybe feeding on a dead deer carcass.'","Jimmy the border terrier went missing during a walk near Edinburgh .

The Vatican’s top astronomer has some assurances to offer - the world won’t be ending in eight days, despite predictions to the contrary.

Internet ahead of the purported December 21 apocalypse.

He acknowledged that the Universe was slowly expanding but that the destruction of the Earth – if it ever does occur – will not happen for billions of years. But he said Christians profoundly believe that 'death can never have the last word.' The Mayan Long Count calendar begins in 3,114 B.C., marking time in roughly 394-year periods known as Baktuns. The Mayans wrote that the significant 13th Baktun ends December 21. A few years ago Father Funes said that extraterrestrial life was a valid area of investigation for the Catholic Church.

More than 3,800 British troops fighting in Afghanistan will be home by Christmas next year, David Cameron announced yesterday. The plan is a further step to the withdrawal of all UK forces from a combat role by 2014, but ministers have denied that the process has been speeded up. The Prime Minister told the House of Commons that troop levels pitted against the Taliban are to be cut by almost half of their current strength by the end of 2013, down from 9,000 to 5,200. Prime Minister David Cameron agreed the withdrawal of 4,000 British troops from Afghanistan during a telephone call with President Barack Obama last night . Mr Cameron made the decision after commanders told him that Afghan forces will be able to assume the lead role in combat operations across the country next year. UK forces are already beginning to pull out of mentoring Afghan troops at the  frontline. By the end of 2013 they will only advise at brigade level, leaving Afghan commanders to run combat operations. Mr Cameron said: ‘Because of the success of our forces and the Afghan National Security Forces, we will be able to see troops come home in two relatively even steps – 2013 and 2014 – leaving probably around 5,200 troops after the end of 2013, compared with the 9,000 that we have now.’ However, senior Government sources said that the eventual number coming home in 12 months time could in fact be nearer to 4,000. Mr Cameron announced the reduction in British troops in Afghanistan during Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons . The Prime Minister has said that by the end of 2014 Britain will no longer be taking part in combat operations. But he signalled that a token force would stay to help at a Sandhurst-style officer training college that the UK is helping to set up. ‘After December 2014, there will still be some troops involved in returning equipment and dealing with logistics,’ he said. He added: ‘We will not be leaving Afghanistan in terms of our support and our help for the Afghans. ‘We will be contributing £70million a year to help pay for the Afghan National Security Forces, we will have an aid programme in excess of £70million a year.’ Chancellor George Osborne has been pushing for a speedy withdrawal to save money. The Afghan war is expected to have cost taxpayers £20billion by the end of next year. But Defence Secretary Philip Hammond denied that the Government has speeded up the withdrawal. Mr Hammond said: ‘It’s not a speeded up anything. ‘This is us announcing today our planning for the trajectory between where we are now, which is 9,000 troops in theatre, and where we need to get to by the end of 2014, which is the finish of our combat operations.’ Afghan forces now have lead security responsibility in areas which are home to three-quarters of the country’s population, and are providing a lead role on more than 80 per cent of conventional operations and carrying out 90 per cent of their own training, he said. British numbers in Afghanistan will be reduced to a token force by 2014 . The ability of the Afghan forces to take on the Taliban has been questioned as a result of a series of 'green on blue' incidents which have seen Taliban sympathisers infiltrate the local security forces and murder British soldiers . In Helmand province, where the bulk of UK troops are based, Mr Hammond said the Afghans are now ‘firmly in charge’ in populated areas. The Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir David Richards, said drawdown plans were ‘based on military advice’ and followed discussion with General John Allen, the leading US commander in Afghanistan. ‘The Afghan National Army and police have greatly improved in the past years,’ General Richards said. ‘To be in the position where we are now able to commit to reducing UK force levels to around 5,200 by the end of next year is testament to the professionalism and courage of those personnel who have served, and continue to serve, in Afghanistan.’","Prime Minister David Cameron agreed move with President Obama last night .

Behind bars: John Duffy had a five year illicit relationship with a teenage girl he seduced when she was just 12 . A parish councillor is today starting a 12 year sentence behind bars for exploiting his status as a 'pillar of the community' to have an affair with a teenage schoolgirl. Married youth group leader John Duffy used his position of respectability as a cover for his five year illicit relationship with the besotted youngster during the 1990s. After befriending her through his youth club, Duffy seduced her when she was just 12 then had regular sexual liaisons with the girl - promising her marriage and even showing her holiday brochures of where he said they would go on their honeymoon. He even spent the night with the teenager while his wife was in hospital giving birth to their third child. The girl was said to have been 'completely infatuated' with Duffy but their relationship fizzled out after the girl became pregnant at 15 and subsequently had an abortion after confiding to her mother. But the abuse remained a secret until last year when the woman, now in her 30s went to police. She later told how her life went off the rails as a result of the relationship and she drank heavily and became suicidal. At Burnley Crown Court Duffy, now 51, who runs a sandwich and takeway business in Colne, Lancs was convicted of 21 counts of indecent assault and one allegation of gross indecency, between 1989 and 1994. He was cleared of more serious charges of rape. The court had heard Duffy was in his late 20s, married with children and a leader at a youth club when he befriended the girl when she was 11 in 1988. But when they were alone together he started to stroke her hair, give her money and tell her how pretty she was. The girl was said to have enjoyed the attention and then subsequently had sex with Duffy 'hundreds of times' over the course of the next four years. Prosecutor Miss Alison Mather said: 'He promised her the earth to abuse her over a number of years. 'She allowed him to have sex with her to try and win his love because he told her that's what people who loved each other did. 'He would tell her things were difficult with his wife, who didn't want to do certain sexual acts with him. 'He said he and the girl had a future, they were going to get married. He would show her holiday brochures of where they would go . 'She listened to him and believed him and she thought he loved her. She loved him and was completely infatuated with him.' Trial: Duffy was found guilty of 21 counts of indecent assault and one count of gross indecency at Burnley Crown Court . The girl's mother found some notes . she had written about Duffy hidden on top of the wardrobe while she was . cleaning - but she thought they were just the infatuated fantasies of a . teenager and threw the notes away. The girl eventually confessed her affair with Duffy to her mother when she became pregnant by him at 15. But the mother agreed to keep pregnancy secret as she feared the girl's father would be so angry he would kill Duffy. She took her daughter to the doctor's to have a termination instead. During the trial the mother said: 'I was thinking of her future. She was too young to have a baby. But she was terrible, right from having that termination. I used to hear her sobbing in the night. 'I used to go and stroke her hair until she went to sleep. She was only a child. She just started to go downhill. She just gave up on everything, She was just so sad. She was so sad all the time. There was no spark there or anything.' The mother said from the age of 17 onwards her daughter was drinking, taking tablets and overdosing. She continued : 'It was just drinking and pills and having her stomach pumped. She was so down. It was terrible. That went on for a few years. 'She never, ever had boyfriends yet she was popular because she was lovely. But she would never go out with anybody.' When asked why she never confronted Duffy about his relationship with her daughter she added: 'I have gone over this and thought ""why didn't I go down?"" 'But what was the point ? He had a wife. He had three little children. I just wanted everything sorted and back to normal. That's how I saw it at the time. It was just panic stations.' When the girl told Duffy about the termination he did not appear bothered and was only interested in when sex could start again. The affair broke up shortly afterwards when she was 16. Duffy who later broke up with his wife denied any affair saying it was a 'figment of her imagination'. He added: 'She may have been 12 when she started on a sexual adventure, but it wasn't with me.' In mitigation, defence counsel Jeremy Lasker, said Duffy had been with his current partner for 10 years and was 'dismayed' at being convicted. The barrister added: 'This has completely ruined his life. He has lived all his life in the Colne area. 'He's well known there and was well respected. He involved himself in many local activities. All that, effectively, has now been put to an end.' Sentencing, Judge Andrew Woolman told Duffy : 'It an aggravating feature that you were a youth leader, and to some extent, exploited that position. 'Your conviction has been a shock to you. It's been a shock to many other people who genuinely believed that you were a good man. In many other respects you were a good man and did good works for the community but it was a cover to what was going on of a sexual nature underneath.'","John Duffy had a five year illicit relationship with the teen during the 1990s .

A man who tried to murder his girlfriend by burying her alive in a cardboard box has been sentenced to an additional four years in prison for possessing potentially dangerous explosives. Marcin Kasprzak, 27, was jailed for 20 years in January for attacking Michelina Lewandowska with a Taser gun. He then bound and gagged her and buried her in woodland under soil, leaves and a heavy tree branch. Locked up: Marcin Kasprzak, left, who tried to murder his girlfriend Michelina Lewandowska, right, by burying her alive, has been sentenced to four years for possessing potentially dangerous explosives . Kasprzak was charged with the additional . offences after police investigating the attempted murder found large . amounts of chemicals, formulae and recipes for making explosives at his . home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. He was sentenced to four years at Leeds Crown Court, which will be served alongside his current term. The court heard the chemicals had potential to cause serious damage or injury and were a danger to his three-year-old son, Miss Lewandowska and his parents who all lived at the house in a residential area. Judge Tom Bayliss QC said: 'This was a large amount of explosive substances which in the wrong hands are capable of causing extensive damage and terrible injury. 'The danger to occupants including your very young son, your partner, your parents and other residents is obvious.' But there is no suggestion Kasprzak intended to endanger life, injure or frighten people or damage property, the judge said. Crime scene: This picture shows the house where Marcin Kasprzak kept explosives . Kasprzak’s motive is 'obscure' but Judge Bayliss said he was satisfied that Kasprzak was experimenting. He had 500g potassium permanganate, . 1.5kg aluminium power, 189g ammonium nitrate, 370g carbon, 476g sulphur, . 1.212kg potassium nitrate, 1 litre of glycerol and 4kg iron oxide. Jonathan . Sharp, prosecuting, said some of the chemicals can be combined to make . explosive reactions or products including thermite, an incendiary . mixture; aluminium nitrate fuel oil, a highly dangerous explosive . substance which has been used in the past by terrorist groups; and . gunpowder. Formulae for making explosive substances were found displayed on a board in the spare room and Kasprzak had downloaded detailed instructions for the manufacture of nitroglycerine, an extremely dangerous explosive. Other items found on a computer revealed that Karprzak had an intense and unhealthy interest in explosives. But the court heard there is no evidence to suggest he had put any of the information he gathered into practice, beyond early experimentation. Dangerous: This picture shows some of the equipment which was seized from Kasprzak's home . Worrying: Formulae for making explosive substances were found displayed on a board in the spare room . Miss Lewandowska told police Kasprzak . tried to make a firework inside the house and then went on to make . firework effects in the garden. But Kasprzak said he acquired the chemicals out of curiosity and denied any experimentation. The court heard the defendant has no political interest or leanings and did not acquire the substances for 'nefarious purposes'. Kasprzak pleaded guilty to eight counts of illegally possessing explosive substances. He was sentenced to four years for each count, to run concurrently with each other and the 20-year sentence for attempted murder. Judge Bayliss said the offences do not compare to the gravity of the attempted murder which Miss Lewandowska survived by using her engagement ring to cut herself free from the cardboard box. The two offences were unrelated, the judge said.","Marcin Kasprzak, 27, was jailed for 20 years in January for attempting to bury Michelina Lewandowska alive in a cardboard box .

A gang who staged a dawn raid on a 51-year-old's home this morning battered their victim senseless while he slept before pouring petrol over him. Several men were being hunted by detectives following the brutal attack on Robbie Sinclair  at 5.30am at the house  in Didcot, Oxfordshire. Neighbours told how the men stormed in and beat Mr Sinclair so severely he suffered critical head injuries and is now fighting for his life in hospital. Sickening attack: Robbie Sinclair was left with severe injuries after the gang of thugs beat him as he lay in his bed at his Oxfordshire home, pictured, this morning . Firefighters evacuated at least three neighbours living in the multi-occupancy five-bedroom house, as well as residents from elsewhere on the street. Detectives sealed off the road where the attack took place and a forensics team removed a blood-covered duvet. It is thought Mr Sinclair might have known at least one of his attackers. Neighbours said they heard Mr Sinclair shouting 'get them out - they’re going to blow up the house' before the suspects fled in a car that was parked nearby. One neighbour, a woman aged in her 40s who did not want to be named, said: 'I saw two police officers in riot gear and shields. They bashed down the doors of three of the five rooms in the house. 'It was clear the people they were after had already left. Breach of the peace: Firefighters headed to the scene to check on the source of the petrol smell while Mr Sinclair was taken to hospital with critical head injuries . Evidence: Forensics teams removed a bloodstained duvet from the large shared property . 'When police were taking statements I heard one of the tenants telling an officer that Robbie was hurt and he had shouted: ""Get them out. They’re going to blow up the house"". 'This was after he had been attacked. I saw him on a stretcher. He had blood coming from his head and neck. I thought he had been stabbed. 'Nothing like this normally happens around here. It is usually really quiet.' Other locals said they had heard several arguments outside the house concerning a faulty car on Friday evening. They said several different vehicles were parked on the driveway of the semi-detached house every week. 'I’ve heard a few arguments coming from that house,' said a 55-year-old neighbour, who also did not want to be identified. 'That was on Friday. Someone was shouting: ""You sold me a dog"". 'There are lots of different cars there every week. I’ve seen two men working on them on the driveway, jacked up and that.' Investigation: Neighbours living on the street were evacuated from their homes for an hour while police took statements from other occupants of the house . Mr Sinclair was taken to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford by ambulance where police said he was in a critical condition. Detectives said they were seeking a number of people in relation to the early morning assault and appealed for any witnesses to contact them urgently. Neighbours living close to the semi-detached house were evacuated for about an hour as the fire brigade ensured the area was safe following the petrol incident. Another neighbour added: 'I heard some people being let into the house and a car engine was running outside at about 5.30am. 'It all kicked off after that. I’ve never seen so many emergency services here before. I hope Robbie pulls through.' Detective Inspector John Turner, of Thames Valley Police, said that police were called by the ambulance service at 6.18am. He added: 'The investigation into this incident is at a very early stage and we have not established how the man came to be injured. However we are treating it as assault at this time.'","Robbie Sinclair suffered critical head injuries and is now fighting for his life .

A father has admitted neglecting his four-month-old son who died from 'catastrophic injuries' after a television fell on his head. Edward Hanratty, 41, was passed out on the kitchen floor after taking a cocktail of drugs and drink when the child's mother's allegedly knocked over the TV set as she attempted to move it to plug in a scart lead and watch a DVD. Kian McMillan was lying below on his changing mat and died a day later in hospital after the incident at his home in Burnley, Lancashire on December 6 last year. Neglect: Natalie McMillan, 25, and Edward Hanratty, 41, who had initially denied child neglect but today changed his plea to guilty after giving evidence to Preston Crown Court. McMillan pleaded guilty to child neglect midway through the trial but continues to deny manslaughter by gross negligence . Hanratty had initially denied child neglect but dramatically changed his plea to guilty after giving evidence at Preston Crown Court today. His former partner Natalie McMillan, 25, pleaded guilty to child neglect midway through the trial but continues to deny manslaughter by gross negligence. In her evidence she claimed Hanratty was responsible for the television falling and that she was upstairs in bed when it happened, having taken heroin and valium. She claims she decided to accept the blame on his behalf from the moment she made the 999 call from the address in Scarlett Street. Prosecutor Suzanne Goddard QC declared this was 'nonsense' and that she was lying. Peter Wright QC, defending McMillan, said the circumstances of the case do not 'deserve plaudits' for the conduct which led to the television falling, whoever was responsible. But he told jurors that they were not being asked to determine whether his client was a good mother but whether she dropped the television and if she did, was it behaviour which was 'truly, exceptionally bad' rather than a mistake or a serious error of judgment. 'We say the evidence points away rather than towards her being responsible,' Mr Wright said. 'A not guilty verdict is not a vindication of Natalie McMillan or a dereliction of Kian McMillan.' McMillan has pleaded guilty to child neglect over the circumstances that 'tragically and avoidably' led to her son's death and would be sentenced accordingly, he said. The jury heard police interviews of McMillan, of Clarendon Road, Leeds, in which she stated that she was the one who knocked over the television and that she also initially denied taking drugs. She was charged with manslaughter but later submitted a defence statement saying it was in fact Hanratty who was responsible for the death. In her closing speech, Miss Goddard said: 'She has to find a way out and the only way out now is to falsely accuse Edward Hanratty.' Hanratty, of Dirkhill Road, Bradford, was released on bail until his sentencing on January 31. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow morning when the jury is expected to retire to consider its verdict against McMillan.

Doctors placed a do not resuscitate order on a patient’s notes without her knowledge or consent, a High Court judge said yesterday. Grandmother Janet Tracey, 63, had terminal lung cancer when she was admitted to hospital with a fractured neck following a serious car accident. Despite her poor prognosis, her family say she ‘wanted to have every minute of every day’ and told doctors she wanted to be included in conversations about her care. Patient: Janet Tracey, pictured with her husband David, did not consent to having a DNR notice put on her medical records . So she was ‘distressed’ to discover . in March last year that a Do Not Attempt Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation . (DNA-CPR) order had been placed on her notes. When Mrs Tracey objected, it was . cancelled by staff at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, in Cambridge, only to be . reinstated three days later. Mrs Tracey died two days after the second notice was issued. Yesterday, Judge Nicola Davies said . she did not accept the evidence of Dr Andrea Lavinio, a consultant on . the neuro-critical care unit, that he had discussed the first order with . Mrs Tracey but forgot to record it in her medical notes . In written findings, she said: ‘There is nothing in the records which suggests any agreement to DNA-CPR by Mrs Tracey.’ She said Dr Lavinio may have kept Mrs . Tracey in the dark to ‘spare her a conversation which he knew was . likely to cause distress to a suffering patient’. Legal battle: Mr Tracey stands outside the Royal Courts Of Justice with his daughters Kate Masters (second from right) and Alison Noeland (right) and solicitors Sophie Turner (left) and Merry Varney (second left) Mrs Tracey received treatment, and died, at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. She was terminally ill and had been involved in a car crash . But the findings will reignite the . debate over whether patients have the right to decide whether they are . resuscitated, or whether the doctor always knows best. Fears: Mrs Tracey told her family that staff 'wanted to get rid of her' Clinicians are not required by law to . gain the consent of patients, but hospital policy states they should . discuss it where possible. The Tracey family claim their . mother’s human rights were breached and that Cambridgeshire University . Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust acted unlawfully when they ignored her . wishes. They will find out tomorrow whether . the case can proceed to a judicial review, where they can challenge the . trust’s policy and the national guidelines set down by the Secretary of . State for Health. The family’s QC, Philip Havers, told . London’s High Court: ‘When the case is a matter of life or death, it is . not good enough for a trust to have a policy that is confusing. ‘There is a real problem out there and this is not a hypothetical or academic issue.’ After the first DNA-CPR order was removed, a second one was placed on Mrs Tracey’s medical records three days later when her condition deteriorated. Mrs Tracey’s four daughters and husband, retired engineer David, 65, say they were not properly informed about this notice either. But Judge Davies accepted the evidence of medical staff who said Mrs Tracey did not want to discuss her prognosis and that doctors ‘had discussed the relevant issues with the family’. She said staff believed 'her family were in denial as to her prognosis'. Judge Davies said: ‘Amongst . clinicians responsible for the care of Mrs Tracey, there was unanimity: a . DNA-CPR order was appropriate in order to protect her from an . undignified and cruel procedure which was of no clinical benefit.’ Mrs Tracey’s four daughters, . including Alison Noeland who attended court yesterday, say they were . given graphic accounts of resuscitation to pressure them to agree to a . second DNA-CPR. Daughter Kate Master told the hearing: ‘They said they would jump up and down on mum’s chest. ‘They would burn her with electrodes, they would break her ribs that weren’t already broken.’ Lord Faulks QC, speaking on behalf of . the hospital, said: ‘Whether or not to give CPR in circumstances like . this is a matter for the clinicians, ultimately.’","Grandmother Janet Tracey, 63, objected when she found note .

Price offered to give him a lift home but lost control of her Ford Ka shortly after they left work at 5pm on December 12 last year. Elizabeth Bradshaw, mitigating, said Price would be haunted for the rest of her life by her actions. She said: 'She is a young mother and she is absolutely devastated with the part she played in robbing another mother of her son. Kelvedon Road, Colchester. Mother of one Price had been travelling at up to 45 mph on the 30mph stretch of road . 'She realises the horrible situation the family of Mr Punter are in and there is genuine remorse.' The court heard that Price was not wearing her glasses when she crashed but she later passed an eye test so it was judged not to have contributed to the tragedy. Price will have to take an extended driving test before she is allowed on the roads again. Mr Punter was born in Wickford and moved to Colchester the month he died. At the time of his death a tribute, released through Essex Police, read: 'Charles Victor Punter, known as Charlie, was a true one-off. He will be remembered as a man who would make you laugh, more often than not until there were tears running down your face. 'But there was much more to him than that. Charlie had an incredible work ethic and enthusiasm for life. 'He returned to Colchester in early December to live with his friends and embark on a new career which we have no doubt he would have succeeded in. When Charlie put his mind to something, he could achieve anything. 'He was so full of potential and his family and friends are devastated that he'll never have the chance to show us what we all knew he was capable of.'","Charles Punter, of Essex, was getting a lift home with Rebecca Price .

Held: Ted Beston has been arrested by police on suspicion of molesting . young girls while working as a producer on Jimmy Savile's shows . Former BBC producer Ted Beston has 'vehemently denied' claims that he molested young women while working for Jimmy Savile. Mr Beston, 76, was arrested by Operation Yewtree detectives early yesterday morning on suspicion of historic sexual offences. In a statement released through his lawyers today, the former Radio 1 producer said he was shocked by the allegations. The statement added: 'What emerged in October 2012 was a side of Savile that Mr Beston never knew. 'Mr Beston vehemently denies the historic allegations put to him by the police. 'When the Savile story surfaced in October, Mr Beston made clear then that he was shocked by the allegations. 'For the time being, Mr Beston will be saying nothing further and we request that Mr Beston, who is now 76, be allowed to deal with these false claims without undue intrusion.' The producer, nicknamed 'Uncle' Ted by Savile on air, was bailed until february. Mr Beston, 76, was held at his home in Bromley, South London, at 6.30am and taken to a police station . He became a close friend of Savile’s while working for years as his producer on Radio 1 on shows including Savile’s Travels. Beston is accused of procuring girls for Savile and other men to molest in the 1960s and 1970s. Some women have also claimed that he sexually assaulted them himself. Beston categorically denied the allegations, saying: ‘I can’t see why the accusations have been made. I knew Jimmy had girlfriends around the country but I was totally unaware of any under-aged children.’ He is the eighth man to be arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, the Savile sex abuse investigation. He was bailed until February. In Savile's Travels, Savile travelled across the UK talking to members of the public. They also worked together on the Jimmy Savile Old Record Club and the Double Top Ten Show. Mr Beston produced several shows for Savile and also used his skills producing hit shows for DJ Mike Read and latterly Simon Mayo's Breakfast Show in the 80s. Throughout the course of yesterday there were signs of police activity at Mr Beston's house. Three men in suits were seen leaving the premises in two cars carrying a large black holdall and three sealed black bin liners. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said yesterday: 'A man arrested earlier today in connection with Operation . Yewtree - [Yewtree 8] has this afternoon left police premises.

'The individual falls under the strand of the investigation we have termed ""Savile and others"".' The force is leading the national . probe into claims made against the disgraced TV presenter and figures in . the entertainment industry. It is understood that up to 25 celebrities have been named to police. A source with knowledge of the inquiry told the Sunday Times: 'They all tend to be white men of the Savile generation'. In some cases victims will not be identified or press charges. But in at least a dozen cases, police are reported to believe there is enough evidence for the celebrities to be arrested. The investigation has three strands, one dealing with allegations directly involving Jimmy Savile, the second involving allegations against associates of the disgraced DJ and the third involving 'others'.

A hospital trust has apologised to the parents of a baby who died after medics failed to spot he was being starved of oxygen during labour. An inquest into the death of baby Lucas Fermor recorded a narrative verdict after concluding at Warwickshire Coroner's Court. Deputy coroner for Coventry and Warwickshire Louise Hunt heard that before Lucas was delivered, maternity staff at Warwick Hospital failed to correctly interpret data monitoring his heart rate and a trace, showing Lucas was in distress, was missed. Errors: The coroner heard that before Lucas was delivered, maternity staff at Warwick Hospital (pictured) failed to correctly interpret data monitoring his heart rate and a trace, showing Lucas was in distress, was missed . She was also told that foetal blood samples which could also have identified Lucas was in distress were not taken. Health . bosses at South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust have already carried . out their own internal investigation, identifying failings in the level . of care it provided to the Fermor family. Mrs . Hunt, giving her verdict, said: 'Lucas died from hypoxic ischaemic . encephalopathy (HIE) caused by asphyxia during labour which went . undiagnosed and untreated before birth as a result of a failure to . correctly interpret the CTG (cardiotocography) and undertake a foetal . blood sample in accordance with the Nice (National Institute for health . and Clinical Excellence) guidelines. Lucas was born on May 29 but had been starved of oxygen for so long that he sustained irreversible brain damage. He was born white and floppy, according to his parents Natasha and Kent Fermor. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) is a condition that usually occurs when newborn's brain is starved of oxygen due to asphyxia. HIE can be fatal. Within as little as five minutes of oxygen deprivation, cerebral cells can begin to die which can seriously affect brain function. The disease can also cause long-term damage, including intellectual disability, delayed development, seizures, and cerebral palsy. While it is most commonly associated with newborn babies, it can, in some circumstances, affect adults as well. Causes can include complications at birth, Carbon monoxide or cyanide poisoning, drowning, drug overdose, smoke inhalation, high altitudes and heart attacks. Lucas, . who was the couple's first and to date only child, was later . transferred to Leicester Royal Infirmary but despite treatment, . including a medical procedure to cool his brain, nothing could be done . to save him. Mr and Mrs Fermor requested a . christening be held at the hospital, following which he was taken off . life support, dying in his parents' arms at 9.30pm on May 31, just two . days after birth. In a . further blow for the family, Mrs Fermor, 40, has since been diagnosed . with breast cancer and is now undergoing chemotherapy. Following . the inquest, the family's lawyer Guy Forster of Irwin Mitchell LLP . urged the trust to do all it could to share the results of 'the series . of failings' it identified in moments leading up to Lucas's delivery. He . said: 'While nothing can turn back the clock for Natasha and Kent, the . fact the trust has now admitted liability is of some comfort and . hopefully the civil claim can now be quickly resolved.' Mrs . Fermor, a technical liaison director with a marketing agency, said: . 'The hospital had already identified that because of my age, my . pregnancy was 'high risk' and as such I should have been carefully . monitored during every stage of my labour. 'I . was in so much pain because of the drugs they were using to induce the . birth, but I was told that everything was fine and as a first-time . mother I put my trust and the life of my unborn son in the doctors' hands. 'Even when they realised that Lucas was, in fact, in distress, there seemed to be endless delays taking me into theatre for surgery, where he was finally delivered. 'Kent kept dashing back and forth between me and the doctors who were desperately working on Lucas trying to get lines into him and resuscitate him. 'When he was transferred to Leicester to undergo cooling therapy in an attempt to limit the brain injury he had suffered, I was still recovering from surgery and wasn't able to travel with him. 'I had only seen Lucas for 10 minutes after he had been born and at that point I wasn't aware just how poorly he was. 'When Kent and I saw him in the neonatal intensive care unit, we realised the enormity of the situation. The doctors admitted he was so poorly that the only thing keeping him alive was the life-support equipment. 'We knew we had to say goodbye to him and we quickly arranged a christening service at the hospital and invited close members of our family who came to support us. 'Taking the final decision to turn off his life support is the most difficult thing I have ever had to do but we knew we didn't have any option and Lucas passed away peacefully in our arms.' Mrs Fermor added: 'The battle to cope with Lucas's tragic and untimely death has been made even worse by the news that I have advanced breast cancer. 'Despite this, we are determined to remain focused on our battle for justice to ensure the hospital has indeed learnt lessons from what happened to Lucas so that no other couple has to suffer the heartache we have endured.' Glen Burley, the hospital trust's chief executive, said: 'The trust has accepted there was a delay in the delivery of Lucas, which we sincerely regret. 'We have fully investigated events leading up to the delivery and have taken action in a number of areas to make improvements. 'On behalf of the trust, I would like to apologise and offer my condolences to Lucas's family.'","Lucas Fermor died at Warwick Hospital of asphyxia after birth on May 31 .

Fears that consumers are reining in their spending ahead of Christmas were fuelled yesterday after it emerged that sales volumes failed to rebound last month. A predicted return to growth did not materialise, with official figures from the Office for National Statistics revealing flat sales volumes between October and November. It comes after a much-worse-than-expected drop in October when retail sales volumes fell 0.8 per cent month on month.

Carrying on: Shoppers eat and drink while they pass shops in Bath as retailers slash prices to entice them in . The Confederation of British Industry said that sales for the Christmas season had been ‘below par’ as families try to make their budgets stretch as far as possible. Excluding fuel, the ONS figures showed the total value of sales was up 2.5 per cent in November compared with a year ago, below inflation of 2.7 per cent in the same period. The ONS said new models of tablet computers drove a 3.8 per cent boost for household goods stores, but this failed to offset a 0.1 per cent drop in food sales. Clothes and shoes sales were also down by 0.1 per cent, with department stores also seeing sales volumes fall. Flat-lining: An Office for National Statistics graph showing the estimated quantity of goods bought in the retail sector back to 2000, with indices referenced to 2009 . But the ONS estimated that the proportion of retail sales online increased by 1.4 per cent between October and November, with the average weekly spend in November at £711million. Across all retailing an estimated £7.3billion was spent weekly in November, around the same as last year. James Knightley, an analyst at ING Bank, said the headline growth figure was a disappointing outcome following a decent bounce in consumer confidence in November. He expects overall GDP to be flat in the fourth quarter. British Retail Consortium director-general Helen Dickinson, said the figures suggested that Christmas shoppers were slow out of the blocks as pressures on budgets and the outlook left people reluctant to commit to spending early.

It would also be an increase of 14million visits from the recent record breaking Cyber Monday, and consumers are expected to spend £472.5 million as they snap up sales bargains, analysts said.

"By . Nina Golgowski . PUBLISHED: . 23:37 EST, 22 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:17 EST, 23 December 2012 . A U.S. Census report revealing the nation's fastest growing states in the last year has seen the population flocking to the nation's best places for the warmest weather, lowest taxes and one with an oil rush to boot. Topping the list, North Dakota was found having secured a 2.2 per cent growth over the last year - three times the national rate - after becoming the second highest oil-producing state behind Texas. In close second, the District of . Columbia was found with a 2.1 per cent growth, Texas with 1.7 per cent, . Wyoming with 1.6 per cent, and Utah with 1.5 per cent. Hot and cold: A report by the U.S. Census Bureau has revealed the top 10 states that have seen a population boom in the last year, seen in red, along with the worst, seen in blue . Top states: With a 2.2 per cent increase, North Dakota dominates the list in booms with the District of Colombia coming in second . Oil boom: Trucks sit outside a row of temporary housing units for oil workers in Tioga, North Dakota after an oil rush made it the second largest oil state last year just behind Texas . Using figures collected between July of 2011 and July of 2012, the report attributed North Dakota's oil rush to its boost of 10,000 additional residents. But what may come as more of a surprise is their high unemployment rates. While North Dakota is benefiting from a rare 3.0 per cent unemployment rate it's a stark contrast from the other top nine boomers who together average 8.1 per cent. In comparison, Nevada, found in 10th place for positive domestic migration and sixth for fastest growing, has seen a 12 per cent unemployment rate. D.C., ranked second on both lists, has seen a rate of 8.9 per cent. In contrast to population boom, states . experiencing the fastest exit by residents are New York, Illinois, New . Jersey, Connecticut, and Rhode Island according to the report with the one exception of New Mexico - in fourth place - linking colder climates between them. Land of opportunity: North Dakota's oil boom is attributed for their surge in domestic immigrants while the state mutually glistens with a 3 per cent unemployment rate . Fleeing: New York, Illinois and New Jersey were found to have the highest rate of residents leaving the states as seen here . Housing boom: Workers in North Dakota work to construct homes with the oil boom putting pressure on the state's tight housing market . As far as taxes go, four of the top 10 states were found with the lowest rates in the country - those being South Dakota, Wyoming, Texas and Nevada. High birth rates are also credited in four of the top 10 states of Texas, D.C., Colorado and Nebraska. Among the top states nation-wide, however, Utah was found with the highest rate with 12.8 per cent, Alaska in second with 11 per cent, Texas with 8.3 per cent, California with 7.2 per cent, and D.C with 6.8 per cent. Interestingly the report notes Mormonism as responsible for this growth, with Utah, Idaho (with 6.7 per cent growth) and Nevada having the highest concentrations of Mormons in the U.S. Floundering in that category - however leading in deaths - are Maine and West Virginia whose population are said to be seeing more deaths of baby boomers than births. In all, the U.S. population was found now increasing a bit faster, thanks to an improving economy, but not enough to lift growth above its lowest level since the Great Depression. The nation is getting older and is less likely than before to be married, with women waiting longer to have children, if at all. Immigration from other countries is on an upswing after years of sharp declines during the recession but may never return to the peak level it reached in the early 2000s. Weather relations: Seen in winter, New York, left, and Illinois, right, were found with the worst rates of domestic migration, with the list of top 10 states all sharing cold weather with the exception of New Mexico . Religious influence: Utah has been named winner of highest births in the country with Mormonism claimed responsible for the growth . The 2012 estimates released on Thursday offer the latest snapshot of the U.S. population, showing signs of revival and change in pockets of the U.S., especially in Sun Belt states hard hit during the recent recession. 'After decades of wars, a depression, immigration surges, baby booms, boomlets and busts, we are entering a new era of modest growth,' said William H. Frey, a demographer at Brookings Institution who analyzed the numbers. 'This is a result of our aging population, lower fertility rates and immigration levels that will probably not produce sharp population spikes.' As a whole, the U.S. population grew by 2.3 million, reaching 313.9 million people. That growth rate of 0.75 per cent was higher than the 0.73 per cent rate in 2011, ending five years of slowing growth rates. Nevertheless, the rate of growth remains stuck at historically low levels not seen since 1937, restrained by reduced childbirths. Over the last year, the economy has shown improvement, with the unemployment rate declining modestly and U.S. migration edging up after hitting a record low in 2011. As a result, states including Texas, North Dakota, Colorado, Oregon and Virginia posted population growth increases as many young adults moved out from their parents' homes, seeking to test the job market in areas with thriving economies in energy or technology. Still, the nation continues to get older, due to aging baby boomers and fewer people in their child-bearing years. Newly released census projections now show that U.S. growth may have largely peaked, barring a significant and sustained increase in new immigrants. The numbers put U.S. growth in the next year or two at just under 0.8 per cent, before flattening and gradually falling to rates of about half a per cent, a level unseen in more than a century. Religious influence: Utah, their capital's spire seen left in Salt Lake City, saw the highest rate of births in the last year with the report attributing Mormonism to the gain . U.S. growth reached a high in 1950 of more than 2 per cent, lifted by the post-World War II baby boom. Immigration to the U.S. was on the uptick in 2012 after falling significantly during the downturn, although it remained far from the level seen during the mid-2000 housing boom. Congress is expected to debate an overhaul of immigration law next year. 'We will now need to cope with population challenges that past growth has left us — notably, the needs of a large aging baby boom population which will require resources for its medical care, and the social and economic integration of first- and second-generation immigrants,' Frey said. The Census Bureau released state population estimates as of July 1, 2012. The data show annual changes through births, deaths, and domestic and foreign migration. The data suggest that the impact of the recession on formerly fast-growing Sun Belt states may be waning. Nevada had more residents move into the state this year after suffering migration losses in previous years. Arizona and Florida, two other housing boom-and-bust states, also showed renewed migration gains after seeing their growth drop off sharply at the end of the last decade. In all, 26 states grew faster this year compared to the previous year, of which 19 are in the South and West region. 'These gains remain far smaller than those each state experienced during the economic boom, but reflect considerable improvement over the situation at the depths of the recession,' said Kenneth Johnson, a sociologist and senior demographer at the University of New Hampshire, referring specifically to Arizona, Nevada and Florida. In contrast, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey saw more residents move away compared to the previous year. North Dakota grew faster than any state in the nation, climbing by 2.2 percent from July 2011 to July of this year. The District of Columbia was next-fastest growing, followed by Texas, Wyoming and Utah. Two states lost population: Rhode Island and Vermont. Kimball Brace, president of Election Data Services, said if the 2010 census had been held this year, Minnesota would have lost a seat in the House of Representatives and North Carolina would have picked up one due to the shifting population figures. Based on continuing losses, Rhode Island is now on track to lose one of its two seats with just 33,000 people to spare — potentially to the gain of Oregon, which is about 59,000 people away from gaining a sixth seat. California remained the most populous state, followed by Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois.","North Dakota topped list with 2.2 per cent growth over the last year after becoming the second highest oil-producing state .

French President Francois Hollande today acknowledged the 'suffering' his country had inflicted on Algeria - while refusing to offer an apology to the former colony. Speaking to the Algiers parliament, Mr Hollande admitted that 132 years of direct rule from Paris had often been 'brutal and affair'. Mr Hollande spoke of the savage war of independence, which took place over eight years up until 1962 and claimed around 1.5 million lives. No apology: French President Francois Hollande, pictured in Algiers on Thursday, acknowledged the 'suffering' his country inflicted on Algeria .

Torture was used frequently by the French military and security services as the war spread from the North African country to mainland France itself. Mr Hollande said: 'What Algeria was subjected to for 132 years was profoundly brutal and unfair. 'That system had a name - colonialism - and I recognise here the suffering that colonialism inflicted on the Algerian people. 'There is a duty to tell the truth about the violence, the injustices, the massacres and the torture.' Mr Hollande added that official archives needed to be opened so that historians could ensure the 'truth can come out progressively.' Many Algerians had called on Hollande to issue an apology for French rule and for its conduct during the war for independence. Its . deep scars are felt on both sides of the Mediterranean, with a . coalition of prominent Algerian politicians attacking the French for . failing 'to recognise, apologise for and compensate' victims of 'its . crimes. Respect: President Francois Hollande laid a wreath of flowers at the Algerian war memorial . Mr Hollande admitted the 132 colonisation of Algeria had been 'unjust and brutal' Mr Hollande's historic speech came a day after he arrived in Algeria on a two day state visit. He called for a partnership 'of equals' between the two countries, but insisted he had 'not come to offer repentance or apologies. I have come to say what is true.' Mr Hollande's predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, also acknowledged that France's colonial rule on Algeria had been unjust but also failed to apologise. There are up to four million French Algerians in mainland France, and Hollande said he wanted to make it easier for them to travel between the two countries. He is also eager to boost trade, which stands at about eight billion pounds a year, and has been accompanied to Algeria by a number of business leaders. Renault has just announced it is to build a factory in Oran, Algeria, and will produce 75,000 cars each year. Hollande was invited to Algeria by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who will pay a return visit to France. French paratroopers spot check Algerian peasants ten days after a series of attacks that marked the start of the Algerian independence war . The Algerian war of independence lasted eight years and cost the lives of approximately 1.5million people. Hundreds of thousands were also tortured as brutal French tactics were used as part of a 'pacification campaign' to quell nationalist support. Both the French army and the FLN - the Algerian National Liberation Front - targetted civilians during the complex conflict between 1954 and 1962. It was characterised by guerrilla warfare and bloody suppression. A pivotal and notorious event was the Battle of Algiers in 1956 when a general strike was violently broken by the French. General Jacque Massu was told to use any means necessary to break the strike. Independence was finally gained following secret negotiations between the two sides and a referendum granted by Charles de Gaulle, who had returned to power. In the second referendum six million people voted for independence and only 16,000 voted against.","The French president acknowledged the 'suffering' inflicted on Algeria .

"By . Claire Bates . PUBLISHED: . 10:44 EST, 19 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:45 EST, 19 December 2012 . A man whose hands shook so violently he struggled to eat and drink has undergone a pioneering treatment to ease his tremor. Tony Lightfoot, 68, can now write fluently and drink a glass of water without spilling a drop - tasks he had found impossible before the treatment. He underwent an experimental procedure using high-intensity ultrasound waves that 'punch' a tiny hole in the part of the brain where the tremor originates to access the rogue cells causing it. Remarkably, the revolutionary procedure does not require an aesthetic. Instead, the patient remains alert throughout the treatment. Scroll down for video . Tony Lightfoot sits on an MRI table before his focused high energy ultrasound treatment at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto . Before treatment (left) Mr Lightfoot was unable to hold a cup of water even with two hands. Afterwards (left) he could sip from it with ease . The treatment is potentially life-changing for sufferers of tremor, which is the most common movement disorder. Essential tremor usually affects the arms and hands and makes them shake noticeably. It gradually gets worse over the years and eventually may become so . severe that carrying out normal, everyday activities can become . difficult. The condition affects men and women equally and is more common with age. Around four in 100 people over 40 are affected. It is triggered by making small detailed movements, which makes activities like writing, drinking a glass of water of tying shoelaces challenging. Being tired, anxious, hot or cold is also likely to make your symptoms worse. Research suggests that it is caused by a mutation in a gene and around half of cases are inherited. Other conditions that can cause a tremor include an overactive thyroid, Parkinson's disease, M.S and drug withdrawal. The most effective medicines to treat the condition are propanolol and primidone. However, they do not work for up to half of patients. Deep brain stimulation has also been shown to reduce tremor. It involves running an electric current  through the brain, however it does carry the risk of several side-effects. Neurosurgeon and co-investigator Dr Andres Lozano, from Toronto Western Hospital, said: 'There was a clearly visible and . dramatic improvement in tremor in the patient cases seen so far.' Now the Canadian team of scientists believe the surgery-free technique could help to treat a host of other conditions from brain tumours to . Parkinson’s. Lead investigator, Dr Michael Scwartz from Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center in Toronto, said: 'This new non-invasive procedure is revolutionising medicine. It could have far-reaching implications for many brain conditions including brain tumours and other movement disorders. 'Although only five patients have . been treated so far in Canada, the procedure appears to be safe, and . associated with limited side-effects.' Mr Lightfoot, who had suffered with a tremor for 15 years, shook whenever he tried to use his muscles and was unable to perform everyday tasks such as buttoning his shirt. 'When eating, my wife often has to feed me with a spoon,' he explained. The former engineer was put forward for the trial after . medication failed to control his worsening condition. To prepare for the . five-hour surgery, he had his head shaved and was fitted with a ring held . in place against his skull. A helmet containing a tube of cold liquid . was placed on top to stop his skull from overheating. On Tuesday, Mr Lightfoot underwent an . MRI scan, during which doctors pinpointed the faulty brain tissue and . zapped it using ultrasound beams. With each zap, the shaking in his . right hand and arm diminished until it had disappeared. Early results . suggest his dominant hand is now steady. 'That is fantastic. Fantastic,' he said after picking up and drinking a cup of water without any mishaps. 'I never thought it would happen.' The unusual-looking specialist head device transmitted the ultrasound waves into Mr Lightfoot's brain . Doctors at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, study Mr Lightfoot's MRI brain scans . Mr Lightfoot's right arm became noticeably more steady during the procedure . Mr Lightfoot said the procedure has boosted his self-esteem and he is looking forward to being able to write once again. At present doctors are only treating one side of the brain and so focus on improving the patient's dominant hand.  Dr Schwarz added that clinical trials were still at an early stage and more research is needed to see if it causes any complications and how long the beneficial effects last.The study is the result of collaboration between world leading experts at Sunnybrook and the Krembil Neuroscience Centre at Toronto Western Hospital.

Christmas parties are causing the winter vomiting bug to spread rapidly as sufferers are attending while still infectious, warns a norovirus expert. Ian Clarke, Professor of Molecular Microbiology and Virology at the University of Southampton, claims that people can remain contagious until three weeks after they have recovered. Prof Clarke told MailOnline that patients going to parties where they are kissing and hugging others are almost certainly infecting more people. Scroll down for video . Figures released on Tuesday show the number of people affected by the illness is 83 per cent higher than this time last year . He said: 'Some people secrete virus after their symptoms have elapsed. 'This can go on for up to three weeks but the amount gets less and less.' New figures from Superdrug show that people are concerned about the problem – sales of anti-bacterial hand gel have increased 52 per cent this week compared to last week. Figures released on Tuesday show the number of people affected by the illness is 83 per cent higher than this time last year due to an early outbreak of the virus. It's estimated that around 900,000 people have now been affected. Most cases usually occur from January to March, making this the worst start to the norovirus season on record. The virus is showing no signs of abating, with the number of people affected almost doubling in the space of a week. Dozens of hospital wards have been closed. The Royal Lancaster Infirmary has closed all its wards to visitors in a bid to stem a 'significant outbreak' of the winter vomiting bug. A total of 140 patients and 20 staff at the hospital have been affected by symptoms of norovirus. Bosses at the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust (UHMBT) made the decision yesterday and said the ban would stay in effect for at least two days. Sales of anti-bacterial hand gel have increased 52 per cent this week compared to last week . In a statement, the trust said: 'In order to try to resolve a significant outbreak of norovirus at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, UHMBT has had to make the difficult decision to close all wards to visitors in the hospital, for at least the next 48 hours. 'Despite every effort by the trust, the highly contagious winter bug has continued to spread, now affecting seven wards.' Chief operating officer Juliet Walters said: 'Whilst we understand that this may seem drastic to some people, our usual infection control methods need to be supplemented with the assistance of the public to help control and resolve the outbreak. 'It has been widely reported that the levels of this bug are 83 per cent higher nationally than last year. There is also a huge increase of the bug in the community and we believe that members of the public who are coming into the hospital, carrying the bug or similar bugs - sometimes without knowledge - may be contributing to the problem. 'By reducing the number of people coming into our hospital, we can reduce the risk of norovirus spreading to further wards. The Health Protection Agency advises the following measures: . Do . NOT visit your GP surgery or local A&E Unit. Norovirus infection is . a self-limiting illness and you will recover naturally without . treatment. It is, however, important to take plenty of drinks to replace . lost fluids. Use . NHS Direct's new diarrhoea and vomiting online health and symptom . checker, to get advice on how to manage your symptoms at home or help to . access the most appropriate health service. Wash hands thoroughly and regularly at all times, but particularly after using the toilet and before eating. Do . not visit friends or relatives in hospitals or residential care homes . as there is a real risk that you would introduce the infection, putting . vulnerable people at risk. Schools across the country have also been affected by the illness. A school in East Sussex has become the latest to close because of an outbreak of the norovirus. The figures released earlier this . week from the Health Protection Agency show there were 337 confirmed . laboratory reports of norovirus in the week ending December 9 and 236 . for the week ending 2 December - a rise of 42 per cent. The number of confirmed cases - where samples have been checked in the lab - have risen from 1,669 to 3,046 this season. But . this figure is likely to be only a fraction of the true total as most . sufferers do not see their GP. Officials at the HPA estimate that for . every confirmed case there are another 288 in the community. Hospital . outbreaks are also double what they were this time last year. The HPA . figures show there were 61 hospital outbreaks during the last two weeks . up to December 16. In same fortnight in the previous year there were 35. Data . from the Department of Health shows that 2,398 hospital beds are . ‘closed’ due to norovirus – equating to 1 in 50 of all available beds. Figures from Firstcare, which monitors absence rates, show that an average of 5,263 NHS staff are calling in sick with typical symptoms every day. And during November some 128,800 working days were lost in the NHS due to employees being off with sickness. It is estimated that 0.4 per cent of the 1.4million workers in the NHS are off sick with symptoms. It . is not known what proportion are frontline staff but they are likely to . be in the majority, as they are mostly in contact with patients. John Harris, an expert in norovirus . at the HPA, said: 'The number of laboratory confirmed cases has risen . again, following the drop in the number we reported last week. 'This . is typical of the norovirus season where the number of laboratory . reports fluctuates between October and April with the bulk of cases . usually occurring between January and March.' The . Government's Chief Medical Officer Professor, Dame Sally Davies, said: . 'For most people norovirus is an unpleasant but short lived illness. There is no specific treatment but patients are advised to drink plenty . of fluids and stay at home. 'Anyone who is concerned should call either NHS Direct or their local GP Practice for advice. Please avoid attending A&E as this could spread the illness to vulnerable people and healthcare workers.' A Department of Health spokesperson added: 'The NHS is well prepared for the increase in winter related health problems which are typical at this time of year. 'Our weekly published figures show the number of beds closed across the NHS due to norovirus symptoms is around 2 per cent. This compares to 2.9 per cent of beds that were closed during the peak of norovirus cases last winter.'","Norovirus expert Professor Ian Clarke says people can be infectious for THREE WEEKS after recovering .

Jailed: Emma Webb had sex with teenage pupils during their free periods at the school and her home . A teaching assistant had unprotected sex with five teenage boys in her care and sent them pictures of herself playing with sex toys. Married Emma Webb, 42, performed sex acts on the pupils - aged 15 to 17 - during free period and detention at the Berkshire school. She groomed them by taking them out for meals at Kentucky Fried Chicken and giving them lifts to school, Reading Crown Court heard. The supply teacher and mentor, who admitted a total of 30 charges relating to the . offences involving five boys at the secondary school, even joked with . one boy about having his baby. Sentencing the tearful teacher to 32 months in jail, Judge John . Reddihough said: 'All of these offences involved serious breaches of . trust that was placed in you as a study supervisor at the school in . question. 'You were expected to support and assist the five boys concerned and you were a mentor to at least two of them. 'Instead you undoubtedly groomed them . for sexual purposes by buying them food and presents, inviting them to . your home and driving them to and from school.' The first youngster to catch the eye of the mother of two was a 15-year-old, who she would question about his sexual experiences. The pair were so close they drew the attention of fellow pupils. 'Others were saying they should get a bed in the classroom, it appeared she enjoyed that jest,' said Simon Heptonstall, prosecuting. 'She said she liked his bum and squeezed it. 'She continued sexual texting when her husband was not around and texted him saying, ""fancy a play?"".' The court heard that Webb told the boy if he told anyone about the texts she would lose her job and that her plumber husband Andy 'had a history of violence', so the youngster would 'end up with no kneecaps.' Webb started asking the boy to visit her and said he was 'a special boy', said Mr Heptonstall. Webb then moved on to another student, aged 16. After taking him to KFC with a group of boys in his year, Webb started texting him and asking him to go to her home for sex. Illicit meetings: Webb, 42, invited pupils to her home, pictured, for sex and drove them back to school afterwards . When the boy obliged, Webb performed a sex act on him, saying 'we shouldn’t be doing this' before he left following a call from his mother. On another visit during one of his free periods, she again performed a sex act. The pair then began to meet up around twice a week for sex when he was not in lessons. 'There was never any use of contraception,' said Mr Heptonstall. The third boy was sent to the school’s intervention room, where Webb lifted up her skirt and told him to touch her sexually, which he did until the school bell sounded 10 or 15 minutes later. She told him not to tell anyone, and followed that up by sending him explicit photographs by mobile, the court heard. On another occasion she asked the boy to walk her dog with her and had sex with him on her staircase, in what the court was told was the teenager’s first sexual experience. Webb had shown the fourth boy explicit photographs of herself using sex toys after he was sent to the intervention room for misbehaving. Warning: Webb told one boy that her plumber husband Andy, pictured, 'had a history of violence', so the youngster would 'end up with no kneecaps' if he told anyone what had happened . 'He was caught drawing a penis when he was doodling in class,' said Mr Heptonstall. 'She bluntly asked to see his.' The pair later went on to have unprotected sexual intercourse, prompting Webb to say to the boy 'imagine if we had black babies now'. Webb also gave the fifth boy lifts to school, and the court heard she made him feel 'as though he was the only one who cared for her.' At a school prom, the pair posed for photographs where Webb had her feather boa draped over him, which the boy’s mother described as featuring them as 'looking like a couple'. 'She referred to him as her baby and said she loved him,' said Mr Heptonstall. 'He would walk the dog with her regularly, two or three times a week, and on one occasion they would go to her house.' Webb was suspended from the school, which cannot be identified for legal reasons, and investigated after another teacher saw a message from the boy where he told Webb that he loved her. The court was told that Webb initially denied that anything untoward had happened, but admitted that she was a tactile person. Webb, who held her head in her hands as the details of her offences were read out, looked tired and red-eyed as she sat in the dock, dressed in a grey striped top. She admitted to 16 counts relating to sex with three of the boys at an earlier court hearing, and to a further 14 charges relating to the other two boys prior to her sentencing hearing today. The teacher admitted four counts of causing or inciting sexual activity with a child and six counts of causing or inciting sexual activity with a child by a position of trust. She also pleaded guilty to three counts of causing a child to watch a sex act by viewing a sexual image, one count of sexual activity with a child and 16 counts of sexual activity with a child in a position of trust between September 2, 2009 and May 1, 2012. She denied a further charge of perverting the course of justice, which the court was told would lie on file. None of the boys can be identified for legal reasons. Most told police they had not been affected by Webb’s activities, although one said he felt he had been taken advantage of. Jennifer Edwards, defending, said Webb had been good at her job, and that the boys had said she was kind to them. She said Webb regretted her actions and hoped to rebuild her marriage after her release from prison, but could not give a reason why she had embarked on sexual relationships with pupils. 'Why on earth did she do this? There was nothing for her to gain from having sexual play with boys at her school,' said Ms Edwards. 'There was everything for her to lose and nothing to gain.' She added: 'They are young and vulnerable but these are young boys on the road to manhood.' Ms Edwards suggested her offending was in part linked to the murder of her . brother several years ago. 'Each of the boys she became involved with, it appears she spoke to them about her lost brother,' she said. 'Perhaps she was looking for some sort of solace.' No details of the murder were heard by the court. Ms Edwards added that the judge had been sent a 'heartfelt' letter by . Webb, plus others in support from other people, including her parents, . her children and her husband, who is standing by her. Judge Reddihough sentenced Webb to 32 months in prison, after he took off a third of her sentence for an early guilty plea. He told her she could expect to serve half of that behind bars, including the 168 days she has already spent in custody. 'It may be that to some extent the boys were over 16 at the time of some of the offences, ' said the judge. 'But they were under 18 and you were in a position of trust towards them. 'What you did will have had an adverse effect on the complainants. 'There is a real risk they will have twisted attitudes towards females and sex, and be confused as to the appropriate boundaries between adults and children or young people in their care.' Despite attending court for all of Webb’s previous appearances, her husband was not present today. A woman who answered the door at their home in Reading said that he was at work.","The supply teacher and mentor groomed boys by taking them out for food .

It was ridiculed by critics at the Cannes Film Festival and struggled to raise any interest in the UK. Now, Keith Allen's controversial documentary about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Fayed, will not be shown anywhere else in the world. Unlawful Killing had been set to premiere in the U.S. on August 31 on the 15th anniversary of her death and was also set to open in cinemas in Spain, India, Russia, Brazil and Italy. Allen had accused the Royal Family of masterminding the car crash that caused the death of Diana, Princess of Wales as a 'warning' to her to toe the line. In the documentary Prince Phillip is also branded a 'Fred West-style psychopath' who 'orchestrated the murder', while the Queen was dismissed as a 'gangster in a tiara'. Allen said the House of Windsor had 'got away with murder' because no one had been held to account over the accident. It premiered in Cannes last year but critics dismissed it as 'absurd', 'twaddle' and 'unlawfully dull'. Allen admitted he had struggled to get interest in the UK because of strict libel laws but insisted there was global demand for his project, . But it has now been shelved indefinitely after distributors failed to secure the necessary insurance to bring in to cinemas. A spokesman for the film said: . 'Unlawful Killing has been sold all around the world. But there was a . specific form of insurance needed by the U.S. distributors to cover them . for their French and UK offices. 'This proved impossible to secure. The film has been withdrawn in perpetuity.' Without the distributors would not be covered for the expense of any libel litigation brought through their French or British offices. The production was backed by Dodi's father Mohammed Al-Fayed, who invested £2.5 million in bringing it to screen. The controversial documentary Unlawful Killing, by Keith Allen, right, accuses the Royal Family of masterminding the car-crash  which killed Diana and Dodi Al-Fayed in 1997 . In the film, the inquest in to her . death is presented as a cover-up in which different arms of the British . establishment - including the police, the Courts, and the Royal Family, . as well as the French coroner and government - had a hand. Unlawful . Killing opens with details of a letter penned by Diana to her Butler, . in which she claims that Prince Charles is planning to have her murdered . in a car accident. Dodi's father Mohammed Al-Fayed, former owner of Harrods, invested £2.5 million in the project . The production stated the 36-year-old could have been saved had she been taken to hospital quickly - and that the inquest failed to properly investigate why. The film shows the graphic black and white close-up of Diana taken moments after the Mercedes carrying the couple crashed in a Paris underpass, for a few seconds. The distressing image, in which her blonde hair and features clearly visible, has never been publicly seen in this UK. Allen said: 'The photo is not used in the film for the purpose of shock. It is included as evidence, because it shows clearly that, although Diana had been injured in the crash, she was alert and very much alive. I repeat: it is not a picture of a dying woman. 'As medical evidence presented at the inquest confirmed, if Diana had been taken promptly to hospital by Dr Jean-Marc Martino, she could well have survived. He added: 'Using the picture is not sensational - it illustrates the story.' The film features Al-Fayed accusing the Royal Family of being racist - and in particular Prince Phillip. Allen, who authors the documentary, suggests in it that the Establishment was unhappy with Diana's relationship with Dodi, because he was a Muslim, and it would have caused problems had the pair married. It also claims that her role in the anti-landmine campaign put her at risk from those in the arms industry, and those in power who had links to it. In 2008, after a six-month inquest which heard evidence from 250 witnesses and cost taxpayers an estimated £12million, a jury concluded that Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed were unlawfully killed as a direct result of grossly negligent driving by drunk chauffeur Henri Paul, who also died in the crash. The actions of photographers following the car were also cited.","Documentary brands Prince Phillip a 'Fred West-style psychopath' and the Queen 'a gangster in tiara'

A Minnesota police officer who has been accused of the unprovoked and vicious beating of a suspect that was captured on video has been placed on leave and is the subject of an . internal investigation. In the footage, St.Paul police officer Jesse Zilge is seen to kick suspect Eric Hightower once in the . chest and then with . the assistance of another officer slam his head onto the . hood of a squad car. Police however said that HIghtower was a dangerous suspect who was wanted by authorities for allegedly threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend which is the reason why the police officer pulled him over. Scroll Down for Video . A passer-by begins filming right after Mr. Hightower was brought to the ground by Officer Zilge . Talking from jail, . Hightower told the Pioneer Press he and his friends were on their way to . a park when an officer jumped out of a squad car and ordered everyone . onto the ground. The officer singled out Hightower and began spraying . him with a chemical. Hightower said he never resists arrest, but . said: 'Why would I get down on the ground when you still haven't told me . what was I under arrest for? I don't feel like I was obligated to get . down on the ground just because you said so.' Officer Zilge stands over Mr. Hightower who screams out that the officer has no reason to have apprehended him let alone attempt to arrest him . Officer Zilge then strikes Mr.Hightower with a kick as he lies on the ground . While on the ground, . Hightower said he continued to ask the officer what he did wrong, but . the officer wouldn't say. Hightower said the officer pointed his Taser . at him, but didn't use it. He said the officer became agitated. 'He . sprayed me in my face again. I was laying on my side, I was hocking up . the stuff, it was choking me and he ran towards me, kicked me in the . chest, kicked me in the chin,' Hightower said. Hightower said the spray caused his eyes to swell and his face was numb. He said he couldn't hear anything out of his right ear. He . told the newspaper that he used a water fountain to flush out his eyes . at the jail, and he also saw nurses and received ice packs for swelling . on his chest. Eric Hightower said he didn't know why he was being arrested, nor why was he kicked when Officer Zilge pulled him over . A . brief report filed by Zilge lists hands, fists and feet among the . weapons used by police in the arrest, but does not describe the events . shown in the video that was recorded by a citizen and posted to YouTube . on Wednesday. Hightower, 30, had been accused of threatening to . kill his ex-girlfriend. He was charged Thursday with stalking, making . terroristic threats and criminal damage to property. He told the . St. Paul Pioneer Press he didn't know why he was being arrested, and the . kick was delivered as he lay on the ground, coughing and choking on the pepper spray that Zilge had used on him. 'It was like he was . kicking a football or something,' said Hightower to the newspaper. 'He . kicked me so hard, he knocked the wind completely out of me.' When assistance arrived for Officer Zilge the two officers approached the squad car and slammed him down on top to prevent him from moving . Both the officers struggle to get Mr. Hightower to enter into the squad car and he struggles with the police . Police . spokesman Howie Padilla said police learned of the video after someone . sent a link to the department and the Chief Thomas Smith of St Paul. Police ordered an internal investigation. 'The . video of a St. Paul police officer striking a suspect raises serious . questions about the conduct of the officer,' said Mayor Chris Coleman said in . a statement. 'I have high expectations for the department and its . employees. We will fully investigate and take appropriate action.' While . several officers appear in the video, Zilge was the only one placed on . paid administrative leave. A phone listing for a Jesse Zilge was . disconnected. St. Paul Police Federation President Dave Titus told the . Pioneer Press that Zilge is a good officer.

Cops call it 'a very calculated and planned crime' as they continue to hunt for suspect . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 07:44 EST, 7 December 2011 . The chief investigator into the death of Jorelys Rivera was so distraught over the girl's wounds he refused to describe them. The seven-year-old girl, whose body was found in a Georgia dumpster, was bludgeoned, sexually assaulted and stabbed in a particularly vicious attack by a killer who police believe lives in her apartment complex. The wounds to her body were so severe Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vernon Keenan would not give any details. Scroll down for video . Grim task: Investigators comb through piles of garbage from a trash container where the body of 7-year-old Jorelys Rivera was found . Mr Keenan would only say she had . blunt force trauma to the head and stab wounds and that the crime as a . 'very horrific and brutal murder.' Police believe the girl was taken to a . vacant apartment where she was sexually assaulted, stabbed and beaten . to death, police believe. The killer then threw Jorelys Rivera's brutally disfigured body into a trash bin near her home in Canton, Georgia where it was found by police. Picture of innocence: The body of seven-year-old Jorelys Rivera was found in a dumpster near her home after she went missing on Friday evening . It came about 60 to 90 minutes after she disappeared, he said. ‘This was a very calculated and planned crime,’ Keenan said. 'A child who dies under extreme violence is absolutely the worst thing that can happen to a human being.' Investigators believe the killer either lives in the apartment complex or has regular access to it. No suspects are in custody but . investigations continue. DNA evidence has been collected from the . child's body and the vacant apartment. Autopsy: She died from a blunt head trauma an hour after she went missing . Taken: The seven-year-old had left the park to collect drinks for her friends. Police believe she was then taken to an empty apartment, sexually abused and beaten . Distraught: Jorelys' mother Joselin had appealed for her daughter's safe return . Rivera was last seen on Friday afternoon, and her body was discovered around 12.30 pm on Monday. Police and volunteers had spent the weekend combing the area around the apartment complex playground where she was last seen. At the time of her disappearance, the child was being looked after by a teenage babysitter along with her two siblings. She had left the park to go and collect . drinks from home for her friends, and disappeared between the playground . and her home at the River Ridge Apartments. Police had sent several Coca-Cola . cans found nearby for forensic testing to see if these are the drinks . that the child had gone to collect for her friends. Jorelys' mother Joselin Rivera had made . an emotional plea for her return and her father, who lives in Florida, . had flown to the city in Cherokee County. Site: Jorelys's body was found in the large green dumpster, pictured, in Canton . Search: Authorities comb through piles of garbage from a dumpster where the body was found. They are also carrying out tests on the vacant apartment . Watch: Georgia Department of Corrections Tack Squad members watch over the playground at River Ridge apartment complex where Jorelys was last seen . A friend translated for Spanish-speaking Mrs Rivera to local TV station 11alive.com. She said her daughter was 'friendly, sweet, had lots of friends and everyone just loved her'. Keenan said investigators have . received numerous tips from the public and said valuable evidence has . come from residents at the apartment complex. Several sex offenders living at the complex have been identified and interviewed, Keenan said. But he added: ‘We have no reason to believe, at this point, that sex offenders are involved.’ About 65 local, state and federal . investigators are working on the case and several hundred interviews . have been conducted, authorities said. Maria Rodriguez, a former resident of the apartment complex, said she works with Jorelys' mother at a nearby poultry plant. Vigil: Neighbours and friends meet on the playground where Jorelys Rivera was last seen alive in Canton, Georgia to hold a candlelit vigil and leave gifts . Remembered: Children who lived near Jorelys pay respect to her in the park . ‘She was a very sweet girl,’ Rodriguez . said as she held her own four-year-old daughter. ‘She was the type of . little girl who likes her presence to be known. It's just so sad.’ Police have removed two other young children from the Rivera home over ‘concern about the supervision of Jorelys,’ said Lt. Jay Baker with the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department. Baker said no charges were expected against the mother or the baby sitter. A prayer vigil was held late Monday at the playground, where people left flowers, balloons and stuffed animals at a makeshift memorial for Jorelys. A $15,000 reward has been issued for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the girl's killer. ‘We're following up on every single tip,’ Baker said.","Body of Jorelys Rivera found brutally disfigured in dumpster on Monday .

The BBC deputy director of news today became the latest casualty of the Jimmy Savile Newsnight scandal after he resigned over the fallout from problems with the flagship investigative programme. Acting director-general Tim Davie said he had accepted Stephen Mitchell's resignation this morning with ‘great sadness’. However it soon became clear that still nobody has been sacked over the affair. It came as former Sky News executive Nick Pollard released his review into the decision to drop a report into Jimmy Savile's sexual abuse, saying it was ‘flawed’ and plunged the BBC into ‘chaos’. Scroll down for video .

Lord McAlpine being wrongly named as a paedophile - are being replaced and have not been working on the . programme for a number of weeks due to the fallout. Meanwhile, . Helen Boaden, the corporation's director of news, will return to her . post tomorrow after having stepped aside while the Pollard review was . carried out. Mr Rippon initially stepped aside from Newsnight over the shelved Savile programme. Mr Davie insisted that Mr Mitchell would not be receiving a pay-off, and said the BBC is replacing the senior editorial team for Newsnight with the appointment of a new editor and deputy editor. Mr Mitchell said in a statement: 'It is with great sadness that I have decided to retire from the BBC after more than 38 years’ service of which I am very proud and which I have found greatly enjoyable. 'Given the strain over the past month since being told to stand aside from the job I loved, having endured the Pollard review process and now having read its criticisms, I have decided that it is in my interests and those of the BBC that I bring my career to a dignified end. Moving positions: Newsnight editor Peter Rippon (left) and his deputy Liz Gibbons (right) are being replaced and have not been working on the programme for a number of weeks due to the fallout . 'Whilst . I feel vindicated that the review has found that I put no undue . pressure on Peter Rippon, I disagree with the remainder of Mr Pollard's . criticisms in relation to me. 'I am grateful for all the support I have received from friends and colleagues around the BBC. I request that both my and my family's privacy be respected at this time.' BBC broadcaster Andrew Marr defended former boss Mr Mitchell, telling BBC Radio 4’s The World At One he was a 'good guy'. He said: 'He was always one of the most . cautious, straight down the line, old-fashioned traditional voices in . the BBC. 'And, clearly, there were lots of mistakes made, but any sense, . and Pollard, of course, has pushed this to one side, that there would be . improper pressure applied by Steve Mitchell on a programme about . paedophilia or anything else - utterly, utterly out of court, completely . impossible and against his character.'

Meanwhile Helen Boaden is due to return to her role as director of news, despite being criticised in the Pollard report. Ms Boaden's attempt to alert Mr Entwistle to potential problems posed by the story during an industry lunch was 'too casual' and she is criticised for not taking 'greater responsibility' as the crisis grew. Adrian Van Klaveren is also being replaced as Radio 5 Live controller by Jonathan Wall, who is a commissioning editor. But Mr Van Klaveren will not be leaving the BBC and is set to move to a new role, which will be announced next year. Mr Rippon and Ms Gibbons are also moving to other jobs at the Corporation. The McAlpine probe led to the resignation of director-general George Entwistle after just 54 days in the job, and three BBC employees have been disciplined. One is Ms Gibbons, another is Mr Van Klaveren and the third is unknown. Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the report raises serious questions about the BBC's editorial and management issues.

Jailed: Factory worker Richard Morgan who shook his girlfriend's poorly baby son to death . A 33-year-old man who beat and shook a poorly baby to death while the boy's mother went shopping was jailed for seven-and-a-half years today. Slater Sharkey suffered 25 bruises from his head to his toes when he died aged 13 months in December 2010, a jury at Newcastle Crown Court heard. Richard Morgan, of Tantobie, County Durham, harmed the baby over 18 hours prior to his death. His partner, the child's mother, Rachel Peacock, 31, was convicted of cruelty to a child but cleared of causing or allowing her son's death. Morgan was not the boy's father and was in sole charge of Slater when the fatal injury was inflicted, Mr Justice King told him as he passed sentence at Newcastle Crown Court. He was convicted of manslaughter yesterday following a trial lasting over four weeks. He said: 'Your killing of Slater was the result primarily of your forceful shaking of the child, in a momentary loss of control, at a time when you had become frustrated by his whingeing and crying due to him in all likelihood being separated from his mother. 'Whatever the circumstances leading you to becoming frustrated at the child's behaviour, nothing justifies Slater becoming treated in this way.' Tragic baby Slater Sharkey, who died aged just 13 months, suffered 'catastrophic' head trauma and a number of bruises . The judge accepted Morgan did not intend to inflict serious harm when he shook the baby, and that he had been a good father to his own children. Bruising inflicted prior to the boy's death could not be proved to have been caused by Morgan, the judge said, but there was 'clear evidence' of assaults over a 24-hour period leading up to it. Slater's mother, Rachel Peacock, who had been living with Morgan for two months, was cleared by a jury of causing or allowing her son's death, but she was convicted of a cruelty charge. That related to an incident a month before Slater's death when she did not take him to hospital in defiance of her GP's advice. She was handed a 12-month community order by Mr Justice King, who said the single episode of neglect had not contributed to her son's death. Morgan claimed he had left the baby momentarily in the living room and when he returned, he found the boy had collapsed. Richard Morgan (left) beat and shook baby Slater Sharkey to death. His . partner, the child's mother, Rachel Peacock, (right) was convicted of . cruelty to a child but cleared of allowing or causing his death . Soon after Peacock . returned from the shops, he claimed, and they rushed his lifeless body . to Shotley Bridge Hospital, and he was then taken to the University . Hospital of North Durham, but attempts to save him failed. Outside . court Detective Chief Inspector Steve Chapman said: 'This was all about . Richard Morgan taking responsibility for his actions. 'He has always said it was not him, and ultimately the jury found him guilty. 'For the family, this was all about getting a conviction.' The pair are no longer together. During the earlier trial, Andrew Robertson QC told jurors Slater died of 'catastrophic brain damage' at the hands of Morgan, who was looking after him while Peacock went to the local shops. The court heard on the day of his death on December 11 2010 Slater had gone to the supermarket with his mother then returned home for tea. Peacock realised she had forgotten something when they got back and popped out to her local shop, leaving Slater alone with Morgan. While she was away Slater lost consciousness. Morgan claimed he had left the child playing with his toys and he was lying face-down, passed out when he got back. Slater's lifeless body was taken to hospital but he died hours later on December 11, 2010. Mr Robertson said: 'Rachel Peacock left Slater playing with his toys. When she left, she left the child in Richard Morgan's sole custody. 'When she returned, Slater was unconscious. Richard Morgan was panicking but he hadn't telephoned an ambulance. 'Richard Morgan's account was he had simply gone to the toilet leaving Slater playing with his toys in the living room floor and when he returned, Slater was face-down on the floor not breathing.' The child was found to have suffered multiple head wounds consistent with being beaten or struck against something, and had bruises on his legs which suggested he had been gripped tightly. The pair were sentenced today at Newcastle Crown Court. The baby's mother received a community order . A pathologist discovered he also had 'extensive and severe' bleeding in his eyes and bleeding and swelling to the brain - a sign he was violently shaken. Mr Robertson added: 'The fatal injury can only have occurred when the child was left alone with Richard Morgan. 'This wasn't a one-off assault.' The 31-year-old mum was found guilty of cruelty after she fled a doctor's surgery a month before Slater's death in December 2010 when it was suggested the boy should be examined by a specialist. The court heard she was covering up bruising on her boy during the shopping trip on the day he died, telling a friend she could not take him to the doctors for a cold because of the state of him. The couple were living together in Tantobie, County Durham at the time of Slater's death.","Baby Slater Sharkey suffered 25 bruises from his head to his toes when he died aged 13 months .

Accident Natalie McMillan who has been cleared of killing her four-month-old son who died from 'catastrophic injuries' when a television weighing five stone dropped on his head . A woman was today cleared of killing her four-month-old son who died from 'catastrophic injuries' when a television weighing five stone dropped on his head. Kian McMillan was lying below on his changing mat and died a day later in hospital after the incident at his home in Burnley, Lancashire, on December 6 last year. Natalie McMillan, 25, initially told detectives she accidentally knocked over the TV set as she attempted to move it to plug in a scart lead and watch a DVD. In interview she said: 'I have never hurt my son on purpose... all because I wanted to watch a film.' She denied she had been under the influence of drugs but tests later showed she had taken heroin and valium. McMillan was charged with manslaughter by gross negligence and child neglect but then changed her version of events as she shifted the blame to the boy's father. When giving evidence in her trial at Preston Crown Court, she claimed ex-partner Edward Hanratty, 41, was the person responsible for the television falling and that she was upstairs in bed when it happened. She admitted guilt to neglect midway through the trial, while Hanratty also changed his plea to guilty on the same charge after he gave evidence. The prosecution had alleged McMillan was responsible for the toppling television while Hanratty was passed out on the kitchen floor through drink and drugs. She said she decided to accept the blame on his behalf from the moment she made the 999 call from the address in Scarlett Street because she was scared of him. Prosecutor Suzanne Goddard QC said this was 'nonsense' and that she was lying. Father: Edward Hanratty, who the prosecution said was passed out on the kitchen floor through drink and drugs at the time of the accident . In his closing speech yesterday, . Peter Wright QC, defending McMillan, told jurors they were not being . asked to determine if his client was a good mother. The relevant questions were: was she responsible for the television falling and if so; was her behaviour so grossly negligent that it was 'truly exceptionally bad' rather than a mistake or a serious error of judgment. Mr Wright said: 'We say the evidence points away rather than to her being responsible. A not guilty verdict is not a vindication of Natalie McMillan or a dereliction of Kian McMillan.' The jury took less than four hours to reach its verdict. Deliberations: Jurors at Preston Crown Court took less than four hours to find the two defendants not guilty . McMillan, of Leeds, and Hanratty, of Bradford, will both be sentenced on January 31. The Recorder of Preston, Judge Anthony Russell QC, told McMillan he wanted a pre-sentence report to find out more about her personal background. He said all sentencing options remained available, including custody. Hanratty was released on bail yesterday following his guilty plea.

A married internet tycoon brought ‘shame’ on this country by thrusting his groin into a female tourist on a train during the Olympics, a court heard. Stefan Glaenzer, 51, carried out the assault after travelling from station to  station on the London Underground to ogle at women from behind.

District Judge Michael Snow told Glaenzer that his victim, an American in her 20s, felt ‘violated’ by the attack. She had travelled to London especially to see the Olympics and said she would never return to the city. Judge Snow said: ‘Her memory of her visit has been tarnished. It is to . this country’s shame that you brought another country’s citizen to that . frame of mind. ‘She’s extremely angry by what happened to her and I’m sure that in . addition, she is disgusted and feels violated. Women on the Underground . are easy prey for men like you.’ Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard Glaenzer was spotted by police . acting strangely at Oxford Circus Tube station at 5.50pm on August 8. Prosecutor Jonathan Gold said he ‘seemed to be paying close attention’ to some of the women before boarding a Central line train to Bond . Street.

On a third train, he stood behind his victim . and thrust his crotch into her backside twice – leading to his instant . arrest. Mr Gold added: ‘He admitted what he had done. He said he had had urges . to do that since his wife had given birth a couple of months ago.’ Defending, Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC said her client had led an . ‘exemplary life’ and had never been in trouble with the police before.

One of two convicted bank robbers who fled a Chicago jail using knotted bed sheets has been captured following a police and federal manhunt. Joseph ""Jose"" Banks was caught by agents and officers from the Chicago FBI Violent Crimes Task Force, and officers from the Chicago Police Department, around 11:30 p.m. Thursday. Banks had been on the run with prison mate Kenneth Conley, 38, after the two escaped on Tuesday, descending a 20 story drop from a window of the Metropolitan Correctional Center. Joseph Banks, 37, (left) has now been captured while his prison mate Kenneth Conley, 38, (right) remains on the run . The 37 year-old was captured by officers without incident. The two men had been on the run for hours before the escape was reported. The men apparently descended from a thin window barely half a foot wide on the flat south side of the prison into the alley below. The wall faces a parking garage and is above air conditioning or heating units. Crowds of people gathered outside the building where the ropes still blew in the breeze, shaking their heads in disbelief that someone could have escaped from a lockup in the heart of downtown Chicago, just a block or two from key federal court and office buildings. The escape went unnoticed for hours, with surveillance video from a nearby street showing the two hopping into a cab shortly before 3 a.m. Tuesday. They were no longer wearing their orange jail-issued jumpsuits. When the facility did discover the two men were gone, around 7 a.m., what was found revealed a meticulously planned escape, including clothing and sheets shaped to resemble a body under blankets on beds, bars inside a mattress and even fake bars in the cells. A massive manhunt involving state, federal and local law enforcement agencies was launched, as SWAT teams stormed into the home of a relative of Conley, only to learn the two had been there but had left, and searched other area homes and businesses -- including a strip club where Conley once worked. The owners of several small shops . across the street from the wall said they didn't see any police activity . until around 8:30 a.m., when a dozen or more police cars and SWAT teams . rushed into the area. Some police officers sprinted for a nearby subway . entrance. Banks, known as . the Second-Hand Bandit because he wore used clothes during his heists, . was convicted last week of robbing two banks and attempting to rob two . others. Authorities say he stole almost $600,000, and most of that still . is missing. The Metropolitan Correctional Center where the two robbers escaped from using their makeshift bedsheet rope .

On camera: Seen here in May of 2011, Conley was charged with robbing MB Financial in Homewood, Illinois . During trial, he had to be restrained because he threatened to walk out of the courtroom. He acted as his own attorney and verbally sparred with the prosecutor, at times arguing that U.S. law didn't apply to him because he was a sovereign citizen of a group that was above state and federal law. Conley pleaded guilty last October to robbing a Homewood Bank last year of nearly $4,000. Conley, who worked at the time at a suburban strip club, wore a coat and tie when he robbed the bank and had a gun stuffed in his waistband.","Joseph ""Jose"" Banks, 37, captured by FBI's Violent Crimes Task Force .

A general charged with multiple sex offences, including forcible sodomy and wrongful sexual conduct, is to face a court martial and could . receive life in prison if convicted, the Army said yesterday. Among the allegations against . Brigadier General Jeffrey Sinclair are that he carried on affairs with and . mistreated subordinate officers and later tried to impede the . investigation of some of the offenses by deleting nude photos and other . emails. A 27-year Army veteran who served . five combat tours, Sinclair is charged with eight crimes, including one . count of forcible sodomy; two counts of wrongful sexual conduct; six . counts of inappropriate sexual relationships, and eight counts of . violating regulations. Scroll down for video . Court Martial: Jeffrey A. Sinclair has been charged with forcible . sodomy, multiple counts of adultery and having inappropriate . relationships with several female subordinates. His wife Rebecca Sinclair has stood by her man saying that the decade of . war has taken its toll on military couples and brought pressure on their . marriages . The case is the latest in a series of . missteps by military leaders: At least five current and former generals . at the rank of one-star or higher have been reprimanded or investigated . for possible misconduct in recent months. The five pages of allegations involved Sinclair's conduct with five women who were not his wife . The charges involve activities when . he was in Afghanistan, Iraq, Germany and at Fort Bragg, N.C., and they . include violating what's known as General Order No. 1 - possessing . alcohol in a war zone. Sinclair is also charged with . disobeying orders, including an order from Maj. Gen. James Huggins, his . superior officer, to cease contact with one of the women. The charges . allege that Sinclair willfully disobeyed the order by calling the . woman's phone. Army officials said Tuesday that Lt. Gen. Daniel B. Allyn, commander of the 18th Airborne Corps, has referred the case to a general court-martial, and the arraignment is set for Jan. 22 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Grave allegations: Sinclair, left, pictured laughing with elder Afghan leaders, has been accused by female subordinates of forcing them to send him their nude photos . Defense: Sinclair's wife of 27 years came to his defense, writing in an op-ed piece that the open-ended wars and years spent apart are partially to blame for sex scandals in the Army . The court martial announcement was . made early in the day Tuesday, but the charges were not released until . much later. Throughout the Sinclair case, Army officials have been slow . to release details of the allegations, which are routinely detailed in . other cases - usually involving soldiers of lower rank. Sinclair could face life in prison if convicted on the most serious criminal offenses. The female captain at the heart of the . Sinclair case admitted she carried on a three-year sexual relationship . with Sinclair, who is married. Adultery is a crime under military law, . and the admission could end her career. She also testified at an evidentiary . hearing early last month that she repeatedly tried to break off the . affair with Sinclair, who she says threatened to kill her and her family . if she told anyone about their frequent sexual liaisons in hotels, . headquarters and war zones. The woman admitted she typically wanted to . have sex with the general, though she said that on two occasions in . Afghanistan he exposed himself and physically forced her to perform oral . sex, even as she sobbed. Disgraced hero: The 27-year Army veteran was deputy commander in charge of logistics and support for the 82nd Airborne Division in Afghanistan before being abruptly relieved in May . Promiscuous: Prosecutors believe Sinclair committed sex crimes against five women in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Germany . Trial continues: Sinclair's trial is now in its third day at Fort Bragg and witnesses continue to come forward . Although the allegations involve five women, she was the only one who says he used physical force. Defense lawyers painted the female . captain as a liar and a scorned lover who was trying to ruin Sinclair's . life and military reputation. During the hearings they characterized her . as a ""crazy"" and manipulative ""back-stabber"" who blamed others for her . mistakes. Two female officers who had served . with Sinclair testified last month that they had given the general nude . photos at his request. His wife, Rebecca Sinclair, stayed . away from the days-long military hearing but later went public with an . opinion piece in The Washington Post. In that column she said she was . not condoning her husband's infidelity, but she said that the decade of . war has taken its toll on military couples and brought pressure on their . marriages. In an interview with the AP, Rebecca . Sinclair said her husband called her last spring to tell her about the . affair and allegations, and she said they were trying to mend their . relationship.

Self-portrait: As he is unable to write or drive Florida man Roger Skelton uses art as therapy. But he now faces eviction from his house and studio . On the doorstep: Disabled artist Roger Skelton is being threatened with eviction by his own sister . According to ABC 7, his sister is unhappy with the fact that Skelton has got a roommate, something that Greenwood informed him was not allowed in November. He claims: 'She wants to be in control of my living situation and that is not going to happen.' Skelton says he has paid rent on time for the last seven years but was served a notice from the sheriff's officer earlier in the month. 'I got a five day notice that I needed to do something,' he told ABC 7. Skelton admits that the property is his sister's house and she 'can do what she wants', but says he needs more time. Out on your ear? Skelton received the eviction notice from his sister on December 11 . Therapy: Skelton says this painting called Bossman is his most popular print . Skelton's apartment also doubles as his studio and he says it would be devastating if his artwork was thrown onto the streets. Following the car accident 32 years ago, he hasn't been able to write or drive so he turned to art. 'It is therapeutic is what I would call it. I like the fact that I can do it,' Skelton said. On his blog, Skelton says that he often depicts tropical scenes using Caribbean colors, inspired by the seven years he spent in the Bahamas as a child. Recently, Skelton has begun to sell some of paintings. Roger's sister, Virginia Greenwood, told ABC 7 that she has worked to help Roger over the years and got a second job as the rent doesn't cover the mortgage. Greenwood claims that she doesn't want to do that for Skelton's roommate and that the dispute has been going on for some time. Elizabeth Boyle of Gulf Coast Legal Services, an organization that provides free legal aid in Tampa Bay, said this was a 'very unusual' case. 'If the sister wanted to get the house because she was in dire need and needed the money that would be a whole different question. I don't think that is what I am hearing here,' Boyle added. Both brother and sister will be hoping a resolution can be found over the holiday season.

The family had booked Lucy in for an appointment to be neutered, but the pups arrived too soon. 'We thought Jack was too young to be able to do anything. But obviously he wasn’t and we know that now.

'But it didn't take long [for them] to trust people again and we gave them lots of love and care. 'They hadn't seen anything for years and they had to get used to going for a walk. Adorable: But the RSPCA prosecutor said Angus and the other dogs came from 'a case of the most extreme neglect you are ever likely to come across' Overgrown: Horrifying photo shows Angus as he was when rescued. He was unable to see or walk because of his matted hair after being neglected for up to six months . 'Lacy is brilliant. I take her to work with me every day now and she just runs around the place, she's such a happy dog now and she's getting much more used to people. 'Her hair has grown back to a normal length now and she is so beautiful. Her temperament is just lovely, you would understand her being aggressive now and again, but I've never seen a side to her at all.' Lacy, Molly and Angus were saved after neighbours complained about an 'incredible odour' outside the property. RSPCA officers found the animals living in 'quite disgusting' conditions, which left one inspector 'gagging' because of the stench. Happy now: The dogs needed extensive coaxing and needed to be trained to do basic things because of the ill treatment they had suffered . A specialist dog groomer removed huge amounts of matted fur from the shih-tzus, who struggled to walk due to the weight of their overgrown coats. The groomer said the dogs' coats were in the worst condition of any he had ever seen. Molly, believed to be around five years old, was adopted by Kay and David Cooke from Hexham, Northumberland. The couple were looking for another dog as company for their border terrier, Oscar. Kay, 49, said: 'We saw an advert for Molly and I fell in love with her straight away. She was adorable. 'We wanted a friend for Oscar and so decided to meet Molly to see if the pair of them would get on. 'We knew that we would like a rescue dog as we wanted to give a dog who really needed to be loved, a good home. She added: 'When we first saw Molly, we took her for a walk. She was very tense so we stopped and I picked her up. 'As soon as she was in my arms, she just melted, and that's when I knew that I was going to love her very much. 'I would like to think that was the moment she felt safe. 'When Molly first came to live with us, she had no sensory experiences. I can't imagine how it must have been for all three of them living in those conditions. 'We have had a lot of work to do with her, as it's harder to teach an older dog the basic skills you would easily drill into a puppy. But she has been worth every minute of it, and I'd like to think she is happier than she has ever been.' Tina Bolton, 47, decided to re-home Angus, as her daughter May, 11, had always wanted a pet. Squalid: Lacy (pictured) and the other dogs were kept in appalling conditions and were left ungroomed by their owner Pauline Kinghorn . Dreadful: Molly (pictured) and the other dogs were unable to walk because of the length of their hair. An RSPCA officer described their coats as looking like 'dreadlocks' Tina, from Gosforth, Newcastle, said she was looking for a dog for May and, seeing Angus enquired about his background. 'We heard he had been living in really bad conditions, but we weren't told too many details - I think so it wouldn't have clouded our judgement of him,' she said. 'But, we found out later on how Angus and the other two dogs had been treated and it was such a shock. 'I don't know how anybody could neglect an animal like that. 'We didn't really know what we were taking on when we re-homed Angus, because we had no idea how his past might have affected his behaviour, and that's something I was of course wary of with a child in the house. Pauline Kinghorn, 62, received a lifetime ban for her poor treatment of the animals . 'But he has been nothing but fun. We've had no problems at all and he's just brought sheer joy into our lives' Ms Bolton said the family has seen a big difference in Angus already. 'I don't consider myself to be a natural dog lover but Angus is adorable,' she said. 'We quite quickly came to see that he was really happy living with us and I don't think that it will ever come back to haunt us. 'He gets excited when I come home but I'm nothing compared to my daughter to him. He lives by her side, they're like soul mates.' Ms Bolton said she felt 'humbled' to think that she and her family had given him a better life. The shih-tzus' previous owner, Pauline Kinghorn, 62, appeared at Bedlington Magistrates Court in November where she admitted four charges of failing to ensure the welfare of the animals in her care. When sentenced, she was banned from keeping animals for life and also given an eight-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months. During proceedings, the court was told by Clive McKeag, prosecuting for the RSPCA, that it was 'a case of the most extreme neglect you are ever likely to come across', and warned magistrates that the DVD showing the animals would fill them with 'revulsion, disgust and probably anger'. Kinghorn was also given a two-month . curfew order, which involves her having to stay at home between 7pm and . 7am and be electronically tagged. She was previously banned from owning . cats for five years in 2003. She admitted causing unnecessary suffering . to the three shih-tzus and the German Shepherd between October last year . and April this year. Kinghorn also admitted four charges of failing to ensure the welfare of the four dogs and 12 cats in her care. Paul Watson, defending, said in court that Kinghorn . had health problems, including visual impairment caused by dense . cataracts and had no-one to help her look after the animals.

The bank used by the Queen is being chased for compensation by a couple who won £1million, but were left with £10,000 a year to live on after being given the ‘wrong advice’. The unidentified couple from Devon who won the lottery in 2001, are now hoping to win a substantial amount of compensation from Coutts. They claim the 320-year-old private bank advised them to put £650,000 into with-profits bonds which left them just £10,000 a year to live on. Lost out: Coutts, the bank used by the Queen is being chased for compensation by a couple who won £1million, but were left with £10,000 a year to live on after being given the ¿wrong advice¿ . Coutts is even older than the Bank of England which was founded two years later in 1694. Coutts which used to be called Campbell Bank, was set up by John Campbell in London's Strand in 1692. Its first bank outside the capital was opened in Eton in 1961. Coutts used designers Ozwald Boateng and Stella McCartnet to design credit and debit cards. Buckingham Palace has a Coutts cash machine. The bank is mentioned in Gilbert and Sullivan's opera The Gondoliers in the lyric: 'The aristocrat which banks with Coutts; The aristocrat who hunts and shoots; The aristocrat who cleans our boots; The all shall equal be. 'We chose Coutts because they are the Queen's bank and we thought that they would be a safe pair of hands,' the couple told The Daily Telegraph. They said they have spoken out about their case to warn other lottery winners - over Christmas 60 lottery millionaires will be created. Lottery winners are offered a range of financial advice when they accept their windfall, although Camelot did not disclose if Coutts was one of the key banks. The couple have submitted their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, stating they were 'normal working people' who earned £42,000 a year between them before the win. They allege they should have been treated as 'vulnerable people' due to the unexpected surprise of their overnight win in 2001. The pair were sold with-profits bonds as a relatively low risk investment. Although with-profits bonds were designed to withstand instability in global stock markets - by setting aside a proportion of the profits made in good years and using them to enhance the returns paid to investors in harder years - many have struggled to cope with phases of stock market instability since the start of the economic crisis in 2008. Publicity: They said they have spoken out about their case to warn other lottery winners - over Christmas 60 lottery millionaires will be created . A spokesman for the ombudsman service said they had received 348 complaints about the bonds last year and they had upheld a quarter. A spokesman for Coutts told the paper: 'We can not comment on individual cases because of client confidentiality.' After initially ruling against the lottery winners, the The Financial Ombdusmad Service said it would rule on the case in the next few months. Earlier this year Coutts, was been fined £8.75million for ‘serious and systematic’ failings when handling money from suspected criminals or foreign despots. City regulators criticised the private bank for taking ‘an unacceptable risk of handling the proceeds of crime’. The fine, imposed by the Financial Services Authority, is a record amount for a money laundering offence.","The couple from Devon are now hoping to win a substantial amount of compensation from the 320-year-old private bank .

They are an icon of the American West and a symbol of the country's frontier history, but now hundreds of mustang horses face slaughter due to overpopulation. Under existing laws the government pays ranchers to take in thousands of these 'wild' horses a year in order to keep population numbers down. Mustangs are not an indigenous species to America and are known to have an adverse affect on natural ecosystems. The current system of managing these threats has been in place since 1971 but now rising feed costs has resulted in a growing number of American ranchers refusing to take on mustangs. Mustangs are regarded as a symbol of the frontier history of the American West . The Government uses helicopters to trap mustangs and thin populations . Campaigners say that helicopter herding is cruel and does not distinguish the fit horses from the old and young populations . Pregnant mares and young foals are sometimes stampeded across miles and miles of rugged terrain, according to activists . Officials have warned that the government's own holding pastures and short-term corrals are themselves reaching over capacity. The result could mean that thousands of this treasured breed will be slaughtered in order to contain overpopulation. Across ten western states in the US an estimated 37,000 wild horses and feral donkeys roam the ranges. Officials say this is 11,000 more than the manageable population, and it is expected that figures will double every four years. There are around 50,000 wild horses and donkeys currently held in temporary pastures, three times the amount held a decade ago. Despite the crisis in overpopulation, and the known effects of wild hoses on natural habitats of other native animals, activists continue to battle with the government over its management of mustangs in particular. To thin the populations of wild herds helicopters are used to chase mustangs into traps. Some campaigners think this is cruel and damaging to a species they think America should be protecting. Suzanne Roy of the American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign said that pregnant mares and foals are stampeded by helicopters over miles of rugged terrain. 'Helicopter's aren't discerning,' she said. 'They stampede the very old and the very young with the fit.' Authorities have been accused of managing mustangs into extinction. However, only 99 out of the 11,000 gathered from the plains last year died. That's less than 1%. Officials are now beginning to recognise that slaughter might be the only solution to contain the population. Government legislation has been criticised for favouring ranchers who prefer land to be freed of wild horses to make way for cattle . Officials estimate that just under 50,000 wild horses are held in temporary pasture . There remains a controversy over whether the mustang can be considered an indigenous animal in North America . Ms Roy denies this and she questions the wisdom surrounding the belief that America's land cannot support mustang populations. She claims that the legislation is weighted heavily in favour of the ranchers who need the land freed up for cattle. The problem could be better addressed through contraceptive measures using fertility drugs. Tom Gorey, of the Bureau of Land Management, denied that this would provide an adequate alternative. He said: 'Logistically, [contraception] is very hard. It has not been demonstrated to be a magical solution.' The US Congress has recognised the mustang as ' a living symbol of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West.' The first Mustangs descended from Iberian horses brought to Mexico and Florida from Spain during the settlement of North America. Most of these horses were of Andalusian, Arabian and Barb ancestry and were domesticated animals tamed for human use. This has led to a dispute over whterh it is entirely accurate to call the mustang 'wild' since it is the descendent of a domestic breed which is not native to the natural habitat. Native Americans quickly adopted the horse as a primary means of transportation. They were also used in battles, trade, and hunts, particularly bison hunts. Some environmentalist claim that the mustang should be classed as indigenous because there is evidence that horses roamed North America in per-historic times. More than half of all Mustangs in North America are found in Nevada , with other significant populations in Montana, Wyoming and Oregon. The government says that the total manageable population in the wild should be 26,000 a figure that is significantly lower than the reality. 'We are reaching a critical mass,' Tom Gorey added. 'And we don't see any instant solution.'","Iconic horse of the American west threatens natural ecosystems .

Healthy appetite: Mad Men Actress January Jones came under fire for eating her own placenta in the form of dried pills . When it comes to dishing out advise on health and wellbeing, maybe celebrities should just stick to their day jobs. From Simon Cowell carrying around inhalable bottles of oxygen to tackle tiredness and stress, to actress Patsy Palmer rubbing coffee granules into her skin to prevent cellulite, stars are more prone than most to questionable fads. Now scientists are hitting back and debunking the outlandish claims which are often lapped up by the public. In a report, the charity Sense About Science has named and shamed actors, singers and sports personalities guilty of peddling 'dubious' scientific theories. They also list five 'misleading' terms celebrities should avoid in 2013 as they mean very little - immune boosting, detox, superfood, oxygenating and cleansing. And in an Olympic year, one of 2012's most popular fads was seen adorning the legs, backs and buttocks of athletes - coloured sports tape. Footballer Mario Balotelli, tennis players Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams, and British sprinter Dwain Chambers all used the Kinesio strapping, which comes in a variety of shades, to help with injuries. Developed by a Japanese doctor more than 30 years ago, the adhesive tape is designed to provide muscle and joint support without restricting movement. But sports scientist Professor Greg Whyte said: 'The manufacturers...claim placement of the tape on the skin reduces pain and swelling in injured muscles. It's unclear how this can positively affect inflammation deep within the muscle.' He added: 'That said. This tape could have added placebo effect'. In 2011, Simon Cowell championed vitamin injections, but this year the media mogul has opted for pocket-sized oxygen shots to get his health fix. According to reports, Cowell - also an aficionado of botox - is convinced inhaling the gas can reduce the signs of tiredness, stress and ageing. Kay Mitchell, from the centre for . Altitude Space and Extreme Environment Medicine, warned 'breathing pure . oxygen can cause collapse of lung air sacs - this could make you more . susceptible to lung infections'. You can trust Simon Cowell to discover the Next Big Thing in showbusiness, but when it comes to reliable health advice perhaps one should look elsewhere. The X-Factor supremo, who last year championed vitamin injections, apparently carries small bottles of oxygen with him convinced that inhaling the gas can reduce the signs of tiredness, stress and ageing. Actress Patsy Palmer's home-made cure . for cellulite involves rubbing coffee granules into her skin. But pharmaceutical scientist Dr . Gary Moss is not convinced. He says that while 'caffeine may have an effect, the coffee . granules won't....for any chance of seeing an effect from such a small . amount of caffeine you would need to be rubbing coffee into your skin . all day.' The . Manchester City striker is one of many sportsmen to use Kinesio . strapping, developed by a Japanese doctor  to provide muscle and joint . support without restricting movement. The tape, which comes in a range of colours is supposed to help with injuries. Scientists however remain unconvinced with a common view being that the tape might have, at best, a placebo effect. The US actress apparently believes that children would better understand where their emotions come from  if they were taught about the functions of the brain.But in a scathing put down, neuroscientist Professor Sergo Della Sala said such an idea would work be no more effective than 'understanding the chemical components of a ball would help them to kick it better'. Earlier this year, US star Sheryl Crow claimed her mobile phone may have been to blame for a benign brain tumour.The Soak Up The Sun singer said she used to spend  hours chatting away on 'archaic old cell phones.'But Dr Mireille Toledano from Imperial College London said: 'The evidence to date is clear that short term use of mobile phones is not linked to brain cancer'.

Gary Moss says that while 'caffeine may have an effect, the coffee . granules won't....for any chance of seeing an effect from such a small . amount of caffeine you would need to be rubbing coffee into your skin . all day.' Star of Mad Men January Jones came . under fire for eating her own placenta in the form of dried pills, . following the birth of her son. Catherine Collins, principal dietician at St George's Hospital, said: 'Nutritionally, there's little to be gained from eating your placenta - raw, cooked or dried.' Earlier this year, singer Sheryl Crowe claimed her mobile phone may have been to blame for a benign brain tumour, saying 'I do have a theory that it's possible that it's related to that, I used to spend hours on the archaic old cell phones.' But Dr Mireille Toledano from . Imperial College London said: 'The evidence to date is clear that short . term use of mobile phones is not linked to brain cancer'. Sense About Science also took . exception to chancellor George Osborne saying the Government was giving . the economy '110 per cent' of its attention. Nigel . Hawkes, the former director of straight statists, said: 'You can't have . 110 per cent of anything....it's nonsense to anybody with any feeling . for numbers.' Helpful contribution: Singer Gary Kemp said he was a pragmatic cynic and believer in 'hardcore medicine and science' The . charity did congratulate a handful of celebrities for making a helpful . contribution and 'talking sense' on food fads, vitamin supplements and . alternative therapies. Singer Gary Kemp was praised for his comments in the Daily Mail last month debunking alternative medicine. The former Spandau Ballet frontman said: 'I've tried acupuncture...but I'm a pragmatic cynic and believe hardcore medicine and science should be your first port of call before you deviate to other things, otherwise your life could be at risk.' Science writer Simon Singh said it is 'right to highlight the value of ""hardcore"" medicine, which simply means that the treatment has been tested and shown to be effective.' Cricketer Stuart Broad was also commended after telling the Daily Mail that food supplements are mostly superfluous, saying 'you can get enough out of your diet'. Tracey Brown, the managing director of Sense About Science said: 'We seem to be seeing a celebrity divide on science. The implausible and frankly dangerous claims about how to avoid cancer, improve skin or lose weight are becoming ever more ridiculous. On the other hand, this year we have had more examples than ever sent to us of people in the public eye who clearly do check their facts.'","Simon Cowell carried a bottle of oxygen to help combat tiredness .

Now she is walking her new ambition is to learn how to drive . A teenager who was told to get on with life in a wheelchair life because she would never walk again is now walking after a pioneering operation. Charlotte Volante, from Jersey, had been confined to a wheelchair since the age of 11 after being born with spina bifida and hydrocephalus (water on the brain). But children's orthopaedic expert Caroline Edwards was confident she could get Charlotte standing again. After a complex operation in July this year to lengthen the tight muscles at the hips, knees and feet, Charlotte amazed her family by standing up next to her hospital bed. Supported by a nurse and her mother Bernadette, 52, the teenager then walked around her ward and the nurses' station at Southampton General Hospital. The breakthrough was just 10 days before her 18th birthday and left Charlotte and her family with a double reason to celebrate. Charlotte, . the youngest of five girls and two boys, said: 'When I was 11, I was . given an electric wheelchair and told to just get on with it. 'After I met Caroline, I agreed to let her do the op she suggested but I didn't really know if it would work. 'Walking again after my operation did not feel strange and it didn't hurt; it just felt completely natural.' It has been a long road for Charlotte as she and her parents have made more than 500 return trips to Southampton for treatment. She had already undergone 42 surgical procedures on her head, legs, back and stomach. Charlotte was born with spina bifida - a fault in . the development of the spinal cord and surrounding bones (vertebrae) that had left a gap in her spine. She also developed the related condition hydrocephalus - where cerebro-spinal fluid doesn't drain into the blood stream properly. She will still need to return to Southampton for further treatment including having new splints fitted. Her father Tony, 50, said: 'We have been coming to Southampton General Hospital regularly since Charlotte was just a day old and have nothing but good things to say about it. 'The staff have been brilliant and there are still one or two we remember from when we first came in all those years ago.' Meanwhile, Charlotte is hoping to fulfil another dream - learning to drive. 'Caroline has given me the drive to go on and make all my dreams a reality and I now hope to begin to drive - and I'm already saving for a car,' she said. Charlotte with her mother Bernadette and father Tony: They have all been impressed with Charlotte's treatment at Southampton General Hospital . Charlotte is one of 15 children and young people who have benefited from a pioneering accelerated rehabilitation programme developed by the hospital. The programme can see patients walking within six weeks of hip surgery through the use of a removable brace. Conventionally, patients are placed in plaster shorts - known as a spica - for six to eight weeks. These hold the hip in place but limit movement, causing muscle wastage, delaying the start of therapy treatment and preventing them from standing for at least three months. Under accelerated rehabilitation, patients are placed in their brace at night or during periods of rest following surgery, allowing early movement and standing to preserve muscle strength or comfortable seating. The programme is already helping young cerebral palsy patients as well as those with spina bifida, where a series of birth defects affect the development of the spine and nervous system. 'It is fantastic to see children and young people like Charlotte to be up on their feet so soon after major invasive surgery - the early movement with the brace seems to be the key,' said Miss Edwards. 'I am delighted for Charlotte and her family, especially as they thought she would never walk again.'","Charlotte was confined to a wheelchair aged 11 and told to 'just get on with it'

Printed books made a surprise comeback this Christmas after figures revealed the strongest week of sales in three years. The autobiographies of TV star Miranda Hart and Olympic cyclist Bradley Wiggins were believed to be key factors in the surge of book-buying in the Christmas rush. Physical books have seen dwindling sales in recent years due to the increased use of e-readers and tablets, but this Christmas their fortunes were reversed. Success: Jamie Oliver (left) took the crown of most-popular book this Christmas after his 15-Minute Meals sold 140,155 copies in the UK last week . Right: Is It Just Me? - the memoirs of Miranda Hart (left) - came second in the UK Christmas book chart . The industry saw takings of £75.4million in the week ending December 22 - up by 20 per cent on the previous week and £1.4million higher than the same period in 2011. Most popular was Jamie Oliver's 15-Minute Meals, which sold 140,155 copies in the UK last week. Second was comic Miranda Hart's Is It Just Me?, in which the star looks back on her childhood, followed by Bradley Wiggins's account of his journey through the Tour de France and the Olympics. The titles sold 64,691 and 59,524 copies respectively. Writer William Dalrymple, who authored Nine Lives: In Search of the Sacred in Modern India,  was among those who welcomed the news. He said on Twitter: 'Real books fighting back!' Antony Beevor, whose books include The Second World War and Stalingrad, told the Guardian: 'This looks to be positive in many ways but the question is, what are the figures for sales of serious fiction,' he said. 'I would fear they are down quite considerably, and that is probably true of serious books across the board.' He added part of the attraction of celebrity memoirs was due to the pictures. The Guinness World Records 2013 came in at fourth place, while a film tie-in version of JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit was fifth. Industry figures show that physical book sales in the UK have fallen every year since hitting a peak of £1.8bn in 2007, when the final Harry Potter book was released.

'Unacceptably hostile': BBC presenter Evan Davis (right) was under fire last night following an extraordinary interview with George Osborne (left) in which he was continually interrupted . The interview began with the presenter asking the Chancellor if government borrowing would have gone up without income from selling the rights to operate 4G mobile phone services. EVAN DAVIS: Just to be absolutely clear, if you strip out all of the accounting changes, the Royal Mail, post, the different treatment of banks, the asset purchase facility, all those things, if you take those out and you take out the 4G licence, borrowing would actually go up this year? It’s a simple, simple question, and I am asking you if that’s the case or not. GEORGE OSBORNE: Well, I just don’t think you can strip out... DAVIS: It’s extraordinary you can’t answer. OSBORNE: I am sorry, I am answering your question, it’s not that I am not answering it, it’s like saying if we went ahead with the fuel duty rise in January, which is the same month that the 4G receipts are scored, well what would happen then? DAVIS: Well that would be a perfectly reasonable question but I didn’t choose to ask it. OSBORNE: Or, indeed, what happens if we do or don’t go ahead with the big increase in investment allowances. DAVIS: Another interesting question which I didn’t choose to ask. 'Spoken to': Mr Davis's barrage led to a BBC apology but the BBC denied he had been reprimanded . OSBORNE: I would say the money we get from the 4G receipts, which is an independent number, that money enables us in the round, with all the other things going on, to help small businesses to help fund capital investment, for example in further education colleges and schools. So it’s all part of a whole... what I am saying is that it’s a pretty desperate attempt... DAVIS: Well it’s not a desperate attempt. OSBORNE: I’m sorry, I’m sorry, as you know this is what the Labour Party put out to try and explain the fact that they put out for weeks in advance saying that the deficit was going up when in fact the deficit is coming down. DAVIS: Mr Osborne, everyone was surprised, the Labour Party was surprised, the Institute for Fiscal Studies was surprised, a lot of people, I was surprised, people covering it on telly were surprised, everyone was surprised. I will ask you another very simple question, is the cut in borrowing, when you strip out the one-off factors, apart from the 4G licence, is the cut in borrowing less than £3.5billion? OSBORNE: Well it depends on... DAVIS: We’re wasting our time giving us a non-answer, let’s move on. Ambushed: The interview with Mr Osborne began with the presenter asking the Chancellor if government borrowing would have gone up without income from selling the rights to operate 4G mobile phone services . OSBORNE: I’m sorry, you can’t just ask these questions and before you even allow me to answer... DAVIS: Well it’s a factual question, you are clearly unable to answer, so let’s move on. Come on, let’s not waste time. OSBORNE: Can I just answer your question? Let me answer it like this. There are four different ways you can present our numbers, it’s all been done independently, some of it includes things like selling the Royal Mail pension fund, some of it involves a transfer of the QE coupons, there are lots of different ways [an audible sigh is made in the background] of presenting the numbers, every single different version of presenting those numbers audited independently shows that, yes, we are making progress. The deficit has come down by a quarter, it is continuing to fall, of course it’s still far too high and I want to do more to get it down but we are making progress...  [the interview continues to discuss the deficit and Mr Osborne ends a subsequent point with...] We are being completely transparent. DAVIS: You were transparent and I was defending your transparency until the first answer of this interview in which you just refused to say the simple thing, which is it would have been going up, borrowing this year. You chose not to answer it. OSBORNE: Hold on, you cannot pull... DAVIS: You can, let’s not waste any more time on it. OSBORNE: That’s simply not how Autumn Statements are put together...

He only arrived to review her at 4.05am after initially being called at 3.15am and gave no explanation for his delay, an inquest heard. Mrs Day gave birth to little Fleur by Caesarean section within the hour at 4.54am on December 9, 2010 at Cheltenham General Hospital. She weighed just 5.86lbs and was very cold. She was not feeding naturally from her mother and developed both hypoglycaemia and hypothermia. But a coroner said other staff also failed the mum as her condition didn't trigger alarm bells quickly enough and there was a delay in moving her to a special care unit. Paediatrician Dr Haroon Mansoori, a locum who had been at the hospital for just four days, told the inquest Fleur appeared to be in 'good condition' when he examined her. He said he was unaware of her low temperature, but had he been, would have admitted her to the special care baby unit. 'As a result of this little girl's . death, it may well be that we will avoid and prevent similar deaths in . these circumstances in the future. The NHS is rightly cherished as a favourite institution of which mostly we can be proud.' Coroner Tom Osborne . Paediatrician registrar Dr Ka Fai Sun was also said to be lacking 'basic skills' to help when Fleur went into the Special Care Bay Unit at around 5pm. By that time her oxygen saturation levels were low. And a consultant paediatrician was held up in traffic and did not arrive at the hospital until 6.30pm - an hour after he was called. Fleur died two hours later at 8.30pm and pathologists were unable to determine her cause of death. Tom Osborne, the assistant deputy Gloucestershire coroner, said hospital staff 'missed opportunities' that might have saved the baby. He said he was referring the case to the Care Quality Commission to investigate neo-natal care at the Gloucestershire NHS Hospitals Trust. Recording a narrative verdict, Mr. Osborne said: 'She was not recognised as small for her gestational age and at high risk of hypothermia and hypoglycaemia - or that she had signs indicating she was unwell after delivery. 'These would have warranted an early paediatric review and admission to the special care baby unit for monitoring and investigation. 'This resulted in a lost opportunity to render further medical intervention. 'As a result of this little girl's death, it may well be that we will avoid and prevent similar deaths in these circumstances in the future. 'The NHS is rightly cherished as a favourite institution of which mostly we can be proud. 'But unfortunately, as is evident from the death of Fleur, there are rare occasions when a person under the care of the NHS is badly let down.' Mrs Day, formerly of Cirencester, Gloucestershire, but now living in China, left the two-day hearing without comment.","Lucy Day was 'badly let down' by the NHS who missed opportunities that could have saved tragic daughter Fleur, coroner rules ."

Looking straight at the camera, Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover seems to be looking almost inquisitively at its own robotic arm in the latest self portrait from the red planet. The image in the latest of a series of self portraits from the red planet, and comes as Curiosity has been taking its first sniff of the planet's atmosphere. Engineers say the analysis could lead to a new understanding of how Mars lost much of its original atmosphere. Scroll down for video . Curiosity's latest self portrait, taken by its robotic arm . Learning what happened to the Martian atmosphere will help scientists assess whether the planet ever was habitable. The present atmosphere of Mars is 100 times thinner than Earth’s. A set of instruments aboard the rover has ingested and analyzed samples of the atmosphere collected near the 'Rocknest' site in Gale Crater where the rover is stopped for research. Findings from the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instruments suggest that loss of a fraction of the atmosphere, has been a significant factor in the evolution of the planet. Initial results show an increase of 5 percent in heavier isotopes of carbon in the atmospheric carbon dioxide compared to estimates of the isotopic ratios present when Mars formed. Scientists theorize that in Mars’ distant past its environment may have been quite different, with persistent water and a thicker atmosphere. NASA’s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, or MAVEN, mission will investigate possible losses from the upper atmosphere when it arrives at Mars in 2014. With these initial sniffs of Martian atmosphere, SAM also made the most sensitive measurements ever to search for methane gas on Mars. Preliminary results reveal little to no methane. A lab demonstration of the measurement chamber inside the Tunable Laser Spectrometer, an instrument that is part of the Sample Analysis at Mars investigation on NASA's Curiosity rover . Methane is of interest as a simple precursor chemical for life. On Earth, it can be produced by either biological or non-biological processes. Methane has been difficult to detect from Earth or the current generation of Mars orbiters because the gas exists on Mars only in traces, if at all. The Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) in Curiosity's SAM instrument provides the first search conducted within the Martian atmosphere for this molecule. The initial SAM measurements place an upper limit of just a few parts methane per billion parts of Martian atmosphere, by volume, with enough uncertainty that the amount could be zero. 'Methane is clearly not an abundant gas at the Gale Crater site, if it is there at all. 'At this point in the mission we’re just excited to be searching for it,' said SAM TLS lead Chris Webster of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif. ' This graphic below shows pieces of the Tunable Laser Spectrometer instrument, one of three instruments in the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument suite on NASA's Curiosity rover. Curiosity 'sniffs' the martian atmosphere using a tunable laser . As seen in the top graphic, the Tunable Laser Spectrometer has two infrared lasers whose light is invisible to the human eye. From the fore-optics chamber, they . shoot beams into a type of measurement chamber called a multi-pass . Herriot cell (shown in yellow in the middle). Mars air is pumped into this cell and out again with a vacuum pump. A detector, seen on the left of the graphic in gray, picks up the way these lasers are absorbed by the Martian air. By this method, scientists can . measure concentrations of methane, carbon dioxide and water vapor and . different isotopes of those gases. At the bottom left is a picture of a . lab demonstration of the measurement chamber with visible lasers so . scientists can see how they bounce between the mirrors in the chamber. At bottom right is the flight . hardware showing the lasers and the plate to which they are mounted. Also visible are the collimators, which are lenses that direct the . lasers into the cell. While we determine upper limits on low values, atmospheric variability in the Martian atmosphere could yet hold surprises for us.' In Curiosity’s first three months on Mars, SAM has analyzed atmosphere samples with two laboratory methods. One is a mass spectrometer investigating the full range of atmospheric gases. The other, TLS, has focused on carbon dioxide and methane. During its two-year prime mission, the rover also will use an instrument called a gas chromatograph that separates and identifies gases. The instrument also will analyze samples of soil and rock, as well as more atmosphere samples. 'With these first atmospheric measurements we already can see the power of having a complex chemical laboratory like SAM on the surface of Mars,' said SAM Principal Investigator Paul Mahaffy of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. 'Both atmospheric and solid sample analyzes are crucial for understanding Mars’ habitability.' SAM is set to analyze its first solid sample in the coming weeks, beginning the search for organic compounds in the rocks and soils of Gale Crater. Analyzing water-bearing minerals and searching for and analyzing carbonates are high priorities for upcoming SAM solid sample analyzes. If the atmosphere of Mars contains methane, various possibilities have been proposed for where the methane could come from and how it could disappear. Potential non-biological sources for methane on Mars include comets, degradation of interplanetary dust particles by ultraviolet light, and interaction between water and rock. A potential biological source would be microbes, if microbes have ever lived on Mars. Potential sinks for removing methane from the atmosphere are photochemistry in the atmosphere and loss of methane to the surface. This graphic shows how the Martian atmosphere may have changed .

Diver Tom Daley was expected to reach the gold standard. But the 18-year-old, who has more than two million followers on Twitter, took home only a bronze medal. At the height of the Games, Daley was tweeting up to nine times a day.

Hauling heavy luggage through rush hour crowds for eight hours a day was never Maya Devi's idea of a career. Following the sudden and tragic death of her husband however, she had no choice. Maya, 40, lost her  husband, Ram Kumar, a licensed railway porter at the Ludhiana railway station, in April this year. Her world has never been the same since. 'Perhaps this is my destiny that I have to start afresh from where my husband Ram Kumar left,' she said stoically. Maya, 40,is the only female porter in her city . Hard physical work like this is not what Maya had envisioned for herself . Porters must pass strenuous physical tests before being given a license . Maya was married to Ram Kumar in Redau . village in Sonepat district of Haryana 13 years ago, and they were . living since then in a house that Ram Kumar owned near the Jagraon . bridge. The couple has a son, Guarav, who is 12-years-old. 'In March 2012 misfortune struck our . family. My husband fell ill and died in April. 'The initial shock of my . husband's death shattered my world. 'But then I gathered myself and . decided to carry on with the life, not for myself but for the sake of my . son for whom my husband had nursed many dreams,' she said. Maya wants her son to study hard . and achieve great things. If doing hard physical work, and long hours, on Ludhiana's bustling platforms means that her son is able to build himself a future for himself, then all the suffering of the last six months will not have been in vain. Maya is pictured here with one of her many hundreds of customers at the station . Some women apply for jobs on the station's platform but Maya is the only one to have accepted employment at Ludhiana . Maya is determined to keep working to give her son an education . 'I have no idea as to what fate holds for me, but . if I can get my son educated and make him stand on his feet, I shall . have the satisfaction of being a good mother and also having fulfilled . the wishes of my husband,' she said. Though Maya only started working as a porter in November, any initial apprehensions she may have had in approaching passengers alighting from trains has now changed into a visible sense of confidence. There is no doubt, however, that the sight of a woman carrying heavy baggage remains a strange one to regular passengers. Being a luggage porter is not an easy job to get. it requires a vigorous physical test in order to get an official license. Senior divisional commercial manager MM Singh said there was no gender bias for recruitment of women as porters. For whatever reason, however, women as a rule do not come forward for jobs. 'During fitness tests conducted at several major railway stations a couple of months ago for recruitment of licensed porters, quite a few women had appeared and some of them had cleared the fitness test. But none of them appeared at the time of the final recruitment,' he said. Mr Singh said there was no practice of giving the jobs to family members on compassionate ground after the death of a porter. Maya would have had to pass the same tests and recruitment procedures as everyone else. 'The railway officials must have done the same to recruit Maya in place of her husband,' Mr Singh added.","Punjab's first woman railway porter forced to work after losing her husband .

Like many little boys, four-year-old  Rio Woolf dreams of following in the  footsteps of his sporting idols. And his chances of achieving that  ambition have taken a giant leap  forward – thanks to some help from his biggest hero. A delighted Rio received a hi-tech running blade for Christmas after Britain’s Paralympic sprint champion Jonnie  Peacock heard of his plight. ‘I really love my new special leg,’ he said. ‘Now I can run about and do lots of things I’ve never done before.’ Rio jumps for joy after he receives the surprise Christmas gift from Santa (Dorset Orthopaedic's Bob Watts) Rio was inspired to start running after meeting his hero Paralympian runner Jonnie Peacock . Rio, from Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire, . was born without a shinbone, knee or ankle joint, and had his lower . right leg amputated at 14 months. He was originally fitted with a rigid . NHS prosthetic limb, but it slowed him down when he ran. Peacock, 19, . who won 100m gold and broke the Paralympic record at the London Games . this summer, put Rio’s parents in touch with experts at a prosthetic . limbs clinic after meeting the family at an event. Dorset Orthopaedic, based in Ringwood, . Hampshire, offered to help for free after watching a video of Rio . running. Now there’s a spring in his step after the £4,000 lightweight . carbon-fibre blade – decorated with his favourite character Fireman Sam – . was fitted on Christmas Eve. His parents Trevor, 47, a bathroom fitter, and Juliette, 44, are equally overjoyed. Mrs Woolf said: ‘It’s a dream come . true for Rio and is the perfect Christmas present. He is over the moon . and very excited and after it was fitted he couldn’t stop jumping up and . down. ‘He’s been so captivated watching . people running in the Paralympics with their “special legs”, as he calls . them, and now he can run too. Rio holds his new limb that has been decorated with a picture of the cartoon Fireman Sam . Rio with his proud parents Juliette and Trevor. They are now raising money to fit him out with new legs as he grows up . 'It is a dream come true for Rio and is the perfect Christmas present. 'He is over the moon and very excited and after it was fitted he couldn't stop jumping up and down. 'We took Rio along to the Paralympic Primary Games for children and he loved participating, even with his NHS leg. 'It . was then he started to show he loved to run. He said it was his . favourite thing. The only problem was that his old leg was very heavy. 'Despite this he was running quite fast and we could see how much he enjoyed it. He had the speed, but not the right equipment. 'Now there is nothing stopping him. He loves the Paralympics and although he is only four, I think he will . see it through to the end. 'He has shown promise at such a young age and he has told me he wants to get back on the track already. Standing tall: Rio's blade is 150g lighter than his old NHS prosthetic . 'My . husband and I are incredibly thankful to Dorset Orthopaedic and we are . hugely indebted to them for giving Rio this amazing opportunity.' So Rio can continue wearing the blades as he grows and needs replacements, his mother has started a fundraising campaign. Rio has worn NHS prosthetic limbs for the last three years after he was born with a one-in-a-million condition, Tibial Aplasia. His parents decided to have his leg amputated so he wouldn't be restricted to a wheelchair and could have the option to walk with a false leg. Prosthetic legs on the NHS are heavier than the blade and take up to three months to make before Rio can use them, which he outgrows quickly. Bob Watts, managing director of Dorset Orthopaedic, said: 'The blade and socket we have had made for Rio is 150g lighter than the NHS prosthetic legs. 'The blade is made out of carbon fibre which is very light, springs back into shape, and 95 per cent of energy you put into it will come back during running. 'The blade is guaranteed to last for at least a year, but as a child grows the socket will need to be replaced after six to nine months of use.' Mrs Woolf is now fundraising to try and raise money so that Rio can continue wearing the blades as he grows and needs new sockets, which cost £2,500 on their own.

Thousands of gay couples in civil partnerships will be able to ‘convert’ their relationships to marriage in return for a £100 administration fee. Around 50,000 couples will be able to change the legal status of their relationship by simply filling in a form and popping it in the post along with a cheque to cover the cost of issuing a marriage certificate. In effect, the change in the law will mean that some gay couples will be able to get married without even having a wedding, with the result that some couples could become married in secret. Love-ly law: The new legislation means civil partners will be able to change the legal status of their relationship to marriage . But Tory MP Peter Bone said the decision would further undermine the status of marriage. Mr Bone said: ‘The Government is sending out the very dispiriting message that it doesn’t care about marriage. ‘The idea that people will be able to get married by simply filling in a form and paying £100 is a further dilution of the institution of marriage that the Government claims to care about. That is clearly not what marriage means to millions of married couples in this country.’ Criticism: Tory MP Peter Bone says the Government's decision undermines the status of marriage . Documents issued by the Department for . Culture, Media and Sport yesterday suggested that couples in civil . partnerships will have a choice about whether or not to hold a separate . ceremony to mark the conversion of their relationship to marriage. ‘We will enable couples to have a ceremony upon conversion should they wish to do so. 'The ceremony would have no legal effect and would be similar to existing ceremonies allowing couples to renew their vows (and would therefore incur a separate cost). Accordingly a couple would be able to have such a ceremony on religious premises, if agreed with the religious organisation and any representatives of that organisation who would be involved in the ceremony.’ Despite the change, married couples will not be able to convert their relationships into civil partnerships. Officials said there was ‘no justification or requirement for introducing such a process’. And, to the dismay of some campaigners, ministers refused to extend civil partnerships legislation to cover heterosexual relationships. Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell . condemned the decision, saying: ‘Retaining the ban on opposite-sex civil . partnerships is a huge failing. It deprives heterosexual couples of . legal equality. I strongly support the right of straight people to equal . treatment.' Wedding bells: If civil partners so wish they can have a ceremony to mark their conversion which would function as a renewing of their vows and not have any legal effect . He added: ‘Under the government’s plans, gay couples will soon have legal privileges over heterosexual couples. ‘There will be two forms of official state recognition for lesbian and gay couples: the present system of civil partnerships plus marriage. Heterosexual couples will have only one option - marriage.’ In a further change, heterosexual couples will no longer have to divorce if one partner has a sex change. If both partners agree they will be able to retain their married status. The Government announced today that it will introduce a bill next year legalizing gay marriage - but banning the Church of England from conducting same-sex ceremonies.","Conversion would see same-sex couple able to change the legal status of their civil partnership .

U-turn: Jacques Delors' change of heart comes 22 years after he infuriated Eurosceptics by trying to force European federalism on the UK . Britain could negotiate a looser relationship with the EU under plans floated by a key architect of the European project. In a remarkable change of heart, the arch-federalist Jacques Delors suggested the UK could be an EU 'partner' rather than a fully fledged member of an organisation committed to ever-closer union. Mr Delors, who was president of the European Commission three times, said 'the British are solely interested in their own economic interests, and nothing else. We could offer them another kind of partnership.' The U-turn comes 22 years after Mr Delors infuriated . Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, and other Eurosceptics by trying . to force European federalism on the UK. In November 1990 the French economist was the subject of a famous headline in The Sun that read: 'Up yours Delors'. But in an interview in the German ­economic daily Handelsblatt yesterday, Mr Delors said: 'If the British do not follow the tendency towards more integration in the European Union, we can anyway stay friends, but in another way.' Mr Delors, 87, suggested the UK might sign up for an arrangement 'like that of the European Economic Area' or a 'free trade agreement'. If Britain left the EU, he said, it would still be a 'partner' because it is 'strategically and economically important'. But, in a typically cutting aside, he added that 'other countries' were also important in the new economic order, including India and China. On Thursday Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, said David Cameron's drive to repatriate ­powers from Brussels risks damaging the EU and could cause the collapse of the single market. He said countries would not be allowed to 'cherry pick' which EU policies they wanted to keep. Tense handshake: Jacques Delors pictured here with Prime Minister Thatcher in 1987 after a battle over European federalism . But Mr Delors appears to think differently, and his intervention came as Europe minister David Lidington said the Government wanted to keep Britain in the EU, but also to strike a better deal, including the repatriation of powers from Brussels. He said: 'We need a settlement that enables the British people to feel comfortable with membership of the EU.' Mr Cameron will outline his thinking on Europe in a major speech next month. He is expected to promise a major renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU, probably followed by a referendum after the next election. Mr Lidington said yesterday he gave 'short shrift to some of the charges of cherry picking' and insisted a new deal on Europe was possible.","Jacques Delors' u-turn after trying to force European federalism on UK .

Cameron backed calls for the downgrading of both cannabis and ecstasy. Yesterday he acknowledged he had said ‘all sorts of things about drugs . policy over the years’, but insisted he was now against . decriminalisation of any sort. In a thinly veiled swipe at the Prime . Minister, Mr Clegg hit out at politicians who called for drugs reform in . opposition only to abandon the issue when they got into government for . fear of being painted as ‘soft’. ‘For too long people in politics have . worried that saying something differently can somehow look like you’re . being soft,’ he said. ‘It’s important now to pluck up the . courage to speak out.’ Mr Clegg, whose party first adopted a policy to . decriminalise cannabis possession a decade ago, added: ‘If you were . waging any other war where you have 2,000 fatalities a year, your . enemies are making billions in profit, constantly throwing new weapons . at you and targeting more young people, you’d have to say you are losing . and it’s time to do something different. ‘I’m anti-drugs – it’s for that  reason I’m pro-reform.’ The Lib Dem leader has ordered Home .

The spending power of the average family has taken a historic plunge over the past five years, official figures showed yesterday. The amount a typical household  is able to pay to cover all its necessities and luxuries has dropped by nearly 10 per cent since the onset of the recession. An average home had almost £50 a  week less to spend last year than it  did in 2006, once inflation has been taken into account. Rising costs: Transport is the largest cost the British family faces as they battle to make ends meet . And families’ real buying power is now back to the levels of 1996 and 1997, just before the long boom which ended in the banking collapse of 2007 and 2008. Family expenditure has now declined in real terms for five years in a row – the greatest blow to living standards since official surveys on household spending began in the 1950s. The figures compiled by the Office for National Statistics show that in 2006 a typical family was spending £533 a week at 2011 prices. That dropped steadily through the recession to £483.60 last year. The fall since 2006 amounts to 9.3 per cent and means that households on average are able to spend £49.40 a week less now than they could then. Economist Ruth Lea said: ‘People are really hurting. ‘The recession of the 1970s was relatively shallow. The early 1980s recession was not, but we were out of it in four years. The 1990s recession hit house prices, but it only lasted three years. ‘This time it seems there is no chance of recovery before 2015.’ In bald figures, average family spending went up by £10 a week in the year between 2010 and 2011. But that does not take account of inflation and does not reflect families’ real spending power. Over the past year, weekly spending in real terms fell by £14.60. Expensive: Running a family car is getting more and more expensive because of fuel and insurance costs . The inflation-adjusted figures showing . six years of spending decline are unmatched since the survey began. Other real terms spending declines were reported in the recession years . of 1974, 1980 and 1981, and 1991. The South East of England has the highest share of the UK’s wealthiest households, while Scotland has the lowest, according to official figures. More than one in seven households in the South East are in the top 10%, compared with one in 14 of Scottish households, said the Office for National Statistics. The wealthiest 10% of households have almost £1 million in cash and assets, while the top 1% have more than £2.8 million. TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: 'These regional inequalities are making whole areas of the country unaffordable, creating employment blackspots in other parts and are holding back our economy.' Although survey methods used to measure family spending have been changed over the past 15 years, the figures indicate that the last time outgoings fell below £490 a week was in the financial year 1996/97, when the economy was still recovering from the recession of the early 1990s. The ONS survey covered the spending of 26,000 homes. It follows checks on how families spend their money – made by asking people to keep weekly spending diaries – which have been carried out annually since 1957. The biggest rise in costs in cash terms was for cars, car insurance, maintenance and fuel, which rose  to £65.70 per week, up 80p from the previous year. Recreation and culture, including tickets for the cinema and sporting events, took up the next highest chunk of families’ spending, costing £63.90 a week on average. Housing – excluding mortgage payments – fuel and power came next at £63.30 a week in 2011, a weekly increase of £2.90. The richest 10 per cent of homes can afford to spend more than £1,000 a week, the ONS report said, including nearly £100 a week on restaurants and hotels. Those whose incomes are in the bottom third spend a total of only £260.70 a week.","It cost £483.80 a week to run a British home in 2011 .

A 'super inquiry' set up to expose the true scale of historic child abuse in North Wales has been contacted by 105 victims in its first month. Operation Pallial, led by Keith Bristow, director general of the National Crime Agency (NCA), is re-examining allegations that a paedophile ring targeted care and children's homes there during the 1970s and 1980s. The new inquiry was announced by Home Secretary Theresa May last month after a BBC investigation found that previous investigations into sexual abuse only uncovered the 'tip of the iceberg'. But the Newsnight probe also . falsely accused Lord McAlpine of being a paedophile who targeted . children at the notorious Bryn Estyn institution near Wrexham. Scandal: The Bryn Estyn boys home in Wrexham was closed down because of child abuse and a new probe has been contacted by 105 victims from this and other North Wales institutions . It sparked a chain of events that led to a huge taxpayer-funded libel payout for the Tory peer and the resignation of director general George Entwistle after just 54 days in the job. Operation Pallial involves 27 police officers and staff from all over the country, backed by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA). In just a month 105 victims now living in the UK and Ireland across 22 force areas outside north Wales have called them to say they were abused. Revelations: Theresa May launched Operation Pallial after a BBC investigation, which also wrongly accused Lord McAlpine (right) of being a paedophile and led the corporation's worst-ever crisis . Detective Superintendent Ian Mulcahey, from Merseyside Police, senior investigating officer for the inquiry, said: 'Operation Pallial is investigating new allegations of historic child abuse, some from victims previously known about and some from victims who have come forward for the first time. 'All victims of abuse have a right to expect all allegations of abuse, no matter how much time has passed, to be investigated professionally and appropriately. We will do so. 'Equally importantly, if offenders are still alive, they must be identified, investigated and brought to justice, with those who still have access to children being prioritised.' Victims have revealed the horror inside the Bryn Estyn where gang rape, strip searches and vicious canings were a way of life - and padeophile DJ Jimmy Savile was a regular visitor. Victims: Former Bryn Estyn residents Steve Messham (left) and Keith Gregory (right) were two of many sexually abused and humiliated there . Keith Gregory claimed young boys used to lie in their beds and pretend to be asleep to avoid being taken to a flat and abused by staff and visitors - those that were taken came back sobbing. He knew of children being driven off to a hotel where they would be gang raped and said he was beaten bloody and subjected to humiliating strip searches. Theresa May announced the National Crime Agency would examine the issue after lawyers involved in the original inquiry into abuse at Bryn Estyn and other homes across North Wales in the 1970s and 80s said allegations about a wider paedophile ring had not been fully investigated at the time. The Home Secretary said that the conclusions of the Waterhouse Inquiry in 2000 will be looked at again, but alleged victim Steve Messham who spoke out last month: 'There's no point in having an inquiry into the inquiry.' Mrs May used a statement to the Commons in November to announce the review, which will not be complete until next April next year. 'The Government is treating these allegations with the utmost seriousness,' she told MPs. 'Child abuse is a hateful, abhorrent and disgusting crime and we must not allow these allegations to go unanswered.'

Must change: More foreign prisoners should be sent home to serve their time says Justice Secretary Chris Grayling . Britain was hit by a fresh foreign prisoner fiasco last night after it was revealed that a much- trumpeted EU transfer agreement has spectacularly backfired. Ministers had pinned their hopes on the deal between member states leading to a dramatic fall in overseas inmates clogging the UK’s jails. It allows EU prisoners to be forced to serve their sentence at home. But farcically, the two countries with the most inmates in Britain – Poland and Ireland – were given opt-outs by the previous Labour government. As a result, not a single prisoner from a fellow EU country has been sent back to their homeland by the UK since the agreement came into force in December 2011. At the same time, Britain has been sent two inmates by our EU partners – meaning the number behind bars is going up. To make matters worse, a further 38 British citizens were sent to our packed jails by our EU neighbours under pre-existing voluntary transfer deals. Only 32 Britons went in the opposite direction, according to figures released by Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright. At the heart of the fiasco is a decision made by Labour three years ago, to grant Poland an effective opt-out from the new EU arrangement. There are more Poles – 861 – in the UK’s prisons than citizens of any other EU nation. It has echoes of Labour’s infamous decision not to place any restrictions on Poland when the country joined the Union in 2004. It led to one million travelling here from the former Eastern Bloc country, compared to government estimates of 13,000. Poland’s exemption from the deal lasts for five years, leaving little prospect of any improvement until 2017 at the earliest. Ministers in the last government also allowed Ireland an opt-out, formalising a long-standing arrangement between the two countries. No fair: No EU citizen has been sent from Britain to serve their jail-time in their native country whilst 38 British citizens have been returned to be imprisoned here (file photo) The news is likely to cast new doubt on how much benefit Britain receives from signing up to EU directives. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling told the Mail: ‘This is an aspect of our prison system that has to change. More foreign prisoners must serve their sentences in their own countries. There are far too many in our prisons. ‘Prisoners are being transferred out of our prisons under various transfer agreements but I am determined to do more and will investigate every possible avenue to reduce their numbers and unburden British taxpayers.’ The Prime Minister had personally put the agreement at the heart of his blueprint for cutting the 11,000 foreign nationals behind bars,  which costs taxpayers an estimated £420million a year. UK prisons contain inmates from 156 . different countries. There are 193 member countries in the United . Nations, meaning all bar 37 are represented in the British prison . system. Labour’s strategy was to offer inmates a bribe of thousands of . pounds to go home voluntarily to complete their sentence. However in recent years the strategy has shifted towards trumpeting the introduction of the EU prisoner transfer agreement. Prisoners do not have to give their consent before they can be sent to a fellow member of the EU. In reply to a question from Tory MP Therese Coffey, Mr Wright admitted: ‘To date no prisoners have been transferred from England and Wales to other EU member states under the EU prisoner transfer agreement. ‘A small number of requests for transfer to other member states have been made and decisions  are awaited.’ He added: ‘It remains government policy that, wherever possible, prisoners should serve their sentences in their own country. ‘All of those prisoners from member states which have implemented the EU prisoner transfer agreement, and who it is considered may be eligible for transfer . . . will be transferred at the earliest possible opportunity.’","Since December 2011 prisoners from within the EU can be forced to serve their sentence in their home country .

Disability spending: Britain spends more than any other country in the world on disability benefits . Disability benefits are costing Britain more than almost any other western country. The revelation in a report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development will add fuel to the Government’s drive to cut back on the handout. The OECD figures show that Britain spends 2.4 per cent of national output on the benefit – more than France, Germany, Italy or Spain. The share of GDP is more than double the 1 per cent in the US – and six times Japan’s 0.4 per cent. The average among the 34 OECD members – all industrialised states – is 1.3 per cent. Only Norway and Iceland spent more: 2.8 per cent. The study found that the share of British GDP spent on disability soared by a third between 2005 and 2009. Elsewhere spending was almost flat in the same period. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Britain cannot ignore the huge rise in the number of people claiming disability benefit. ‘Welfare is there to help the most vulnerable but for too long it simply consigned people to a life on benefits regardless of what they were capable of. ‘Reforms must ensure that help is available to get those who can work into employment, while ensuring the whole system remains affordable to taxpayers.’ The study found that Britain spends 0.5 per cent of its GDP on sickness handouts such as incapacity benefits. Sickness and disability made up 12 per cent of UK social spending. The average across the OECD is 9.2 per cent. A record 3.2million people in Britain claim Disability Living Allowance - at a cost to taxpayers of more than £13billion a year. Around half a million people on disability benefits stand to lose it all under plans by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. Big payout: Nearly 1,000 people receive disability benefits for being obese, costing taxpayers £11,000 a day . Two million claimants of the main payment, disability living allowance, will be reassessed over the next four years. The DLA, which helps people pay for the extra costs of mobility and care associated with their condition, is worth up to £120 a week. It is being replaced by a new, more stringent benefit called personal independence payment. All claimants will have to undergo a medical check - which does not happen in about half cases at the moment. And there will be a drive to repeat the checks at intervals to ensure that those whose condition improves do not get payments for life. However, Esther McVey, minister for disabled people, said: ‘We rightly continue to spend around £50billion a year on disabled people and their services. ‘The UK continues to be a world leader in the rights for disabled people.’ All time high: A record 3.2million people in Britain claim Disability Living Allowance costing taxpayers more than £13 billion per year . The Daily Mail revealed on Monday that taxpayers fork out more than £4million every single year on incapacity benefit for people who are obese. Almost 1,000 people receive the hand-out for no other reason than they are grossly overweight – costing us £11,000 every single day. And two thirds of them have been languishing on the sick for more than five years. Official statistics also demonstrate a sharp rise in the amount paid every year in IB for drug addicts and alcoholics. Over the past decade, no less than £1.2billion has been spent on IB for fat people and those with addictions. In another benefits scandal, it also emerged earlier this week that record numbers were receiving winter fuel payments from the UK despite living abroad. Almost 74,000 received the payment of £200 or more in 2011/12, even though they have moved to sunnier climes. This is more than a thousand more than the previous year.","Disability Living Allowance costs British taxpayers more than £13 billion per year .

Punishment: Nurse Stephen Johnson faces being struck off for his treatment of mentally ill patients . A senior nurse who goose-stepped around a room of mentally ill patients while performing Nazi salutes faces being struck off. Stephen Johnson put a finger under his nose to represent . a Hitler moustache and marched around the NHS care home in Essex like Basil Fawlty in the comedy classic Fawlty Towers. He reduced a patient who suffered from delusions that he was Adolf Hitler to tears. The patient – identified as Patient C – had a strange obsession with Nazi Germany and suffered from hallucinations. Johnson cruelly . encouraged him to live out his fantasy by performing the . salutes made famous by the Nazi regime and shouting 'Heil Hitler', a . Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) panel found. The nurse’s behaviour came to light . when bosses at the North Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust . investigated a seven-month campaign of sexual harassment against a . Polish colleague, known only as Miss A. The . former deputy ward manager, who had worked at Severalls House in Colchester for more than two decades, made the Nazi salutes in front of Miss A and a male Jewish colleague, known as Mr D. Johnson, 54, flies a St George’s flag from his home in . Essex. He was . yesterday found guilty of eight allegations of misconduct in 2008 and . 2009. He sent explicit messages to the Miss A, groped Mr D and made racist remarks, and repeatedly grabbed a male patient's genitals. Karen Russell, who still works at the . ward, told the hearing: ‘He would mimic the patient who had been . doing the Nazi salutes. ‘He would be marching up and down saluting and shouting.' She said he would raise his arm to a Nazi salute with a finger below her nose. Guilt: A panel at the Nursing and Midwifery Council, pictured, found Stephen Johnson, 54, guilty of eight allegations of misconduct in 2008 and 2009 . She added: ‘It would wind [patient C] up and he  would cry. He [Johnson] would do the baiting.’ Miss Russell told the hearing that the patient had an obsession . with Nazi Germany and would suffer hallucinations. She added: ‘The patient would often speak in a German accent and go on about Nazi Germany. He’d say he was Adolf Hitler.’ Chris Renehan, the clinical manager at the time, told the panel Johnson would incite the patient to shout ‘Heil Hitler’. Mr Renehan, who now works at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, added: ‘Mr Johnson was very black and white. ‘He either liked you or he didn’t – and that tended to be people that were ethnic minority or people not English. ‘He was very English. Very British.’ He also performed the role of a German soldier in front of Miss A, which she was said to find ‘particularly offensive as she is Polish, and associations with the Second World War have particularly offensive significance to her.’ Johnson, who lives in a quiet cul de sac in Great Horkesley, Colchester, called Mr D by the names of Arab terrorist organisations, Hezbollah and Hamas, and once said to him, ‘BNP go home’. The male care assistant also reported Johnson to police for grabbing his genitals at work while another colleague . pinned his arms behind his back. Torment: Johnson reduced a patient who suffered from delusions that he was Adolf Hitler, pictured, to tears . Johnson denied the charges, accusing colleagues of conspiring against him and making him a scapegoat. But James Spencer, chair of the NMC panel, said:  'The panel is not . satisfied that any of the witnesses have colluded, that Mr Johnson has . been made a scapegoat or accused of any of these things for any reason . other than the facts included in the charges.' The panel also found Johnson guilty of grabbing another patient's genitals on an almost daily basis. Miss Russell said in a . statement: 'Mr Johnson would stand facing him and hold the patient's . genitals through his clothing. 'Mr Johnson would grab the patient's genitals all the time, I would say this happened on a nearly daily basis. 'He did it to make people laugh, the staff would laugh.' Johnson's campaign of harassment began just three weeks . after Miss A joined Severalls House, after the pair took a . patient on a trip to London. 'Mr Johnson sent a pornographic photograph of a woman's vagina', said Mr Unwin. 'She found this disgusting, showed the . picture to her boyfriend, and then deleted it. She replied to Mr . Johnson, telling him to grow up.' But Johnson continued to bombard her with messages, saying, 'You sexy momma, I love you.' He added: 'Don't you give up on me' and 'I want to complete you :) xxxxx', and repeatedly tried to call her at midnight. 'Mr Johnson himself performed a Nazi salute while in her presence and while looking at her,' added Mr Unwin. 'She found this particularly offensive . as she is Polish, and associations with the Second World War have . particularly offensive significance to her.' 'Miss A felt threatened by his conduct . and felt that if she didn't tell Mr Johnson what he wanted to hear he . would make her life at work very difficult.' Unacceptable: Johnson's tasteless behaviour is reminiscent of a memorable scene in Fawlty Towers in which Basil Fawlty goose-steps around his hotel . The tribunal heard the sexual . texts stopped when Johnson's wife, who also works at the trust, saw . a message and called Miss A to confront her. After Miss A reported Johnson's advances, Mr D came forward to report the deputy ward manager . for groping him while on duty. Mr D described one incident in October . 2008 when Johnson and another member of staff allegedly ambushed him . while he was looking through a colleague's holiday photos. He said he was standing outside Severalls House, when Johnson and the male member of staff 'jumped' on him. 'He (the other male) grabbed both my hands behind my back, Mr Johnson grabbed my genitals outside of my clothes,' he said. The . panel was told that the staff nurse Mr D had been speaking to at the . time was still present and took a photograph of the incident. 'It is not acceptable in my country or my culture,' said Mr D. 'I was very offended and felt violated. 'Mr Johnson had no respect for any staff members at Severalls House.' Mr D told the panel the insults happened almost every shift at the care home. Johnson . was arrested by police and questioned on suspicion of groping Mr D in .

Damages: Surgeon Benjamin Kendrick, who admitted killing Joan Johnston in a road crash in 2009, is being sued for compensation . A surgeon convicted of killing an obese woman in a road accident is refusing to pay out £300,000 compensation to her widower - because her 30-stone weight would have limited her life expectancy. Robert Johnston has lodged the claim following the death of his wife Joan in the crash in 2009. But surgeon Benjamin Kendrick, 36, is disputing the amount because the victim was 'morbidly obese'. He has agreed to pay out a large sum . in compensation over the death of Mrs Johnston, a court heard, but not . the full amount her husband is demanding. The . surgeon's solicitor told Perth Sheriff Court that the impact of the . victim's 30-stone weight on her life expectancy was among the factors . being examined as negotiations between the two parties are ongoing. Paul . McGregor told the court Dr Kendrick, of Chesham, Buckinghamshire, had . already made a 'substantial' offer to settle the claim. He said negotiations were still taking place over expert evidence relating to Mrs Johnston's weight at the time she died. 'This is a reparation case in which substantial progress has been made,' he said. 'There has been a substantial offer made to the pursuer. 'The . lady involved at the centre of this action was 30 stone in weight. That . would have had an effect on her life expectancy and that is still being . looked at. Couple: Joan Johnston pictured with her husband Robert. The woman was killed in a road accident in 2009 . 'I am advised . that further negotiations are taking place and I am told that it is . likely the parties will be able to resolve matters.' Dr . Kendrick admitted killing the morbidly obese woman, who was from Scarborough, on his way to a . medical team bonding course in the Scottish Highlands in 2009. He was fined £5,000 and banned from driving for three years but walked free from court partly because of his victim's weight. Sheriff Michael Fletcher ruled out jailing Kendrick because his victim could have survived the head-on crash if she had been of average size. Dr Kendrick admitted causing the death of the holidaymaker, and injuring her husband and three of his own colleagues, as they drove to a medical course. The orthopaedic surgeon - described as 'an exceptional' talent - lost control of his rented people carrier and smashed into the Johnstons' oncoming vehicle. Sheriff Fletcher said: 'Your contribution to society in your everyday work is extensive. At the time of the accident you employed all your medical skills to help the persons who were injured. 'If the person had been of average fitness they might have survived the injuries caused by the collision.' Negotiations: Perth Sheriff Court heard Dr Kendrick had already made a 'substantial' offer to settle the claim . The court heard how Kendrick spent 45 minutes at the scene before paramedics arrived, tending to the injured including Mrs Johnston. The doctors, who were Fellows of Oxford University, were on their way to a medical outbound course. The Johnstons were both struck by an unsecured mobility scooter - weighing 15 stone - which was in the back of their Volvo estate. Mrs Johnston, 57, was 'morbidly obese' and weighed so much that she almost sheered through her specially adapted seatbelt upon impact. Her weight was so great that both the ambulance and the air ambulance called to the scene were unable to transfer her to hospital. A helicopter from RAF Kinloss eventually took her to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee. Mr Johnston, 63, said: 'It's no secret Joan was a heavy lass. We were married 38 years and she always struggled with her weight, but that wasn't why she died. 'The fact he's disputing this really makes it worse. She had a thyroid problem which also meant that we could never have children - but she was healthy enough and we were happy. 'Now that's all been taken away. I am not saying he meant to kill Joan or I want him punished, I'm just saying that by shirking his responsibility he's causing even more hurt. 'From the start this man has tried to blame everybody else for this accident and my wife's death,' the retired Post Office manager said. 'He has blamed the vehicle, my driving, the car behind him and now Joan herself. I don't even care about the money. She was my absolute soulmate and not a minute goes by when I don't miss her.'","Benjamin Kendrick admitted killing obese Joan Johnston in a crash in 2009 .

But these pictures of a lavish banquet held in Stockholm last night - and attended by more than 1,200 glittering guests including members of the royal family and Nobel laureates - reveal little evidence of cost-cutting. As women in elegant gowns and men in white tie and tails made their way over slippery snow and ice to the dinner in Stockholm City Hall last night, the Nobel Peace Prize was being awarded to the European Union at a separate ceremony in Oslo, Norway.

In a stinging rebuke to one of under-fire Socialist Hollande's flagship campaign promises, the constitutional council ruled that the way the highly contentious tax was designed was unconstitutional. It was intended to hit incomes over €1million (£820,000) but the largely symbolic measure would have only hit a tiny number of taxpayers and brought in up to around €300million (£250million). Embattled: French President Francois Hollande suffered a fresh setback yesterday when France's highest court threw out a plan to tax the ultra-wealthy at a 75 per cent rate and said it was unfair . It was an insignificant amount in the context of France's roughly €85billion (£70billion) deficit. Au revoir: Actor Gerard Depardieu recently announced his intention to turn in his French passport and move to a village in a tax-friendly Belgium . Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault was quick to respond, saying in a statement following the decision that the Government would resubmit the measure to take the court's concerns into account. The court's ruling took issue not with the size of the tax, but with the way it discriminated between households depending on how incomes were distributed among its members. A household with two earners each making under €1million (£820,000) would be exempt from the tax, while one with one earner making €1.2million (£980,000) would have to pay. The French Government approved the tax in its most recent budget, amid criticism that it would do little to stem the country's mounting fiscal problems and would drive away the wealthiest citizens. Meanwhile President Hollande's popularity has been tanking as the country's unemployment continued its rise for the 19th straight month.

As days of almost relentless downpours blighted parts of the country for much of December, it seems hard to believe that this time last year water reserves were worryingly low due to a lack of rainfall. But now figures have emerged showing a tale of two very different years - 2011 was the driest year in England for 90 years while 2012 was the wettest since records began in 1910. Last year's drought across England forced water companies in the worst-affected areas to start using river water to top up reservoirs. From sunshine to rain: While 2011 (left) was exceptionally dry, 2012 . (right) was England's soggiest year since 1910. (Brown areas are driest, . while blue are wettest) But exactly a year later strong rain has . left communities counting the cost of flooding as rivers burst their . banks, struggling to contain the heavy deluge of rain. Hundreds of alerts have been issued . by the Environment Agency this month, as several days' worth of rain has . fallen in just a few hours at its worst, contributing to a year of bad . weather which has left the UK on the brink of its wettest since records . began in 1910. Homes have been evacuated and weary . commuters and travellers have been forced to find alternative routes or . abandon their plans altogether as sections of Britain's transport . network ground to a halt. What a difference a year makes: Ardingly Resevoir in Ardingly, West Sussex, at 12% of its capacity in 2011, and the same view (bottom) taken this year showing the increasing water level at the reservoir . But earlier in the year 2012 looked set to be a year defined by drought. In February the dry spell threatened . the UK's landscape and in April a hosepipe ban was introduced to . conserve vital water, but recent strong rain has left . communities counting the cost of flooding. Now forecasters have said 2012 is set to become the wettest on record in the UK after predicting a wet and windy . end to the year as flood-battered areas were warned they face renewed . danger from storms. According to the Met office just . 1.8in (46mm) of rain is needed to fall before December 31 to make this . year the wettest on record for the UK overall, with a new record already . set for England with 43.1in (1,095.8mm) falling between January 1 and Boxing Day. Warning: . Low levels in Ogston Reservoir in Derbyshire last year. 2011 was the driest year in England Wales for 90 years and the . environment agency has warned that without rain in the near future, . England will . experience a severe drought . Dried up: The River Kennet in Wiltshire was reduced to a trickle in December 2011 after months of low rainfall . The UK as a whole had 50.8in . (1,291.2mm) of rain from January 1 to December 26, with the wettest year . on record for the UK currently 2000, when 52.6in (1,337.3mm) fell. Confirmation is expected next week, . and would be all the more remarkable considering the drought status . declared for parts of the country during the early part of the year. In terms of temperature and sunshine the . year as a whole is set to be unremarkable, both being around normal. However, overall 2012 is set to be cooler than 2011, but warmer than . 2010.

"Raymond Bell, The Cowboy Church of Virginia's chief pastor, says the efficacy of 'Equine Assisted Psychotherapy' has never been in doubt . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:53 EST, 30 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:32 EST, 30 December 2012 . Raymond Bell, the chief pastor of The Cowboy Church of Virginia, claims he can rid homosexuals of their 'addiction' to members of the same sex . A Virginia pastor claims he's discovered a new application for an existing form of pet therapy utilizing horses: ridding homosexuals of their troublesome 'addiction' to members of the same sex. Raymond Bell, The Cowboy Church of Virginia's chief pastor, tells Gay Star News 'Equine Assisted Psychotherapy' can, 'help any person who is living the homosexual lifestyle or involved in it any way.' When asked by Gay Star News whether the therapy has ever worked in the past, Bell told the publication, ‘it is not now, nor has it ever been, in question’. EAP is a form of pet therapy in which a person sorts out their own emotions by engaging in myriad activities with horses - from grooming and walking to playing games with the animal. It is conventionally used as a stop-gap for addressing everything from trust issues to eating disorders to assuaging pain associated with repressed mental trauma. However, Bell reportedly believes the therapy can also be used to cure one's 'addiction' to homosexuality. A description of the therapy on the Cowboy Church of Virgina's website reads: 'Equine Assisted Psychotherapy (EAP) offers experiential psychotherapy sessions to diagnosed or diagnosable clients. According to Bell: 'Equine Assisted Psychotherapy' can, 'help any person who is living the homosexual lifestyle or involved in it any way,' Brokeback Mountain: Bell claims that EAP will not only reveal the root causes of a person's homosexuality, but also augment their masculinity . 'Natural horse and herd behavior are observed and honored as a model for healthful human behavior.  Equine-assisted exercises are designed to elicit metaphors and self-awareness.  These exercises help clients recognize their own behaviors and patterns and create their own solutions.' Bell's notion that a person can rid themselves of homosexuality apparently springs from his ideas about the lifestyle. ‘The first common misconception is that homosexuality is genetic, or hereditary, or as some say 'born this way,'' Bell reportedly said. The first common misconception is that homosexuality is genetic, or hereditary, or as some say 'born this way . ‘Homosexuality is actually a type of addiction. It is not curable as a disease because it is a choice driven by the person.’ 'Homosexuality is a secondary effect from a single, or multiple, primary events in a person’s life,’ Bell told Gay Star News, before reportedly adding EAP can be utilized to bring to light the specific events that lead a person to homosexuality, in the first place. Cowboy Churches are local Christan churches that incorporate a Western motif into their worship. 'In 2004 God called and sent Ray and Linda Bell, along with Peggy Campbell, to begin this new pioneer work in Virginia,' reads the Cowboy Church of Virginia's website. 'Beginning with what was thought would only be one church in Wytheville, God blessed and grew the ministry.'","Raymond Bell, The Cowboy Church of Virginia's chief pastor, says the efficacy of 'Equine Assisted Psychotherapy' has never been in doubt ."

There are fears that there is an inadequate food supply for bees as their numbers double with the popularity of urban beekeeping. With the growing trend of producing home-grown honey, the number of bees in London has doubled in the past four years. Now beekeeping associations are warning that there may not be enough food to sustain the growing numbers or whether hobby beekeepers have the knowledge to look after the insects. Beekeeping trend: As popularity of urban beekeeping grows, so do the bee population fuelling fears that there is not enough food to sustain the insects . The London Beekeepers Association (LBKA) says some 39 per cent of beekeepers have had no training. The National Bee Unit estimates that there are 3,200 colonies in the Greater London area as of May this year. A hive requires as much as 66lb of pollen and 260lb of nectar to be sustaining and experts worry that London does not have enough of the plants that are nectar-rich and bee-friendly. Without the necessary food, bees get sick as disease passes through the hive, infecting all the insects. Hives among the houses: There are an estimated 3200 bee colonies in Greater London, including this urban colony on a rooftop in Hackney . Angela Woods, the secretary of the LBKA, told The Daily Telegraph that the association encouraged beekeeping with adequate training. She said: ‘We are not saying there are too many bees now but the big worry is that in a few years there could be too many. ‘The other question is how much food is enough? ‘We need to make sure that planting for them keeps pace with that growth. ‘A good analogy is it’s like having a cat in the room with one bowl of food, and you think “that’s lovely”, and then you put two cats in the room and realise that one’s going to hungry.’ Bees feed on nectar as their primary energy source and pollen for protein and other nutrients. To buy five combs, bees, brood at all stages, a laying marked queen, and stores cost between £140 to £240.

And this flamingo was no different. She gave her chick a stern look when he came back to the nest with dirt all over his white feathers. Who's a naughty boy? This mucky flamingo chick, pictured with his mother, was covered in mud after taking its first steps out of the nest . But her anger didn't last as, before long, the chick snuggled up in his mother's feathers and enjoyed a bite to eat. At just two weeks old, the flamingo . chick had been taking his first steps out of the nest among the 80,000 . strong colony of birds in Rio Maximo national reserve in Cuba. It spent half an hour slipping and . sliding around in mud as he tried to scramble back to the nest before . its mother noticed he was gone. Photographer Andrey Gudkov spent a day watching the pair bond. The mother flamingo would collect food in her beak from a nearby brook before returning to feed her son. Mucky: The flamingo chick spent half-an-hour slipping and sliding around in the mud . Feeding time! The chick ate a pureed dinner of plankton, shrimp and tiny fish from his mother's bill . Mr Gudkov, 40, said: ‘This mum and baby caught my eye because they were a bit separated from the other flamingos. ‘We were able to sit right inside the colony as flamingos aren't afraid of people. ‘But we still had to arrive before sunrise and leave after sunset, sitting motionless in the mud so we didn't disturb them. ‘The mother left the nest to feed and refresh herself, before coming back to feed the youngster. ‘I could hear them chattering away the whole time they were together. ‘When the mother returned, the chick would stand up, open his beak and ask for food.’ Each feeding session lasted a few seconds as the chick enjoyed a pureed dinner of plankton, shrimp and tiny fish from his mother's bill. Bonding: Wildlife photographer Andrey Gudkov said he spent a day watching the pair and how they interacted . In time, this diet will bring out the flamingo's pink colour. Mr Gudkov, a marine biology graduate, added: ‘After the chick is fed, it normally sleeps and the mother covered her baby with her wings to protect him from the heat. ‘I was interested in the one-to one feeding process and seeing how the flamingos interacted. ‘I loved the geometry of their long legs and necks, compared with the petite chick. ‘Their relationship made for a very tender picture showing how the big bird communicates with the small, weak chick.’ Mr Gudkov, a professional wildlife photographer from Moscow, Russia, was joined by a group of scientists in Rio Maximo national reserve, Cuba.

Ask any football fan or would-be WAG in the North where the top footballers live and you will get a quick answer – within the ‘golden triangle’ that lies between the towns of Alderley Edge, Knutsford and Wilmslow in Cheshire. For 20 years, football’s superstars have flocked to this patchwork of villages, 20 miles from Manchester and 45 miles from Liverpool. Many of them have bought homes from multi-millionaire developer David Hughes – the man who has helped make the term ‘footballer’s house’ part of estate-agent vocabulary. Top of the league: Multi-millionaire property developer David Hughes is selling his very own 'footballers house', complete with pool, helipad and 25 acres of land . David’s client list is impressive. His . very first footballer transaction was with Harry Kewell, who played for . Liverpool from 2003 to 2008, and since then he has sold mansions to, . among many others, Manchester United’s Edwin van der Sar, Nemanja Vidic . and Nani, and buy-to-let apartments to Manchester United manager Sir . Alex Ferguson and former captain Gary Neville. Yet the biggest star he . sold a home to, and the client he remembers most fondly, was the boy . from the back streets of Madeira: Cristiano Ronaldo. ‘People forget how young and naive Ronaldo was when he first arrived in Manchester,’ recalls David, sitting in the study of his enormous country house in Chelford, which is for sale at £15 million. ‘He was just 18, his English was poor and I remember he had a trusted friend – a waiter in Manchester – whom he made his financial adviser. 'My abiding memory of Ronaldo is calling in to see him in the leisure complex of the house I sold him. He and his friend were trying to make their own ice bath. They had bought an industrial-size ice-making machine and were trying to shovel ice into a plunge pool. Big player: The 'Arabian themed' dining room at Holly Tree House . Grand designs: The grand pool with skylights and tropical fish mural . ‘They had laid the wires from this machine across the wet floor and jammed the bare flex into sockets with bits of pencil. It was suicidal. Sir Alex Ferguson never knew how close he came to having £80 million worth of footballer go up in smoke.’ David’s involvement in property was originally little more than a casual punt. In 1997, he sold 25 per cent of his Allsports sports retail business for £19 million. The property market was booming, so he spent £400,000 converting Bollington Mill, near Prestbury in Cheshire, into mews cottages. When he sold these on for £800,000, he got a taste for the easy money to be made. David decided to specialise in the top end of the residential market, hitting on a formula that ideally matched young footballers’ tastes. He would buy a dated home on a good-sized plot in the golden triangle, knock it down and build another in its place. When he built the new home, he would create a huge extended basement. The homes all had underfloor heating and state-of-the-art sound, lighting and security systems. Leisure centres with saunas and cinema rooms were a ‘must’. Now David is selling his own home, Holly Tree House, which is a template for the footballers’ homes he’s sold. Indeed, he used it as a show house when he tried to interest cricket star Freddie Flintoff in buying one of his properties off-plan. True 'footballer's house': Holly Tree House, is located in an area of Cheshire known as the 'golden triangle' due to the high number of footballers who reside there . Every imaginable item of ostentation is on show: the white drawing room has enormous chandeliers, gold-leaf cornices and hand-made carpets, while the dining room, in royal blue and reds, has an Arabian feel to it. To most people it may seem wildly over the top but David reckons it is quite subdued, compared with the tastes of many of the stars. ‘Ronaldo ordered a bedroom in a mass of black satin from Portugal,’ he says. ‘On his bed he had three enormous cushions, one with a C, the second with an R and the third with a 7 – his initials and shirt number.’ Although the tastes of footballers match the stereotype, David is keen to contradict the image of their wives. ‘They are portrayed very unfairly,’ he says. ‘They are always very attractive but the ones I have met – notably Vidic’s wife and Patrice Evra’s – have been very quiet and charming too.’ There is wit in David’s house. In the pool, a mural creates the illusion of swimming off Richard Branson’s Necker Island. The 25 acres of grounds, which include a Japanese water garden, fishing lake, tennis court, golf tee and green and heli-pad, also hide deer which are, on closer inspection, made of stone. David lost his property business in the 2008 banking crash, but he still owns swathes of the ‘golden triangle’ and his reason for selling is unrelated to business. ‘I built this house in 1997 with my first wife and it still has her stamp on it,’ says David, who has been married to his present wife, Gill, for four years. ‘Now we are going to build the same house again – but slightly smaller.’ Jackson-Stops & Staff,  jackson-stops.co.uk, 01625 540340 .","Multi-millionaire David Hughes has sold houses to Manchester's football stars and is now selling his own .

Safe: Alzheimer's sufferer Michael Clement, 68, went missing for 23 hours after he was discharged from hospital in the early hours . An Alzheimer's patient who was discharged from hospital at 5am in freezing temperatures was found when he knocked on a stranger's door 19 miles away and pleaded to come in from the cold. The family of Michael Clement, 68, who suffers severe Alzheimer's, have accused health staff of 'disgusting' incompetence after the pensioner went missing for 23 hours. His disappearance left his frantic family scouring the streets looking for him and triggered a desperate police helicopter and sniffer dog search. The grandfather, from Thamesmead in Kent, had been admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in Woolwich, London, suffering from dehydration. But members of Mr Clement's family have accused hospital staff of discharging him at 5.19am on December 7 without a coat, money or his relatives being contacted. He was in the early hours of December 8 after he knocked on a door in Sutton and told the homeowner: 'I'm cold, can I come in?' His daughter-in-law Michaela Curren told MailOnline: 'We were worried sick. 'We were driving around looking for him and the whole family was out searching. 'The hospital said that they offered him transport and he refused it. 'But he was in a couple of weeks previously and family had been called and it must be all over his medical records that he has Alzheimer's. 'We're never going to know how he got where he did and it was freezing. Who knows how many doors he knocked on at that hour before someone answered. 'He had food on him so someone must have bought him food at some stage. Frantic: Mr Clement's daughter-in-law Michaela Curren said that the family were 'worried sick' when he was missing . 'When we had a call from the police saying he'd been found, we were shouting and screaming, if you can imagine what was going through our minds, it was such a relief he'd been found.' Mrs Curren said that the family were overwhelmed with the support they received while searching for her father-in-law. Mr Clement's picture was circulated across social networking sites and hourly pleas for help to find him were played out on radio stations. An Alzheimer's sufferer for five years, Mr Curran had been able to live alone before he went missing but is now being cared for by family members, according to Mrs Curren. Mrs Curren says that the family wish to take the matter further but are awaiting forms from the NHS Trust that runs the hospital to make a formal complaint. The hospital confirmed that an investigation into the matter is now underway. A spokesman for the South London Healthcare Trust, which runs the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, said today: 'We are investigating the circumstances around the discharge of Mr Clement from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital last weekend.

Thousands of the most seriously ill emergency patients are being forced to travel further to hospital in ambulances following a swathe of A&E closures and downgrades. Figures obtained by The Mail on Sunday show that the number of patients with life-threatening conditions taking longer than 30 minutes to reach A&E has rocketed by an average of 37 per cent in two years. Most of these people will be transported by ‘blue light’ ambulance – so the extra journey time means they are being transported further than ever to access emergency care. There has been a huge rise in the number of patients taking 30 minutes or more to get to A&E. Patient groups blame cost cutting . Figures from ambulance trusts across England show a rise of up to 63 per cent in just two years in the number of priority Category A patients spending 30 minutes or more on the road after being collected by paramedics. Such patients are so ill that trusts have a legal requirement to get paramedics to 95 per cent of cases within eight minutes. But there is no upper limit on the time it takes to get them to hospital. The shocking rise in journey times has been attributed to the closure and downgrading of A&E departments, with some operating limited opening hours. But it also shows the effect of the Government’s policy to introduce major trauma networks, which means some of the most seriously ill patients go to specialist centres rather than the closest local casualty department. While paramedics are highly trained and can perform life-saving techniques, the disclosure still raises fears that patients are being put at risk by such policies. Hope Daley, of trade union Unison, which represents ambulance workers, said: ‘Alarm bells should be ringing in the Government and the Department of Health about this shocking rise in the time it takes seriously ill people to get to hospital. Concerned: Public services trade union Unison, pictured here at a previous picket, said 'alarm bells should be ringing' in the Government over the revelations . ‘Patients need fast, efficient treatment without having to wait in pain. The financial straitjacket on the NHS is leading to A&E units up and down the country closing or reducing their hours to daytime only. The Government must see that its policies are damaging the ability of the NHS to care properly for patients.’ A Mail on Sunday investigation uncovered 33 hospital emergency departments which have either already been closed or downgraded, or are under threat of closure. Senior NHS executive Mike Farrar this week warned that the public must accept the closures if the health service is to survive and called on politicians to back the changes. But many MPs are preparing to join campaigns and protest marches in their constituencies against the unpopular moves. Doctors are still largely divided on the issue. While some claim the changes will improve patient care and mortality rates, others insist it puts patients at risk and dismantles the NHS. Shadow Health Minister Andrew Gwynne said: ‘David Cameron promised to put doctors in control, but he has allowed A&E closures to be driven through even where they don’t have clinical support. Ministers must take urgent action to ensure patients don’t pay the price for his broken promises on the NHS.’ This newspaper revealed in September that Category A patients in Newark, Nottinghamshire – where the A&E department closed last year – took an average of 90 minutes to reach an alternative casualty department after the initial 999 call. The latest figures, obtained after a Freedom of Information request, illustrate the national picture for the first time, covering eight out of 11 ambulance trusts in England. Senior NHS executive Mike Farrar has warned the public must accept cost cutting measures if the service is to survive . In the area covered by South Central Ambulance Service, the number of Category A patients taking longer than 30 minutes to reach A&E increased by 63 per cent between 2009-10 and 2011-12 – representing an additional 2,000 patients waiting longer before being seen in hospital. The picture was similar in the North East – where A&E units in Bishop Auckland and Hartlepool have closed in the last few years – with an additional 1,500 patients facing a 30-minute transit compared with two years ago, a rise of 62 per cent. In this area, patients with a certain type of heart attack or suffering major trauma are now taken to specialist units rather than district hospitals. In Yorkshire, 17,305 seriously ill patients spent 30 minutes in transit compared with just over 11,000 in 2009 – an increase of more than 50 per cent. Several A&Es in Yorkshire have closed or have been downgraded and others have limited opening hours. The numbers in the area covered by South East Coast Ambulance Service represent a rise of 37 per cent in two years, and in the East Midlands there were 23 per cent more journeys taking longer than half an hour in just 12 months. In the West Midlands the numbers rose by 27 per cent. The exceptions to the national picture were in the East of England, where there was a rise of less than one per cent, and in London, where the number of journeys taking longer than half an hour fell by around a third. Roger Goss, of campaign group Patient Concern, said: ‘We’re getting close to crunch time when we find out who was right – the medics who tell people they are more likely to survive if they travel to a specialist unit, or those who said patients would be arriving at A&E in a box.’","Patient groups up in arms and blame figures on cuts .

A mother who abandoned her four young children in a hotel room to go out partying has been banned from having any more babies. Kimberly Lightsey agreed not to have any more children in return for avoiding five years in jail. A judge in Bartow, Florida offered the 30-year-old the unique plea deal as a condition of her probation. Ban on babies: Kimberly Lightsey, 30, has been told not to have any more children as a condition of her parole after she left her four offspring in a hotel room to party in Florida . Lightsey looked at her boyfriend after Circuit Judge Ernest Jones Jr offered her the deal. When the single mother hesitated and said she wanted more children, the judge said: 'But you've got four of them.' Lightsey agreed to the plea deal which means she cannot get pregnant in the next 13 years - the length of her probation. The court heard how Lightsey had left her children, aged from one to 11 years old, alone in a hotel room in Winter Haven, Florida. Another guest at the hotel tipped off police after hearing crying coming from the bedroom and an overturned stroller in a hallway. Sentenced: Lightsey escaped a five-year jail term by agreeing not to have another child - a condition set by the judge . One of her children suffers from epilepsy and cerebral palsy and needs constant care. At the time, Lightsey was serving four years of probation after pleading no contest to child abuse. She had been charged with hitting her six-year-old son in the face with a belt in 2009. When police entered the hotel room they found it in 'complete disarray' with trash, food and clothing strewn everywhere. The eldest child said a woman called Simone was supposed to be looking after them. She was tracked down by police but told investigators she did not know what room the children were staying in. Lightsey was arrested when she returned to the hotel room. All of her children were taken into care before being placed with relatives. As well as 13 years probation, Lightsey was also placed under house arrest for two years and ordered to carry out 100 hours of community service. She was also banned from having any unsupervised contact with minors. The judge agreed that Lightsey could have more children in the future if she is able to fulfill various conditions of her probation and successfully petitions the court to remove the 'no unsupervised contact with minors' clause.","Kimberly Lightsey, 30, forced to comply after being put on probation for 13 years by a Florida judge .

More than half of young Britons say that friends seeing unflattering pictures of them on Facebook is one of the biggest concerns in their life. Four in ten worry about friends putting uncomplimentary photos of them on the site, with women concerned about it more often than men. The figures were revealed by a survey for shopping site VoucherCodes.co.uk. Its co-founder, Duncan Jennings, dubbed the trend ‘virtual vanity’. A fifth of Facebook users regularly exaggerate posts on their page to make their lives appear more exciting . A quarter of the 2,000 people aged between 18 and 25 who were interviewed for the survey admitted that they felt low and unpopular when they saw friends talking about social events to which they had not been invited. A further 25 per cent were so worried about their appearance on the site that they regularly splashed out on new clothes to avoid being photographed in the same outfit twice. The poll also revealed that young Britons spent an average of one hour and 20 minutes a day on Facebook, but nearly ten per cent used it for more than eight hours daily – the equivalent of a full working day. Nearly ten per cent of young Brits use Facebook for more than eight hours a day . A fifth of users were so concerned about their online appearance that they regularly exaggerated posts on their page to make their lives appear more exciting. Mr Jennings said: ‘Facebook is an integral part of young people’s lives but it’s putting pressure on them to  fit in and look the part, which is especially challenging for groups such as cash-strapped students.’ Internet psychologist Graham Jones said: ‘Those aged 18 to 25 are very aware of how they appear to others. They are still just completing the  formation of their self-identity and they can be quite affected by anything that makes them doubt themselves. ‘Anything that attacks who or how they are is quite impactful and they can get quite upset by such things  on Facebook.’ Due to the rise of social-networking sites, young people today are under constant scrutiny and observation – more so than any other generation before them. Mr Jones said: ‘They are alerted every time anything happens on Facebook and so they are much more aware of what other people think of them. They are more likely to find out if all their friends have been invited to a party but they haven’t. ‘This means they have a tougher time coping with the world than older people did in their younger years.’ Mr Jones added that today’s youngsters could not shut out their peers’ judgment in the way previous generations could. He said: ‘This judging is constant and can affect their self-esteem in a negative way.’","Not being invited to social events also a worry for young adults .

Debbie Grosch-Squance became seriously ill with a flesh eating bug after contracting a chest infection. Doctors had to amputate her right leg to save her life . For many of us, struggling out in the cold this winter to exercise sounds like a nightmare. But for Debbie Grosch-Squance, it’s something she feared might never be possible. Debbie, a mother-of-two from Plymouth, lost her right leg after a chest infection spiralled out of control. She became severely ill with a flesh-eating bug and in order to save her life, doctors had to amputate her right leg. Today, she says she is fitter than she has ever been and also slimmer – and she hopes her story will inspire others in similar situations. Her problems began after she developed a nasty cough and chest infection. ‘I’ve always been fit and healthy but this chesty cough really knocked me for six,’ she told MailOnline. 'My GP advised me to take paracetamol and ibuprofen but then two days later I began to experience a cramp-like pain in my right calf. It got progressively worse and nothing would ease it.’ After another visit to her GP she was provisionally diagnosed with DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis) and advised to go to hospital. What she didn’t know then was that she was actually suffering from necrotising fasciitis, a deadly flesh-eating bug. ‘I was told my chest infection was caused by the Strep A virus and sometimes it can mutate for no apparent reason and start attacking soft and healthy tissue,’ said Debbie, 47. ‘Before the amputation I was a keen runner - half marathon standard – and I’d done a 10k the week before. Debbie with her husband Tony and teenage daughters after her leg was amputated due to the flesh-eating bug . that nearly killed her . ‘When I arrived at hospital the pain was getting worse and worse and I just wanted it to stop. I had some blood taken and a doctor came to speak to me when I was shown to a bed. That was the last thing I remember until 12 days later.’ In the days that followed, Debbie’s family, including her husband Tony and her two teenage daughters, watched in despair as her condition deteriorated. The day after her admission, still undiagnosed, she began to go into toxic shock as the toxins began to affect her major organs and her blood pressure dropped to zero. She said: ‘I’m told that doctors and other medical staff began to frantically try to get lines into my body and things looked very grim. I was taken down to theatre immediately and my leg cut open and it was then that the diagnosis was changed from DVT to necrotising fasciitis.’ The flesh-eating bug had ravaged her right leg and there were worrying patches of black tissue appearing on her fingers and trunk. Doctors removed the dead tissue from Debbie’s legs and placed her in a morphine-induced coma in intensive care. She then went into cardiac arrest and her devastated family was told it was unlikely she would survive the night. From the very beginning, the seeds of hope were sown that Debbie would eventually be able to run again. She was back in the gym a month after the amputation . ‘When I was brought round 10 days later, my leg was basically just bone between my knee and ankle. It was in such a bad way that the doctors told me I needed to make a decision.’ One option was to have reconstructive surgery. But this would involve numerous operations - with no guarantee they would work – and she would still need a stick to walk. The other option was to have an amputation above the knee and be fitted with a prosthetic leg. In the end, the decision was made for her. While considering her options, she took a turn for the worse and spent four days battling for her life. ‘On Easter Sunday I signed the consent form to have my right leg amputated above the knee. It was one of the hardest decisions I have ever made, but even today I think it was the right one. Being wheeled down to theatre knowing I was going to lose my leg was also very surreal. ‘Even when I came round, I felt so much better than I had for ages. Tony, my husband, remarked on how much better I looked already. I knew then that I had made the right decision.’ From the very beginning, the seeds of hope were sown that Debbie would eventually be able to run again. Painstaking: Debbie had to learn to run again from scratch . ‘Basically, my whole life as I knew it ended that day and I knew I would have to re-start my life all over again. I set myself small goals along the way, but always with the ultimate aim of being able to run.’ Her personal trainer before the tragedy, Naso Shemetras, also visited her in hospital. ‘She came to see me in hospital and promised I would get fit and again and I would run again,’ says Debbie. 'The whole experience . has really made me value everything in my life and really appreciate my health' ‘And she really did a lot to help me back to fitness - I was back in the gym a month after leaving hospital, when I was still on one leg and crutches.’ Naso later went on to win the Exorex Personal Trainer of the Year award for her remarkable work with Debbie. ‘Once I was able to walk with a prosthetic leg without the aid of crutches or a walking stick, about nine months post-amputation, I walked the Race for Life and was ready for the big challenge – returning to running.’ It was a painstaking journey but with advice from another amputee, she began to make progress. 'He advised me to start by jumping from my good leg onto the prosthetic foot to gain confidence in my prosthetic leg and I practised this every day. I then tried the hop/skip style of running, where you jump twice on the good foot and then land on the prosthetic foot and repeat. This got me moving a bit faster. Debbie says she is now fitter and more active than ever. She now runs twice a week, cycles and swims as well as working two jobs . 'I . then felt ready to try step over step running, so accompanied by my . husband Tony, and a belt round my waist so he could hold me up whilst . attempting it, we went to the local athletics track. 'It . was hard work and the first few steps I made were very clumsy and . awkward, much like a baby elephant. It was exhausting and I realised . just how hard this was going to be.' She then enlisted the help of running coach Julian Wills. ‘I was very nervous to start with. He had to teach me how to run completely from scratch, as I could hardly put one foot in front of the other. 'It was exhausting - my own leg had to learn how to run alongside a mechanical leg which was quite alien to it, and a lot of the practise was to re-train my brain.’ Today, six years after losing her leg, Debbie says she is fitter and more active than ever. She now runs twice a week, cycles and swims as well as working two jobs as a supervisor of a pre-school and an admin assistant. Debbie before her accident, when she ran to half marathon standard . ‘I was a keen runner beforehand, so I . was pretty fit, but I’m definitely fitter now – and slimmer. I am now . quite obsessive about my health and fitness now. The whole experience . has really made me value everything and appreciate it. I’m also fitter . because you use so much more energy exercising with a prosthetic leg. ‘I . had to learn how to run up and down kerbs, but hills were my biggest . fear. Uphill is hard work - as an amputee, I already use up to 100 per . cent more energy to run, but running up hills is like climbing a . mountain - and Plymouth has plenty of hills! 'Running on the pavements is a whole . new ball game, too. The obstacles are many – cracks in the pavement, people, . dogs, children, drains, sharp bends and kerbs.' Running downhill is particularly scary. 'I've fallen over a few times running downhill - usually at bus stops, much to the amazement of waiting passengers, but never hurt myself, thankfully. 'When I took part in my first run with able-bodied people, I ran it in 22 minutes – probably double the time I would have been able to do it in normally. It was 1.5 miles, which doesn't seem a lot - or it certainly didn’t when I had two legs. But that was then and this is now, and it was a challenge for me. 'I trained hard and even though I had to stop a couple of times to catch my breath, I got my first medal and was proud of my achievement. 'Above all, the important thing is I survived the whole original ordeal and I'm here today with my family.'

A . new website launched by ministers will remotely monitor whether . benefits claimants are making enough effort to find employment. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith warned that . jobseekers could see their benefits slashed if they fail to look for . three jobs a week on the ‘revolutionary’ new government website. The new Universal Jobmatch site will remotely track whether the unemployed are doing enough to look for work, and match their CVs to vacancies while they sleep . He unveiled the new site, Universal . Jobmatch, which will enable jobseekers to input their details into a . computer system and then receive suitable vacancies. The system will trawl vacancies while the jobless are asleep in a bid to get them into work, Mr Duncan Smith said. They will also receive advice on what . skills they needed to improve their chances of finding work. He warned that those who do not make an effort and use the service could see their benefits cut. ‘If you choose not to take a job that matches you, then the adviser will . look at your reasons, and if the adviser thinks “actually, these are . pretty specious reasons”, he may call you in and say “I think you really . need to be applying for these jobs”,’ he said. The system will be fully launched in the New Year following a trial . period, with 370,000 companies already using it to advertise jobs. Online recruitment firm Monster will manage the site, which will be . compulsory for jobseekers to use at the start of next year. Mr Duncan Smith said the system was ‘brilliant’, adding: ‘It will be . accessible in internet cafes, libraries and on personal computers. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan warned the jobless will have their benefits cuts if they fail to look for three jobs a week on a new website . ‘It is a real revolution in the way we match future employers with . would-be employees. Your CV will do the work for you, even when you are . sleeping, and notify you that a suitable job has become available.’ Meanwhile, Mr Duncan Smith is prepared for a political battle with . Labour over the Welfare Benefits Up-rating Bill, published yesterday. The bill limits the year-on-year increase of benefits to 1 per cent – . around the same level as the increase in wages for working people. Chancellor George Osborne claimed in the Commons the cap was to ensure . fairness for those who go to work while their neighbours have their . curtains drawn. But Liam Byrne, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, said many benefits claimants in work would also be hit. ‘The Strivers’ Tax Bill is a naked attack on hard working families to . pay the price for this government’s economic failure,’ he said. ‘I want to bring down the welfare bill. But the way we do that is with . jobs. Labour will not support a bill that does nothing to create a . single new job yet punishes those who work.’ Mr Duncan Smith has also backed a new payment card for benefit claimants with drink and drug addictions – to prevent them from wasting taxpayers’ money fuelling their habits. The Work and Pensions Secretary said his department was studying the possibility of introducing a ‘welfare card’ for claimants with drug and alcohol addiction problems. The plan, under which claimants would receive the card rather than cash and would only be able to buy certain essential items, is being pushed by Tory backbencher Alec Shelbrooke.","New website will monitor whether unemployed search for three jobs a week .

A plan to improve dementia diagnosis rates by quizzing anyone over the age of 75 about their memory will put older patients off visiting their doctor, claims a concerned group of GPs. Prime Minister David Cameron, who has made tackling dementia a 'personal priority', wants older people to be checked when they visit the doctor for any reason. GPs will be paid for asking questions about patients' memories with anyone who admits to having problems being offered a screening test to see if they are at risk. GPs fear a proposed drive to tackle dementia diagnosis rates could put older patients off from visiting their doctors for unrelated matters . But many GPs fear patients will be put off visiting the doctors, even when suffering potentially serious health problems, because they will not want to be diagnosed with the disease. Former president of the Royal College . of GPs Dr Iona Heath was one of the doctors who signed a letter . which appeared in the Daily Telegraph. She said: 'This is . another step on the road to obsessive diagnosis, and turning people into . patients without any notion that it might cause more harm than good and . divert resources.' About 800,000 Britons are currently being treated for dementia with another 400,000 thought to suffer from it but have not been diagnosed. Prime Minister David Cameron has made tackling dementia a 'personal priority' Last month David Cameron announced plans for a £2.4million project to train a million volunteers to spot the illness and care for patients. One million 'dementia friends' are to be trained to spot the symptoms of the condition and given advice on how to provide practical help to Britain's estimated 700,000 sufferers. The GPs' letter reads: 'A diagnosis of dementia is a life-changing event. 'The Government's NHS Mandates states: 'Dementia is the illness most feared by people in England over the age of 55. 'There is a danger that older patients will avoid visiting their doctor with health problems, for fear of being given a diagnosis they do not wish to have.' In an interview with ITV's This Morning programme last month Mr Cameron explained: 'Six months ago, I set up this challenge to say we’ve got to do better as a country in three vital regards. 'First is how do we treat people with dementia in the health service, in care homes? In some cases it’s brilliant, in many cases it’s not good enough, and remember one in four hospital beds are occupied by someone with dementia. 'What more can we do in society to show understanding for people with dementia and make sure we treat them properly?

Italian prosecutors are seeking a jail sentence for the country's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi for allegedly revealing confidential information about an investigation into a financial scandal. The case relates to a judicial inquiry into an attempt by insurer Unipol to take over bank BNL, now owned by BNP Paribas, in 2005. Berlusconi is accused of obtaining details of a wire-tapped phone conversation about the deal and passing them to Il Giornale, the newspaper owned by his brother Paolo. Allegations: Silvio Berlusconi, seen at a book launch in Rome earlier this month, is accused of revealing confidential information about an investigation into a financial scandal . The tapped conversation in question was between former centre-left leader Piero Fassino and the former head of Unipol. Prosecutors are seeking a one-year jail sentence for Berlusconi, who has announced he will run as a candidate for prime minister in elections expected in February. Earlier this week the controversial figure announced his engagement to a girl young enough to be his granddaughter. The twice-married 76-year-old confirmed that his new partner was TV showgirl Francesca Pascale, 27, who has been at his side constantly in recent weeks following his announcement that he would seek to be elected prime minister once again. since he announced he would be running in next February’s General Election. The revelation came despite the fact he is still officially tied to his second wife Veronica Lario. Engaged: Berlusconi recently announced his engagement to 27-year-old Francesca Pascale . Berlusconi, who is currently on trial accused of having sex with an underage prostitute, said: 'It’s official, I have got engaged to Francesca Pascale and finally I feel less lonely.' In recent weeks the two have been seen together at the San Siro stadium in Milan watching his AC Milan football team and they were also snapped laughing and joking at a pizzeria in the city centre.","Prosecutors are seeking a one-year jail sentence for Italy's former PM .

Describing his hour-long meeting with . congressional leaders as 'constructive,' Obama said he is 'modestly . optimistic' that an agreement can be reached before the December 31 . deadline when the fiscal cliff is scheduled to take effect.

If the Senate does not come up with a compromise that it can approve and pass to the House for a vote before Sunday, Obama has ordered Sen. Harry Reid, the top Democrat in the Senate, to propose a vote on a basic package that would preserve tax cuts for middle-class Americans while extending unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless and working toward a foundation for a broader deal. 'I believe such a proposal could pass both houses,' Obama said. 'If members of the House or the Senate want to vote no, they can, but we should let everybody vote.'

At that point, Boehner had already said he was . willing to let tax revenues rise as part of an agreement, and the . president and his Democratic allies said they were ready to accept . spending cuts.

Unemployed Spaniards in a highly indebted commuter town in the outskirts of Madrid have been celebrating winning the top prize in El Gordo, the world's biggest lottery. The 200-year-old Christmas draw, known as The Fat One, doled out more than 2.5 billion euros (£2bn) in prizes around the country, where one in four of the workforce is jobless. There was a top individual prize of four million euros and smiles were particularly broad in Alcalá de Henares, a university town 20 miles from the capital, where some people had won a 400,000 euro share in the jackpot. Winners: Javier and his wife Silvia celebrate their lottery fortune outside an Alcala de Henares shop . Money, money, money: A group of friends toast their recession-hit town's El Gordo success . Many lived in the working-class neighbourhood and had bought tickets, known as decimos, for 20 euros. In Spain it is common for friends, relatives and colleagues to club together to buy the tickets, so the joy was spread even further. Winner Javier Hernando, a middle-aged owner . of a bar in Alcala de Henares, a working class town 20 miles northeast . of Madrid, said the prize would allow him to look at life differently, . as European authorities press countries on the periphery of the euro . zone to raise the age of retirement. Fellow winner Luis, 28, an unemployed electrician, said he would spend the money on buying a flat. Around 1,800 people around the country bought shares in top prize tickets, and more than 25 million won some sort of prize. Winning this year was particularly sweet, not just because Spain is suffering its second recession in three years, but also because 2012 is the last year winners will pay no tax on their takings. Spain's centre-right government, which has introduced austerity measures this year to shrink its public deficit, ruled that from next year those who win over 2,500 euros will pay 20 percent to the state. Celebrate: Manuel shows a photocopy of the winning number as he drives through a jubilant Alcalá de Henares . Joyous: People celebrate winning the second prize in Manises, near Valencia . The lottery, which dates back to . 1812, is an important Christmas tradition in Spain, with many families, . offices and bar regulars clubbing together to buy a full ticket for 200 . euros. Sales dipped 8 per cent this year to 2.47 billion euros compared to a 0.5 percent drop in 2011. 'It is no wonder that sales have gone . down taking into account the economic situation we are going through. We are in crisis, people are out of work and have no income,' said a . spokeswoman for the National Lottery. Those who did not win big can look . forward to the El Nino lottery on January 6, or Epiphany, when Spaniards . traditionally give presents to children.

A seven-year-old boy was grabbed from the street by strangers to maim him so he would elicit more sympathy working for them as a beggar. But when he recognised the men from his area and told them he would report them to his father, they decided to torture him, cutting off his penis and leaving him for dead on the streets of Bangladesh. In some South Asian countries, the prevalence of 'beggar mafias' is becoming increasingly common. Scroll down for video . Butchered: The seven-year-old's attackers drew ab upside down cross on his chest as well as slitting his throat . The practice was portrayed in the 2008 movie Slumdog . Millionaire, in which a child in Mumbai, India, is intentionally . blinded so he could bring in more money. The tragic story was uncovered by CNN's . Freedom Project - they named the child, who can not be identified, as . Okkhoy, the Bengali word for 'unbreakable.' The horrific attack on Okkhoy unfolded in late 2010, just a few days before the Muslim festival of Eid, when three local children lured the trusting child out of his home with the promise of a lolly. Brutal: One of the attackers grabbed a brick and Okkhoy lost consciousness after he was struck over the head . It was then a group of neighborhood men grabbed him and pulled him into an alley, binding his hands and feet. 'They tied me up and told me they'd force me to beg,' said Okkhoy. But their hope to maim Okkhoy turned into a plan to kill him after he told the men that he recognised them and he would tell his father. One of the attackers grabbed a brick and Okkhoy lost consciousness after he was struck over the head. They then set about carving up his body, slashing his throat and slicing his chest and belly in an upside down cross. Butchered: Okkhoy nearly died from blood-loss after his attackers slit his throat and left him for dead . In a final brutal act, his attackers chopped off his penis and his right testicle. Okkhoy was dumped by the side of a warehouse - his attackers intended to come back later and dump him in the river. But his mother, who had gone looking for her missing child, stumbled across his blood-soaked body. 'I barely recognized him; he was so stained with blood,' shes said. She carried her young son's body to the side of the main road where she was met by Okkhoy's father Abed, who had been alerted by a neighbor. 'It felt like the sky fell on me,' he said. Hero: Dr Reddet examines the young boy's head in Maryland after he was flown over for treatment . 'As a father, there is no greater pain in the world than knowing that you could not protect your child.' Okkhoy spent three months in a Dhaka hospital, but doctors were unable to do much to repair the severed organ. Abed reported the attack to police, but was shocked to discover it had already been covered and the police would not investigate. A man, who pretended to be Okkhoy's uncle, had told police that his nephew was attacked by two boys in a playground spat. Hope: During surgery in the U.S. doctors managed to rebuild the young boy's butchered genitalia . A judge also refused to help, but by sheer coincidence human rights lawyer, Alena Khan was in the courthouse and felt compelled to publicise the horrifying case. As the founder of Bangladesh Human Rights Foundation, she contacted a local television station and the story garnered so much publicity the high court was forced to ask authorities to launch an inquiry. Within days, the Rapid Action Battalion rounded up five suspects and charged them with attempted murder. 'The boy started arguing with us and I hit him on his head with a brick,'  said one of the men in a televised confession. 'After I hit him on the head, he fell to the ground. Then (one of the men) said to cut off his penis, and I cut it off. After that, (someone else) cut his chest and belly. Then (a third person) held his head and slit his throat,' he said. Philanthropy: U.S. businessman Aram Kovach, from Ohio, heard the story on CNN and decided to fund a trip for Okkoy and his family to travel to America for treatment . At the trial, according to prosecutors, it emerged that the gang maimed at least five other children to get money for begging. The gang kept . the children confined for months in tight spaces or even in barrels . and deprived them of food and then send them out to beg, according to . one of the men who confessed. Okkhoy's father believes the attack was payback after he had a confrontation with one of the men at a tea stall. Authorities continue to look for four others who they claim are part of the same 'beggar mafia' gang. To ensure Okkhoy and his family stay safe, they were placed in a battalion compound, but his father remained concerned about his son's ability to father children. Publicised: The practice was portrayed in the 2008 movie Slumdog Millionaire, in which a child in Mumbai, India, is intentionally blinded so he could bring in more money . But then U.S. businessman Aram Kovach, from Ohio, heard the story on CNN and decided to fund a trip for Okkhoy and his family to travel to America for treatment. John Gearhart, the director of pediatric urology at Johns Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore, Maryland decided to waive his fee and help Okhkoy. Although the surgeons were initially concerned they would not be able to reconstruct Okkhoy's genitalia, they found it was less-damaged than originally thought on the operating table. They were to move the urethra - the tube used for urination - to the tip of Okkhoy's penis, so he would no longer have to urinate through a tiny hole the doctors in Bangladesh had created. And his father's concerns about having grandchildren was abated after Redett's team used skin from Okkhoy's . thigh for the shaft of the penis and tissue from his inner cheek lining . to create the tip. The success of the operation means that Okkhoy will be able to have sensation and the organ will continue to grow as Okkhoy gets older. Now Okkhoy's ambition for the future is to become a doctor and help other people who have been inured.

By telling the world about it on  Twitter, of course. For Coleen Rooney, the celebrations involved raiding the dressing-up box to turn herself into Dorothy from The Wizard Of Oz. The 26-year-old posted a photo yesterday of herself with three-year-old son Kai as the Scarecrow. Whether or not her footballer husband Wayne, 27, joined in the fun in quite the same way is unclear. Christmas tweet: Nigella Lawson donned a blonde wig, holding a sign reading 'Happy Holidays!' Over the moon: Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins posted a picture of his son Ben with his new bike . Nigella Lawson also appeared keen to sport a different look. The raven-haired TV cook wore a blonde wig as she held up a sign reading ‘Happy holidays!’ in a snap she uploaded to her page. On another site, Instagram, Sports Personality of the Year Bradley Wiggins posted a photo of his seven-year-old son Ben grinning as he proudly shows off his Christmas present of a  racing bike – perhaps not surprising, given his father’s phenomenal success at the Tour de France and the Olympics. And on the Prime Minister’s official Twitter page, Larry the No 10 cat was pictured sprawled out in a Santa hat. The posts were among a series of ‘Merry Tweet-mas’ offerings to be found littering the social networking site, where the rich and famous seemingly can’t stop themselves from sharing snapshots of their lives... no matter how bizarre or, for that matter, mundane. Another Olympian, Tom Daley, got into the swing of things in more traditional Yuletide attire. The 18 year Olympic high diver wore a Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer t-shirt as he posed by the Christmas tree. Pop singer Leona Lewis tried to go the trad route too in casual sweater and jeans by the tree... but her slightly glum expression suggested little festive cheer.

Cheer up: A picture of Larry, the Downing Street cat, was posted on the Prime Minister's official Twitter page . Family: Tennis champion Andy Murray's mother Judy posted a picture of her son enjoying Christmas day with his relatives . Her chart rival Rhianna, meanwhile, opted for a Santa hat teamed with camouflage vest and shorts - relatively demure for her, considering her penchant for posting revealing snaps on Twitter. Over at the Murray household, things looked to be considerably tamer, with tennis hero Andy relaxing on the sofa with his brother and sometimes double partner Jamie. Their mother Judy Murray posted the picture along with the message: ‘Murray Christmas.

In August a court of appeal reversed a . trial judge's decision to end Debra Lafave's 10-year non-prison sentence . four years early. Lafave appealed to the Supreme Court in October and this week she asked the justices to let her remain off probation until they rule. Dispute: Disgraced Florida former teacher Debra Lafave is fighting to be taken off probation eight years after she admitted to having sex with one of her 14-year-old students, pictured in March . Split: Debra LaFave, left and with her former husband Owen Lafave who she had just married before she had sex with the teenager . The mother-of-two pleaded guilty in 2005 to having sex with a 14-year old boy. Lafave - who is now using her maiden . name Beasley - was ordered to stay away from children after it was . discovered she had been having sex with the boy while she was a teacher . at Angelo L. Greco Middle School in Temple Terrace, Florida. Lafave was reported by the boy's mother and was immediately arrested. She was charged with two counts of felonies after pleading guilty to having sexual intercourse and oral sex on four different occasions with the boy - one of which was at school. Deal: Lafave, pictured in 2006, avoided as much as 30 years behind bars after she accepted a plea deal . 'Too lenient': Lafave appears before Circuit Judge Wayne S. Timmerman, left, in 2005. Timmerman's decision to throw out the rest of Lafave's probation has been criticised - and now overthrown . Excitement: Lafave, who now has two baby twin boys, speaks to reporters in October 2009 after a judge ruled she could have unsupervised contact with children . The disgraced teacher avoided jail entirely, despite facing up to 30 years behind bars if convicted. The boy's mother did not want him to have to go through the trauma of the trial after learning the it would be televised and agreed to a plea bargain. She was newly married when she committed the offenses. Following the court case, she and Owen Lafave divorced and she now has baby twin boys with new love, Shawn Haverfield, 36. She was then sentenced to only seven years probation and three years house arrest. The story took a bizarre twist after John Gillespie, the lead detective in her case, was arrested before the trial in an unrelated prostitution sting, while Tampa Bay Police officers were probed when it was revealed they took graphic nude photos of Lafave while she was in stirrups in a jail cell. Racy: Lafave escaped jail time as the boy would not testify and she accepted a plea deal instead . In 2009, once she completed sex offender therapy, a judge allowed her to have contact with her relative's children, though she was still banned from living within 1,000 feet of where children congregate. But in 2009, Circuit Judge Timmerman said Lafave could have unsupervised . contact with children after she completed sex offender therapy. And last September, Lafave convinced Timmerman to drop her final four . years of probation, telling him she had completed the community service, . had two jobs, had two sons and was engaged. Lafave, who garnered nationwide interest for her striking looks and provocative modelling shots after she committed the crime, is banned from ever teaching in Florida again.","Debra Lafave is fighting to be taken off probation early, eight years after she admitted to having sex with one of her 14-year-old students .

Alex Goodhind was so determined his Christmas decorations would be the best ever this year, he took more than four weeks off work to prepare them. And with more than 180,000 bulbs, a searchlight that can be seen for almost four miles and an estimated £1,000 electricity bill for the month, he certainly didn’t disappoint. Indeed, his neighbours say you can see this extraordinary collection from space. Mr Goodhind, 28, started draping his . house with Christmas lights in 2006 and his displays have already raised . more than £8,000 in donations for the hospice which treated his mother. Wonder: This amazing Christmas lights display in Melksham, Wiltshire, attracts coachloads of visitors . Teamwork: Mr Goodhind's friend Graham Fryer helped him finish the amazing display . Fairy story: With hundreds of lights and figurines it is hard to believe the house isn't part of a film set . He took a break from delighting the locals in 2010 and 2011. But this year the electrician promised his show would be better than ever – adding a snow machine, the searchlight and thousands more lights. He said: ‘I’ve been collecting lights and decorations for years, so it’s just sort of grown. There are some new pieces I’m particularly excited about.’ Mr Goodhind has had to pay Southern Electricity £700 to lay an industrial strength cable to his home to cope with the drain caused by the display. The lights go on every day from 5.30pm and Mr Goodhind has them switched off at 10pm ‘out of respect to his neighbours’. His display now features more than 300 strings of lights, 300 metres of rope lights, 145 rope light frames, 18 plastic figures and several large inflatables. Magical: Coachloads of people flock to take in the Christmas wonderland which takes a month to put up . Colourful: Children stand in thrall of the display which costs nearly £30,000 to put up every year . Mr Goodhind has even installed a snow machine to make the display even more more festive . Mr Goodhind is one of a number of residents on Longford Road in Melksham, Wiltshire, who decorate their houses for Christmas – often for charity. His neighbour Margaret Escott, 69, said: ‘We do ours for the air ambulance as it is nice to give something back to the community. ‘I think you could see Alex’s display from space, there is not a part of that house which isn’t covered in lights.’ After raising £4,000 for the Dorothy House Hospice in nearby Bradford on Avon in 2009, Mr Goodhind took a two year break but he decided to start again and hopes to raise even more for the charity this year. Despite the coachloads of visitors who flock to the suburban street to catch a glimpse of his display, Mr Goodhind says most neighbours are supportive of his decision to switch on the lights once again. Vast: Nearly 100,000 lights are used in in the display . He said: 'Some of the neighbours might have been glad when we stopped, but I wanted to do it again, for Dorothy House. My mum was in there before she died, so I've always been keen to stick with them.' Despite costing him nearly £30,000, he won't be stopping any time soon. 'I've been collecting lights and decorations for more than 15 years, so it's just sort of grown as I add new pieces each year. There are some new pieces in there this year that I'm particularly excited about.' Luckily, he's got friends like Kim Bailey and fellow electrician Graham Fryer to help with arduous task of completing the job. Ms Bailey said: 'Alex doesn't like to make a big fuss of it himself, he just does it for the charity.'

Celebrated physicist, Sir Bernard Lovell, was asked by Soviet officials to defect during his trip to the USSR at the height of the Cold War. After he refused, he believes members of the KGB tried to wipe his memories of the visit using radiation, extracts from his diaries released yesterday reveal. His Cold War diaries, kept hidden for 50 years, were promised only to be published upon his death. They reveal a fascinating story of KGB brainwashing, radiation weapons and an astronomer's secret role at the centre of Britain's nuclear defences, being told in full for the first time. Sir Bernard Lovell, the astronomer behind the Jodrell Bank observatory, reveals in his diaries that the Soviets may have tried to remove memories from his brain using radiation . Released by the family of Sir Bernard, after his death last month, they are an account of his visit to observatories in the Crimea in the 1960s. If MI6 suspicions at the time were correct, his tale is one of the most fascinating revelations of the Cold War. His son, Bryan Lovell, speaking to MailOnline today said: 'They are an account of an extra-ordinary exchange at the height of the Cold War.' In 1963 Sir Bernard, who died aged 98, went on a scientific visit to the Soviet Union. On his return and for a month afterwards the celebrated physicist felt inexplicably unwell. Doctors could not explain why and his illness was left a mystery. But he believed until his death this August that someone did - the Russian security services. Sir Bernard led the construction of the Jodrell Bank Radio Telescope which launched in 1959 and tracked the USSR's Sputnix satellite - the first of many achievements. Secret: This section of his diaries shows an insert from the summer of 1963, when he went to visit Moscow . Details of Lovell's flight ticket to Moscow in the archived diaries, which were released yesterday . Ink stained with scribbles, the incredible diaries detail an extraordinary account during the height of the war . His visit to Crimea, written about his his diary extracts, pictured, was shortly after the Cuban Missile Crisis . In an earlier interview the scientist said it was then used as the first 'early warning device' of a Soviet nuclear attack. This, he said, put him in the front line and prompted the Russian military to try and harm him during a visit behind the Iron Curtain in 1963. The diaries, which were kept in the archive at Manchester University's John Rylands Library and at last set out his suspicions, were released yesterday by his family and have been seen by MailOnline. The KGB, he claimed, had tried to wipe his memories with a beam of focused radiation. His visit, as part of a British delegation, to observatories in the Crimea, included a surprise trip to an unexpectedly advanced radio telescope at Yevpatoria. After the visit to the telescope, he . claims Soviet officials tried to persuade him to defect. He refused, . saying: 'I am an Englishman and I wish to return to England.' But . when he returned home all was not well. 'After a few days at home I . became mysteriously ill', he explains in a foreword to the diaries. 'There has never been an explanation of this sudden hiatus.' Debriefed by M16, he heard an astonishing theory. The Yevpatoria RT-70 radio telescope in Yevpatoria, Crimea. Lovell's visit, as part of a British delegation, included a visit to the advanced device . He wrote: 'The intelligence agents thought that by some means - probably radiation, the Soviets tried to removed from my brain all memories of my visit to Yevpatoria.' Sir Bernard was so disturbed by the illness and its explanation, that he considered quitting astronomy altogether. He said: 'I visited the bursar and told him that I was proposing to resign from Jodrell and go . into the Church . . . he did not dissuade me but my family did so, for . which I am everlastingly grateful.' He said in a later memorandum: 'In retrospect, I should not have accepted that invitation to visit the USSR...in the summer of 1963 and furthermore the Joint Intelligent Burreau in London should have advised me not to visit Moscow.' Sir Bernard Lovell, pictured in front of the telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory, said after a visit to the USSR, Soviet officials tried to persuade him to defect . Bryan Lovell, the astronomer's son, who is president of the Geological Society, told MailOnline: ‘What is fascinating about these diaries is the details of my father carrying out this scientific research right through the most dangerous part of the Cold War. 'My father was one of the leading scientists in the West at the time. He was at the front line of defence during the height of the Cold War. 'I remain to this day angry that he was sent to Russia so soon after the Cuban missile crisis, when he was obviously a key person in British defence.' Speaking about his illness following the trip to the USSR, he said: ‘You and I will never really know what happened.' He believes that the stress of the responsibility he carried for Britain's safety could have been an explanation for his sheer exhaustion upon his return to the UK. He said: 'There is the spooks explanation and then there is the mundane explanation – that he was so exhausted due to tremendous strain. At the time, unknown to the public, . Jodrell Bank was not simply a astronomical establishment, but also one of . the most important military tools in the free world. Bryan added: ‘The reason for the embargo on the papers is that he wanted the context of the Cold War to be published before his diary entries were released.' Sputnik 1,the first artificial Earth satellite. The Soviet Union launched it in 1957 and the Jodrell Bank telescope tracked it . The diaries also detail a discussion Sir Bernard had about the Space Race - which experts say effectively began with the Soviet launch of the Sputnix 1 artificial satellite in 1957 - a device Lovell Radio Telescope tracked. Sir Bernard wrote in 1963: 'They see great technical diffciulties which still have to be solved. 'The President said it was impossible to foretell if it would be . possible to arrive there quickly although one must remember the contrast . between today and the Sputnix of 1957. Then he asked me to explain why . I thought it was necessary to get a man on the moon. The discussion . which followed clearly indicated that the President is thick in the . middle of the same kind of arguments which are taking place in the west. 'At least i realise now that to talk of a Russian moon landing in 1968 . or 1970 means nothing more than guessing at dates which they themselves . are not even doing.'Although Jodrell Bank was built for scientific endeavour, Nato very quickly realised that it was the only mechanism available to them for tracking Soviet inter-continental ballistic missiles.

"By . Jo Macfarlane and Martyn Halle . PUBLISHED: . 17:15 EST, 29 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:59 EST, 31 December 2012 . Few gifts could be more precious than the one David Whaymand gave to his wife Carolyn this Christmas. When cystic fibrosis sufferer Carolyn was told her kidneys were failing and that her only chance of survival was a transplant, her devoted husband stepped in without hesitation to offer one of his own organs. It was a touching gesture of love and one David was happy to make after 15 years of marriage to his childhood sweetheart. Gift of life: Husband David Whayland was a donor for his wife Carolyn's kidney transplant just before Christmas . But what makes his sacrifice all the more remarkable is that, in similarly desperate circumstances 13 years ago, David also gave Carolyn a portion of one of his lungs. These two inspiring deeds are now thought to represent a world first. Doctors and transplant experts say there are no known cases in which a living donor has given up two organs. This is due to the serious risks of such surgery. The fact that the recipient in both case was David's own wife makes the story even more extraordinary – especially considering that it is highly unusual for a husband to be able to donate to his spouse, as finding a suitable match for a transplant is notoriously difficult. World class treatment: Carolyn received her transplant at Hammersmith Hospital in West London . The latest successful operation took place at Hammersmith Hospital in West London on December 12 and the couple were back at their £500,000 home in Ingatestone, Essex, in time for Christmas. David, 39, an accountant for bank J.P. Morgan, told The Mail on Sunday: 'They say marriage is in sickness and in health. When I married Carolyn I knew it wouldn't be easy and that she might die without a transplant. When it came to me being a live donor, I didn't hesitate for a second. 'I was prepared to make the sacrifice that could have seen us both lose our lives. I couldn't stand by and watch Carolyn die for want of a lung donor. 'And when it turned out she needed a kidney, of course I was ready to make the sacrifice again. 'It was child's play compared with the first operation, which was definitely more risky.' For solicitor Carolyn, 42, it is difficult to explain just how much David's sacrifices have meant to her. 'He's more worried about my suffering than his own,' she says. About 1,000 people in the UK give up a kidney for a friend or loved one every year. The Human Tissue Authority, which regulates all donations by living people, must decide who is suitable. Volunteers must prove they are in robust health and understand what the lengthy, physically arduous process will involve. There can be a 12-week recovery period, and a one-in-3,000 risk of dying while having a kidney removed. Carolyn, who was diagnosed with the genetic condition cystic fibrosis aged two, was already on the transplant list when David proposed in 1996. The couple, who met when they were teenagers, were married the following year. Cystic fibrosis affects the internal organs, especially the lungs and digestive system, by clogging them with sticky mucus, making it hard to breathe and digest food. In sickness and in health: David and Carolyn were childhood sweethearts before marrying in 1997 . Only half of sufferers live past the age of 40. Within a year of their marriage, Carolyn's situation became more desperate. 'I was on oxygen a lot of the time and towards the end I was on it all  of the time,' she says. 'But neither of us had ever considered that David could donate part of his lung.' Carolyn was receiving her treatment at the specialist lung unit at Harefield Hospital in Uxbridge, West London, when a friend saw a magazine article on lung donation. 'The doctors were very cautious and said they had done some live lung transplants at Harefield. But the operations were risky for both the donor and the recipient,' she says. 'They explained the survival rate wasn't very high and there was a strong risk that I might not pull through afterwards.' At first the couple rejected the idea but as Carolyn became increasingly ill, it suddenly became their only option. David, along with four members of Carolyn's family, including her father and brother, volunteered to be tested to see if they could donate. Unusually, David turned out to be a good match and Carolyn's cousin also offered a section of his lung. 'We had to take a gamble on live donation because I might have got to the stage where I was too sick to have a transplant from a donor – live or dead,' says Carolyn. 'Both David and my cousin agreed – after counselling – that they were prepared to risk their lives to save mine. Both were desperate to see me living a normal life.' Pioneer: Sir Magdi Yacoub, Carolyn's surgeon during her lung surgery, is one of Britain's experts on organ transplants . David adds: 'I had watched her deteriorate and it was enough for me to do something about it. The risks were there, but there was no question I would donate.' The pioneering surgery, carried out by Professor Sir Magdi Yacoub, one of the world's leading transplant surgeons, was hugely controversial because so many patients had died during previous procedures. In fact the operation has subsequently been suspended in Britain because of the risks. Today, Carolyn is regarded as something of a medical miracle because she is one of only four patients who underwent the procedure in the UK and survived. Only about 50 per cent of any lung transplant patients are still alive after ten years, so the fact she has survived 13 years with very limited problems makes her tale all the more remarkable. Carolyn's lungs function perfectly and she has near-normal breathing. However, she has needed to take powerful drugs to suppress her immune system and prevent her body from rejecting the new organ. She still also has the digestive problems associated with cystic fibrosis and must take daily enzymes and immuno-suppressive drugs that have had an effect on other organs. About five per cent of those who have lung transplants go on to  suffer kidney damage because of these drugs. Unfortunately, Carolyn is one of those affected, and during the past 12 months doctors informed her that tests showed she would soon need dialysis or a kidney transplant. She says: 'Ordinarily, going on to dialysis wouldn't have been a problem, but I was at added risk by being someone who had already had a transplant. 'There was an increased risk of picking up an infection and the effect of the dialysis on my anti-rejection medication. The doctors were worried it would put me at risk.' For David, who was left with a scar on his back after donating part of his lung, the answer was simple. He says: 'I had invested part of my lung all those years ago and it was ironic that the drugs used to keep Carolyn's lung healthy had damaged her kidneys and I was called upon again. 'I love her, and I wasn't prepared to see what I gave to her all that time ago put at risk.' The latest operation was carried out by Professor Nadey Hakim of Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust. David was discharged on December 17, and Carolyn was allowed home four days later. David expects to be well enough to return to work in the middle of January, while Carolyn will be recovering for several months. A spokesman for the Human Tissue Authority said: 'This would appear to be a first. Live donors  are a very important part of the transplant programme. 'Mr Whaymand should be congratulated on giving twice.' Prof Hakim added: 'It is amazing for someone to give an organ twice. In all my years in transplant surgery I have not heard of an example.' Carolyn's lung physician, Dr Martin Carby, said: 'I'm not aware of any other individual donating tissue twice to a spouse or any other – it is an extraordinary case. The lung donation would have been the more risky of the two transplants. But I admire anyone who gives an organ twice.' David is prepared to donate again should Carolyn need his help a third time – although his options are understandably limited. He says: 'I wouldn't think twice about doing it again if I had to, although all I have left to give is my liver [the only remaining organ he, as a living donor, could donate part of]. 'Ironically, doing this for Carolyn has actually improved my life expectancy because I'm having such regular check-ups. 'Both times, the medical teams have been just fantastic. If our story can encourage other people to become living donors, that would  be wonderful.'","David Whaymand, 39, donates kidney 13 years after giving his wife a lung .

A seven-year-old boy was grabbed from the street by strangers to maim him so he would elicit more sympathy working for them as a beggar. But when he recognised the men from his area and told them he would report them to his father, they decided to torture him, cutting off his penis and leaving him for dead on the streets of Bangladesh. In some South Asian countries, the prevalence of 'beggar mafias' is becoming increasingly common. Scroll down for video . Butchered: The seven-year-old's attackers drew ab upside down cross on his chest as well as slitting his throat . The practice was portrayed in the 2008 movie Slumdog . Millionaire, in which a child in Mumbai, India, is intentionally . blinded so he could bring in more money. The tragic story was uncovered by CNN's . Freedom Project - they named the child, who can not be identified, as . Okkhoy, the Bengali word for 'unbreakable.' The horrific attack on Okkhoy unfolded in late 2010, just a few days before the Muslim festival of Eid, when three local children lured the trusting child out of his home with the promise of a lolly. Brutal: One of the attackers grabbed a brick and Okkhoy lost consciousness after he was struck over the head . It was then a group of neighborhood men grabbed him and pulled him into an alley, binding his hands and feet. 'They tied me up and told me they'd force me to beg,' said Okkhoy. But their hope to maim Okkhoy turned into a plan to kill him after he told the men that he recognised them and he would tell his father. One of the attackers grabbed a brick and Okkhoy lost consciousness after he was struck over the head. They then set about carving up his body, slashing his throat and slicing his chest and belly in an upside down cross. Butchered: Okkhoy nearly died from blood-loss after his attackers slit his throat and left him for dead . In a final brutal act, his attackers chopped off his penis and his right testicle. Okkhoy was dumped by the side of a warehouse - his attackers intended to come back later and dump him in the river. But his mother, who had gone looking for her missing child, stumbled across his blood-soaked body. 'I barely recognized him; he was so stained with blood,' shes said. She carried her young son's body to the side of the main road where she was met by Okkhoy's father Abed, who had been alerted by a neighbor. 'It felt like the sky fell on me,' he said. Hero: Dr Reddet examines the young boy's head in Maryland after he was flown over for treatment . 'As a father, there is no greater pain in the world than knowing that you could not protect your child.' Okkhoy spent three months in a Dhaka hospital, but doctors were unable to do much to repair the severed organ. Abed reported the attack to police, but was shocked to discover it had already been covered and the police would not investigate. A man, who pretended to be Okkhoy's uncle, had told police that his nephew was attacked by two boys in a playground spat. Hope: During surgery in the U.S. doctors managed to rebuild the young boy's butchered genitalia . A judge also refused to help, but by sheer coincidence human rights lawyer, Alena Khan was in the courthouse and felt compelled to publicise the horrifying case. As the founder of Bangladesh Human Rights Foundation, she contacted a local television station and the story garnered so much publicity the high court was forced to ask authorities to launch an inquiry. Within days, the Rapid Action Battalion rounded up five suspects and charged them with attempted murder. 'The boy started arguing with us and I hit him on his head with a brick,'  said one of the men in a televised confession. 'After I hit him on the head, he fell to the ground. Then (one of the men) said to cut off his penis, and I cut it off. After that, (someone else) cut his chest and belly. Then (a third person) held his head and slit his throat,' he said. Philanthropy: U.S. businessman Aram Kovach, from Ohio, heard the story on CNN and decided to fund a trip for Okkoy and his family to travel to America for treatment . At the trial, according to prosecutors, it emerged that the gang maimed at least five other children to get money for begging. The gang kept . the children confined for months in tight spaces or even in barrels . and deprived them of food and then send them out to beg, according to . one of the men who confessed. Okkhoy's father believes the attack was payback after he had a confrontation with one of the men at a tea stall. Authorities continue to look for four others who they claim are part of the same 'beggar mafia' gang. To ensure Okkhoy and his family stay safe, they were placed in a battalion compound, but his father remained concerned about his son's ability to father children. Publicised: The practice was portrayed in the 2008 movie Slumdog Millionaire, in which a child in Mumbai, India, is intentionally blinded so he could bring in more money . But then U.S. businessman Aram Kovach, from Ohio, heard the story on CNN and decided to fund a trip for Okkhoy and his family to travel to America for treatment. John Gearhart, the director of pediatric urology at Johns Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore, Maryland decided to waive his fee and help Okhkoy. Although the surgeons were initially concerned they would not be able to reconstruct Okkhoy's genitalia, they found it was less-damaged than originally thought on the operating table. They were to move the urethra - the tube used for urination - to the tip of Okkhoy's penis, so he would no longer have to urinate through a tiny hole the doctors in Bangladesh had created. And his father's concerns about having grandchildren was abated after Redett's team used skin from Okkhoy's . thigh for the shaft of the penis and tissue from his inner cheek lining . to create the tip. The success of the operation means that Okkhoy will be able to have sensation and the organ will continue to grow as Okkhoy gets older. Now Okkhoy's ambition for the future is to become a doctor and help other people who have been inured.

So, no doubt many will have been delighted  last night at the look of horror across her face as she discovered what she had let herself in for on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! The Conservative MP appeared shocked on finding out that contestants would be forced to empty their own toilet in the Australian jungle. Reading camp instructions she said: 'Oh my God!

Jungle fever: The politican talks with fellow contestant, Made In Chelsea's Hugo Taylor . Mrs Dorries, 55, also seemed upset that the contestants would be sleeping on the ground instead of hammocks, distilling their own water and collecting firewood. The former nurse took charge of the camp and later said she was 'worn out' after delegating tasks to her team mates. Viewers saw Mrs Dorries justify her appearance in the jungle to fellow camper Hugo Taylor from TV show Made in Chelsea. She said: 'Sixteen million people watching this show. That's how politics should be. Sixteen million people do not watch Prime Minister's Question Time or Question Time.' Her publicity point was rammed home when former Coronation Street star Helen Flanagan wasted no time stripping to her bikini to get in the camp shower – a scene that has become customary among the fame-hungry in the TV jungle. Tired: Mrs Dorries looks shattered despite the show only just getting started . Order! The Tory MP told her fellow contestants she is 'worn out' Back with Mrs Dorries, Mr Taylor asked the politician if she would ever like to be Prime Minister.'God no,' she said.

Yesterday a blog that Mrs Dorries wrote before going into the jungle revealed she fully knew her appearance on the show was likely to cause trouble. Published yesterday, it began with the words: 'G'day. Is it outrage back home?' She then added: 'I think many may have guessed that I am a bit of an anti-politics politician.' The Mid-Bedfordshire MP caused fury last week when she left for the ITV1 show without telling her local association or getting permission from the Chief Whip. She has since been suspended from the party. Shocked: Mrs Dorries also appeared upset when she found out they would be sleeping on the ground .

However, Mrs Dorries remains defiant, claiming that she had informed the Whips Office that she would be away for a month. She also said she will be donating her parliamentary salary for the period she is away to children's charities. If she is away for a month that would be around £5,500 which is significantly less than the £40,000 fee she is understood to be receiving from ITV to be a contestant.

Rapid response: Bus driver Mr Cork immediately sprung into action when he heard his son needed emergency treatment . A quick-thinking bus driver rushed his epileptic son to hospital in his double-decker bus after he started having a fit. Ross Cork, 27, was forced to carry out the mercy dash for his two-year-old son Riley after an ambulance was delayed. The Norwich bus driver had just dropped off all his passengers at 10.30am on Saturday at Castle Meadow in the city centre when he got a heart-stopping call from his frantic wife Lydia, who told him their son was having a fit. Their vulnerable son, who has battled epilepsy since he was born, was at his grandad's home nearby and urgently needed to go to hospital. Mr Cork instinctively phoned his boss at Konectbus to get the all clear to rescue his son and within minutes had diverted his bus to get Riley. He said: 'I drove that bus down some roads I didn't think I would ever drive down - I still can't believe I did it. 'I keep thinking how lucky it was that I was in the city centre when I got the call. 'I could have been anywhere in Norfolk, but it just so happened I was five minutes away.' Mrs Cork had dialled 999 and the bus driver arrived to find an East of England Ambulance Service Trust (EEAST) rapid response vehicle and paramedic at the scene. The paramedic warned Ross that the ambulance due to pick Riley up had been held up ten miles away in Wymondham and urged him to drive them to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in his double-decker. Mr Cork, who has been a bus driver for five years, put Riley on the back seat, got the paramedic and his wife aboard and headed straight for the hospital. He said: 'I thought in circumstances like this that driving to the hospital had to be done.' Mr Cork dropped Riley, his wife and the paramedic at the emergency department's entrance as he parked his giant bus in a shelter outside the main hospital building for Konectbus to collect.

"By . Annabel Venning . PUBLISHED: . 19:41 EST, 30 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:46 EST, 30 December 2012 . Sex advice: Dr Marie Stopes, the author of Married Love which published in 1918, was an instant bestseller and reprinted 39 times in the next seven years . Deeply embarrassed yet clearly keen to make a success of his marriage, the anonymous correspondent plucked up the courage to ask for advice on a delicate matter: how to make love to his wife. ‘For the first four months of our married life I did not know that it was necessary to move my body in any way,’ he wrote. ‘We only know of the one positions [sic] in which my wife is underneath . . . now can you tell me of alternate positions and also is my wife supposed to move about?’ The letter was one of many sent to Marie Stopes, the birth-control pioneer and author of Married Love, a manual with information on physical intimacy that emphasised how husbands should endeavour to satisfy their wives rather than merely expecting them to put up with ‘it’. The book, published in 1918, was an instant bestseller and reprinted 39 times in the next seven years. Young couples and those who had been married for years devoured it. Though erotic novels had long been in circulation, practical advice for ‘normal’ couples was non-existent. Brides went into marriage woefully ignorant of what to expect, while their bridegrooms were very often equally naive. When Stopes asked her readers to write to her with evidence to support her theory that women had a ‘cycle’ of desire — feeling more amorous at certain times of the month than others — she was inundated with thousands of letters from men and women desperate for information about sex. The act of ‘married love’ did not come naturally for many, and they were acutely aware of their failings. Some of the letters are touchingly naive, others heart-breaking. Other men and women were writing letters sharing their sexual experiences, fantasies and bizarre proclivities to magazines such as London Life. These were published alongside racy pictures of chorus girls disrobing. An American academic has unearthed these letters to Stopes and the risqué magazines, drawing on them for an intriguing new book about British sex lives between the wars and how people communicated their sexual problems and desires. While Victorian marriages had been largely about wives submitting to husbands — in the bedroom and elsewhere — by the Twenties many men and women (at least among the middle classes) wanted a more equal relationship. But they’d been raised by Victorian parents reluctant to broach such a distasteful subject, so often had no idea how to do it. This was where Stopes stepped in. She had been entirely ignorant about sex before she married. Highly educated though she was (she had a doctorate in botany), it was not until several years into her marriage that she stumbled across a description of sex in a library book and realised she had never experienced it. In 1916 she obtained a divorce on the grounds her marriage had not been consummated — a claim her husband furiously denied — and set about trying to dispel the ignorance that had led her and, she surmised, many others to miss out on this vital part of marriage. The reception of Married Love proved her right. Though the Church, press and medical establishment were outraged (couched though it was in coy euphemisms), ordinary couples fell on it eagerly, using it as a guide to navigate their way through territory as bewildering as another planet. Cheeky: Edwardian magazines printed revealing shots, left, while Marie Stopes book, published in 1918, revolutionised sex for married couples, right . One woman wrote that her husband, despite having a biology degree from Cambridge, was clueless as to the geography of the female body, and they’d been unable to achieve ‘union’. After studying the book, they pinpointed the vital location and ‘eventually were successful’. Not all sexual impasses could be resolved so happily. The war had left many men with physical injuries that made sex impossible. Others suffered mental trauma that inhibited them. One young man wrote to Stopes that he had been wounded three times during the war, the last time in both legs. He had suffered shell shock and two nervous breakdowns but had recovered — or so he thought — sufficiently to get married in 1925. Sadly, he had been unable to consummate the marriage on honeymoon, and the experience was so off-putting for his wife that she lost all desire for him. Other men with disabilities worried that their inadequacy would cause the wives to have nervous breakdowns. They were mortified and felt ‘selfish and mean’ or ‘like a cad’ for being unable to fulfil their role. Perhaps some feared their wives would seek sex elsewhere, like Constance in D. H. Lawrence’s novel Lady Chatterley’s Lover. For other men, the war had provided an outlet for sexual preferences they hadn’t been aware of. A sapper wrote to London Life of how, while taking part in morale-boosting theatrical performances, he’d discovered he loved dressing in women’s clothes. One man claimed happy memories of cross-dressing sustained him during a long recuperation from war wounds. Most refused to see their penchant as effeminate. One man who liked wearing female underwear wrote robustly: ‘Nothing namby-pamby in that!’ The era also saw the rise of the sporty girl, who cast off the corsets and stays worn by her mother’s generation and enjoyed hiking and tennis. Some saw the rise of these modern women as deeply worrying, but for others the image of girls wrestling or boxing was a source of admiration and titillation. Magazines such as London Life obliged by running reports of such matches accompanied by photos of semi-naked girls in the wrestling or boxing ring. One woman, calling herself Sporty Wife, wrote many letters to London Life, sending readers’ pulses racing with descriptions of her underwear. In response to multiple requests, she sent in her photo and it was printed. But her fans were disappointed by the disparity between the curvaceous figure she had described and the reality. One wrote in describing himself as ‘Sadly Disillusioned’. In need of help: Some men turned to Marie Stopes's book because they were worried that their wife might take a lover like Constance in Lady Chatterley's Lover . Magazines with deceptively anodyne titles catered to more risqué tastes. Englishwoman’s Domestic Magazine, for instance, was all about whipping. Novels were a source of information and titillation. In 1919, nearly a century before suburban housewife E. L. James wrote Fifty Shades Of Grey, E. M. Hull, a pig farmer’s wife from Derbyshire, published The Sheik — a romantic novel about an Englishwoman who is kidnapped in the desert by a sheik and spends months being sexually dominated by him until they fall in love. The bestseller was made into a hit film starring Rudolph Valentino. People who wanted something more raunchy could visit certain bookshops in London, though the National Vigilance Association and London Public Morality Council would alert the police if the material being sold was too explicit. (Presumably, these moral guardians had to read them thoroughly first in order to make such a judgment.) Many people preferred to get erotic literature from mail-order companies that would deliver it in brown paper. Most consumers were middle class, as were Marie Stopes’ correspondents — at least those concerned about sexual pleasure. The working classes, if they could write, tended to have more practical concerns: they wanted information about birth control. Their mothers were equally reluctant to enlighten them about the facts of life as those in the middle classes. One young woman from Lancashire believed that ‘if a lad kissed yer, you’d be having a baby’. Such innocence seems a world away from our own, rather more  sexually confident age.

Russia's female prisoners are being subjected to 'concentration camp' conditions where as many as 30 inmates are forced to share one room, a damning new book reveals today. Convicts tell of a 'devastating lack of personal space' and the 'awful' experience of having to share just two toilets with 300 fellow inmates. Others have been punished for soiling their bed sheets with menstrual blood after their period started unexpectedly. 'Awful': Russia's female prisoners say they are being subjected to a 'devastating lack of personal space in concentration camp-style conditions, according to a new book (file picture) Their accounts have been documented in the book Before and After Prison: Women’s Stories by a group of St Petersburg sociologists who have combined uncensored stories by inmates with a professional assessment of life behind bars. Russia's penal colonies have been examined before, but mainly by lawyers and human rights advocates and never analysing gender differences. One prisoner known only as Galina, whose story features in the book, said: 'There were thirty of us sharing the same room in the colony. It was awful and really felt like barracks. 'And there was only one toilet room — with two toilets in it — per one detachment of three hundred people, who had a total of half an hour in the morning to use this toilet. It was a concentration camp'. The inmates' accounts have been documented in the book Before and After Prison: Women¿s Stories by a group of St Petersburg sociologists (woman pictured was not involved in the book) She said they were forced to boil rainwater after being left without any drinking water. According to The St Petersburg Times, the book also describes how the women are put through a series of ordeals designed to suppress their femininity. Sociologist Natalya Goncharova, a co-author of the book, said: 'There are rules in jails stipulating that if you soil your bed sheets — for example, with menstrual blood — you will be punished for it.' Galina recalled how inmates are sometimes not allowed to was or shower after having an unexpected period until the next day. The book also dispels the myth that female prisoners are softer towards each other than their male counterparts. 'If you are ill, or weak or old, they will be sure to exploit you, humiliate you, harass you, sometimes just for fun,' recalls one prisoner called Yulia. According to official statistics, Russia's total prison population this year was 714,000, with women representing 59,000 of them, or 8.3 per cent.","Female convicts tell of 'devastating lack of personal space' behind bars .

The Marchioness of Worcester has said an organic diet and complementary medicines helped her beat cancer. Speaking for the first time since she was diagnosed with breast and lymph cancer in 2009, she said an ‘alkaline diet’ free from alcohol, meat and processed food helped her through chemotherapy and radiotherapy by maintaining her strength. The Marchioness, 54, said: ‘My doctor said he had never known anyone be quite so well, I would put it down to complementary medicine and alkalining my body.’ Recovery: The Marchioness of Worcester, pictured in May last year, says that an 'alkaline diet' of organic foods has helped her beat cancer . The Marchioness was one of the stars of detective show 'C.A.T.S. Eyes' alongside Jill Gascoine and Leslie Ash in the Eighties . An alkaline diet claims to prevent cancer by making body fluids less acidic. It is commonly used as an alternative medicine though medics question its effectiveness. But the Marchioness, who was born Tracy Louise Ward and starred in the 1980s television detective series C.A.T.S. Eyes, told the Daily Telegraph she had ‘never felt better’. She recommended everyone eat organic food as it has fewer pesticides, try a vegetarian diet with more raw vegetables and take supplements such as omega 3. She said she had never spoken about her diagnosis before because it was ‘just so boring’. She added: ‘Why become obsessed by something so boring and negative when the world is such an interesting place?’ In 1987 the mother of three married the Marquis of Worcester, the eldest son of the 11th Duke of Beaufort, who owns Badminton estate. She revealed she sent her two sons and a daughter to Marlborough College – the school attended by Kate Middleton – only because she was expected to do so by her husband’s family. She said: ‘I did not want it but it was demanded in this family. ‘This country is the only country in the world where normal children are sent to boarding school, normally it is just problem children.’ Husband: The Marchioness married the Marquis of Worcester, pictured, the eldest son of the 11th Duke of Beaufort, in 1987 . She admitted she had problems at boarding school herself and was expelled several times. She said the schools were elitist and failed to teach children about the real world. The Marchioness, who is the great-granddaughter of the Earl of Dudley, said she would prefer money to be spent on state schools. She said: ‘We are enslaved to earning enough money to send people to the boarding school club. ‘It would be great to be freed from that so that everyone’s children had a good education. ‘It makes a division in society. Wouldn’t it be better if we all had the time and money to make sure everybody’s school was good?’ The Marchioness, who prefers to be known as Tracy Worcester, campaigns against factory farming and donated to the bail money for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.","The Marchioness of Worcester was diagnosed with lymph and breast cancer .

A pub landlord who went missing with a £30,000 Christmas fund has been found dead in the sea near Dover. Malcolm Levesconte, 59, was last seen at the Royal Oak pub in Shrewton, Wiltshire, on December 9. The savings club cash which more than 60 families had been paying into all year had also gone. Police launched an international man hunt after it emerged that Mr Levesconte had booked a return ferry ticket from Portsmouth to St Malo in France. But officers feared he may have jumped from the ferry as they could not confirm that he completed the journey. A body was found in the English Channel near Dover on Christmas Eve four miles from Dover. Forensic tests were carried out and it has now been confirmed as Malcolm Levesconte. His death is not being treated as suspicious and it is understood a suicide note had been found. His next of kin have been informed. Mr Levesconte had collected cash from villagers every Friday telling them he would pay the money into a bank account. Each investor would then be paid their money two weeks before Christmas to pay for presents and food. Villagers' savings: More than 60 families had spent all year paying money into the 'thrift' fund at Levesconte's Royal Oak pub in Shrewton, Wiltshire .

The Department for Energy and Climate Change, headed by Lib Dem Ed Davey, is has almost two dozen secondees from private firms working in its offices . The taxpayer is paying the wages of more than a dozen employees of energy giants to work for the government. Staff from firms including British Gas and npower have been put on the state payroll to take up jobs in Whitehall. The Department of Energy and Climate Change, headed by Lib Dem Ed Davey, admitted it has 23 employees on secondment from private sector companies, including oil giants Shell and ConocoPhillips. The government defended the use of public money to pay staff from companies regulated by the ministry, but critics said the firms would expect ‘something in return’. The pay deals were revealed in freedom of information requests made by Green MP Caroline Lucas. It also emerged civil servants from DECC had been seconded to work for private energy firms. Ms Lucas said: ‘Fossil fuel giants should have no place at the heart of government given that their current investment strategies run contrary to the need to build a low-carbon future that delivers both security and prosperity. ‘It's even more outrageous that taxpayers are footing the bill for some of these secondments, including from British Gas-owner Centrica, at a time when British Gas customers are struggling in the face of a 6% rise in their energy bills, and the company is expected to make £1.4bn profits after tax this year,’ she told The Guardian. ‘These corporations obviously don't lend out their employees without expecting something in return.’ Green MP Caroline Lucas , who obtained the data through freedom of information laws, said the private companies would want something in return . Controversially, the secondees decide for themselves whether there is a conflict of interest in their work. The contract states: ‘It is a condition of the secondment that the secondee ensures to the best of their ability that in the course of their duties for Decc there will be no conflict of interest or perception of such.’ The 23 companies with employees seconded to the Department for Energy and Climate Change are: .

Joss Garman, political director of Greenpeace, said: ‘Centrica, Shell and RWE are corporations that make their huge profits from the fossil fuels that are warming our planet. ‘Nobody will believe that these vested interests are lending staff to Decc out of charity. To the contrary, they have a clear financial interest in putting their people into key positions where they can exert a malign influence that runs counter to the public interest.’ However, DECC insisted the secondees bring with them ‘knowledge and expertise’ which are ‘vital’ to government work. ‘DECC ensures that any secondee is bound by the professional Codes of Practice relevant to their industry or services provided. ‘It is normal for secondees to be paid directly by DECC or for their company to be refunded for their time spent working in DECC; this is standard practice across Government. ‘There are contractual measures in place to make sure that any employee seconded into DECC is not placed in a position where there could be a conflict of interest.’","Firms like British Gas and npower have staff on secondment to Whitehall .

BBC veteran Michael Buerk was criticised last night for describing Tess Daly as ‘a pneumatic bird-brain from Strictly Come Dancing’. While many agreed with his view that BBC coverage of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee river pageant was ‘cringingly inept’, they said it was wrong to single out presenters rather than bosses. Others took to the internet to describe his remarks in a Mail on Sunday article – which saw him call the presenters ‘airheads’ – as cruel and accused him of being grumpy. 'Ashamed of the BBC 'Michael Buerk called presenter Tess Daly  'a pneumatic bird-brain from Strictly' In an end-of-year comment piece, the 66-year-old former newsreader argued that the spectacle of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee was ‘betrayed’ by the BBC’s dumbed-down coverage. ‘The one enduring British institution [the Monarchy] was mocked by another that had shamefully lost its way,’ he wrote. ‘On the screen, a succession of Daytime airheads preened themselves, or gossiped with even more vacuous D-list “celebrities”. With barely an exception, they were cringingly inept.’ He then focused on Miss Daly’s talent as a news presenter. He said: ‘The Dunkirk Little Ships, the most evocative reminders of this country’s bravest hour, were ignored so that a pneumatic bird-brain from Strictly Come Dancing could talk to transvestites in Battersea Park. ‘I was so ashamed of the BBC I would have wept if I hadn’t been so angry. The worst thing was that it was deliberate – planned that way to be “light” and “inclusive”.’ Some critics said while they agreed with his analysis, they objected to what they saw as a personal attack on Miss Daly. Just not good enough: Michael Buerk was highly critical of the BBC's coverage of the Diamond Jubilee - which included Tess Daly . One wrote on the BBC’s Points Of View message board: ‘I did agree ... but was mystified as to why it was mainly aimed at the indians instead of the chiefs.’ Another said while it was ‘generally agreed’ the BBC ‘failed miserably’ in the coverage, to turn it into an attack on the presenters rather than those in charge was ‘wrong’. One responded on Twitter: ‘There is no need to be cruel about Tess Daly.’ But there was a lot of support for his view that presenters such as Miss Daly and Fearne Cotton had not been right for the event. In an interview with another Sunday paper, BBC presenter Clare Balding admitted the ‘light entertainment’ feel of the River Pageant had been wrong. ‘We want to be informed and interested, we want presenters who are well-prepared and know their stuff,’  she said. ‘Yes, the BBC should entertain, but in doing so they’d moved too far from their remit to educate, too, and viewers didn’t like it.’ Miss Daly was unavailable for comment yesterday.","BBC veteran criticised for 'personal attack' on Strictly presenter Tess Daly .

The Hatfields and McCoys, America's most infamous feuding families, have had new life breathed into the bitter rivalry thanks to the discovery of one of their most legendary battle sites. An archaeological dig has shed light on the New Year's Day Massacre of 1888 which culminated with  the last in a long list of deaths on both sides and brought bloodshed to an end. Artifacts have been unearthed where the home of patriarch Randall McCoy once stood, in the rural lands of Hardy, Kentucky on the 125th anniversary of the massacre. Scroll down for video . Out for revenge: The feud between the Hatfield clan (pictured) and the McCoys raged from the end of the Civil War in 1865 for more than two decades . On New Year's Day, 1888, the Hatfield family torched McCoy's home, killing two of his children and seriously injuring his wife. The McCoys quickly retaliated with the battle of Grapevine Creek in . which several Hatfields were captured or killed. Tensions had bubbled between the two families since the end of the Civil War in the Tug River valley region, an area which separates Kentucky from West Virginia. The head of the Hatfield family was a man called William Anderson who was known as 'Devil Anse'. The McCoy clan were led by Randall McCoy. The first ever clash between the two sides can be traced to 1865. Devil Anse, who had fought for the Confederate Army joined a militia called the Logan WildCats on the return to the family homestead. Digging up the past: George Wyant and Tim Saylor from National Geographic show Diggers pinpointed the location of the McCoy house in Hardy, Kentucky when they found charred wood and a piece of stove . Fascinating: The hosts of the National Geographic show discuss their finds with historian Bill Richardson (left) and right, a bullet casing discovered at the site believed to have been fired by the feuding families . A brother of Randall McCoy, Asa, who fought for the Union was murdered on his return to Tug River - no one was ever pinned for the death but it was believed that the WildCats were behind it. More than ten years later in the late 1870s, Devil Hatfield got into a land dispute with a cousin of Randall McCoy.  Although Devil was awarded the land, bad feeling festered between the families - which was heightened by the accusation from Randall McCoy that a Hatfield cousin had stolen one of his hogs. From there, it was simply a matter of time before the simmering tensions spilled over into violence. Events were further complicated in 1880 by an almost Shakespearean event - Randall . McCoy’s daughter Roseanna fell in love with Devil Anse’s son Johnse Hatfield. Vengeance: The TV series depicting the Hatfields & McCoys with Kevin Costner playing Devil Anse Hatfield (center) Clashes: Bill Paxton stars as Randall McCoy (left) and Kevin Costner as Devil Hatfield (right) in a story that has mesmerized America for decades . The couple's decision to marry appeared to be apprehensively supported by both sides - however soon after Roseanna fell pregnant, she realized that Johnse would never marry her. She tried to returned to the McCoy family home but was refused by her father. She lived with an aunt, giving birth to a baby which died from measles aged eight months. To add to Roseanna's anguish, Johnse Hatfield married her cousin Nancy McCoy several months later. Soon after, Devil Anse Hatfield’s brother Ellison was stabbed 27 times and shot in the back by three of Randall McCoy’s sons at a party. The fleeing McCoy brothers were caught by a Hatfield gang and brought back to West Virginia. They were told by Devil Hatfield that they would live only if Ellison did, who was clinging on to life. When Ellison died, the Hatfields tied the McCoy brothers to trees and shot them. The violence reached a climax on January, 1, 1888 when the Hatfield family crossed the river to burn down Randall McCoy's home. All the Hatfields involved were sentenced to life in prison that September - and when Devil Anse Hatfield made no attempt for revenge, the sad and bitter feud was brought to a close.

But Samia, who split from ex Corrie co-star Will Thorp in Decmeber, has denied there is anything romantic going on between her and Sylvain.

"By . Tom Bower . PUBLISHED: . 19:13 EST, 19 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:37 EST, 20 June 2012 . Controversial: Brilliant historian Gitta Sereny's 1972 book tried to argue that society was to blame for Mary Bell¿s crimes. In Sereny¿s opinion, the killer was simply the victim of her childhood . Four years after 11-year-old Mary Bell was convicted of killing two small boys (aged three and four), I interviewed her mother Betty for BBC TV’s Midweek programme in a shabby hotel room in Newcastle. She had been persuaded by writer Gitta Sereny to help promote her book about the killer schoolgirl which was called The Case Of Mary Bell. In a hesitant performance, Bell’s mother admitted that, as a child, her daughter had witnessed her own sordid lifestyle, which included drug-taking. Sereny believed that those awful experiences had contributed to Mary’s pathological behaviour. Sereny, who has just died at the age of 91, was understandably pleased with her scoop. The Mary Bell story had gripped Britain in 1968. During her trial, experts testified that she had shown no remorse or anxiety and shed no tears for her crimes. Her lack of emotion and evidence of her previous violence towards babies and animals had staggered the court. It was no surprise that people wanted an explanation as to why a young girl could behave in such a depraved way. Step forward the brilliant historian Gitta Sereny, whose 1972 book tried to argue that society was to blame for Mary Bell’s crimes. In Sereny’s opinion, the killer was simply the victim of her childhood. She recounted Bell’s uncorroborated claims that she had been sexually abused by her prostitute mother and her mother’s clients. This led Sereny to contend this abuse was irrefutably the cause of Bell’s murderous behaviour. Such analysis was typical of the growing cult of victimhood, which saw criminals as prisoners of their upbringing who were therefore incapable of making moral judgments. The ‘unfortunate’ Mary Bell had become a monster because of her allegedly terrible childhood. Mary Bell, pictured, was convicted of horrific child murders. Bell's mother Betty admitted that, as a child, her daughter had witnessed her own sordid lifestyle, which included drug-taking . To blame were her teachers, the police, social workers and even her neighbours. According to Sereny, everyone bore responsibility except the killer herself. At the time, this view was embraced unquestionably by Britain’s increasingly liberal ruling elite. Sereny had managed to humanise a monster. This was helped by the confessions of Mary Bell’s mother and Sereny’s description of a rigid legal system and an uncomprehending judge who — when sentencing Bell to ‘life in detention’ — said she was ‘dangerous and remained a grave risk to other children’. Later, it was revealed Bell had been paid £50,000 for her collaboration — bringing a storm of new criticism down on Sereny’s head. Undaunted, she remained in touch with Mary Bell throughout her 12 years in prison and at the secret address where — hiding behind a new identity — the killer subsequently enjoyed her freedom. Sereny’s remarkable skills and her ‘pursuit of the truth’ led her to write several other studies of evil. These included gripping biographies of two of Hitler’s henchmen, Albert Speer and Franz Stangl. As with Mary Bell, she endeavoured to explain away their monstrous behaviour as the result of circumstances beyond their control. New theory: Albert Speer, right, was convicted at Nuremberg for war crimes. Sereny claimed in a novel that his monstrous behaviour was a result of circumstances beyond his control . Sereny’s credibility was boosted by the fact she was brought up in Vienna and her heavily accented English reminded many of Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis. In 1938, soon after Hitler’s occupation of Austria, Sereny’s family fled to Paris. Unlike most Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, she was fascinated by the perpetrators of mass murder. One intriguing aspect of Sereny was the way she denied her Jewish roots. When she returned to Europe from the U.S. after the war in 1945, she claimed she was a Catholic. She angrily denied she was Jewish — a key reason why she had been forced to leave Vienna in the first place. The truth is that on the morning of March 16, 1938 — alongside my own mother — she had been physically kicked out of Reinhardt’s school by fellow students wearing swastika armbands. Sereny was a brave woman but the denial of her Jewish past put a question mark over her illustrious career as she sought to understand the state of the minds of the murderers who persecuted her people. Similar: Sereny¿s credibility was boosted by the fact she was brought up in Vienna and her heavily accented English reminded many of Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis . Inspired by a description of Adolf Eichmann’s trial in Jerusalem in 1961, in which one of an architects of the Final Solution was described as the embodiment of ‘the banality of evil’, Sereny attended the trial in Dusseldorf of Franz Stangl, the commander of two extermination camps — Sobibor and Treblinka — where he organised the murder of 1,250,000 Jews. Like many Nazi murderers, Stangl escaped after the war to South America, where he lived until he was exposed. Extradited to Germany, he was jailed for life. Sereny persuaded him to give her a series of interviews for a biography. The fascinating result showed how an intelligent but unremarkable Austrian policeman had been inducted into the Nazi murder machine. Stangl’s inhumanity was encapsulated in his admission that he regarded the hapless people who arrived daily at the death camps by train as ‘cargo’. His horrifying insensitivity and lack of conscience was justified by a monstrous lie: ‘It was a matter of my survival. 'What I had to do to get out.’ Inspired by the trial of Nazi Adolf Eichmann, pictured, Sereny attended the trial in Dusseldorf of Franz Stangl, the commander of two extermination camps . Sereny was accused of being more sympathetic to the villain than to his victims — a criticism that would return years later with her depiction of Mary Bell. Murderers, she argued, were the products of their environment and therefore not totally responsible for their crimes. Like Mary Bell, Stangl had lacked the ‘freedom to grow: within family, within human society as a whole.’ Stangl’s father was a ‘dragoner’ —  one of the imperial elite regiments of the German army. He told Sereny: ‘Our lives were run on regimental lines. I was scared to death of him.’ To her credit, she recorded Stangl’s post-war confession: ‘Everything I did out of my own free will.’ But, then, she cast doubt on his self-awareness. She concluded that he was not a perpetrator of evil but a victim of his childhood. ‘A moral monster,’ she wrote, ‘is not born but is produced by interference with this growth.’ Both Mary Bell and Stangl were therefore victims of ‘a climate of life’. This misguided obsession with the denial of personal responsibility reached a climax in her biography — critics would say hagiography — of Hitler’s favourite architect Albert Speer. It even led to accusations that she was a Nazi sympathiser. Speer was the Nazi minister of armaments. It was he who presented the Fuhrer with a grandiose vision for rebuilding Berlin as a city befitting a conqueror’s Thousand Year Reich. He dramatically increased the manufacture of weapons. This was achieved as a result of Speer’s use of prisoners of war and 7.5 million slave labourers. Misguided: Sereny defended Hitler henchman Albert Speer. This even led to accusations that she was a Nazi sympathiser . He was also responsible for the eviction of up to 70,000 Jews from their homes in Berlin from where they were taken to ghettoes and execution camps. Prosecuted at Nuremberg with other . Nazi leaders, Speer brilliantly set himself apart by playing the . middle-class apologist who was ignorant of Hitler’s genocide plans. After . 20 years in prison, Speer produced a manuscript — Inside The Third . Reich — in which he outrageously painted himself as a conscious-stricken . bystander to Nazi crimes unaware of the Final Solution. Pandering . to that cynical distortion of the truth, Sereny gained access to him . and produced a biography sub-titled His Battle With Truth. Shockingly, she depicted the thug as ‘unique among Hitler’s men in the integrity of his battle of conscience’. Here was another killer whose crimes, for Sereny, could be explained and occasionally even excused. In her world of rampant psycho-babble, she claimed Speer’s abusive parents had prompted his search for a father figure which, in turn, fatally led him to Hitler. Portraying him as a beguiled innocent, Sereny wrote about Speer’s ‘aesthetic perception’, ‘inner awareness’ and ‘moral guilt’ but never his calculated participation in killing. In humanising monsters, Sereny was a major force in creating a very modern and corrosive ideology that architects of evil should not be punished but understood and even rewarded to help them atone for their sins. Their victims are forgotten. Worse still, we are left with a society more likely — not less — to breed such monsters in the future.","Gitta Sereny tried to claim society was to blame for child murderer Mary Bell's crimes .

"By . Beth Stebner . PUBLISHED: . 12:48 EST, 29 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:21 EST, 29 December 2012 . The New York City subway could be getting sliding doors on some platforms following another person's fatal push onto the tracks. The Metropolitan Transit Authority said yesterday that they are revisiting the possibility of installing sliding doors at some stations so it would only be possible to board the train when the screens are opened in-synch with the doors to the car. Fifty-four people died on subway tracks this year alone, the MTA said. News of the development comes as schizophrenic Andrew Goldstein, who infamously shoved Kendra Webdale onto the tracks in front of an oncoming train, said that there should be harsher regulations to prevent more senseless deaths. Scroll down for video . Options: A man was killed at the 40th St-Lowry St Station in Queens after being pushed on the tracks; the MTA could again look into installing sliding screens . Underground: The Westminster train station on London's Jubilee line is one such station that has sliding doors installed . Speaking exclusively to the New York Post, Goldstein said that Kendra’s Law, the act that was passed following her murder in 1999, needs to be stricter. ‘Should you let a mental patient like myself be in freedom so an incident like train-pushing can occur?’ he asked from the Sullivan Correctional Institute in Fallsburg, New York. ‘If you are a harm to anyone, even yourself, you should be hospitalized.’ Kendra’s Law states that people in New York state who have certain mental illnesses must undergo regular psychiatric treatment. The law does not go as far as to force patients to take medications against their will. Goldstein, however, is now on medication and is lucid. In 2006, he was sentenced to 23 years for shoving Ms Webdale into an oncoming N train at 23rd St. Help: Andrew Goldstein, pictured in 1999, confessed to shoving 32-year-old Kendra Webdale to her death under a Manhattan subway train; he says there needs to be stricter laws . The Post notes that while Kendra’s Law exists to protect the mentally ill from hurting themselves and others, it must be renewed every five years. In addition, there are certain loopholes allowing mentally ill New Yorkers to remain out on the streets. Horrific: Kendra Webdale was pushed to her death under a subway train as it pulled into a midtown Manhattan station on January 3, 1999 . In light of the string of recent subway deaths, MTA executive director Thomas Prendergast said yesterday that ‘we’ll have to revisit’ installing sliding doors in some subway stations. The development was exclusively reported by the  New York Daily News. There have been talks of installing barriers throughout the years, but each time, the plans have been abandoned for one reason or another, the main reason being the overwhelming cost . According to the Daily News, it could cost as much as $1.5million to install sliding doors on each of the subway’s 468 station platforms. Neither the 7 line extension nor the Second Ave. subway lines, which are both currently under construction, will get the new technology, an MTA official told the News, saying the construction was ‘cost-prohibitive.’ Mr Prendergast said in March that it was feasible, saying that hundred-year-old subway lines in London and Paris have been modified and modernized to meet safety concerns. That press conference came after 20-year-old college student Joshua Basin was pushed onto the tracks by a homeless man. The technology already exists at New York’s AirTrain system, which transports people between terminals at JFK International Airport. In addition, gates have been installed in many Asian and European cities to prevent these sorts of tragedies from happening. The latest victim of subway shoving was Sunando Sen, 46, a native of Calcutta, India, who was pushed into the path of an approaching 7 train in Queens by a muttering woman who then fled the 40th street station. His death marked the second fatal push this month. Safety: The Paris Metro has installed similar security measures on some of its lines . Mind the gap: In Taipei, sliding doors ensure that no passengers fall onto the tracks . New York city Police commissioner Ray Kelly said that Sen was looking westbound as the train was pulling into the station and likely didn't see the woman leaping from a bench and shoving him at the last moment. The New York Daily News reported that Sen had been in the U.S. for the past 20 years and lived in Queens in an apartment with at least two roommates. 'I think she's crazy,' Sen's shocked roommate Ar Suman, told the New York Post. 'I can't believe this right now.' Mr Suman said that the 46-year-old, who . was single and childless, had just opened a copy shop, the New Amsterdam . Printing Co, with another man on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. 'My heart is broken because this guy was so nice and quiet,' added Sen’s other roommate, Md Khan. On Friday, Sen's business partner was trying to reach the victim's relatives in . India to deliver them the bad news. The suspect was arrested Saturday afternoon along Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn, the New York Post reported. According to the commissioner, . officers were able to identify Sen using his wallet and laptop that were . recovered at the scene. Innocent: Sunando Sen, 46, a native of Calcutta, India, left, was shoved onto the subway tracks in front of an oncoming train earlier this week by an unidentified Hispanic woman in her 20s, right . Crime scene: The man was struck by the train and killed at the 40th Street station near Queens Boulevard in Sunnyside, pictured . On the run: The unidentified woman, captured on surveillance video fleeing the scene, was reportedly muttering to herself . New York Police Department chief . spokesman Paul Browne said the woman fled the scene after the shocking attack and officers were searching for her. She . was described as Hispanic, in her 20s, heavyset and about 5-foot-5, . wearing a blue, white and gray ski jacket and Nike sneakers with gray on . top and red on the bottom. The man was hit by the first car of an 11-car northbound train and got stuck under the wheels of the second car, Browne said. According to witnesses, at around 8pm a woman was seen pacing and muttering to herself. She then sat down on a wooden bench at the end of the platform, where she waited until the last possible moment before pushing a man in front of the approaching train. The NYPD chief added that the victim, who was . pronounced dead at the scene, had 'terrible injuries that make providing . a description difficult at this time.' Daily grind: Commuters wait on the platform as a train passes through the 40th St-Lowry St Station, where a man was killed after being pushed onto the subway tracks . Shocking: Sen was standing on the elevated platform of a 7 train in Queens at about 8pm when he was shoved on the tracks . Browne said there was 'no trend' of . such horrific occurrences despite the incident being the second of its . type in the space of a month. 'It's the urban nightmare,' he told Bloomberg. 'It's sometimes in the back of peoples' minds because of the incident preceding this one, but there's no indication that it is related in any way or inspired it,' he said. During his weekly radio address Friday morning, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said that while such attacks were extremely rare, he understood how statistics did not diminish the tragedy for the families of the victims the New York Times reported. 'To say it’s only two in a long period of time doesn’t help either person,' he said. 'I don’t know what happened here.' Police viewed footage from a 24-hour surveillance camera outside a pizza restaurant located across from the station and were able to obtain clear images of the suspect, according to The New York Times. 'She jumps from the stairs and she just runs,' Oasis Restaurant owner, Giovanni Briones, told the newspaper, describing the video he provided detectives. He said he did not recognise the woman but that a restaurant regular was on the train and said they felt a bump as it ran over the man. On December 3, 58-year-old Ki-Suck Han was shoved in front of a train in Times Square. A photograph of him on the tracks a . split second before he was killed was published on the front of the New . York Post the next day, causing an uproar and debate over whether the . photographer, who had been waiting for a train, should have tried to . help him and whether the newspaper should have run the image. Apparently . no one else tried to help up Han, either. Charged: Homeless man, 30-year-old Naeem Davis, pictured, was charged with murder after pushing a man under a train on December 3 . Dead: Ki-Suck Han, pictured, was shoved in front of a train in Times Square . A homeless man, 30-year-old Naeem Davis, was charged with murder in Han's death and is being held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty, claiming Han was the aggressor and had attacked him first. The two men hadn't met before. Service was suspended tonight on the 7 train line, which connects Manhattan and Queens, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has been using buses to shuttle riders while police investigate. Being pushed onto the train tracks is a silent fear for many of the commuters who ride the city's subway a total of more than 5.2 million times on an average weekday, but deaths are rare. Among the more high-profile cases was the January 1999 death of aspiring screenwriter Kendra Webdale, who was shoved by a former mental patient. After that, the state Legislature passed Kendra's Law, which lets mental health authorities supervise patients who live outside institutions to make sure they are taking their medications and aren't threats to safety. On Friday, Mayor Bloomberg said that had some concerns about the state releasing mentally ill people from custody.

The Prime Minister led tributes to the ‘Fleet Street legend’ Lord Rees-Mogg who died over the weekend at the age of 84. As editor of The Times for 14 years, he was credited with forging its reputation for investigative journalism and cutting-edge commentary. Among his most influential articles were a piece in 1963 headlined ‘A Captain’s Innings’ calling for Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home to resign, which he did shortly afterwards, and the editorial ‘Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?’, soon after becoming editor in 1967, criticising a jail term handed to Mick Jagger for drugs offences. 'Fleet Street legend': Former editor for The Times Llord Rees-Mogg died over the weekend aged 84 . He left the paper in 1981 and later served as chairman of the Arts Council, vice-chairman of the BBC and most recently a columnist for the Mail on Sunday newspaper for nearly a decade. He was made a life peer in 1988. Educated at Charterhouse public school and Balliol College, Oxford, he started out as a leader writer on the Financial Times in the early 1950s. After twice running unsuccessfully as an MP he worked as a speechwriter for Anthony Eden, before moving to the Sunday Times where he worked his way up to Deputy Editor before being offered the top job at the Times. Tribute: David Cameron said Lord Rees-Mogg edited The Times 'through a tumultuous period with flair and integrity' His tenure was sometimes controversial, particularly his support for US President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. He resigned from the paper after initially backing his staff who opposed Rupert Murdoch’s bid to buy the newspaper, then changing his mind. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was a cheerleader for the monetarist policies of Margaret Thatcher - his friend since university. But he was a vocal critic of John Major, trying unsuccessfully to challenge his Maastricht laws on legal grounds, and then described him in The Times as ‘over-promoted, unfit to govern and lacking self-confidence.’ David Cameron yesterday paid tribute to him saying: ‘William Rees-Mogg is rightly a Fleet Street legend - editing The Times through a tumultuous period with flair and integrity. ‘I always found him full of wisdom and good advice - particularly when I first became Leader of the Opposition. My thoughts are with his wife and five children at this sad time.’ His son Jacob, Tory MP for North-East Somerset, said his father had discovered only in the past few couple of weeks that he was suffering from inoperable oesophageal cancer and that he died ‘very peacefully’. His wife Gillian and their two sons and three daughters and grand-children had been at his bedside during his final days. He said his father’s ‘reputation as a wordsmith who could produce long and elegant articles was unsurpassed’, but added that he always made time for his family. ‘I had the greatest father anyone could ever want, who always encouraged his children in the different things that they did’, he said. Lord Rees-Mogg (right) is pictured with Rupert Murdoch (centre) and Sunday Times editor Harold Evans following the announcement that . Mr Murdoch was to buy The Times . Lord Rees-Mogg's son, Jacob, said his father had 'this fascinating position in British public life for the last 60 years' ‘He had the most extraordinary knowledge of almost every subject you could ever ask him about, and had this fascinating position in British public life for the last 60 years. ‘He interviewed the leader of the opposition only six weeks ago.

Dozens of elephants have died in India in recent years after being struck while crossing railway tracks that often run through national parks and forests.

Emma Mitchell – who lives in Scotland – and her London-based brother Nick Talbot both have cystic fibrosis. A breakthrough drug called Kalydeco has been approved for hundreds of patients in England and Wales. From today, Nick, left, will be able to take the medicine which has been hailed the biggest breakthrough in CF treatments in years, but Emma, right, has to wait . Mrs Mitchell, a maths teacher, and her brother both suffer from the hereditary illness, which leads to lung infections and early death . From today, Nick, 36, will be able to take the medicine hailed as the biggest breakthrough in cystic fibrosis in years. But Scotland’s drug rationing body, the Scottish Medicines Consortium, has yet to approve it, leaving Mrs Mitchell, 35, without access to the ‘wonder drug’. The drug costs £182,000 a year for each patient. It is estimated around 80 Scottish patients would benefit from its use. Mrs Mitchell, a maths teacher, and her brother both suffer from the hereditary illness, which leads to lung infections and early death. Cystic fibrosis is an hereditary condition that damages the lungs and affects around 9,000 people throughout the UK . It affects around 9,000 people UK-wide, and costs the NHS millions in hospital care. The new drug has brought hope for the one in 20 who suffer from a particular strain known as the Celtic form. But Mrs Mitchell must wait until January 14 to find out if the  country’s drugs chiefs will allow her access to the medicine set to  transform life for her brother. Mrs Mitchell has refused to let illness slow her down. She said: ‘I have worked hard to become a maths teacher and endured countless chest infections. 'I have even gone into work with intravenous drips hidden under my clothes so that pupils got every hour of teaching they needed. She added: ‘All I ask is that I get an equal opportunity to live and not have my life shortened by being denied access to the drug our Nick is getting.’ Mr Talbot, director of global development for the Royal  Institute of Chartered Surveyors, hopes the medication can help him fulfil lifelong ambitions. He is a gifted mountaineer who has scaled several peaks, despite his condition, which leaves him struggling with thin air at altitude. The drug could help him reach his dream of climbing Mount Everest. He said: ‘It is heartbreaking that Emma is still waiting to know if she will get it.'","Emma Mitchell lives in Scotland and will not get breakthrough cystic fibrosis drug .

Report: Prescribing generic alternatives to expensive branded drugs could save the NHS billions, a new study claims . Doctors could save the NHS billions of pounds a year by ditching expensive branded drugs in favour of prescribing cheaper, equally-effective alternatives, new research has found. More than £200 million was unnecessarily spent on two types of costly statin drugs alone in the last year, despite doctors usually being advised to prescribe better value options, the study said. The wider issue of inefficient spending on prescriptions where far cheaper generic equivalents exist is estimated to cost the NHS £1billion a year, data company Mastodon C said. Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of the NHS Commissioning Board, which backed the research, said it will help to 'focus minds' on reducing costs. He said: 'Variation in prescribing habits costs the NHS millions of pounds a year. 'Transparent sharing of information will help clinicians understand whether they are over or under prescribing. 'This will focus minds in a way that will not only improve the quality of treatment for patients but also reduce cost and free up money for re-investment in other parts of the NHS.' Mastodon C, based at The Open Data Institute, spent eight weeks working with publicly available data looking at the NHS prescribing patterns in GP practices, Clinical Commissioning Groups, and Primary Care Trusts. The cost of an individual prescription item can vary from 81p for a generic drug, to over £20 for drugs still under licence to the pharmaceutical companies that develop them. Francine Bennett, who carried out the data analysis said: 'We've suspected for some time that there were potential savings to be gained by looking at prescribing practices across the NHS but I wasn't prepared for the extent of the potential savings we've seen in just this analysis. 'What's important now is to work with the NHS and healthcare professionals to provide the data and analysis which can realise this potential.'

The traditional phone call on the stroke of midnight is a New Year's tradition as entrenched as Auld Lang Syne. But now it seems Britons text their Happy New Year wishes hours ahead of midnight, research has shown. In 2011 traffic peaked at 7.02pm and analysts expect the same trend this year. Almost four times as many texts as calls were sent on 31st December last year, the research by Tesco Mobile found. New tradition: Most people will text their loved ones around five hours before midnight on New Year's Eve . This is thanks in part to the trend of 'broadcast text messaging' – sending the same text to your whole address book to spread the love at the touch of a screen. With the recession rumbling on people are staying at home to save money, the researchers found. As a result they're not staying up so late, so the calls and texts are getting earlier and earlier. Fear of forgetting to call at midnight and concerns over whether loved ones will already be in bed at 12am also played a part in the trend for getting well wishing done by early and by text. The person we are most likely to call hasn't changed. When it comes to that one person we must wish a Happy New Year, eight in ten of those surveyed said when it came to New Year well wishing, it was their mum they called, with dad following in second place. Simon Groves, Chief Marketing Officer, Tesco Mobile said: 'It seems our customers are doing away with the traditional midnight call and are instead texting their Happy New Year messages earlier. 'We have seen this pattern form over the last few years – no doubt in part to the recession meaning festivities have become more low key affairs at home, so revellers are likely to be hitting the sack earlier.'

A Freedom of Information request found that 850 staff have been given a total of £11 million to cover the costs of moving, as well as one-off payouts worth 10 per cent of their salary, to encourage them to move north from London.

BBC Breakfast presenters Susanna Reid and Bill Turnbull are among those taking the incentives. Angie Bray, a Conservative member of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said: 'I can’t help feeling that Salford is an expensive box- ticking exercise. 'I absolutely understand that the BBC feels the need to demonstrate that they are not entirely London-centric but the fact is the programming from Salford is not as good and it is costing an awful lot of money.'

Novelist Will Self has blasted Britain's pre-occupation with gourmet cuisine, celebrity chefs and TV food programmes. Self, author of novels such as The Book of Dave and How the Dead Live, wrote his withering assessment of Britain's love of shows like Come Dine With Me and Great British Bake-off in a blog on the BBC website called The British Vomitorium. He said: 'It is, surely, undeniable that in the past 30 years we have, as a nation, been transformed from a culinary backwater - a stagnant reach in which floated the occasional soggy meat pie or waterlogged cabbage - into a foodie's paradise. 'What I think we should all do is throw up our very obsession with food itself, and enter the new year purged and able to forge a new relationship with whatever we happen to find on our plates. 'Once upon a time our High Streets were perhaps home to a chippie, a Chinese and an Indian. 'But now, even the most desultory and cloned shopping zone in the most provincial of towns will boast five, 10 or 15 eateries, all jostling for business with their exotic offerings.' However, Self says it is people's desire to be seen as middle class that drives their culinary endeavours.

Dogan Ismail, 17, pictured, died outside a block of flats on the Aylesbury Estate, in Walworth, south east London . Detectives wantl to trace a 15-year-old boy in connection with the murder of a teenager who was stabbed to death in the street. Sixth form student Dogan Ismail, 17, bled to death in front of his older brother after he was stabbed following 'an altercation' outside a block of flats on the Aylesbury Estate, in Walworth, south east London, yesterday. Police have now taken the unusual step of naming a youth wanted for questioning in connection with Mr Ismail's death. Dawda Jallow, 15, from the Peckham area, is described as black, clean shaven with cropped black afro hair, 5ft 5in tall and of slight build. He has brown eyes and speaks with a London accent, although he is a Gambian national. Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner of the Homicide and Serious Crime Command, leading the investigation, said: 'I am seeking help from the local community to locate Dawda Jallow. 'I appeal to anyone who knows of his whereabouts, or has any information that could assist us, to come forward. 'If Dawda is seen, please do not approach him but contact police. 'I appeal direct to Dawda to present himself at a police station so this matter can be dealt with.' Dogan was attacked after he and his brother encountered a group of four males, Scotland Yard said. The Metropolitan Police and London Ambulance Service were called to Latimer House, Beaconsfield Road, at 4.20pm, where the victim, from Peckham, south-east London, was subsequently pronounced dead. A post-mortem examination was taking place at Greenwich Mortuary. Mr Bonner added: 'My thoughts go out to Dogan's family, who have been left devastated by his senseless killing. Flowers from the murder of Shaun Chambers, 21, which took place in September are still visible next to the more recent crime scene, which police have said is not related . 'That it should happen at this time of year is all the more tragic. I would like to urge anyone with information about this incident to come forward and speak with my officers or, if they would prefer to remain anonymous, Crimestoppers.' The murder scene is yards from where 21-year-old Shaun Chambers died on September 26 after being stabbed in an apparent gang-related killing. Mr Chambers, 21, from Greenwich, was stabbed in the heart. However Mr Bonner said there was 'no evidence' to suggest Dogan's death was gang related. He said: 'I know there will also be local speculation about the fact that this murder took place on the same spot that Shaun Chambers was killed on 26 September, but I would like to make clear that there is no link between the incidents aside from the location.' Dogan is the eighth teenager to be murdered in London in 2012. Neighbours in the area have said they are living in fear following the second incident in a matter of months . A 16-year-old girl who lives near the scene said: 'I heard someone was trying to take his mobile phone and he ran up the stairs and that's when he was stabbed. 'His older brother who is about 20 was with him and saw it happen. I came outside and could see he had been stabbed in the chest. 'His brother was on the phone to his mum, just screaming what had happened. I don't think she believed him at first. He was saying ""mum, Dogan's been stabbed"".' Dogan, who is believed to have studied at the Walworth Academy, is of Turkish origin and lived in nearby Peckham. And residents on the estate today said they were living in fear following the second such incident on their doorstep in the space of a few months. A mum-of-two, who did not want to be identified, said: 'This is a very bad estate. It's so dangerous. I want to move, but I have to wait for the council to move me because I am poor.' A forensic tent was still up at the scene and the stairwell remained cordoned off on one side as police stood guard at the scene. Two people have been arrested in connection with Dogan's death. Another 15-year-old boy has been arrested on . suspicion of murder and a 39-year-old woman on suspicion of perverting . the course of justice. Anybody with information should call the incident room on 020 8358 0200 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Outgoing North Carolina Governor Beverly Perdue has pardoned the Wilmington 10, a group wrongly convicted 40 years ago of firebombing a local grocery store after police shot a black teenager. Nine black men and one white woman were given prison sentences totaling nearly 300 years in the notorious Civil Rights-era prosecution that led to accusations that the state was holding political prisoners. Perdue issued pardons of innocence today, which means the state no longer considers the 10 - four of whom have since died - guilty of a crime. Wrongly convicted: The Wilmington 10, pictured in Raleigh in 1976, were given prison sentences totaling nearly 300 years in the notorious Civil Rights-era prosecution that led to accusations that the state was holding political prisoners . 'I have decided to grant these pardons because the more facts I have learned about the Wilmington 10, the more appalled I have become about the manner in which their convictions were obtained,' Perdue said in a news release. The three key witnesses in the case later recanted their testimony in the 1971 firebombing. Amnesty International and other groups took up the issue, portraying the Wilmington 10 as political prisoners. In 1978, then-Gov. Jim Hunt commuted their sentences but withheld a pardon. Two years later, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., threw out the convictions, saying perjury and prosecutorial misconduct were factors in the verdicts. 'We are tremendously grateful to Gov. Perdue for her courage,' said Benjamin Chavis, the former national . NAACP executive director who was in jail and prison for about five years . before his release. 'This . is a historic day for North Carolina and the United States. People . should be innocent until proven guilty, not persecuted for standing up . for equal rights and justice.' Pardoned: Outgoing North Carolina Gov. Beverly Perdue signs pardons on Monday to the Wilmington 10, a group wrongly convicted of firebombing a grocery store 40 years ago . In addition to Chavis, the surviving members of the Wilmington 10 are Reginald Epps, James McKoy, Wayne Moor, Marvin Patrick and Willie Earl Vereen. Those who have died are Jerry Jacobs, Ann Shepard, Connie Tindall and Joe Wright. Wright was the youngest, arrested when he was 16 years old. The Wilmington 10 were convicted in . October 1972 on charges of conspiracy to firebomb Mike's Grocery and . conspiracy to assault emergency personnel who responded to the fire in . February 1971. The . trial was held in Burgaw in Pender County after a judge declared a . mistrial the first time. A jury of 10 blacks and two whites had been . seated in the first trial when prosecutor Jay Stroud said he was sick, . and the judge declared the mistrial. At the second trial, a jury of 10 . whites and two blacks was seated. The . three key witnesses who took the stand for the prosecution recanted . their testimony in 1976. And the prosecutor, Stroud, became a flashpoint . for the Wilmington 10 supporters. Survivors: Connie Tindall, a member of the Wilmington 10, speaks at a news conference outside the State Capitol building in Raleigh in which the group called on Gov. Beverly Perdue to pardon them, in May . In November, NAACP state leaders said they believe newly uncovered notes show Stroud tried to keep blacks off the first jury and seat whites he thought were sympathetic to the Ku Klux Klan. They showed the notes on a poster board, saying the handwriting on the legal paper appeared to match notes from other prosecution records in the case. At the top of the list of 100 jurors, the notes said, 'stay away from black men.' A capital 'B' was beside the names of black jurors. The notes identify one potential black juror as an 'Uncle Tom type,' and beside the names of several white people, notations include 'KKK?' and 'good!!' Stroud told the StarNews of Wilmington that he wrote the notes but declined to confirm that to the AP.'This conduct is disgraceful,' Perdue said of the notes. 'It is utterly incompatible with basic notions of fairness and with every ideal that North Carolina holds dear. The legitimacy of our criminal justice system hinges on it operating in a fair and equitable manner with justice being dispensed based on innocence or guilt - not based on race or other forms of prejudice.'","Outgoing North Carolina Governor Beverly Perdue pardoned the group today, though four have already died .

'He . managed to restrain himself in the beginning — just. But as the . marriage progressed, he got worse and kept winding up her family.' Another added: 'After the lust wore off, reality hit home about their differences and she was left thinking, 'What have I done?' Other rumours say the split was because Katy couldn’t keep up with . Russell’s appetite in the bedroom, and he disapproval of her party . lifestyle.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:54 EST, 2 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:53 EST, 2 January 2013 . Gov. Tom Corbett said Tuesday he plans to sue the NCAA in federal court over stiff sanctions imposed against Penn State University in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal. The Republican governor scheduled a Wednesday news conference on the Penn State campus in State College to announce the filing in U.S. District Court in Harrisburg. A person associated with the university and knowledgeable about the matter, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the lawsuit had not been filed, told The Associated Press that it is an antitrust action. Scroll down for video . Gov. Tom Corbett (Pennsylvania) said Tuesday he plans to sue the NCAA in federal court over stiff sanctions imposed against Penn State University in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal . Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, pictured in October, was found guilty on multiple cases of child abuse; he still maintains his innocence . The NCAA sanctions, which were agreed to by the university in July, included a $60 million fine that would be used nationally to finance child abuse prevention grants. The sanctions also included a four-year bowl game ban for the university's marquee football program, reduced football scholarships and the forfeiture of 112 wins but didn't include a suspension of the football program, the so-called death penalty. The governor's office announced the news conference late Tuesday afternoon. His spokesman did not respond to repeated calls and emails seeking to confirm a Sports Illustrated story that cited anonymous sources saying a lawsuit was imminent. Corbett's brief statement did not indicate whether his office coordinated its legal strategy with state Attorney General-elect Kathleen Kane, who is scheduled to be sworn in January 15. Kane, a Democrat, ran on a vow to investigate why it took state prosecutors nearly three years to charge Sandusky, an assistant under former football coach Joe Paterno. Penn State coach Joe Paterno pictured in 2009; he died in January of 2012 . The famed statue of former head coach Paterno was removed from outside the Penn State stadium, eliminating a key piece of the iconography surrounding the once-sainted football coach accused of burying child sex abuse allegations . Corbett was the attorney general when that office took over the case in early 2009 and until he became governor in January 2011. State and congressional lawmakers from Pennsylvania have objected to using the Penn State fine to finance activities in other states. Penn State has already made the first $12million payment, and an NCAA task force is deciding how it should be spent. The NCAA, which declined to comment Tuesday on the planned lawsuit, has said at least a quarter of the money would be spent in Pennsylvania. The sanctions include a four-year bowl game ban for the university's football program, reduced football scholarships and the forfeiture of 112 wins but didn't include a suspension of the football program, the so-called death penalty . Republican U.S. Rep. Charlie Dent called that an 'unacceptable and unsatisfactory' response by the NCAA to a request from the state's U.S. House delegation that the whole $60 million be distributed to causes within the state. Last week, state Sen. Jake Corman, a Republican whose district includes Penn State's main campus, said he plans to seek court action barring any of the first $12 million from being released to groups outside the state. Sandusky, 68, was convicted in June on charges he sexually abused 10 boys, some on Penn State's campus. He's serving a 30- to 60-year state prison term. Eight young men testified against him, describing a range of abuse they said went from grooming and manipulation to fondling, oral sex and anal rape when they were boys. Sandusky did not testify at his trial but has maintained his innocence, acknowledging he showered with boys but insisting he never molested them.","Republican Gov.

Russian President Vladimir Putin says he will sign a controversial bill banning Americans from adopting Russian children. Mr Putin told a televised meeting in .

UNICEF estimates that there are about 740,000 children not living with parents in Russia and only 18,000 Russians are now waiting to adopt a child.

Arise Sir Wiggo: Bradley Wiggins, Britain's first Tour de France champion, has been given a knighthood in the New Year's honours list . Britain's Olympic heroes have been rewarded for  their success with a record number of gongs in the New Year honours list. The athletes, coaches and organisers who brought delight to the nation this summer dominate the list like no other group before them. A staggering 127 awards have been handed out to those involved – more than 10 per cent of the total. The figure is unprecedented in the 122-year history of the list. Among the 78 athletes and coaches honoured were cyclist Bradley Wiggins and sailor Ben Ainslie, who both received knighthoods. Sir Bradley, as he will be known, made sporting history this year by becoming the first Briton to win the Tour de France, and followed the feat by scooping an Olympic gold, as well as being crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year. He heads a sparkling list of sporting heroes, including Paralympic cyclist Sarah Storey, who was made a dame, and Jessica Ennis, Victoria Pendleton, Mo Farah and David Weir, who all received CBEs. Wiggins, affectionately known as Wiggo, said: ‘It’s quite something really. I never imagined that I would ever become a knight, so it’s an incredible honour, but there’s a slight element of disbelief, and it will take a while  to sink in. There was never any doubt whether I’d accept it or not, it was more a case that I never saw myself as a Sir, and I probably never will.’ The honours crown a year of excellence in British sport – so much so that a special honours list was added to recognise the 65 medals, 29 of them gold, won at this year’s Olympic Games, as well as the 120 medals – including 34 golds – won at the Paralympic Games. There was also recognition for those behind the Games. Lord Coe, who headed London’s bid team, becomes a Companion of Honour, while Jean Tomlin, who led the Games Maker programme for volunteers to help the event run smoothly, gets an OBE. Scroll down for video . Knight of the road: Wiggins followed his Tour de France triumph with an Olympic gold and was also named BBC Sports Personality of the Year . King Cool: Bradley Wiggins, pictured right in Manchester on Thursday night, said: 'It’s quite something really. I never imagined that I would ever become a knight' But eyebrows were raised that Mo Farah received only a CBE for his historic double track triumph in the 5000m and 10000m. In 2005, Kelly Holmes was made a dame for winning both the 400m and 800m at the 2004 Athens Olympics. Heptathlete gold medallist and London 2012 poster girl  Jessica Ennis will also have to be content with a CBE. Andy Murray, who won Olympic tennis gold before becoming Britain’s first men’s Grand Slam champion for 76 years, can perhaps count himself unlucky to receive just an OBE. It was also noted that while Sarah Storey was made a dame after her four golds at 2012, her Paralympic teammate, wheelchair athlete David Weir, who also got four golds, was made merely a CBE. There was no mention of Danny Boyle, creator of the epic Olympics opening ceremony, who reportedly turned down a knighthood, or Stephen Daldry, who staged the closing party. Champion: Ben Ainslie, who won four successive Olympic sailing golds, has received a knighthood in the list . Supreme: Sarah Storey is the UK's most successful ever Paralympian and is to be made a dame . There was also nothing for cyclist Chris Hoy, who with six gold medals became Britain’s most successful ever Olympian during the Games, because he had already been knighted after his heroics at the previous Olympics in Beijing. In 2008, when Britain came fourth in the Olympics’ medal table at Beijing, 54 honours were awarded in the New Year honours list. Storey, 35, who now has 11 Paralympic gold medals in total and is pregnant with her first child, said: ‘I can’t believe the number of times we’ve said this year, “Oh, can 2012 possibly get any better?” We feel so fortunate that 2012 will always stand out as being the most incredible year. ‘2012 has been quite amazing. I am still pinching myself, literally.’ Nation's favourite: Jessica Ennis, who was the face of the Olympics for home fans, received CBEs after her heptathlon triumph in London . Inspiring: Jessica Ennis was the London 2012 poster girl and finished closely behind Bradley Wiggins in the running to be BBC Sports Personality of the Year . Besides Wiggins and Ainslie, the most decorated sailor in Olympic history with four gold medals at four consecutive Games, knighthoods also go to Dave Brailsford and David Tanner, performance directors at British Cycling and British Rowing. Ainslie said: ‘This is an incredible honour. When I set out Olympic sailing 20 years ago, I never would have dreamt this would happen.’ CBEs also went to rower Katherine Grainger and cyclist Victoria Pendleton. Lady in red: Jessica Ennis attends the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards in London . OBEs go to equestrians Sophie Christiansen and Charlotte Dujardin, Paralympic swimmer Ellie Simmonds and cycling couple Laura Trott and Jason Kenny. Among those to get MBEs are boxer Nicola Adams; canoeist Timothy Baillie; equestrians Laura Bechtolsheimer and Carl Hester; rowers Katherine Copeland and Helen Glover; wheelchair racer ‘Hurricane’ Hannah Cockcroft; and Paralympic swimmer Josef Craig. Triathlon gold medallist Alistair Brownlee gets an MBE but brother Jonathan, who took bronze, misses out, while the MBE also goes to Welsh taekwondo gold medallist Jade Jones, Paralympic blade runner Jonnie Peacock, long jump hero Greg Rutherford and silver medal gymnast turned Strictly Come Dancing star Louis Smith. ‘To receive this honour is out of this world and something I never would have dreamt of as I grew up in the sport of gymnastics,’ said Smith, 23. ‘This year has been like no other for so many reasons. ‘For me it’s obviously one I’ll never forget and I wasn’t sure it could get any better, but to be awarded an MBE is the icing on the cake and without a doubt the proudest moment of my life. ‘I just hope this acts as even more inspiration for future generations within sport in this country, further continuing the Olympic legacy.’ Swimmer Simmonds, 18, who won two more golds at London 2012 making her a four-time Paralympic champion, said: ‘It’s been a great honour to be included in the list which caps an amazing year for me personally and for British sport.’ The honours also recognise those who contributed to London 2012 in a ‘non-sporting capacity’, with 49 ‘back-room’ staff from Paul Deighton, who was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, down to a MBE for volunteer Muhammed Khan. Away from sport, the Companion of Honour goes to Professor Peter Higgs, namesake of the Higgs boson or so-called ‘God particle’, which was finally proved to exist in July, 48 years after he first proposed it. No Sir Mo: Mo Farah's gold medal-winning triumphs provided fans with two of the London Olympics greatest moments . Lightning: Mo Farah missed out on a knighthood but has been awarded a CBE . Recognition: Cyclist Victoria Pendleton, who appeared on this year's Strictly Come Dancing, has been awarded a CBE . Recognised with an MBE in the Diplomatic and Overseas list was also Captain Raymond ‘Jerry’ Roberts, 92, one of the four founder members of Bletchley Park’s Testery section, tasked with breaking the German top-level code during the Second World War. An MBE also goes to Penelope Clough, 53, who set up the Justice For Jane Campaign with husband John after her daughter was murdered by her ex-partner in 2010 while he was on bail. Sport makes up about 10 per cent of this year’s awards, education 10 per cent, health 7 per cent, and industry and the economy make up 12 per cent. A Cabinet Office spokesman said an unprecedented number of people from the sporting world had received honours. He said: ‘As we’ve seen with the special list for Olympians and Paralympians, there is a desire to continue to expand the honours system and make sure we’re extending the reach.’ Northern star: Tennis champion Andy Murray enjoyed his most successful ever year as a tennis player winning both Olympic gold and the U.S. Open .

Speaking to Mail Online from her home . in New York Mrs Elizabeth Valle, 57, was adamant that her son is . innocent and that he will be publicly exonerated. She said: ‘My son is not what they are saying he is. He’s been made out to be a monster. My son is not a monster’. Standing by him: Elizabeth Valle, pictured with her son Gilberto, has defended him against allegations that he planned to kidnap, rape and cook at least 100 women . Not the 'thing' that he has been depicted as: Valle is being held without bail but his mother insists his trial will prove him innocent . Looking tired and anxious Mrs Valle admitted: ‘It is a difficult time but we’re holding up okay. ‘It gives me great strength knowing that when the truth comes out my son will be okay.’ Mrs Valle said that she has been advised by her son’s attorney not to discuss any details of the case which goes to trial on 22 January. But she reiterated that when it does, ‘the truth will show what he really is and it’s not this… thing, people are saying’. ‘My son will be fine,’ she said. ‘That’s all I can say right now’. It is not clear whether Mrs Valle has had any contact with her daughter-in-law, Kathleen, 28. It was Kathleen Cooke Mangan who tipped off police when she found sick internet messages detailing Valle’s plans to abduct, rape, cook and consume 100 female victims. Valle plead not guilty to all charges including illegally accessing the National Criminal Database to search out potential victims. He has been held without bail and if convicted faces life imprisonment. In a particularly chilling section of the internet transcripts read out in Manhattan Federal Court during his bail hearing on Tuesday, Valle shared his hunger for ‘girl meat’ this Thanksgiving in an email exchange with a co-conspirator who has so far remained un-named. Gilberto and his estranged wife Kathleen Cooke Mangan, 28. It was Kathleen's discoveries on Valle's computer that led FBI agents to her husband . Files found on Valle’s computer included one titled: ‘Abducting and Cooking Victim I: A Blueprint’. It listed materials required including chloroform and rope as well as chronicling the practicalities of fitting a victim into an oven – her legs, he noted, would have to be bent. Valle also expressed a desire to cook one particular victim slowly – ‘tying her onto some form of apparatus’ and trying to ‘keep her alive as long as possible’. His defence maintain these were nothing but fantasies and have pointed out that no women were hurt though among his ‘victims’ Valle named women whom the FBI have established did indeed know Valle.

A New York police officer who allegedly plotted to kidnap up to 100 women before raping, killing, cooking and eating them has been charged. Gilberto Valle, a married six-year veteran of the department who lives in a middle-class Queens neighborhood, even allegedly used  law enforcement databases to conduct surveillance on up to 100 potential victims before keeping scores of files on them listing their personal information. The 28-year-old, who works in Harlem, has been arrested by the FBI for the heinous plans after his estranged wife reportedly tipped off police. Valle was arraigned Thursday afternoon and was held without bail on charges including kidnapping conspiracy and unauthorized use of law enforcement records. If convicted, he could face life in prison. Scroll down for video . Not guilty: Gilberto Valle, 28, is seen in this courtroom sketch with his public defender Julia Gatto, center, when he pleaded not guilty to criminal charges Thursday afternoon . 'Sick plans': Gilberto Valle has been arrested for allegedly detailing his plans to kidnap, torture, kill, cook and eat women. His list of potential victims allegedly named more than 100 women . One document on Valle's computer was . titled 'Abducting and Cooking (Victim 1): A Blueprint,' according to the . criminal complaint. The file also had the woman's birth date and other . personal information and a list of 'materials needed' - a car, . chloroform and rope. 'I was thinking of tying her body . onto some kind of apparatus ... cook her over low heat, keep her alive . as long as possible,' Valle allegedly wrote in one exchange in July, the . complaint says. Emails, computer files, and fetish . chats were retrieved from the NYPD officer’s computer. None of the women . was harmed, although a prosecutor said some of the women knew Valle and . he had stalked at least two of them at home or work - once in his . police car in a 'very intimidating fashion.' In other online conversations, . investigators alleged, Valle talked about the mechanics of fitting the . woman's body into an oven, noting that the women’s legs would have to be . bent, and discussed how 'tasty' one woman looked. 'Her days are numbered,' he wrote, . according to the complaint. That woman told the FBI she knew Valle and . met him for lunch in July. Harrowing: He allegedly discussed how to kill a woman by slowly cooking her over emails with co-conspirators . Shock: Valle's brother arrived at the apartment to collect his dog and was swarmed by reporters . Public defender Julia Gatto had asked for bail, saying the Valle was only guilty of a 'deviant fantasy.' 'There's no actual crossing the line from fantasy to reality,' Gatto . said. 'At worst this is someone who has sexual fantasies about people he . knows and he talks about it on the Internet,' according to the AP. But Valle was arrested because he was . too close to carrying out the 'grotesque and disturbing' plots, . Assistant U.S. Attorney Hadassa Waxman said. He had 'plans to kidnap, . rape, torture, kill and eat the body parts of young women, some of whom . the FBI has identified and they acknowledge knowing the defendant for a . period of time,' she said. Valle, a graduate of the University . of Maryland, where he studied psychology and criminal justice, was . suspended from the police force after his arrest. He allegedly created files on his personal computer containing at least 100 women with at least one photo of each, details of their physical characteristics and lists of their addresses. He even allegedly had a file named 'Abducting and Cooking [victim's name]: A Blueprint' containing information including the woman's name, date of birth, height, weight and bra size. FBI agents tracked down 10 of his named victims who said they knew him. Phone records showed he was once outside the home of one woman, who told investigators that she hardly knew him. In another eerie message, Valle, who is believed to have married in June, wrote that his knowing the victims would lead to a 'flawless' abduction as his arrival 'will not alert her', the complaint noted. Scene: FBI searched his apartment in Forest Hills, Queens (pictured) and allegedly found lists of women on his home computer. One file was named: 'Abducting and Cooking [victim's name]: A Blueprint' His co-conspirator, who has not been named, responded with equal excitement at the plans. 'I love that she is asleep right now not have the slightest clue of what we have planned,' Valle allegedly wrote, ABC reported. 'Her days are numbered... She does look tasty, doesn't she?' His alleged co-conspirator responded: 'You do know if we don't waste any of her, there is nearly 75 lbs of food there.' He also allegedly asked Valle, 'How big is your oven?' and 'What's your favorite cut of meat?' Their . bizarre relationship only became more deranged as Valle allegedly . offered to sell a woman to the other plotter in February for $5,000 so . that he could rape and kill her. But Valle said he would only deliver the . woman and would not get involved in the rape as 'I don't want to be . tempted the next time I abduct a girl', he wrote, prosecutors said. Vile: This photo shows a passage of a Federal complaint filed in New York on Thursday against Valle . Horrifying: The complaint shows Valle's in-depth plans for the kidnapping and killings of the potential victims . He allegedly added that the co-conspirator needed to ensure her body was not found. Valle is not known to have engaged in any of these plans, an officer told the New York Times on condition of anonymity. No women were harmed, the FBI confirmed. It is believed he has a young child; his estranged wife has commented on Facebook about needing a babysitter, while the New York Daily News noted that his home appeared to be child-proofed. Valle was suspended on Wednesday and arrested by the FBI, who worked in conjunction with the NYPD on the case, on Thursday. He is due to appear in a federal . court in Manhattan later today on charges of conspiracy to kidnap and . access of unauthorised computers.

From the moment he was diagnosed with testicular cancer, Huw Allanson had feared his dream of becoming a father would never come true. Having battled testicular cancer twice – losing his left testicle and having nine rounds of chemotherapy in the process – he was told his chances of becoming a father were just five per cent. But this year, he’s had more to celebrate than most. Incredibly, just a week before he and his fiancé Lizi, 32, were due to start IVF, they discovered they had managed to conceive naturally and their son Ryan was born in in April this year. Huw Allanson and his fiance Lizi were given just a five per cent chance of conceiving naturally after he battled testicular cancer twice. Their son Ryan was born earlier this year . ‘It has been an amazing year,’ Huw, 27, told MailOnline. ‘One of my biggest ambitions in life was to have a family, but I was always concerned it would never happen.’ Huw was just 18 when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. After noticing a lump on his left testicle, he was referred to a specialist for an ultrasound test which confirmed the lump was cancerous and his testicle would need to be removed. He said: ‘I have always wanted to be a dad but there wasn’t much time to think about everything at the time – I was diagnosed on the Friday and had surgery on the Monday. Afterwards, I went away, assuming that was it and tried to get on with my life.' Sadly, that wasn’t the case. Just . three months later, he received the devastating news the cancer was back . – and, even worse, had spread to his stomach. 'It was terrifying to be . told it had come back and I was pretty scared,' said Huw. To battle the cancer, Huw needed nine gruelling rounds of intensive chemotherapy at Charing Cross Hospital. My First Christmas: Baby Ryan opening his stocking . 'The best present ever': Huw, with Ryan, now nine months old . And . after being warned this could affect his fertility, he decided to have . his sperm frozen at Hammersmith Hospital as a preventive measure. The chemotherapy dragged on for months and sucked the life out of Huw as he had a terrible reaction to it, suffering severe nausea and vomiting and extreme fatigue. Thankfully he responded well to the treatment and was put in remission in 2004. Today, he only requires yearly check-ups. Ryan celebrating his first Christmas with mother Lizi . Part of his treatment included taking . the drug cisplatin, a drug developed in conjunction with Cancer . Research UK, which has transformed the outlook of men with advanced . testicular cancer. When he met his fiance Lizi at a friend's birthday drinks four years ago, the couple, who live in Lingfield, Surrey, quickly decided they wanted to start a family. But after nearly year of trying, they were worried something was wrong as Lizi still wasn’t pregnant. ‘I . mentioned at one of my yearly cancer check-ups that we’d been trying . for a baby, with no luck,’ recalls Huw, who now works for a telecoms . company. And after tests on . Huw’s sperm, the couple were devastated to learn they had only a 5 per . cent chance of conceiving naturally due to the quality. Desperate . to try and have a family of their own, they decided to have fertility . treatment and, after a lengthy struggle, eventually managed to get it on . the NHS. Amazingly, nine days before they were due to start IVF, Lizi discovered she was six weeks pregnant. ‘I’ll . never forget that day - we were absolutely elated,’ said Huw. ‘I was . obviously delighted that I was going to be a father but I was also happy . for Lizi that she didn’t have to go through some of the unpleasant . procedures that IVF involves. We’d been to a talk about it and it didn’t . sound very nice.’ And on . April 6th this year, Ryan was born after a natural birth weighing 7lb . 4oz. ‘He’s a very healthy and happy baby,’ says Huw. ‘He’s got Lizi’s . mouth and nose and my hair at the moment! ‘The . day he was born was one of the best days of my life – I’d been so . excited for the nine months before his arrival and  couldn’t believe he . was finally here. 'The day he was born was one of the best days of my life - I couldn't believe he was finally here,' says Huw . ‘I have always wanted to be a dad and we will definitely try and have another child. After the years of cancer treatment and trying for him, having him here this Christmas was the best present ever.' According to Cancer Research UK, a survey of men treated between 1982 and 1992 showed that 77 per cent were able to father a child and another five per cent  5 out of 100 did so after having fertility treatment. The biggest risk to fertility is chemotherapy, but even then about 70 per cent of men are able to father children. Martin Ledwick, Head of the Cancer Research UK Information Nurse team said: ‘It is great reading about Huw’s story.  It’s not inevitable that testicular cancer patients will lose their fertility and even if they do it can come back. 'It is also good to talk to the doctor about the possibility of sperm banking before treatment starts.  We have information about all aspects of testicular cancer on our website. Or if anyone has questions about any aspect of cancer and its treatment they can call Cancer Research UK’s nurses on 0808 800 4040.’ Huw is taking part in Cancer Research UK’s new brand campaign which highlights the power of research in beating cancer.

Giving birth in a private hospital is becoming unaffordable for most parents to be, with the average cost soaring to more than £10,000. Fees have rocketed because doctors are facing higher insurance bills, The Medical Protection Society (MPS) has warned. The MPS, which indemnifies doctors, told The Daily Telegraph that rising insurance premiums are making private obstetrics ‘unaffordable’. The society claims that the reason for the soaring prices is that judges are tending to award bigger and bigger damages for negligence. The average cost of a private birth has soared to more than £10,000 because many doctors have been forced to double their fees in the last three years . For example, payouts for problems during birth which leave babies brain damaged now sometimes top £10 million. However, many private doctors claim they are being unfairly penalised for mistakes mainly made by junior NHS doctors. As a result, some are now calling for a no claims discount to be introduced to protect experienced private doctors from the soaring premiums. Dr Paul Armstrong, one of the most experienced obstetricians in the country, told The Daily Telegraph that the rise in premiums had forced him to almost double his charges to £7,000 over the past three years. The enormous pressure on NHS wards is forcing parents to consider going private . ‘If the insurance goes up, the bottom line is one’s charges go up,’ explained Dr Armstrong. ‘Significant numbers of people are going to find it very difficult to set up their practices and there’s the potential that this could put a stop to private birth in the UK.’ According to a report by the NHS Litigation Authority, between April 2000 and March 2010 5,087 birth related claims were made against the NHS resulting in payouts of £3.1 billion. The report also showed that the number of claims rose by 36 per cent between 2003/4 and 2011/12, from 767 to 1,040. Mr Ashok Kumar, a consultant obstetrician with a small private practice, has seen his insurance costs rise from £5,000 to £27,000 in a single year. He said that it has become a nightmare as the costs have made it impossible for him to have a private obstetrics practice. Mr Kumar is considering leaving the country and taking his practice abroad if things do not improve. The warning comes at a time when the . Royal College of Midwives say that NHS labour wards are under ‘enormous . pressure’ forcing parents to consider going private. Birth rates are currently at their highest level for 40 years. Cathy . Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, told The .
