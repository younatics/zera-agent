"(CNN) -- At last it appears the pieces in soccer's latest transfer window jigsaw are slowly falling into place. A pair of big-money moves involving English Premier League clubs on Wednesday could spark a frenzy of activity as Europe's leading clubs aim to finish their business before Tuesday's deadline. London-based club Tottenham Hotspur are at the coalface as things stand, securing a $40 million deal shortly after missing out on another to rivals Chelsea. All this with the potential world record transfer of their star player Gareth Bale to Spanish giants Real Madrid simmering in the background -- a move that manager Andre Villas-Boas admits is close. But while the two English clubs are splashing out lavish sums on new players, the teams they are buying from are resigned to having to offload their big names in a bid to balance the books. Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala announced their intention to sell a swathe of their stars earlier this month, alerting both Chelsea and Tottenham to the availability of Brazilian midfielder Willian. The 25-year-old appeared to be set for a move to Tottenham, but Chelsea swooped in to hijack the deal and on Wednesday announced it had been completed, for a fee reported to be $46.5 million. It means manager Jose Mourinho has ten midfielders at his disposal and raises the prospect that Spanish playmaker Juan Mata, who hasn't featured in Chelsea's first two games of the season, might be sold. Willian told Chelsea's official website: ""Chelsea are one of the best clubs in the world, and now I'm going to play for one of the best managers in the world. ""It's been my dream to come to play here. Chelsea was always my first choice. ""Finally it's become a reality, and when the offer came I never gave a thought to anybody else, I said to myself that I would run here, and I'm happy to be here now."" Chelsea are still in the market for Manchester United and England striker Wayne Rooney, who played for the English champions against Chelsea in their goalless draw on Monday night. The striker was afforded a fine reception by the home supporters, and took to his Facebook page on Wednesday to thank them for their support, the biggest hint yet that he might opt to stay at Old Trafford. Tottenham's frustration at missing out on Willian might have been eased by a new signing of their own, as Italian club AS Roma announced midfielder Erik Lamela was set to join them for a fee of $39.9 million. At the same time the club confirmed the signing of Adam Ljajic from fellow Serie A side Fiorentina for $14.5 million, who is expected to fill the gap left by Lamela, from Argentina. Lamela's acquisition means Tottenham have broken their transfer record three times in the close season, after the arrivals of Paulinho from Corinthians and Roberto Soldado from Valencia. They have also signed Toulouse midfielder Etienne Capoue and Belgian winger Nacer Chadli as Villas-Boas overhauls his squad in the face of Bale's departure. The Welshman's move to Real appears to be moving closer given Tottenham's transfer outlay, Villas-Boas telling a news conference on Wednesday it could happen ""very soon."" But the Portuguese also registered his disappointment that Bale has missed several training sessions as the saga unfolded. ""He is involved in a big transfer move to Real Madrid and in the end if it happens, we wish him all the best, but the fact that he hasn't turned up is not the correct behavior,"" Villas-Boas told reporters. ""That is the position they chose to take and it's up to the club to decide if it's a fineable offense."" As for how quickly Bale's switch to Spain could be concluded Villas-Boas added: ""It could happen very, very soon. ""Will he be in tomorrow? I don't know. I'm not really in control of the situation I've left it up to the club to decide what they want to do. ""It's up to Gareth (whether he wants to come back again). He has a good relationship with everybody and he has saluted the players the other day, myself included.""","Brazilian midfielder Willian joins Chelsea in a deal reported to be worth $46.5m .

"(CNN) -- The man who helped bring David Beckham, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva to Paris Saint-Germain as part of its empire building is leaving the Qatari-owned French club. A key figure in the club's revival thanks to his extensive network of contacts, Leonardo handed in his resignation as sporting director, signaling the second major departure from PSG in two weeks after coach Carlo Ancelotti -- Leonardo's friend -- left for Real Madrid. ""Leonardo has informed Paris Saint-Germain of his desire to resign from his position as Sport Director at the end of the current transfer window,"" PSG said in a statement Wednesday. ""We regret this choice but respect his decision. ""We thank him greatly for his important contributions towards the project of building a top European club in Paris and wish him all the best for his future career choice."" Earlier this month Leonardo's suspension for shoving a referee following PSG's 1-1 draw with Valenciennes in May was extended from nine to 13 months, although the ban wouldn't have affected most of his duties as sporting director. When Leonardo was hired by PSG in July 2011, he said he wasn't overawed as he sought to turn the team -- backed by the wealthy owners -- into a global powerhouse. He called the challenge a ""buzz."" With Ancelotti at the helm and the likes of Ibrahimovic, Silva and the now retired Beckham -- for a short while -- on the pitch, PSG last season claimed the league title for the first time since 1994. The influx of cash didn't hurt. The owners invested an estimated more than $195 million in the club, turning it into the highest-spending side in Europe. In Europe the campaign was also a success, as inexperienced PSG reached the quarterfinals and was only knocked out on away goals by Barcelona thanks to Lionel Messi's late cameo. Almost one million people tried to obtain tickets for the first leg that was played in PSG's 45,000 capacity Parc des Princes stadium. Before the Brazilian leaves, PSG could tie up a deal for sought after Napoli striker Edinson Cavani, a boost for Ancelotti's managerial replacement Laurent Blanc. The transfer window in France closes on August 31, with PSG kicking off the defense of its Ligue 1 title at Montpellier on August 9. But it wasn't all smooth sailing for Leonardo. Besides his suspension, he clashed with Ibrahimovic in the dressing room after PSG won the title and has drawn criticism for some of PSG's signings, including Javier Pastore. The Argentinean's transfer fee was a hefty $54 million. Leonardo collapsed and had to go to hospital shortly after his altercation with Ibrahimovic, sparking reports he was stressed. Leonardo, like Blanc a World Cup winner, earned more than 50 caps for Brazil and was a fan favorite during his four years at A.C. Milan, the club most commonly associated with Ancelotti. He turned to management when his playing days were over, spending a season at both A.C. Milan and its city rival Inter.","Leonardo to resign as sporting director of Paris Saint-Germain after two years with club .

"(CNN) -- Carlos Tevez may have escaped the clutches of the Premier League by joining Italian giant Juventus -- but the long arm of the law could yet bring the striker back to English shores. Tevez, who completed his $13 million move from Manchester City to the Serie A champion Thursday, has yet to complete his community service in England according to sources close to the case. The Argentina international avoided jail last March after pleading guilty to the charge of driving while disqualified and accepted the punishment of 250 hours of community service and a $1,500 fine. While the exact number of hours owed by Tevez has not been made public, he must complete his punishment within the 12 months of it being handed out. Community service punishments in the United Kingdom range from 40 hours to 300 -- with a minimum of seven hours per week being served. A Probation Service spokesperson told CNN: ""We do not comment on individuals. ""Offenders must serve the sentences handed down to them by the courts. Anyone who fails to do so will have action taken against them."" CNN also contacted BCL Burton Copeland, the firm which represented Tevez at his trial, but it refused to comment on the matter. Meanwhile, Tevez revealed his delight Thursday at being handed the iconic number 10 shirt following the completion of his move to Turin. Tevez will follow in the footsteps of Bianconeri legends Michel Platini, Roberto Baggio and most recently, Alessandro Del Piero. ""I'm absolutely aware of the great effort Juventus Football Club has made to bring me here,"" he told reporters. ""I feel the responsibility of wearing this number and I am aware of the great responsibility of representing Juventus and playing for the club. This number is certainly a great challenge. ""Top players have worn it before and I was number 10 with Boca (Juniors) before, and (Diego) Maradona played in it too, so the great responsibility is now that I'm going to play in this great club. So certainly the greatest challenge is to do my best. ""Obviously I didn't want to forget Del Piero, who was the last player to wear number 10. He is a person and player that I greatly respect and who certainly represents an emblem and symbol of esteem. ""It is a great pleasure and honor to wear this jersey with his number."" Tevez's move to Italy brings an eventful seven-year spell in England where he played for West Ham, Manchester United and Manchester City. He endured a turbulent time at City after being exiled for six months by former manager Roberto Mancini following his refusal to warm up during a Champions League clash at Bayern Munich in 2011. Mancini's departure at the end of last season failed to persuade Tevez from seeking pastures new -- although he denies that he turned down a move to AC Milan following claims by the club's vice-president Adriano Galliani. ""I want to be very clear and honest,"" he said. ""I've only talked to Galliani a couple of times in my life,"" said Tevez. ""The last time was last year when there was an intention to bring me to AC Milan but I don't know why he has said such a thing. ""Today I'm here and that's what matters, I'm very happy to be here."" Isco . Elsewhere, new Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti completed his first signing since taking over from Jose Mourinho with the acquisition of Spain under-21 and Malaga star Isco. Isco was a stand out star for the Spain under-21 team which retained the European Championship in Israel, scoring three goals following a stunning season with Malaga. ""Real Madrid incorporates a new project with one of the best Spanish football players,"" the club said in a statement. ""Francisco Roman Alarcon - Isco - plays at the Bernabeu for the next five seasons."" The 21-year-old midfielder scored 12 goals in 45 appearances last season and made his full international debut against Uruguay last February. ""Imagination and speed are some of the qualities that define this midfielder... a recent champion with Spain at Euro Under-21 and at age 21 already capped by the senior team,"" Madrid's statement added. ""[He is] a player with enviable technical quality, chutzpah and imagination.""","Carlos Tevez has completed his $13million move to Juventus from Manchester City .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League club Newcastle United and striker Papiss Cisse are at odds over the club's sponsorship deal with a finance company, according to the player's agent. Cisse, who terrorized opposition defenses when he moved to soccer's Premier League last year, hasn't been included in Newcastle's squad for a pre-season tour of Portugal, the team from Northeast England revealed on its website . A Muslim, Cisse doesn't want to don Newcastle's jersey -- according to his agent -- because the sponsor is Wonga, which, as stated on its website, lends money with an annual interest rate of more than 5,800 percent. ""He feels that it is immoral....,"" the Senegal international's agent Madou Diene told CNN, outlining his interpretation of the striker's position. Diene declined CNN's request to interview Cisse. Earlier this month UK consumer watchdog Which? revealed a million families a month needed short-term high interest loans to get by. Of those, 400,000 used the cash to pay for essentials such as food and fuel, while a further 240,000 needed money to pay off existing debts. Newcastle, which did not return calls from CNN seeking comment, has yet to explain why Cisse did not travel with the squad to Portugal. Under Sharia law, making money from interest, for example, isn't allowed. But the BBC reported that two of Cisse's Muslim teammates, midfielders Cheick Tiote and Moussa Sissoko, told the club they had no issue with wearing the shirt and both of them were included in the squad for the trip to Portugal as the club prepare for the new English Premier League season which starts on August 17. The partnership between the club and Wonga is said to be worth $38m over four years. Wonga, which declined comment on the Cisse case, launched its first website in 2007 and according to its website, ""rapidly became one of the world's most innovative credit providers."" For first-time users, loans of up to about $600 can be requested and Wonga usually provides an answer, it says, in seconds. However, the interest such companies charge consumers has raised concerns among a number of British politicians. ""Urgent action is needed to grip the regulation of the payday loan industry, as the number of cases of misery and hardship are growing rapidly because of pressures on living standards and personal finance,"" Chris Leslie MP, Labour's Shadow Treasury Minister, told the British opposition party's website in June. Cisse wore Newcastle's jersey last season when it was sponsored by another finance company -- lender Virgin Money. ""I guess it might be a question of people's views changing over time,"" Shaykh Ibrahim Mogra, assistant secretary general with the Muslim Council of Britain, told CNN. ""Maybe they've not had a chance to think things through beforehand. Maybe now they realize,"" added Mogra in response to the question as to why Cisse wore a Virgin jersey but not the Wonga one. Cisse wouldn't be the first Muslim player to refuse to wear a jersey on religious grounds. Striker Frederic Kanoute took a stand at Spain's Sevilla in 2006 when he opted against wearing a shirt sponsored by gambling firm 888.com. Eventually, Kanoute did wear the shirt but was excluded from taking part in any promotional activities linked to the sponsorship. ""I think every player will have their own (stance) on this,"" said Mogra. ""There will be players who will not be prepared to do something they believe is against their religious teaching and there might be some who might not be so concerned. ""It's very difficult to say how everyone is going to react."" The Council hasn't been approached by the club or Cisse, Mogra added. ""If they were to make a request or approach, we would either signpost them or be able to give them advice,"" he said. The chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association Gordon Taylor -- who is seeking a resolution to the dispute -- did not respond to CNN's request for an interview. When asked if other clubs had expressed an interest in Cisse, Diene couldn't ""answer that question."" Earlier he insisted that Cisse ""loves the fans, the club and the city."" Cisse played a significant role in helping Newcastle to overachieve and finish fifth in the Premier League in 2011/2012, scoring 13 goals in 14 appearances after joining from Freiburg for $13.7 million during the January transfer window. But he cooled last term, netting eight league goals as he played second fiddle to Demba Ba. Ba was then sold to Chelsea and Newcastle barely avoided relegation. The Cisse saga has added to an already lively off-season at Newcastle, one of England's best supported clubs with an average league attendance last season of more than 50,000. In June, the Magpies rehired the outspoken Joe Kinnear, which did not go down well with the club's fans. Formerly a manager, he was brought back as director of soccer.","Muslim striker Papiss Cisse refuses to wear Newcastle's club shirt on religious grounds .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Turkey on Thursday recalled its ambassador to the United States and warned of repercussions in a growing dispute over congressional efforts to label the World War I era killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turkish forces ""genocide."" The U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs passed the measure 27-21 Wednesday. President Bush and key administration figures lobbied hard against the measure, saying it would create unnecessary headaches for U.S. relations with Turkey. Turkey -- now a NATO member and a key U.S. ally in the war on terror -- accepts Armenians were killed but call it a massacre during a chaotic time, not an organized campaign of genocide. The full House could vote on the genocide resolution as early as Friday. A top Turkish official warned Thursday that consequences ""won't be pleasant"" if the full House approves the resolution. ""Yesterday some in Congress wanted to play hardball,"" said Egemen Bagis, foreign policy adviser to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. ""I can assure you Turkey knows how to play hardball."" Asked about Ambassador Nabi Sensoy's recall after the news broke, a State Department spokesman said he could not confirm it. ""People are sometimes called back for consultation; sometimes they're called back for other reasons,"" said spokesman Tom Casey. ""If they wanted to bring their ambassador back for consultations or do something else, that is their decision. I certainly think that it will not do anything to limit our efforts to continue to reach out to Turkish officials, to explain our views, to engage them on this issue and again to make clear that we intend to work on this with Congress."" Casey and White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said they both would like to see the resolution withdrawn without a vote by the full House. However, Casey said, ""I don't think anyone is expecting that to happen at this point."" Democratic leaders said earlier if the Foreign Affairs Committee passed the resolution, they intended to bring it to the House floor.  Watch why the resolution stirs strong emotions » . The House was not in session Thursday because of the funeral of Rep. Jo Ann Davis of Virginia, who died Saturday. Members may vote on the resolution Friday. House Foreign Affairs Chairman Tom Lantos, D-California, was unmoved by the Turkish government's protests. ""The Turkish government will not act against the United States because that would be against their own interests,"" he told CNN. ""I'm convinced of this."" But Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton, D-Missouri, sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opposing the resolution, and said the backlash threatened by Turkey could disrupt ""America's ability to redeploy U.S. military forces from Iraq,"" a top Democratic priority. Turkey, a NATO member, has been a key U.S. ally in the Middle East and a conduit for sending supplies into Iraq. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Wednesday that good relations with Turkey are vital because 70 percent of the air cargo sent to U.S. forces in Iraq and 30 percent of the fuel consumed by those forces fly through Turkey. U.S. commanders ""believe clearly that access to airfields and roads and so on, in Turkey, would very much be put at risk if this resolution passes and the Turks react as strongly as we believe they will,"" Gates said. Bagis said no French planes have flown through Turkish airspace since a French Parliament committee passed a similar resolution last year. He said the response to the U.S. might not be the same, but warned if the full House passes it that ""we will do something, and I can promise you it won't be pleasant."" Bagis spoke to reporters while in Washington to attend a meeting of the Carnegie Endowment. In a statement on his Web site, Turkish President Abdullah Gul said the resolution was ""unacceptable"" and ""doesn't fit a major power like the United States."" In a letter to Bush, Gul warned ""in the case that Armenian allegations are accepted, there will be serious problems in the relations between the two countries."" ""We still hope that common sense will prevail and that the House of Representatives will not move this resolution any further,"" the Turkish Foreign Ministry Web site said. The vote was also strongly criticized by Turkish newspapers, The Associated Press reported. ""Bill of Hatred,"" said Hurriyet's front page, while Vatan's headline read ""27 Foolish Americans."" Casey said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice requested calls with Erdogan and Gul and planned to speak with the Turkish foreign minister about the issue later Thursday. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack issued a statement expressing ""regret"" for the committee's action, warning the resolution ""may do grave harm to U.S.-Turkish relations and to U.S. interests in Europe and the Middle East."" The nonbinding House resolution said the deportation of nearly 2 million Armenians from the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1923, resulting in the deaths of 1.5 million of them, amounted to ""genocide."" Turks strongly reject the genocide label, insisting there was no organized campaign against the Armenians and that many Turks also died in the chaos and violence of the period. Sensoy said the resolution's passage would be a ""very injurious move to the psyche of the Turkish people."" He predicted backlash and setbacks on several fronts: Turkish-American relations, Turkish-Armenian relations and the normalization of relations between the nations of Turkey and Armenia. The resolution's sponsor, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, said the measure already had 226 co-sponsors, more than enough votes to pass ""and the most support an Armenian genocide resolution has ever received."" A similar resolution passed the committee by a 40-7 vote two years ago, but it never reached the full House floor. The resolution arrives at a particularly sensitive point in U.S.-Turkish relations. The United States has urged Turkey not to send its troops over the border into northern Iraq to fight Kurdish separatist rebels, who launched some cross-border attacks against Turkish targets. Observers of U.S.-Turkish relations have argued the House resolution could make Turkey less inclined to use restraint in dealing with its longstanding problems with the Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the PKK.

"(CNN) -- Kimi Raikkonen wants to stay with Lotus, the Formula One team's boss said amid claims the former world champion is targeting a return to Ferrari. The Finn's future has been a hot topic of discussion during the mid-season break, which comes to an end with this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix. Raikkonen has also been linked with a move to Red Bull, although reports suggest Toro Rosso's Daniel Ricciardo is set to become reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel's No. 2 when Mark Webber leaves at the end of this season. Raikkonen sits second in the individual standings in 2013, behind Vettel. ""Kimi wants to stay with us,"" Lotus team principal Eric Boullier told CNN. ""We want to keep Kimi. There are a lot of teams who (would) like to have Kimi on board now. ""It's up to him to choose what he wants to do. We know what he wants. We will do everything that we can to get what he wants. We need to make him just happy to stay. So far he wants to stay so we'll see."" Boullier's comments appeared to be echoed by the 33-year-old's manager Steve Robertson. He told Autosport that Lotus was in pole position and would hang on to Raikkonen -- provided he has a car that can compete for a world title. It contradicted another report Monday that stated Raikkonen was seeking a return to Ferrari, where he won his lone world championship in 2007. ""Lotus holds the key to Raikkonen's future,"" Robertson told Autosport. ""If the team can provide him with the answers he is seeking, which will ensure he has a car that can fight for race wins and the championship, then he will stay."" Raikkonen didn't answer any questions about his future Thursday because he was ill and missed his media briefing ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix, Lotus said. He is seeking a fifth victory at the famed Spa-Francorchamps circuit. ""I bet every driver likes Spa and I have so many good memories there,"" Raikkonen told Lotus' official website Wednesday. ""For me it's the greatest circuit in the world and it has been my favorite place since my first ever visit there in 2000 with Formula Renault. ""It's great to go racing with a modern car at a proper circuit which has such a great tradition. You can't get the same feeling anywhere else.""","Kimi Raikkonen wants to stay with Lotus and Lotus wants to keep him, said his team .

"(CNN) -- Honesty is often a rare virtue at the highest level of sport, especially when it comes to admitting mistakes, so McLaren fans may give Martin Whitmarsh some begrudging respect after the team principal accepted responsibility for a catalog of errors this season. The United Kingdom-based constructor may have won twelve drivers' championships since its creation in 1963 but none will be added in the year of McLaren's 50th anniversary. Neither Jenson Button nor Sergio Perez have managed to stand on the podium all season, with the Briton's fifth place in the third race in China the best finish so far. Mexican Perez, 23, has won 18 points in his first season with McLaren while Button, who won the 2009 title with Brawn, can only muster 47, trailing leader Sebastian Vettel by 150 points -- or the equivalent of six race victories with just eight rounds left. The problem is that McLaren are currently on course for their first season without a grand prix win in seven years. A number of hasty changes to the car have made racing this year both ""painful and difficult"" for Whitmarsh as he revealed in an open interview with Formula One's official website. ""This year we have made some big mistakes -- that is very obvious, and difficult to rectify,"" the Briton said. ""I don't like it, but there is no point in hiding from it."" The 55-year-old traces the roots of the problems back to the middle of last season, when McLaren dropped off the pace after a bright start. At this point, the car was redesigned, with significant changes to the height of the nose, the configuration of both the front and rear suspensions, as well as the bodywork and exhaust layout. ""In a word, we did too many things which were deviating from a car which was the fastest car about nine or ten months ago,"" the McLaren official said. ""The start of the 2012 was good, but then in mid-season we were falling behind and it is about that time that you make these decisions -- and then last year's car became quicker and quicker. ""It was bad timing, it was misjudgment, and it was ambition. It is very clear in hindsight that we've got it wrong. But let's also be fair: this car is now quicker than last year's car."" Nonetheless, it is still struggling to make any impact in the constructors' standings, with 11 races of the 19-round season having already gone. McLaren's tally of 65 points is almost tripled by the team immediately above them in the standings, fourth-placed Lotus, while the Woking outfit's total is dwarfed by the 312 boasted by Red Bull, who lead the way. When asked who should carry the can for the failed redesign of the car, Whitmarsh resisted any temptation to seek out scapegoats. ""Ultimately I take the blame for it,"" he said. ""I am happy to name names when we are successful and give them the opportunity to stand on the podium, but it is my job when things haven't gone so well to take the responsibility."" Critics of Whitmarsh, who has been with McLaren for a quarter of a century, will point to the team's inability to win a championship since he replaced the retiring Ron Dennis in 2009, a year after the team's last championship title. The closest McLaren came to a championship under his control was in 2010 when Lewis Hamilton had a chance of winning the title on the final day of the season, only for Vettel to take the glory. There has been some good news for Whitmarsh this week though. At Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix, Button felt the car performed the best it had all season with the Briton, 33, also publicly stating in recent days how he hopes to sign a new three-year contract with the team. Whitmarsh had considered trying to lure Kimi Raikkonen, who has been in great form this year, back to McLaren for next season, revealing that talks last year to the same effect failed ""for various reasons"". However, he also feels he owes the current stable a car that will enable them to challenge far higher up the table. ""We haven't given our drivers the car we should have done this year. But they've been fantastic ambassadors and I think they deserve another go with us next year. ""If we give them a car that is good enough, they both can win. We know that."" And having had a front row seat for more than 100 of McLaren's 182 grand prix wins, Whitmarsh is confident that the team can turn itself around ahead of the 2014 season. ""Looking over the last 20 years, we are pretty consistent,"" he rallied. ""Yes, this is a bad year but usually we come back strong -- and that is what we will do next year.""","McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh admits 'big mistakes' in 2013 season .

"(CNN) -- Italian football is facing new scandal after police raided the headquarters of a host of leading clubs in a tax evasion and money laundering probe, according to Italian prosecutors Tuesday. Champions Juventus, AC Milan and Lazio were among approximately 40 clubs that had documents seized relating to transfers and contracts between teams, players and agents in an investigation reportedly dubbed ""Sick Soccer,"" the public prosecutors' office based in Naples said in a statement. The probe, involving over 200 police officers, is looking at more than 50 player transfers, in particular those arranged by two football agents -- Argentine Alejandro Mazzoni and Italian Alessandro Moggi, the statement said. Eight agents are under investigation, while another four could potentially be drawn into the probe. Neither the Italian Football Federation, nor Juventus, Milan and Lazio or Moggi or Mazzoni were immediately available for comment. ""At the moment the LNPA (Italian Football League) is not planning to release any official statement,"" said the Lega Calcio, the regulator of Italy's top two division Serie A and B. The Naples police authorities began the investigation last October, initially looking into Argentina international Ezequiel Lavezzi's Napoli contract. The 28-year-old moved to Paris Saint-Germain in a multi-million dollar deal last summer, though Italian authorities have stressed that the players themselves are not under investigation. The warrant for the search and seizure of documents was issued by a court in Naples as seizures took place in the headquarters of dozens of Italian football clubs and some foreign clubs as well. The charges range from criminal association, international fiscal evasion, illicit brokering, the production and use of fake invoices and money laundering. ""From what we know about the investigation, it's all about agents,"" Riccardo Andriani, a lawyer from the Center for Law Economics and Ethic Studies in Sport, told CNN. ""They often act in an unclear way as middlemen [between the clubs and the players] rather than representing just one side. ""This can create a lack of transparency about where the money comes from and where it goes. But I believe that Italian football, as it has in the past, will survive also this scandal."" Italian soccer has been dogged by a number of scandals in recent years. Juventus were stripped of the titles won in 2005 and 2006 and relegated to Serie B because of their involvement, along with several other top clubs, in match fixing. The ""Calciopoli"" affair saw former Juventus managing director Luciano Moggi -- the father of Alessandro -- banned for life by the Italian football authorities. Juventus, AC Milan, Fiorentina and Lazio were all implicated in a wide-ranging police investigation which discovered a network of phone calls between club officials and refereeing organizations. Ahead of Euro 2012, Italy was the focus of an international match-fixing ring, while last season, Juventus coach Antonio Conte temporarily suspended for failing to report infractions. In 2012, Napoli were docked two points after an investigation by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) into match-fixing claims. Club captain Paolo Cannavaro and Gianluca Grava were both handed six-month bans for failing to flag up former Napoli goalkeeper Matteo Gianello's intention to fix a match between the Naples club and Sampdoria in 2010. Napoli had issued a statement at the time denying any wrongdoing by the club. In 1980, Italy striker Paolo Rossi was out of the sport for two years following his involvement in a match-fixing scandal. He has always maintained his innocence. Turkish Despair . In a separate development in Turkey, leading sides Fenerbahce and Besiktas have both been banned from European competition on match-fixing charges by UEFA. Both clubs have said they will appeal the decision -- with Besiktas unable to contest next season's Europa League after being banned for a year while Fenerbahce have received a two-year suspension. ""Our club will be filing an appeal to UEFA's Appeals Committee,"" Fenerbahce, who reached last season's Europa League semifinals, said on its website. 'Fener', who must now sit out the 2013/2014 Champions League, will serve an additional one-year ban if they commit a similar offense in the next five years. If the appeals are rejected, Bursaspor, who finished fourth last season, will replace Fenerbahce in the Champions League while fifth-placed Kayserispor will take part in the Europa League. Both Fenerbahce and Besiktas were caught up in a match-fixing scandal that surrounded the 2010-2011 season, when 'Fener' were crowned champions. They were barred from competing in the 2011-2012 Champions League by the Turkish Football Federation as a result.","Italian football faces new scandal -- this time tax evasion probe .

"(CNN) -- Lazio will play its next two European matches behind closed doors after football authorities punished the Italian club for several offenses, including a fourth charge of racist behavior this season. European football's governing body also fined Lazio €40,000 ($52,000) following incidents in last week's Europa League round of 32 tie with German side Borussia Monchengladbach. Lazio had already been fined a total of $230,000 for racist abuse and other fan offenses during two group-stage matches with English team Tottenham Hotspur and another against Slovenia's Maribor. The Rome-based team has appealed UEFA's latest decision, which was handed down for ""setting off and throwing fireworks, racist behavior and insufficient organization."" ""The control and disciplinary body decided to order Lazio to play their next two UEFA competition matches as host club behind closed doors,"" read UEFA's statement. It applies to the home leg of Lazio's last-16 clash in the second-tier competition against another German team, Stuttgart, on March 14. ""The remaining game behind closed doors applies to the next UEFA competition match for which the club would qualify,"" the ruling body said. It is also the second time in a matter of days that a top Italian team has been cited for racism. Inter Milan was fined €50,000 ($65,500) by the Italian football federation on Tuesday after its supporters directed abuse at former player Mario Balotelli during Sunday's derby match with city rival AC Milan. Lazio president Claudio Lotito was disappointed by UEFA's decision, saying it was unfair on the majority of fans at the Stadio Olimpico. ""We cannot as a club be penalized for the mistakes of a small minority (and) we will lodge an appeal,"" Lotito told RaiSport. ""Lazio did everything we could and should have done to stop this from happening. It seems absurd to me that we have to play behind closed doors, which will seriously damage the club economically and stop the fans from participating in this event. ""We must distinguish between the delinquents who act on their own volition and those fans who express themselves in a civilized fashion."" UEFA meted out a heavier punishment to Turkish club Fenerbahce following last week's home Europa League match against BATE Borisov, threatening the Istanbul team with a one-season ban from from European competition if it offends again in the next two years. That sanction is probationary, but Fenerbahce will have to play the home leg of its last-16 clash with Viktoria Plzen on March 14 behind closed doors and pay a €60,000 ($79,000) after its fans set off and threw fireworks from outside the stadium. Fenerbahce's Portugal midfielder Raul Meireles will miss both games against the Czech club after being sent off in the February 14 away leg against BATE.","Serie A side Lazio punished for a series of offenses including racism .

"(CNN) -- The jury in the Drew Peterson murder trial deliberated for more than eight hours Wednesday before a judge sent them home for the night. Peterson, a former Chicago-area police sergeant, is accused of killing his ex-wife, Kathleen Savio, in 2004. The seven men and five women began deliberating Wednesday morning and asked during their discussions to hear again from the testimony of a defense witnesses, Harry Smith, who was Savio's divorce attorney, and a prosecution witness, Neil Schori, a pastor. Schori had testified that Peterson's fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, told him she woke up alone the night Savio died and Drew Peterson later coached her on how to talk to police about his whereabouts that night. Smith had testified that Stacy Peterson asked him, ""She wanted to know if, in my opinion, the fact that he'd killed Kathy could be used against him."" After 8 1/2 of deliberations, Judge Edward Burmila sent the jury home for the night. When Stacey Peterson went missing in October 2007, investigators said they would look again at Savio's death, which was initially ruled a drowning. Stacey Peterson still has not been found and Drew is considered a suspect in the case. Savio was found dead in her dry, clean bathtub March 1, 2004. Savio's death was ruled a homicide in February 2008, and Peterson was later arrested and indicted on first-degree murder. On Wednesday, the jury also asked for Drew Peterson's and Stacy Peterson's phone records for the weekend Savio died. ""There's a lot for the jury to go through. This is an entirely circumstantial case,"" Beth Karas, a legal correspondent at In Session, which airs on CNN sister network TruTV, said. Peterson was married to Savio in 2001 when he had an affair with then-17-year-old Stacy Cales, who became his fourth wife. Savio and Peterson filed for divorce in October 2001 and their relationship remained contentious for the next several years. Bolingbrook police records indicate officers were called to Savio's home 18 times to intervene in domestic fights from 2002 to 2004. Peterson had Savio arrested twice for domestic violence, though she was found not guilty in both cases. On February 27, 2004, Peterson picked up his two sons from Savio's home and spent the next two days with them. Prosecutors believe he entered her home again early on February 29 and killed her. At the time of her death, which authorities initially treated as an accident, a court was mulling how the couple's marital assets would be divided, and Savio was set to receive part of Peterson's pension and other support.

"Singapore (CNN) -- A police investigation into one man's death has now become an issue between two countries. Singapore's Foreign Ministry on Sunday said it was ""deeply disappointed"" by the attempt of two U.S. senators to block funding to the country's state-backed Institute of Microelectronics in a dispute over the investigation into the death of American who had worked there. U.S. Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester of Montana recently introduced a measure to block U.S. funding to the institute until U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder certifies that the FBI had full access to all evidence related to the death of research engineer Shane Todd. Todd's parents, who are from Montana, had raised the issue with the senators in early March. Baucus told reporters in Washington that he will work until he is ""satisfied that the parents have closure, and I am convinced there has been no national security breach or improper transfer of technology that puts America at risk."" According to a statement from the senators, in 2010, IME received nearly $500,000 from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, part of the U.S. Department of Defense responsible for the development of new technologies for use by the military. It was unclear what proportion of IME's overall budget the U.S. funds amounted to. Parents call death suspicious . Todd was found hanged in his apartment in June, just days after resigning from a job at IME. His death was reportedly called a suicide in initial reports by a Singapore coroner. A further investigation is under way in Singapore before a final coroner's report. Todd's parents consider their son's death suspicious and think he could have been killed because of his work on a semiconductor project between IME and the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. READ: Montana family disputes Singapore police probe into son's death . The Singapore police last week issued a statement asserting that they were cooperating with the FBI and said they also told the FBI they will share evidence obtained so far ""in accordance with the legal framework of both countries."" The senators' latest move came despite a meeting between Baucus and Singapore's Foreign Minister K Shanmugam on Tuesday. Shanmugam has said IME is subject to ""rigorous internal audits"" and offered to allow the United States to conduct its own ""process audit"" of IME as well. Hard drive holds evidence? Singapore police have also sought help from the FBI to obtain a hard drive that had been in Shane Todd's apartment and may contain relevant evidence. His parents say they found the drive in their son's apartment after police had already conducted their search. They also have said that experts who've examined the drive say someone accessed the drive after Todd's death. The parents have told CNN they are holding the drive ""at an undisclosed location."" Both IME and Huawei have denied any joint projects related to Todd's work were being conducted. Security concerns . Huawei is one of the world's largest telecommunications equipment makers. Along with its Chinese rival ZTE, it has been seeking to expand its business in Western markets. But at times, the two companies have met with resistance over security concerns and fears over their ties to the Chinese government. In October, a report prepared by the U.S. House Intelligence Committee said that ""the risks associated with Huawei's and ZTE's provision of equipment to U.S. critical infrastructure could undermine core U.S. national-security interests."" The two Chinese firms disputed the reports' findings, saying their products were safe for use in the United States. Todd's parents say his work had involved the use of an advanced semiconductor material Gallium Nitride, which has both commercial and military applications. They say he had expressed concerns about the legality of his work and whether it could be harmful to U.S. security. Singapore denies there were any illegal transfers of technology between IME and Huawei. In a statement from Singapore's Foreign Ministry, Singapore also objected to the ""pressure"" in this case and said the country has ""made every effort to be open and transparent in both the investigation of Mr. Todd's death and the IME's projects."" ""We will let the outcome of the investigation and coroner's inquiry speak for themselves.""","Montana senators aim to stop funding Singapore firm after U.S. employee's death .

"(CNN) -- Facebook may be more populous, but Google+ is better-liked. That's the message from a new set of data released Tuesday by the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Google+, the 1-year-old social network that pundits declared dead last year, ties Wikipedia at the top of the list of social media sites, with a score of 78 out of 100. Facebook is the least-liked social network on the list, with a score of 61 on the group's ranking of e-businesses. That's down nearly 8% from Facebook's previous ranking, indicating a drop in popularity of the social network that is by far the world's most populous, with more than 900 million active users. By contrast, Google+ has about 150 million monthly active users. ""If Facebook doesn't feel the pressure to improve customer satisfaction now, that may soon change,"" ForeSee's CEO, Larry Freed, said in a news release. ForeSee is an analytics firm that partnered with ACSI to create the report. This was the first year Google+ was included in the ranking, which is based on interviews with consumers. ACSI, which releases monthly reports in a variety of business categories, says it interviews 70,000 people a year. With a rating of 63, LinkedIn, another popular network, barely scored higher than Facebook in terms of customer satisfaction in Tuesday's report. YouTube, which is owned by Google, received a 73; Pinterest a 73; and Twitter a 64. (MySpace, in case you're wondering, isn't part of the list anymore). Some people who use Google+ weren't surprised by the ranking. ""Makes sense,"" one user wrote in response to a CNN question about the news. ""I'm sure a lot of people use Facebook because they genuinely love it, but a huge number are also using it because they feel forced to -- because everyone else they know is using it, or they think they need to have a business presence there. So there are many people using Facebook on a regular basis who don't actually like it and have plenty to complain about. Whereas the majority of people using Google+ regularly only bother to do so because they really prefer it over other sites like Facebook."" ACSI says Google+ is strong in areas where Facebook is weak. ""According to the report, Google+'s strong showing is a result of an absence of traditional advertising and what is seen as a superior mobile product,"" the group says in its news release. ""Google+'s strengths may be Facebook's weaknesses, as users complain about ads and privacy concerns. However, the most frequent complaints about Facebook are changes to its user interface, most recently the introduction of the Timeline feature.""

"(CNN) -- We already knew that Christian Bale probably wasn't going to show up as Batman in the upcoming Justice League movie, the Avengers-style supergroup of DC heroes. First, Bale said that he wouldn't do another Batman movie unless Nolan opted for a fourth Dark Knight chapter, which Nolan says isn't happening. Then 'Man of Steel' and 'Dark Knight' screenwriter David S. Goyer confirmed that the Justice League's Batman would be a rebooted character. So that pretty much closed the book. Still, with news like this, sometimes you just have to hear it from the man himself. Why the next nemesis for 'The Avengers' may be the 'Justice League of America' ""We were incredibly fortunate to get to make three [Batman films]. That's enough. Let's not get greedy,"" says Bale, who called EW to promote his upcoming revenge drama 'Out of the Furnace' (in theaters Nov. 27). ""Chris [Nolan] always said he wanted to make it one film at a time. And we ended up sitting there looking at each other, saying 'We're about to make the third.' We never really knew if we were going to get to be there, but if that was how it was going to be, this was where it should end as well."" Henry Cavill talks 'Justice League': It won't be right away . The actor says he hasn't even been involved in official talks about a Justice League movie. ""I have no information, no knowledge about anything. I've literally not had a conversation with a living soul. I understand that they may be making a Justice League movie, that's it.""

"New York (CNN) -- Police have identified two bodies found in the waters off Coney Island on Friday, believed to be the two people who went missing while riding on a personal watercraft on the Fourth of July, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. The bodies of Willie Tom, 44, and Celine Fu, 29, were discovered Friday afternoon by SCUBA divers of the NYPD Harbor Patrol. Tom's body was recovered just after noon on Friday. Fu's body was found less than one hour later. Both were found under about 14 to 15 feet of water in Gravesend Bay, located approximately one mile northwest of Coney Island, according to police. The pair went missing in Coney Island Creek around 8:15 p.m. Thursday, according to New York Police Department spokesman Sgt. Tom Antonetti. Several onlookers saw the pair riding together on a personal watercraft. Fu apparently fell off and Tom circled back and dived in after her.

"New York (CNN) -- Major League Baseball will probably move Monday to suspend New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez amid allegations involving the use of performance-enhancing drugs, two sources close to the decision told CNN on Sunday. The length of the suspension was not known nor was the timing of any announcement. A number of news outlets reported Sunday night the suspension will be for at least 214 games, meaning it would end in the 2015 season. Major League Baseball was negotiating with the 38-year-old slugger last week about a deal for a lengthy suspension rather than a lifetime ban over the Biogenesis scandal, according to several outlets. A-Rod is accused of having ties to the now-shuttered Biogenesis anti-aging clinic in south Florida and taking performance-enhancing drugs. He has denied the accusation. The Biogenesis scandal has already ensnared one star: 2011 National League MVP and Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun. Last month, Braun was suspended without pay for the rest of this season for violating the league's drug policy, baseball Commissioner Bud Selig announced. All about A-Rod . Rodriguez has missed the entire 2013 season so far after undergoing hip surgery, and he told reporters Saturday he plans to rejoin his teammates for Monday night's game in Chicago against the White Sox. Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said he's ready to put Rodriguez in Monday's lineup. ""If he's in there, I'm going to play him,"" Girardi told reporters Sunday night. Rodriguez and the league may be in for a lengthy legal fight, said CNN's Rachel Nichols. Usually, suspensions related to drug offenses are made under the players' collective bargaining agreement, allowing suspended players to keep playing while their cases are being appealed. Nichols said, however, ""That's probably not going to be the case with A-Rod. We're expecting him to be suspended under the commissioner's powers, which means that he would not be able to play while he's doing an appeal, which is why the court system might get involved."" Rodriguez is considered one of the game's greatest sluggers. He has 647 home runs -- the fifth most ever -- in 19 seasons. In 2009, he had an outstandng postseason in helping the Yankees win their most recent World Series title. He holds the largest contract ever in American sports, signing with the Yankees in 2007 for $275 million over 10 years. Rodriguez said Friday he believes his contract makes him an attractive target for a baseball ban or suspension. ""There's more than one party that benefits from me not ever stepping back on the field -- and that's not my teammates and it's not the Yankees fans,"" he said. Rodriguez has admitted using banned substances in the early 2000s but also has denied taking any after 2003. He has never been suspended by the league for a drug violation. Rodriguez may not be the only player facing suspension Monday as a result of the Biogenesis scandal, with reports of more than a dozen others possibly being punished. First-time offenders receive a 50-game suspension, so if they begin their punishments Monday, they could be back playing before the opening rounds of the playoffs. Major League Baseball sued Biogenesis and several men associated with it in March, alleging the clinic supplied banned performance-enhancing substances to a number of current and former professional baseball players like ex-Boston Red Sox slugger Manny Ramirez. A Miami-Dade County circuit court judge decided last month the lawsuit could proceed. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","NEW: Girardi says if A-Rod is ready Monday, 'I'm going to play him'

"(EW.com) -- There's a reason Marvel conceived the X-Men as a team: The menagerie of mutants are more interesting when they come in a pack. When the posse of super-powered outcasts was first brought to the screen by Bryan Singer in 2000, Hugh Jackman's mutton-chopped, adamantium-clawed Wolverine emerged as the stand-out super-freak. And Hollywood accounting being what it is, he was naturally granted his own solo encore in 2009's underwhelming X-Men Origins: Wolverine, a silly spin-off that never quite came together. Now, to wipe the slate clean, Jackman and director James Mangold (Knight and Day; Girl, Interrupted) have teamed up to bring out the claws once again in The Wolverine. And while it's definitely a more entertaining and far deeper film than the last Wolverine outing, it still falls short of the top tier of Marvel tentpoles like the fizzy Iron Man and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man. Based on Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's much-loved 1982 comic-book arc, The Wolverine is an existential (and at times soddenly heavy) story about our razor-taloned hero grappling with the burden of immortality and loss. But before we wade into that therapy session, the film opens with a harrowing sequence set, like most of the film, in Japan. It's WWII, and Jackman's Logan is imprisoned in a Japanese POW camp in Nagasaki as B-29s fly overhead to deliver the atomic bomb. During the blast he saves one of his captors, a soldier named Yashida, who, during the explosion, learns of Wolverine's invincibility and ability to heal his own wounds. Decades later, Logan, who hasn't aged a day, has renounced violence and lives as a hirsute hermit in the Yukon. There, he's tracked down by a punky, red-haired Japanese pixie named Yukio (Rila Fukushima), who informs him that the man he saved back in the prison camp is now a rich industrialist on his deathbed. He's requesting Logan's presence to thank him and settle the karmic debt that he believes he owes him. Of course, that's not all he wants. Logan heads to Japan to pay his respects and discovers not only that the aging Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) wants to steal the secret to Logan's immortality, but also that he has a granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), who's about to inherit his fortune and is in need of Logan's unique brand of badass protection. Why Logan complies is never really explained. Regardless, Logan and Mariko are on the run from a lethal posse of tattooed Yakuza and some other samurai-style baddies straight out of the Kill Bill playbook, including Yashida's femme fatale blonde nurse (Svetlana Khodchenkova) who possesses certain viper-y gifts of her own. As Logan and his charge hit the road, sparks fly, ninjas attack, and Wolverine begins to experience something he never has before â€” the actual fear of death. He's been sapped of his eternal life force and now, when he gets into one of his signature slice-and-dice brawls, the wounds he suffers no longer cauterize and heal. He's both physically and emotionally vulnerable. In other words, human. All of this makes for a Wolverine tale that's more loaded with psychological questions (his immortality is seen as a curse) and makes the haunted character more interesting. Still, that's no excuse for the film's gauzy dream sequences with Famke Janssen's Jean Grey and its overall bloat, which leads up to a preposterous (and endless) final half hour. Over the past decade, the Marvel brand has become a virtual guarantee of box-office bang. But someone over at the company's Quality Control Department really needs to look into tightening up these films. They just don't know when to end. That said, it's worth pointing out two things that The Wolverine gets right (aside from Jackman's always excellent, strong-and-silent-type performance as Logan). The first is an action sequence that occurs mid-way in the film, when Wolverine is being pursued on top of a bullet train. By now, we've all seen so many beat-downs atop locomotives that they've become numbingly similar. But the one in The Wolverine is so frantic and adrenalized (not to mention the only part of the film that takes advantage of 3-D) that the familiar becomes new again. The film also sticks the landing on a brief teaser scene after the end credits that hints at future developments in the X-Men universe. I won't spoil the pleasure of what happens. But you have to hand it to Marvel for managing to leave audiences breathless in anticipation of a sequel after making them sit through two-plus hours of merely satisfactory storytelling. Grade: B- .

"(CNN) -- It all started with a New Year's Eve party. The cushy gig probably sounded irresistible to singing sensations like Beyoncé, Usher and Mariah Carey: a private concert in the luxurious Caribbean island of St. Barts to ring in a new year before a group of dignitaries who were big fans. But that was before everything came to light, courtesy of WikiLeaks. Those artists and others, including Nelly Furtado and rapper 50 Cent, have recently faced sharp criticism for accepting payments for performances from the family of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. The scandal highlights how very easily stars can find themselves smack dab in the middle of a major political firestorm for simply doing what they do best: making money for their talents. In February, it was reported that cables obtained by the secrets-revealing WikiLeaks website detailed lavish spending by Gadhafi's sons, including large sums of money paid to American singers for performances. Within the past few days, Beyoncé, Usher, Carey and Furtado have announced that they either have donated or plan to donate the money earned to charities. Carey recently released a statement saying she was embarrassed by the scandal. ""Going forward, this is a lesson for all artists to learn from,"" the singer said. ""We need to be more aware and take more responsibility regardless of who books our shows. Ultimately we as artists are to be held accountable."" ""You really have to be very careful and do your research,"" said Matthew ""Mateo"" Rajkumar, chief executive officer of the American Talent Agency. ""You have to make sure you know where the money is coming from."" Rajkumar's company specializes in booking urban American music artists overseas, with a heavy concentration in the markets of Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. His clients have included big names in hip-hop like Fat Joe, Missy Elliott, Wyclef Jean and Busta Rhymes. Rajkumar said an intense vetting process is crucial to making sure artists don't find themselves performing for dictators or accepting ""blood money."" He said he recently had to turn down gigs in North Africa for artists like singer Chrissette Michele because the deal didn't meet his standards. ""It's such a coincidence in that we recently turned down a deal coming from people we have worked with in Uganda, where we had offers in Libya that we turned down,"" he said. ""When I say recently, I mean before the recent uprising. We do everything we can to make sure we are protecting our artists."" The CEO said his company was one of the first to see the potential market abroad for celebrity artists and brokered a deal in 2008 for 50 Cent to appear in Angola, which snagged the rapper one of his largest paydays for a concert to date: $1.4 million. ""The money had to play a factor in getting an artist of his stature at that time to go over there, but there were other things that we did,"" Rajkumar said of booking 50 Cent for the Angola concert. ""We tied in a visit to the embassy and did a huge AIDS awareness event with a bunch of kids, as well as a hospital and orphanage donation, so there was also an element of giving back to the country."" Fans in the United States and major countries in Europe have better access to concerts by some of their favorite acts, Rajkumar said, but the presence of these same stars in some of the smaller and more far-flung countries generates a great deal of interest that artists can cash in on. Oil companies, cell phone companies and breweries are usually the three big types of industries that sponsor such shows, as well as local governments, which want to put their country on the map and stimulate tourism. When rapper Snoop Dogg performed in Croatia in 2008, he packed Zagreb's Dom Sportova arena with 10,000 fans, and the event made the style section of the Croatia Tourist Center website. But the shows aren't cheap to produce, with the need for increased security and the fees paid both to the artist and for expenses like flying in the artist's entourage and equipment needed to mount a concert. ""These events are hardly ever put on for the financial benefit,"" said Rajkumar, who added that often, fans in these countries cannot afford expensive tickets. ""It's more for the exposure and publicity it generates."" Such appearances can also expand artists' fan bases and their wallets. Peter Katsis, a music manager and a senior vice president of music for Prospect Park Entertainment, recently told CNN that the temptation is absolutely there for artists to ""just take the check."" ""The attraction is obviously the money,"" said Katsis, who has worked with such performers as the Backstreet Boys, Jane's Addiction and Korn. ""You can sometimes make as much as you can in a week on tour by doing one show."" But Katsis said the recent scandal has some artists thinking twice about where they book their shows. ""I think in light of the current situation, people are going to be asking more questions than ever before,"" he said. Marketing expert Rachel Weingarten said the celebrities are smart to donate the money to charity, though they may want to also consider ways to educate people about world issues and dictatorships. Such scandals can make consumers feel very uncomfortable, she said. ""It's someone who is a pop star right now, and you're thinking, 'Wait a minute, I'm downloading their music, going to see their concert and supporting them, when a year or so ago, they were performing for a dictator.' It puts [the fan] in the equation,"" Weingarten said. ""It suddenly makes people have to question their own politics if they are supporting someone who took this check."" Rajkumar said his company does massive amounts of due diligence, including flying into the country to meet with the key players, checking the source of wire transfers and meeting with representatives from the U.S. embassy there to make sure that there are no concerns about money being funneled out of the country. ""We have to track and do the research that the government that's in place is legitimate,"" he said. ""We talk to the embassy and check out political contacts to make sure our government doesn't have information that the country is being run by a dictator or that funds are being directed out of the country for the leader's benefit."" It is so easy to fall prey to a bad deal, he said, with the use of middlemen and others who may not be very scrupulous. ""You just know that any money coming out of the country is coming from Gadhafi, because he controls the wealth there,"" Rajkumar said.

"(CNN) -- Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon are seemingly headed in different directions. With millions pumped into the squad by its Qatari owners, PSG ended a 19-year title drought in France last season and looks set to challenge for league honors and on the European front for some time. After winning seven consecutive league titles from 2002-2008, Lyon, meanwhile, is now finding it difficult to break into the top two. It also crashed out in Champions League qualifying this week having been a fixture in Europe's most prestigious club tournament for years. And on Saturday, while Lyon fell 2-1 at Evian to suffer a fourth straight defeat in all competitions, PSG scored twice in injury time to see off a spirited Guingamp and move a point behind idle league leader Marseille. Just when it appeared as if newly promoted Guingamp would snatch a point in Paris, substitute Adrien Rabiot pounced on a rebound when keeper Mamadou Samassa couldn't hold on to Alex's header. Zlatan Ibrahimovic doubled the advantage for his first league goal this term to give Laurent Blanc's men two wins and two draws from four outings. The host was full value for all three points, hitting the post, crossbar and dominating possession. Guingamp's only shot on target, though, was a good one. Salvatore Sirigu stopped Mustapha Yatabare on a one-on-one approaching the 80th minute. Two first-half goals from Kevin Berigaud were enough for Evian to see off Lyon, which again played without influential attacking duo Bafetimbi Gomis and Jimmy Briand -- Lyon wants to sell both players. There was more misery for Lyon when star midfielder Yoann Gourcuff left the game with a leg injury before halftime. ""A lot of disappointment with this loss and this bad start to the game,"" Lyon midfielder Fares Bahlouli told the club website. ""It's becoming a habit."" Marseille and Monaco, along with PSG the only other unbeaten teams in Ligue 1, face off Sunday. Rampant Juventus . In Italy, defending Serie A champion Juventus thumped Lazio for the second time this season, winning 4-1 in Turin. Arturo Vidal scored twice and Carlos Tevez continued to find the back of the net since his move from Manchester City, getting Juventus' final goal in the 80th minute. Lazio, routed by Juventus 4-0 in the Italian Super Cup, had midfielder Hernanes sent off in the 63rd minute for a handball offense, although Juventus was already leading 3-1. Juventus and Napoli each have the maximum six points through two games in Serie A.","Two goals in injury time gave Paris Saint-Germain a 2-0 win over Guingamp in Ligue 1 .

"(CNN) -- In Russian, there is an old saying: ""An uninvited guest is worse than a Tatar,"" referring to the country's medieval invaders from the East. Although Edward Snowden's lawyer calls him ""the most wanted man on the planet,"" it's clear that Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, would rather he were just about anywhere else. After five weeks in Sheremetyevo Airport's transit zone, the NSA leaker was allowed to leave on Thursday under a grant of temporary asylum valid for one year. A taxi spirited him to an undisclosed Moscow location, where Putin's Federal Security Service will undoubtedly be watching him closely. To some in the U.S., Snowden's Sheremetyevo escapade seems to have Putin written all over it. The Russian president, who once compared the U.S.'s behavior abroad to that of the Third Reich, seems to rarely miss an opportunity to score points at Washington's expense. Yet the reality is that Putin did not seek out this problem, and now that his agents have presumably debriefed Snowden, he would much prefer for it to disappear. Snowden was -- and remains -- an uninvited guest. Russia's intelligence agencies did not lure the NSA contractor to Moscow. It is not even clear how much they will have learned from him. Russian intelligence must have known already that the NSA was comprehensively monitoring telephone and Internet traffic. Putin, who has never shown a soft spot for whistle-blowers and civil libertarians, is certainly not sheltering Snowden on humanitarian grounds. As a former KGB colonel, he understands the U.S. intelligence community's desire to get the leaker back. But Putin is stuck. He cannot extradite Snowden to the U.S. without looking subservient. At the same time, he has no real interest in further damaging relations with Washington. That might seem strange given the angry rhetoric that regularly issues from Moscow, in particular from the Parliament, where Putin's United Russia party dominates. Just in December, Putin signed a bill banning the adoption of Russian orphans by Americans. However, anti-Americanism has always been a complicated game for the Russian president. On the one hand, it plays well in the provinces. Since December 2011, when Moscow's boulevards erupted into protest, Putin has faced the most serious political challenge of his career. Having lost the support of sophisticated urbanites, his priority has been to shore up his provincial base. One key strategy has been to appeal to more traditional and nationalist constituencies. Kremlin operatives attempt to discredit Putin's critics by portraying them as stooges for an interventionist Washington that seeks to interfere in Russian domestic life. In 2007, Putin compared his opponents to ""jackals,"" scrounging around outside foreign embassies for handouts. Although exploiting xenophobia may seem crude, it works with some segments of the population. Putin wins widespread credit for standing up for Russia's rights and restoring the country's position in the world. Still, while insisting on Russian sovereignty, Putin loses the aura of a skilled statesman if his policies provoke genuine crises. Behind the scenes, and even in public, he has sought accommodation on certain international issues. Putin, the anti-American in chief, personally faced down communist protesters to permit NATO to build a transit hub in the city of Ulyanovsk. Some in Washington have urged President Obama to skip the G20 summit in St. Petersburg in September. Sen. Lindsey Graham even suggested boycotting the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Putin would clearly like to avoid such snubs. But were they to occur, he would cast them as yet another show of U.S. arrogance, a slap in the face not for him personally but for Russia. Assuming the leaders of Western European countries -- where many sympathize with Snowden -- do come to St. Petersburg, the final impression produced by Obama's empty chair might be less of Russian humiliation than of U.S. isolation. For this and other reasons, the White House would probably also prefer to move beyond the Snowden issue. The U.S. public appears ambivalent at this point, uncomfortable about both Snowden's law-breaking and the scope of government snooping. Yet the longer the issue remains in the public eye, the more embarrassing it is likely to become for the administration. For a U.S. attorney general to have to guarantee that a suspect would not be tortured if returned shows how much has changed over the past 12 years. The more officials turn out to have ""misspoken"" in denying existing surveillance programs, the lower trust in government is likely to sink. At the same time, the U.S. has a broader agenda on which it needs to negotiate with Moscow. Syria continues to bleed. Although odds of a breakthrough are low, a joint U.S.-Russian peace conference is supposed to take place in Geneva this fall. The Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs remain urgent challenges. On these and other issues, Russia's U.N. Security Council seat makes it a crucial player. Through 2014, as U.S. troops withdraw from Afghanistan, the NATO transport route across Russian territory will remain important. If Secretary of State John Kerry's latest attempt to revive Middle East peace talks is to bear fruit, the U.S. will at least need to persuade Russia not to become a spoiler. Finally, even on Snowden, the White House may not want to push the Russians too far. As Andrew Kuchins, director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, points out, the U.S. could do worse than to have Snowden remain -- under tight control -- in Moscow. If Putin honors his pledge to stop Snowden harming what Putin called his ""American partners,"" then at least further leaks will be prevented. Were the Russians in frustration to put their uninvited guest on a plane to Ecuador or Cuba, the next morning's newspapers might contain additional revelations. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- The sun is shining, barbecues are out, beaches are packed and the commute to work is slightly less crowded than normal. It can mean only one thing: football's summer transfer window is upon us. Most managers hate it, fans are powerless to resist hourly updates on it; sports journalists worldwide are consumed by it. With a further month of fevered speculation, rumor, counter-rumor and downright subterfuge to come before it closes, CNN tries to work out what it all means. Will he, won't he? Every summer needs a transfer saga. Recent tradition tends to place an Arsenal player at the center of a heart-wrenching drama, with dastardly suitors attempting to steal him away from Arsene Wenger's bosom. Usually, after a summer of emotionally charged hearsay, these players stick around to give the Arsenal boss one more chance to deliver the satisfaction they crave. But eventually, as with Patrick Vieira (Juventus), Thierry Henry (Barcelona), and Robin Van Persie (Manchester United), the lure of new pastures proves too strong, and the bond is broken. This year, in a dramatic break from tradition, it is Arsenal's turn to play the villain in the love triangle, and covet the prized assets of other clubs. Gonzalo Higuain proved to be nothing but a flirt, eventually finding Napoli more enticing than North London. While many label him a bad boy, Arsenal now seem only to have eyes for Luis Suarez. Faint heart, as they say, never won fair maid; but only time will tell whether Arsenal's seduction technique and slightly eccentric offers of Â£40 million, plus one pound, will be enough to tempt the controversial Uruguayan. But none of these great romances can hold a candle to events on the other side of North London. For weeks Tottenham Hotspur have been clinging desperately to Gareth Bale, begging him to remember the good times and promising that a top four finish in the Premier League can make him happy again. Real Madrid, meanwhile, have been suggestively whispering that, while he looks great in white, he'd look even more fabulous in the white of the Castilian giants. Certainly the prospect of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale on their respective wings is more than enough to get most Madrilenos salivating, but until this week it seemed that Spurs would keep their man. Now, however, things have changed; the latest reports indicate the Londoners' passion for Bale has cooled sufficiently for them to admit defeat. As with many a high-profile divorce, however, the scale of the pay-off should at least help to wipe away their tears. Vive la revolution! Time was when the mere suggestion Chelsea or Manchester City were interested in a player pretty much put an end to transfer speculation; indeed, when Edinson Cavani indicated he was ready to leave Napoli behind him, England seemed his inevitable destination. To the surprise of many, however, the towering striker opted to join the newly minted French champions, Paris Saint Germain, instead. The Premier League may still believe itself to be the world's best, but this summer's evidence shows that its spending power may be diminishing. What's more, the traditional big three European leagues -- England, Spain and Italy -- can no longer have it all their own way. For a start the Bundesliga has already demonstrated its strength on and off the pitch, with trophies and multi-million dollar transfer fees alike. France's Ligue 1, however, is making a surprise bid to join the giants. The resurgence of Monaco, and their favorable tax rules for foreigners, has added a new string to the French elite's increasingly impressive bow. Alongside their Qatari-backed Parisian rivals, Monaco are simply outbidding the big spenders, leaving the likes of Chelsea -- who they also beat to the signature of Falcao -- scratching their heads. Suddenly, French football seems a lot more interesting, and Jose Mourinho's billionaire-backed Blues a little less potent. Austerity is for normal people . All over Europe, austerity is biting hard. Unemployment, particularly among the young, is at eye-watering levels, and belts are being tightened accordingly. In England, where former Premier League perennials Coventry City have become the latest club to hit skid row, fans have also been protesting at high ticket prices. All the signs should point to a more sensible age of spending in the game. Of course, we're talking about football here though -- a world where almost nothing makes any sense whatsoever. So while Spanish unemployment lines grow, talk of Real Madrid paying a record-obliterating $120 million for a player many argue they don't really need seems absolutely genuine. In fact, according to a FIFA report, transfer spending over the first six months of 2013 sharply increased, while the list of multi-million dollar deals in this summer's window grows almost daily. It remains to be seen whether spending in 2013 will set new records, but don't bet against it. Are you ITK? Everyone likes a bit of juicy gossip, and starved of the usual stuff to talk about, football fans in summer are particularly susceptible to a little tittle-tattle. The inexorable rise of Twitter has spawned a wave of people claiming to be ""ITK"" (""in the know"") -- particularly supposed agents. The most notorious of these fakes unmasked himself last year, but only after his (completely fabricated) rumors had found their way into the mainstream media. One hapless fan even bought a shirt with the name of an apparently done-deal transfer emblazoned on it. These days it is often hard to tell whether the rumor you have picked up on social media is anything more than a mischievous hoax, but fake agents are not just found on Twitter. A more insidious breed is also playing a highly damaging role in some young footballers' careers. The problem is particularly acute in Africa, where an international scouting camp has been set up to help young players find genuine agents and avoid being exploited by chancers. Even experienced players can be hoodwinked, as Glasgow Rangers striker Francisco Sandanza discovered to his cost earlier this year. The Spaniard was sacked after details of an overly candid phone call with a man purporting to be an agent were made public, to the anger of his employers. Buyer beware. Footballers have feelings too . Wayne Rooney is ""angry"" and ""confused"". Gareth Bale is ""horrified"" and ""distraught"". Meanwhile Arsene Wenger apparently experiences every defeat ""like a death"", so who knows how the Frenchman is coping as Arsenal keep missing out on their transfer targets. Footballers and their agents, managers and chairmen have been reaching for their thesauruses in an attempt to convey the sheer emotional turmoil that the transfer window brings. There are safety issues for the general public too: back in 2006 Ashley Cole almost ""crashed his car in disgust"" when he heard Arsenal were only prepared to offer him Â£55,000 a week, rather than the Â£60,000 he had his heart set upon. Top footballers are fragile creatures. During this unsettling period, as they are forced to endure exotic beach holidays and wonder just how much money might be on the table, one really has to feel for them. Still, with just a matter of weeks to go until the Window closes, calm will soon be restored - at least until it reopens on January 1st, and the whole astonishing business gets underway once again.","The European football season has two transfer windows .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- During a swift pre-trial hearing Tuesday, a South African judge delayed Oscar Pistorius' murder case for two months -- and warned that misconduct in the media could delay the process even longer. The hearing in Pretoria lasted only about 10 minutes. The magistrate granted the prosecution's request to postpone the case until August 19 to allow for more time for the investigation. The judge addressed concerns Tuesday about the ""sanctity of judicial processes."" He said there appears to be a trial by media, which could result in contempt of court. The judge's comments came days after photos of the bloody scene from Pistorius' home were leaked to the media. The Olympic and Paralympic track star made his first public appearance in months during the hearing Tuesday. The judge ordered Pistorius re-released on the same bail conditions he had before. The double-amputee sprinter is charged with premeditated murder for killing Reeva Steenkamp, a model and law school graduate, on Valentine's Day. The date for the murder trial could be announced on August 19 -- which, incidentally, would have been Steenkamp's 30th birthday. No one disputes that Pistorius killed his girlfriend; the point of debate is whether he intended to kill her. Pistorius has said he thought an intruder was inside his house. He said he ran on his stumps to the bathroom, where he shot through a door four times. It was only upon returning to his bedroom, Pistorius said, that he realized Steenkamp was not in bed and that she was actually the one in the bathroom. But prosecutors said the act was a premeditated murder -- that Pistorius had an argument with Steenkamp, put on his prosthetic legs, walked to the bathroom, and shot through the door, intentionally killing his girlfriend. The high-profile case against the Olympic athlete has strained the nerves and patience of some South Africans. ""They've had so much time to prepare the case against Oscar, and now we are expecting nothing more than a postponement,"" Gabi Zaharieva said shortly before the hearing. ""They really have to get going on this."" CNN Exclusive: Photos show Steenkamp's transformation . Taking refuge in uncle's house . Pistorius has been living at his uncle's house in Pretoria for the past three months. He has grown a beard because he doesn't want to be recognized and has surrounded himself with photos of Reeva Steenkamp, his uncle said. ""He's got photos in his room, photos all over the place,"" Arnold Pistorius told CNN's Robyn Curnow. ""He's housebound, you know. He doesn't go out in public places."" Arnold Pistorius described the his nephew's grief as unimaginable. ""What can you say if the person you love the most dies, and you were the instrument? How would you feel? It's unthinkable."" Trouble with the investigation . The police investigation into the killing has been beset by problems and scandals since the start. Hilton Botha, the original lead investigator, admitted during Pistorius' bail hearing that police had failed to wear protective shoe covers at the crime scene because they had run out of them, and that it was possible evidence had been damaged as a result. Botha also drew audible gasps from the packed courtroom when he testified that testosterone had been found at Pistorius' house, before being forced to admit that he hadn't actually read the full name of the substance. The sprinter's lawyers testified that the substance was an herbal remedy. The Paralympian's lawyers also got Botha to acknowledge that investigators had failed to collect any evidence that counters Pistorius' argument that he mistakenly shot Steenkamp. But police spokesman Phuti Setati said authorities are confident Pistorius will be convicted. ""Nothing will distract the detectives from the case. They will remain on course to make sure that they secure a murder conviction."" If convicted of premeditated murder, Pistorius could face life in prison -- which in practice typically amounts to 25 years, unless someone can prove extraordinary circumstances. But even if a judge finds him not guilty of premeditated murder, he could still face a charge of culpable homicide, which is based on negligence. The punishment for culpable homicide is at the court's discretion. Not everyone surprised by Pistorius' fall from grace . CNN's Robin Curnow reported from Pretoria; Holly Yan wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Nkepile Mabuse, Nick Thompson, Hamilton Wende, Susannah Cullinane and Kim Norgaard contributed to this report.","The court granted the prosecution's request to postpone the case until August 19 .

"(CNN) -- With news that Sony Pictures is buying the movie rights to an upcoming biography of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, speculation has jumped to who could play the late tech mastermind. Quoting anonymous sources, the New York Times and other media outlets were reporting that Sony is in final talks and will pay $1 million for the rights to the book, which traces Jobs' story from college dropout to CEO of the world's leading tech company. Simon & Schuster announced last week that, based on the surge of interest in Jobs following his death last week, it would move the release date of the authorized biography, ""Steve Jobs"" by Walter Isaacson, from November 21 to October 24. Capturing the iconoclastic Jobs on the written page is not easy. But finding the right actor to bring him to life onscreen might be an even bigger challenge. ""When you're casting somebody to play someone that is familiar to audiences, you're never going to get somebody that is going to look exactly like them,"" said Tammara Billik, casting director at Billik/Wood Casting in Sherman Oaks, California. ""So you have to get at the sort of internal essence of the person. You have to get their energy."" Think Ben Kingsley as Gandhi, or more recently, Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles. With a Jobs biopic, there's the added difficulty of finding someone who can play him both as a young man starting Apple Computer in his parents' garage with partner Steve Wozniak, and as the 50ish CEO who captivated audiences three decades later with high-profile launches of the iPhone and iPad. And then there's the dramatic weight loss Jobs saw in his final years as he battled pancreatic cancer. The first name that came to Billik's mind was an actor that could capture Jobs in his later years: Stanley Tucci. ""I think physically there's a resemblance,"" she said of the veteran character actor from ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and other films. ""And I think Stanley always plays very bright, articulate men. I think that really speaks to who Steve Jobs was."" Going younger, she mentions another, perhaps less-likely choice: ""Saturday Night Live's"" Andy Samberg. ""He doesn't really look like him, but he doesn't really look like anybody he plays and he pulls it off,"" she said of the actor who has mimicked another tech titan, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, on ""SNL."" In a quick brainstorming session, Billik threw out a list of other possibilities: Josh Stamberg from ""Drop Dead Diva."" ""Heroes"" alum Adrian Pasdar. Matthew Modine. Christian Bale. Jason Schwartzman. Bob Saget. (Yes, Bob Saget. We think that one was a joke). ""You could kind of go down the list and find a lot of people who probably could do it,"" Billik said. ""Nobody is going to be exactly him. But it's got to be somebody who's right -- who's got an intensity to them."" Jobs has already been portrayed on screen once -- by ""ER's"" Noah Wyle in a 1999 made-for-TV movie, ""Pirates of Silicon Valley."" Of course, to cast Jobs' life story today you'd also need another actor to play the shorter, stouter Wozniak. Some first-instinct suggestions: Jack Black, Zach Galifianakis or Philip Seymour Hoffman. In the gallery above, we've collected 10 actors who could bring something interesting to the role. Does one of them work for you? Did we leave out an obvious choice? Let us know in the comments.","Sony Pictures is buying the movie rights to an upcoming Steve Jobs biography .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two current and two former TSA employees have been arrested in an alleged drug and bribery scheme by screeners who allowed large shipments of narcotics to pass through security at Los Angeles International Airport in exchange for cash, federal prosecutors said. Three other people, suspected drug couriers, are allegedly involved. One is in state custody. A second is expected to surrender on Thursday. Authorities are searching for a third. According to a 22-count grand jury indictment unsealed Wednesday, the Transportation Security Administration employees took payments of as much as $2,400 to allow suitcases filled with cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana to pass through X-ray machines at LAX while TSA screeners looked the other way. The indictment outlines five separate incidents that occurred from February 2011 through July 2011. TSA employees allegedly conspired with either drug couriers or an undercover operative working with the Drug Enforcement Administration to smuggle narcotics through checkpoints. In one incident, two suspects allegedly agreed to have a third suspect bring about 5 kilograms of cocaine in a bag through a security checkpoint manned by one of the TSA screeners. But that third screener failed to follow the instructions and went to the wrong security checkpoint, where TSA officials uninvolved in the scheme seized the bag filled with cocaine. In the final incident outlined in the indictment, two TSA screeners allegedly conspired with the DEA confidential source to allow about 8 pounds of methamphetamine to pass through a security checkpoint staffed by one of the two screeners. After the drugs made it through security, the suspect allegedly met the confidential source in an LAX restroom to receive $600 in cash, which was the second half of the agreed-upon $1,200 fee. The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Central District of California says all the defendants were arrested either Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. If convicted, each of the current and former TSA officials faces potential life in prison sentences. ""Airport screeners act as a vital checkpoint for homeland security, and air travelers should believe in the fundamental integrity of security systems at our nation's airports,"" said U.S. Attorney AndrÃ© Birotte Jr. in a news release. ""The allegations in this case describe a significant breakdown of the screening system through the conduct of individuals who placed greed above the nation's security needs.""","Grand jury indictment shows four people have been arrested in alleged scheme .

"(CNN) -- Michigan authorities are pursuing a new lead in the case of the infamous Oakland County child killer who abducted and murdered at least four boys and girls in the 1970s. ""We would be thrilled if this is the one piece of evidence that we are looking for to give closure to the families, but we want to do our due diligence"" said Michigan State Police Lt. Michael Shaw. Parts of a blue AMC Gremlin with a white stripe were unearthed at a construction site in Grand Blanc Township on Monday. The car matches the description of a vehicle seen near the scene of one of the kidnappings. New DNA work may offer break in slayings . ""We received an anonymous tip of car parts recovered in the excavation of a new homes subdivision,"" Shaw told CNN. ""There was that blue colored Gremlin with the white stripe down the side of it. We sent out our crime lab from Bridgeport to investigate and see what the situation was. ""Right now we are continuing to excavate the site to see if there is any more evidence we can locate,"" Shaw said. The Oakland County Child Killer Task Force was also notified, Shaw added. The search for the serial killer has lasted for more than 36 years. Police agencies have pursued some 20,000 tips in the hunt for the perpetrator of the unsolved murders, which took place over a 13-month period between 1976 and 1977. Mark Stebbins was 12 when he was abducted in Ferndale on February 15, 1976. His body was found nearly a year later. Jill Robinson was also 12 when she was kidnapped on December 22, 1976. Her body was found four days later. Kristin Mihelich was 10 when she disappeared in Berkley on January 2, 1977, and her body was found later that month. Timothy King was 11 when he vanished in Birmingham on March 16, 1977. His body was found one week later. Several other children who went missing or were killed during that time may period also may have been victims of the Oakland County child killer, according to the task force. Shaw cautioned that this new lead may turn up empty. ""We're not sure if this has anything to do with it,"" he said. ""In Michigan, this used to be farm land so it was common for farmers to bury their scrap metal. Since this is a vehicle that we have been looking for for years, we will make sure if it's part of the crime scene or isn't, and rule it out.

"(CNN) -- Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Indiana, said Monday afternoon that he won't seek a third term in the Senate -- a major blow to Democrats worried about losses in the midterm elections. ""Congress is not operating as it should,"" Bayh said at a news conference in Indianapolis, adding there's too much partisanship and ""the people's business is not getting done."" Bayh said he loves public service but does ""not love Congress"" and is ""not motivated by strident partisanship or ideology."" He cited the Senate's recent failure to pass a jobs bill and legislation that would have created a deficit reduction commission as evidence of what he characterized as a broken political system. President Obama released a statement praising Bayh for devoting ""his career and his life to serving his fellow Hoosiers."" Bayh, a former two-term governor, was first elected to the Senate in 1998, taking 62 percent of the vote. He won re-election with 64 percent six years later. In his two terms in the Senate, Bayh cut a centrist path and worked across party lines, which at times frustrated liberal Democrats. ""He hates the Senate, hates the left bloggers,"" a friend and longtime adviser to Bayh said. ""They are getting their wish, pure Democrats in the minority."" While Bayh had been mulling retiring for a ""good part of last year,"" he made his final decision not to seek re-election Friday, said another source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Bayh was scheduled to appear Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union With Candy Crowley,"" but his office canceled the appearance late Friday afternoon. Bayh is the third Democratic senator to announce he is retiring when the curtain drops on the 111th Congress. Sens. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota previously said they would not seek re-election. Democrats will have to defend five open seats in November, as Roland Burris of Illinois and Ted Kaufman of Delaware have said they will not run for their own six-year terms. Burris was appointed to Obama's former Senate seat, while Kaufman was appointed to Vice President Joe Biden's old seat. Meanwhile, Republicans will be forced to defend six seats in the midterm elections. Sens. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, Kit Bond of Missouri, Jim Bunning of Kentucky, George Voinovich of Ohio and Sam Brownback of Kansas are all retiring at the end of the year. Sen. George LeMieux of Florida -- who replaced Sen. Mel Martinez after he resigned before the end of his term -- also will vacate his seat. Former Republican Sen. Dan Coats recently announced a bid to challenge Bayh this year. Coats served from 1989 to 1999 but chose not to run for re-election. Bayh won that contest. Former Rep. John Hostettler and state Sen. Marlin Stutzman also are bidding for the GOP Senate nomination in Indiana. Bayh probably would have faced a difficult re-election due to the anti-incumbent political climate, but an Indianapolis Star/WTHR poll conducted in November indicated that 61 percent of Indiana voters approved of the job the senator he was doing, with 24 percent disapproving. Bayh also had nearly $13 million in his campaign war chest. He seemed to face the same frustration many former governors experience when they are elected to the Senate. Instead of being able to make singular decisions, they find themselves members of a slow-moving legislative body where political lines are dug deep. ""I'm an executive at heart,"" Bayh said. ""I value my independence. I'm not motivated by strident partisanship or ideology. These traits may be useful in many walks of life, but they are not highly valued in Congress."" A source noted that Bayh is unclear about what his next step might be but said he would entertain the idea of becoming a university president, running a private business or heading up a charitable endeavor. Another source added that Bayh could consider another bid for Indiana governor. A White House source confirmed Bayh discussed his retirement with Obama well before announcing the decision. However, a Democratic Party source said Bayh's announcement took national Democrats by surprise. The source added that Democratic Reps. Baron Hill and Brad Ellsworth and Evansville, Indiana, Mayor Jonathan Weinzapfel all may consider making bids for the Democratic Senate nomination. ""I appreciate the support of those Hoosiers who have already encouraged me to run for Sen. Bayh's seat,"" Ellsworth said in a statement. ""The next step will be taking a few days to talk to my wife and to folks in Indiana about where I can best serve our state."" The deadline for a candidate to submit the required number of signatures to have his or her name placed on the Indiana primary ballot is noon Tuesday. But if no candidate meets that goal -- and no Democrat is expected to do so -- then the Indiana Democratic Party will be able to choose its nominee. Bayh, a centrist Democrat, reportedly was considered a possible running mate for Obama in 2008. Bayh's father, Birch, served three terms in Senate. CNN's Gloria Borger, Candy Crowley, John King, Mark Preston, Alan Silverleib, Paul Steinhauser, Deirdre Walsh and Jessica Yellin contributed to this report.","NEW: President praises Bayh for devoting ""his career and his life to serving his fellow Hoosiers""

"(CNN) -- Jeremy Lin has taken the basketball world by storm, but boxing star Floyd Mayweather Jr. claims the hype surrounding the NBA's new sensation is based on his ethnic background rather than his talent. Lin has had a fairytale rise to fame after inspiring the New York Knicks to a five-game winning streak and scoring a record 109 points in his first four starts for the team -- surpassing the mark previously set by Allen Iverson. But undefeated WBC welterweight champion Mayweather has suggested the ""Linsanity"" sweeping America is because pointguard Lin is the first U.S.-born NBA player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent. ""Jeremy Lin is a good player but all the hype is because he's Asian,"" Mayweather wrote on micro-blogging website Twitter. The NBA's breath of fresh air . ""Black players do what he does every night and don't get the same praise."" Lin graduated from Harvard University and initially failed to get drafted into the NBA, but he was signed by the Golden State Warriors as a free agent in July 2010. He moved to New York in December after being dropped by the Houston Rockets and outshone the legendary Kobe Bryant by scoring 38 points as the Knicks beat the Los Angeles Lakers 92-85 on Friday. Mayweather, who will fight Puerto Rico's Miguel Cotto in Las Vegas in May before starting a 90-day jail sentence for domestic abuse, said he was speaking up for other players in the NBA. Why Jeremy Lin's race matters . ""Other countries get to support/cheer their athletes and everything is fine,"" the 34-year-old said. ""As soon as I support black American athletes, I get criticized. ""I'm speaking my mind on behalf of other NBA players. They are programmed to be politically correct and will be penalized if they speak up."" Lin and the Knicks will attempt to extend their winning run to six games when they play the Toronto Raptors at the Air Canada Center on Tuesday. Mayweather had hoped to finally face Manny Pacquiao in May in a fight that boxing fans have been waiting years for, but they could not agree on a date.","Boxer Floyd Mayweather claims the Jeremy Lin hype is based on the player's race .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Army sergeant pleaded guilty Monday to gunning down five fellow service members at a combat stress clinic in Iraq after military prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty. Sgt. John Russell admitted to the May 11, 2009, killings at Baghdad's Camp Liberty, telling a Joint Base Lewis-McChord court that he ""did it out of rage,"" according to The News Tribune of Tacoma. The court scheduled a May 6 hearing to determine whether Russell committed the slayings with premeditation, which the 48-year-old soldier has disputed. The outcome will determine whether Russell is sentenced to life without parole or given a lesser sentence. As part of the plea agreement, Russell described to the court how he killed Navy Cmdr. Charles Springle, Army Maj. Matthew Houseal, Sgt. Christian Bueno-Galdos, Spec. Jacob Barton and Pfc. Michael Yates Jr. It was the first time Russell has publicly detailed what happened at the combat stress clinic. Russell, a communications specialist, was on his third deployment to Iraq. His attorneys have argued Russell suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and a brain injury from previous combat, which make him not fully responsible for the killings. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Army Sgt. John Russell admitted to the May 11, 2009, killings in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- A furry bat named after a notorious Star Wars character, bombardier beetles that unleash explosive, foul-smelling gas to defend themselves, ants that can't walk or stand on flat surfaces and a mysterious cave-dwelling frog that runs instead of hopping. These bizarre and wildly interesting creatures are just some of the 1,200 species of animals and plants that have been documented for the first time by scientists in the Gorongosa National Park, a stunning biodiversity haven in central Mozambique. In mid-April, a team of 15 local and international scientists ventured into the park's spectacular rolling woodlands, deep gorges and riverine forests to conduct the first comprehensive biodiversity survey in a remote and largely unexplored area that was ravaged by years of war and poaching. Read this: 7 amazing mountain climbs in Africa . For about four weeks, the biologists were transformed into nature detectives surveying the Cheringoma Plateau, the part of the park that was least known biologically. Armed with rubber boots, headlamps and a huge variety of sophisticated equipment, they embarked on a painstaking mission to document life in the area and discover the rare, threatened and new-to-science species that live in it. They climbed giant trees and rapelled from limestone cliffs to get samples of organisms from almost inaccessible canyons; they used ultraviolet lights and pheromone traps to attract insects; remote cameras and traditional tracking techniques to document large mammals; ultrasonic sound detectors to record hard-to-get wildlife, mist nets to capture wild birds and pitfall traps for reptiles and amphibians. ""We found all kinds of really exciting things,"" says expedition leader Piotr Naskrecki, associate director of the soon-to-open Biodiversity Laboratory in Gorongosa. ""We've at least doubled the number of species that is known from the national park, probably closer to tripling it,"" he adds. ""Some of them are new to Mozambique and some are new to science."" Discoveries . Major findings consisted of 182 species of birds, including four rare forest dwellers recorded for the first time in Gorongosa. They also found several species of cricket-like katydids that are new to science, as well as a leaf katydid that had not been seen alive since the 1800s, and 54 species of mammals, including diminutive elephant shrews. Other highlights included more than 100 species of ants, 47 species of reptiles, 33 species of frogs, hundreds of species of beetles and more than 320 species of plants that are new to Mozambique. And, of course, the ""Chewbacca bat,"" (real name Triaenops persicus) named after Han Solo's hairy sidekick in the Star Wars movies, and a strange silver and black Kassina frog that is probably new to science. ""It was an extremely rich experience in terms of adding data to what we've known about the park,"" says Naskrecki, who is also an entomologist at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology. 'Doomed place' Sitting at the southernmost tip of the Great Rift Valley, Gorongosa used to be one of Africa's richest wildlife refuges, a natural wonderland teeming with large populations of buffalo, lions, elephants and hippos. But it all changed in the mid-1970s when Mozambique descended into a bloody civil war. The conflict lasted until 1992 and had a devastating impact on Gorongosa. The park was turned from a wildlife treasure into a battlefield. Thousands of animals roaming its open grasslands were killed by warring groups and entire populations of wildlife came close to extinction. Read this: Saving the African forest elephant . ""After the war, there was very little left,"" says Naskrecki. ""The place seemed to be doomed."" He explains that before the war the park sheltered some 14,000 African buffalo; after the conflict, there were about 100 of them. ""The same thing with lions,"" adds Naskrecki. ""There used to be about 2,000 lions in the park and after the war there were maybe 30 left,"" he continues. ""It also had about 2,500 elephants and after the war it had only 200."" The decimation continued after the war with extensive poaching and illegal logging. Restoration efforts . But hopes for the park's revival have returned in recent years, thanks in large part to the efforts of the Gorongosa Restoration Project, an initiative led by retired American IT entrepreneur Greg Carr, aiming to bring the fragile ecosystem back to its former glory. In 2008, Carr's foundation signed a 20-year contract with the Mozambican government to rejuvenate and protect the park's diverse ecosystem, as well as create a thriving ecotourism industry that would benefit communities in the area. Key to the restoration efforts is the documentation and studying of life in Gorongosa -- a process that started with the scientific expedition in mid-April. Read this: Could horn sale end rhino slaughter? Naskrecki says the information recorded and collected, which will be presented in its entirety in a report later this year, will help guide restoration efforts in the park. It will also provide proof that Gorongosa is still a biodiversity hotspot that needs to be protected from industrial development, such as mining. ""Every single species we found, every orchid, every katydid, every frog is a powerful argument for maintaining the protective status of this area,"" says Naskrecki . ""The main point, however, is not that we found unusual, rare, or new species, but that we found so many of them and in thriving populations. All this indicates that Gorongosa National Park is successfully recovering from the damage caused by the 17 years of civil war, which left many of its species decimated. ""The small animals ... may seem insignificant compared to lions and elephants, which are also recovering nicely, but they are very good indicators of the health and richness of the Gorongosa ecosystem.""","New species discovered by researchers in Mozambique .

"(CNN) -- Financial markets were in turmoil on Wednesday amid fears that more countries could be sucked into Greece's mounting debt crisis. European indexes followed those in Asia into the red after Standard & Poor downgraded Greece's debt rating to junk status and Portugal's rating also dropped two notches. So what has prompted the crisis and what could happen next? How did Greece get into this trouble? Years of unrestrained spending, cheap lending and failure to implement financial reforms left Greece badly exposed when the global economic downturn struck. This revealed partly fiddled statistics that showed debt levels and deficits exceeded limits set by the European Central Bank. How big are these debts? National debt, put at €300 billion ($394 billion), is bigger than the country's economy, with some estimates predicting it will reach 120 percent of gross domestic product in 2010. The country's deficit -- how much more it spends than it takes in -- is 12.7 percent. Greece crisis deepens on global market sell-off . What does the credit rating downgrade mean? The credit rating is an assessment of a country's ability to repay its debts, and Tuesday's downgrade to junk status, the lowest in the eurozone, means Greece is viewed as a financial black hole by foreign investors. Institutions such as pension funds can no longer buy Greek bonds and it leaves the country struggling to pay its bills as interest rates on existing debts rise. The Greek government of Prime Minister George Papandreou, which inherited much of the financial burden when it took office late last year, has already scrapped most of its pre-election promises and must implement harsh and unpopular spending cuts. And any bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is likely to mean more austerity measures must be introduced. How does this affect the rest of the world? Greece is already in major breach of eurozone rules on deficit management and with S&P downgrading the country's debt rating to junk status, this reflects badly on the credibility of the euro. With other countries such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and the Republic of Ireland all wobbling under massive debts this means a sizable chunk of the eurozone is under great strain. This could knock the whole eurozone into the red, affecting the whole world economy. And if Europe needs to resort to rescue packages involving bodies such as the IMF, this would further damage the euro's reputation and could lead to a substantial fall against other key currencies, especially the U.S. dollar. And what does it mean for ordinary people? If you own shares in banking groups that own Greek bonds, through your pension fund for instance, or in any euro-denominated company in fact, these are likely to have been hit hard. But if you're traveling to Europe on vacation, it is likely your own currency will go further, especially if you have dollars. So what is Greece doing? As already mentioned, the government has started slashing spending and has implemented austerity measures aimed at reducing the deficit by more than €10 billion ($13 billion). It has hiked taxes on fuel, tobacco and alcohol, raised the retirement age by two years, imposed public sector pay cuts and applied tough new tax evasion regulations. How have these measures been received? Badly. There have been warnings of resistance from various sectors of society and workers across the country have staged strikes closing airports, government offices, courts and schools. This industrial action is expected to continue. How are Greece's European neighbors helping? Led by Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, all 16 countries, including the other ailing countries such as Ireland, which make up the eurozone have agreed a $50-billion bailout plan for their ailing neighbor. Last week, Greece announced it would finally tap this package. The package involves co-ordinated bilateral loans from countries inside the common currency area, as well as funds and technical assistance from the IMF. Any European-backed loan package requires the unanimous approval of eurozone members, meaning any country in the zone, would have veto power. Merkel's government is under international pressure to put forward the money, but with state elections scheduled for the next few days, it is also facing great pressure at home to hold back. Will the IMF have to produce a bigger package and how soon? There is much talk in the markets that the IMF would and should increase its portion of the Greek bailout and fast. Should the IMF come up with say another $15 billion would it be enough? Some people want to see a knockout loan from the Eurozone and IMF closer to $100 billion to give Greece enough firing power to cool the speculation on a default. CNN's Jim Boulden contributed to this report.","Financial markets in turmoil amid fears more countries could be sucked into Greek debt crisis .

"New York (CNN) -- New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Tuesday fired back at the president of Yale University and others who have suggested city police went too far in their surveillance of Muslims. ""We have to keep this country safe,"" the mayor told reporters, addressing questions about an Associated Press report that said the NYPD was closely monitoring Muslim student associations in schools across the Northeastern United States. ""If people put things on websites and make them available to everybody, of course the NYPD is going to look at anything that's publicly available in the public domain,"" Bloomberg said. ""And given we've had a dozen people arrested or convicted of terrorist acts who've come from similar organizations, we have an obligation to do so."" The AP article said police have tracked websites, and on one occasion sent an undercover officer with students from The City College of New York on a whitewater rafting trip. ""The police department goes where there are allegations,"" the mayor said, adding that the city's officers are seeking to protect ""the very things that allow Yale to survive."" But Yale President Richard Levin described New York's surveillance program as ""antithetical to the values"" of the New Haven, Connecticut, university and those of the nation. When asked by a reporter if police had gone too far by sending the agent on the rafting trip, Bloomberg responded ""no."" Police spokesman Paul Browne told CNN that his agency does not monitor students directly, but confirmed it does monitor the websites they use. ""In any case where you see an NYPD officer present, it's an indication that we were looking at an individual,"" he said. Browne accused the AP of ""hyping these stories"" to sensationalize them. He provided a list of 12 people arrested or convicted on terrorism-related charges in the United States who were once members of Muslim student associations. The Columbia University Muslim Students Association condemned the police practice in a statement Tuesday. ""We are concerned that news reports about NYPD's presence on our campus have a chilling effect on the intellectual freedom necessary for a vibrant academic community,"" it read. In December, a prominent group of Muslim leaders boycotted Bloomberg's annual interfaith breakfast in protest of the controversial program. The move stemmed from a series of earlier news reports that raised questions about the nature of a CIA partnership with the NYPD that allegedly helped to build city intelligence programs to spy on Muslims. The boycott stood in a stark contrast to the goodwill the mayor earned among Muslim leaders when he defended plans for a controversial Islamic community center near the former site of the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. The CIA later announced its internal watchdog found no issue or evidence of wrongdoing in the spy agency's partnership with the NYPD.","The mayor addresses an AP report that said police monitored Muslims at various schools .

"NAPLES, Italy (CNN) -- The Italian prime minister plans to declare Friday that the worst part of a garbage crisis in Naples is over, even though a visit to one neighborhood found residents still living amid huge piles of trash. Garbage has been piling up in the streets of Naples since a municipal dump was closed on December 31. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is due to make the announcement after a cabinet meeting in Naples, according to the national ANSA news agency. He is expected to say that the first phase of his government's response to the crisis -- the emergency phase -- is over. That first phase has involved cleaning up rotting garbage that has accumulated in the streets since the government closed one of two dumps in this southern Italian city. Now, Berlusconi plans to focus on the second phase of his response to the garbage crisis. That involves long-term solutions such as implementing a viable system of garbage collection, incineration and recycling. Despite the prime minister's planned announcement, however, a CNN correspondent who visited one neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples on Friday found residents still tossing garbage into the street. They said they had nowhere else to put it and complained of a lack of trash bins and recycling facilities. The piles were smaller than a few months ago, and the odor was not as bad, but the visit demonstrated that Berlusconi and his government have a long way to go in addressing the crisis. iReport.com: See trash piled high . The prime minister told ANSA that the government had made great strides in addressing the problems. ""Besides the 7,000 tons collected per day,"" he said, ""we have collected 35,000 tons that were left unaddressed."" Naples' garbage problems have been around in some form for nearly 15 years, but they flared December 31, when the Italian government closed one of the area's two working dumps at the request of nearby residents. As trash piled up, officials closed some schools to protect children from noxious fumes. The government moved some waste to temporary landfills and even shipped some of it to other parts of Italy and Europe. In May, two months after he took office, Berlusconi appointed a ""garbage czar"" to focus on the crisis, giving him the authority to open new dump sites and landfills in the region.","Italian PM Berlusconi to declare worst of Naples garbage crisis is over .

"(CNN) -- Thailand is facing its worst flooding since 1942, with 373 people dead, more than nine million affected and 28 -- or more than a third -- of the nation's provinces at least partially flooded after a series of strong seasonal storms that brought exceptional rainfall. More than a billion cubic meters of runoff are expected to pass through some of the northern parts of Bangkok on its way toward the Gulf of Thailand, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) away, as high tides are set to peak on Saturday. CNN takes a look at what the low-lying Thai capital, which straddles the Chao Phraya River, is experiencing, with insights from Craig Steffensen, Asian Development Bank's country director for Thailand. Q. What do high tides mean for the city? ""Picture the equivalent of 480,000 Olympic-sized pools of water trying to make their way through Bangkok at the moment,"" Steffensen said Friday. ""Combined with the floodwaters trying to get out and the tides coming in...we could see a perfect storm in Bangkok. "" The capital lies barely above sea level and is already sinking within the Chao Phraya delta, as sea levels in the Gulf of Thailand rise. The city is protected by dikes, but they may not be high enough to cope with the current flooding. ""Barriers on the north side of Bangkok are 3 to 3.5 meters (10 to 11.5 feet) high, and water is penetrating these barriers,"" Steffensen pointed out. Especially hard-hit are the industrial areas to the north, Ayutthaya and Pathum Thani. Authorities have been diverting waters to the east and west of Bangkok to get them out to the Gulf. But dam levels are already at 100 percent capacity, if not more, said Steffensen. ""It's anybody's guess what Bangkok will look like in next 24-48 hours,"" he added. Q. How protected is the historic heart of the city? Floodwaters have already reached roads around Bangkok's historic Grand Palace and Emerald Buddha Temple. According to MCOT, the Thai media company, the level of the Chao Phraya River had reached 2.46 meters (8 feet), or sea level, and was expected to rise further by evening. Flooding had already affected more than 200 of 500 temples in Ayutthaya province, home to the World Heritage Site, its governor has said. Further assessment cannot be made until the water recedes, however. Q. Has the transportation network been able to weather the floods, given the elevated roads and rail network? Bangkok's main international and domestic Suvarnabhumi airport is operating normally and is protected with a 22.5 km (14-mile), 3-meter (10-foot ) dike system. Also running are the elevated Skytrain and the underground metro system. Nearly 80 highways in 15 provinces are impassable, and northbound rail services have been suspended, according to the government. However, trade and commerce have picked up, as people find ways to bypass the floods by going east or west in order to reach the north, Steffensen noted. Don Muang Airport, which primarily services domestic flights, has been closed since Tuesday night after floodwaters inundated runways and affected the lighting. Nok Air and Orient Thai, which both usually operate from there, have since moved operations to Suvarnabhumi. The flood relief operation will nonetheless continue to operate from Don Muang, which had housed flood victims but was forced to evacuate them to other locations. Q. How is Bangkok holding up, as far as water supplies, sanitation and power supplies? Floods in areas to the northeast of Bangkok have forced people to upper floors of dwellings and led to the loss of electricity, water supply and sanitation. Access to drinking water in remote areas is a concern. Steffensen said that despite being in a location that isn't near floods, ""the tap water in our residences has taken a funny smell."" People are choosing bottled water over boiled water, but finding bottled water in stores is difficult because the shelves are empty. Power supply, internet and telephone service are functioning normally in the center of Bangkok, he said. Q. What is the economic toll? The World Bank has estimated a 2 percent decline in GDP because of the floods. ""The urban poor is mostly likely to be the hardest hit,"" said Steffensen. Most of the flooding has occurred in flood-prone areas with condensed housing . Floods have caused $5 billion in damage to industries and half a dozen industrial estates, said Steffensen, with Japanese industries alone facing losses of at least half that amount, he said. Read more about Thai floods stalling automakers . Although he expressed reluctance to talk about the overall economic impact at this point, Steffensen said certain things were clear: ""Rice production will decrease in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, and rice prices will be affected. That billions of dollars of investment in the industrial sector are underwater are bound to affect Thailand's exports, employment situation, economic growth and development."" Industrial estates could take weeks if not months to drain and get production lines back running again, creating bumps in supply chains and possibly affecting manufacturers' abilities to get good on shelves by Christmas, he added. Rice exports were expected to drop 50 percent in October from the monthly average of 1 million tonnes, according to the Thai Rice Exporters Association. Q. What are the positives for Bangkok right now? The floods have proven to be a political test for the new prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, who was elected in July. ""The government has gone all out, everything they could possibly do to mitigate the impact of these floods,"" said Steffensen. But more striking is the resilience of the Thai people, he said. ""In relief centers and more generally across the country, no one's talking about red shirts or yellow shirts. All people are talking about the floods, helping one another. These floods have healed the country in a way that many people don't appreciate today because the floods are about to come through Bangkok."" Q. What vulnerabilities will Bangkok need to address? Authorities will need to raise dikes and invest in pump station capacity, coastal zone protection and land use planning, Steffensen said. The increasing number of floods in Thailand and the region are consistent with what's expected as a result of climate change. Bangkok and other Asian coastal megacities -- like Ho Chi Minh City and Manila -- will flood more often and on a larger scale, if current climate change trends continue, he added, citing a joint report by the ADB, World Bank and Japan International Cooperation Agency last year.","Steffensen: Bangkok facing 480,000 Olympic-sized pools of water .

"(CNN) -- The speed at which the global economy has pivoted from the West to emerging economies like China is astounding, says author Niall Ferguson.

""That's an amazing reduction in the global imbalance and it's happen in the space really of 30 years."" ""The West is at a different phase of development -- economically, demographically -- and it's also at a different place culturally from these countries that are emerging from various forms of economic control -- whether the bureaucratic system of post-Raj India or the communist system that was gradually dismantled economically in China after 1978,"" he said. This is bringing back one of the most remarkable shifts in the global balance of economic power."" Ferguson sat down last week with CNN's Andrew Stevens in detailed talk on the global economy. What are the underlying reasons for the decline of the West? In our lifetime Western ascendancy is coming to an end, after 500 years, when the story was the great divergence -- when the west got much richer than everybody else. And it's extraordinary that really since the 1970s, this historical tide has turned. I think there are two processes at work here. One is the rest of the world -- led by China -- have been downloading our killer applications. They have been imitating the things that work well in the West, particularly in the realm of business. And this is to be celebrated. It's great to see countries like China and India lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty by essentially copying Western ways of doing things. But I think there is another process at work, which is in some ways independent -- the West is becoming less good at being the West. The things that worked well in the West for over half a millennia don't work so well now. And one way of looking at it is to say: Why is it that the Western economies have malfunctioned? It's not just that there ways a financial crisis and bankers are terrible people. It's much more profound than that. Why are Western economies performing so badly? One way of thinking about this is to ask why so many economies, most of them Western -- Japan is the exception -- are currently crushed by debt, which in some cases exceed 100% of GDP? And these debts are forecast to rise even further in the U.S. The simple answer is to say there is a terrible problem of government extravagancy, but I don't think that's the right answer. One way of thinking about this is to say that debt represents a tax on the future. And the big accumulation of debt that we've seen over the last 20 or 30 years in the Western world reflects a breach of contract between the current generation and the next generations. And these debts represent a big burden on the future. And that is one reason I think we've seen a slowdown in the Western world because these burdens of debt act as a major check on economic dynamism. Why has this generation decided to ignore future generations? Why have we become so selfish? At some level I think it's a cultural shift. We've moved a long way from our ideals of self-sacrifice for the future that characterized the West during its hay days of industrialization, overseas expansion -- not to mention large-scale warfare. So there's partly been a cultural shift towards the 'me generation' -- consume now, live in the present. But I think it's slightly more than that. I think what happened after World War II was that it was decided in most Western countries to create pretty generous welfare states that were going to exist to transfer resources from the rich to the poor. And that worked pretty well. It did reduce inequality in those countries when these systems were introduced. But over time the welfare state has become dysfunctional in a surprising way. But in a way it became a victim of its own success: It became so successful at prolonging life, that it becomes financially unsustainable, unless you make major changes to things like retirement ages. And everywhere you see the same basic story, whether you're looking at northern Europe, southern Europe, or north America -- welfare states become harder and harder to finance, and structural budget deficits emerge. That's to say deficits that are there even when the economy is growing well. And I think these are symptoms of a more profound problem that is causing the Western slowdown. Contrast that with the story in Asia, where welfare states, let's say in China, are much less well developed. Is it going to take something like a fiscal cliff -- a sovereign debt crisis -- to bring this period to an end? The European experience suggests nothing gets done until there is a crisis. And this crisis has begun in countries like Spain, Greece, Ireland, and I think soon it will spread to France, as people begin to realize that the French position is actually no better than the other Latin European countries. At some point one can imagine a crisis like that happening in the most developed Asian economy, Japan. And I think sooner or later it may end up happening in the U.S. Although I must say I'm becoming less and less sure that will happen soon. There are things happening in the U.S. that make it quite different, in the sense for example that the demographics are not so bad -- partly because of immigration -- and also interestingly the U.S. is about to have the most amazing free lunch on the back of shale gas and shale oil. The US economy is going to get a really big shot in the arm. U.S. set for fracking bonanza, says historian Ferguson . What then is the restructuring that needs to happen at an economic level in the West? Well, I think the most important thing to recognize is that it's not just about taxing and spending. If you define this too narrowly in fiscal terms then you end up in the mess that southern Europe is in -- trying to balance the budget, even as your economy is shrinking. It's better I think to ask questions of a more profound nature about the institutional framework within which society operates. To me one of the most profound contrasts between the West and the rest is that things like the rule of law -- regulation, bureaucracy -- are becoming more burdensome in Western countries, even as they are becoming less burdensome in emerging markets. You mean they are getting in the way of development? They really are. I mean one of the main arguments that I make in my new book, ""The Great Degeneration,"" is that the rule of law in the US is becoming the rule of lawyers. The legal profession has become a very major source of cost for business. You have very complex regulation and a very parasitic legal profession, and it battens off the private sector. It's almost impossible for any major organization to function without a huge compliance department and teams of lawyers. And that is all just dead cost. It doesn't really add to the productivity of the economy. And I think that's one of the things that I am trying to focus on: Why is our regulation so over-complicated? Why does the tax code occupy shelves, rather than just a few pages? And why is it that if you want to regulate the financial sector, you need a bill that is 2000-plus pages long? If we could aspire for greater simplicity and transparency in the tax code and most regulation, I think there would be real benefits. As China cherry picks the best of the West, do you think they may also fall into Western excesses as well: Is this an evolutionary likelihood? It's possible. They have some way to go. Short-term, I think the biggest problem facing the Chinese is the rule of law question. It's not the democracy question. It's more -- can China transition to a system in which the rule of law really works? That matters a lot for China's rapidly growing middle class. They want security for their property. They do not want to feel that they could have their property confiscated by an all powerful party at the drop of a hat. It's not difficult to see what China needs to do, but whether it can do it politically, whether it can override the vested interests, or not, I really don't know. If you think about it China is acquiring this huge middle class that's one of the direct consequences of rapid growth. And historically if you look at the Western experience it's the middle class that starts to push for rule of law and representative government and freedom of the press -- those are middle class things to want. You really don't worry about those things if you're a peasant or an industrial worker. It's inevitable I think that as this class grows in China, it will start to behave in the ways that middle classes always behave. And the Communist Party is not well set-up to meet those demands.

"(CNN) -- As the Iranian people get ready to cast their votes for one of the six remaining presidential candidates, as vetted by the country's Supreme Leader and the Guardian Council, a free election is under way in the virtual world -- where technology and the Internet are creating an alternative platform for Iranians to raise their voices. With just days until the June 14 election, a cyber-voting space is running a ""virtual election."" This campaign -- free from the Islamic regime's constraints -- is helping to provide a virtual space for voters inside Iran to ""freely"" choose their preferred candidate. Russian chess legend Garry Kasparov is leading this effort, known as the ""We Choose"" campaign. He is joined by other internationally recognized former government officials, human rights advocates and technology experts. ""Democracy is both a political right and a human right,"" said Kasparov, chairman of the We Choose global committee. ""The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Iran has also signed, declares that the will of the people shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections -- which are not the case in the current system of Iran, so if we want to understand the real opinion of the Iranian people, we need to give them an alternative platform to vote and to express their preferences,"" he said. After the 2009 election many Iranians protested against Ahmadinejad's re-election alleging severe voting fraud. Soon after, the opposition was systematically crushed by regime forces, which left the massive movement for change in Iran shattered. Read more: Repressed voices speak out in Iran . ""Such 'parallel institutions' as We Choose give people space to express their will and grievances freely -- it's also what we called a 'low risk tactic' of dispersion as opposed to 'high risk tactic' of concentration, such as mass rallies and protests,"" said Srdja Popovic, a Serbian lawyer and political activist whose creative opposition tactics helped topple the government of Slobodan Milosevic in 2000. He adds that such tactics are suitable for societies with high levels of oppression and fear, ""and Khamenei's Iran is unfortunately exactly like that."" Popovic is the founder of the Center for Applied Non-Violent Action and Strategies (CANVAS). According to the Atlantic, the young Iranians protesting against Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's re-election in 2009 downloaded 17,000 copies of Popovic's guide to nonviolent action. ""People are not satisfied with the Iranian election inside Iran because of the election process, there is no independent monitoring, and there is no international supervision, so the election is not free and fair."" said Reza Ghazinouri, a young Iranian who fled Iran after expressing opposition toward the regime in the 2009 election aftermath. Like many of his friends inside Iran, Reza believes people are disappointed with this upcoming election, where they feel their voices cannot be heard. Aspiring to help raise the Iranian people's voices, We Choose claims to provide a secure space, where aside from the official nominees, there are 12 other candidates that represent a wide range of socio-political perspectives. Former reformists and Green Movement representatives Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, who the Iranian regime currently has under house arrest, are among the 12 ""virtual candidates."" Representing views from outside Iran, Reza Pahlavi, Iran's heir to the Pahlavi monarchy is another candidate, as well controversial figures like Mariam Rajavi, President of the National Council of Resistance of Iran or Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK). The U.S. removed Rajavi's organization from its list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations last year. Read more: Iranian exile group removed from U.S. terror list . ""While there are an enormous number of possible candidates, our list of 20 candidates is representative of the broad political spectrum and not just chosen from a single political ideology."" Kasparov told CNN, suggesting ""this process can be a step forward towards building a healthy and strong civil society in Iran, which promotes democracy and freedom."" We Choose also listed Nasrin Sotoudeh, an Iranian human rights lawyer currently jailed in Tehran's Evin prison among its candidates. Former president Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani and Ahmadinejad's protege Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei - both disqualified from this year's race by the Guardian Council - are also among the 20 candidates. A similar virtual voting platform was applied in Russia during the October 2012 elections, which was also headed by Kasparov and Leonid Volkov -- the architect of the design team behind the virtual election platform. The Russian cyber election voicing opposition to Vladimir Putin resulted in 82,000 participant voters. As the Iranian government tightens cyberspace access and begins monitoring of Internet activities, satellite space, and mobile communication ahead of the election, these virtual campaigners say they have created a cyber security system that cannot be monitored or hacked by the regime. Read more: Iran tightens grip on cyberspace . ""The system we have created for the Iranian election is arguably the most secure and sophisticated platform of its kind ever developed,"" said Volkov. ""The Iranian people will be able to cast their 'virtual' votes without worrying about a knock on the door in the night."" This technology is exclusive to Iranians inside Iran who can use their mobile phones to cast their votes by SMS. Phil Zimmermann's cyber-security firm Silent Circle helped to ensure anonymity for voters and the ""one vote for one person"" process. Kasparov also told CNN the biggest challenge for the virtual platform was ""finding the right balance between maximum security for the voters, and thereby ensuring safety through anonymity, and protecting the reliability of the results by preventing mass manipulation."" While many still speculate about the success of this campaign and challenges to internet access and cell-phone use in Iran, Nazie Eftekhari one of the Iranian-American community's leading voices and co-founder of The Foundation for the Children of Iran, believes history belongs to those who show up and support creative ways that support democracy and reform. ""If you look at Tunisia and Egypt, it all started as a Twitter and Facebook campaign. Back in the days, wars and change began with shots and gunfire around the world, but nowadays it could be one SMS that could be heard around the world and create change."" Eftekhari is also a board member of the We Choose global committee, as are NASA scientist Firouz Naderi, renowned historian Francis Fukiyama and six other internationally recognized figures. Only one day into the start of this virtual election on June 7, almost 500 people voted inside Iran. An Iranian voter who asked to remain anonymous created a blog post to show other Iranians the process through which he cast his SMS vote. The blogger also publicized how voting cannot go through some mobile-service providers in Tehran. We Choose technicians said that his post helped their cyber security team trouble shoot the technical glitch and continue to improve voting. Inside Iran, Osoolgara, a website close to the Supreme Leader has condemned this campaign and called it a ""CIA operation against the Islamic Republic of Iran, that is led by one of its agents Garry Kasparov."" Other Iranian-government news agencies including Fars News and Mashregh are calling this effort a CIA operation that is aiming to hurt the Islamic Regime. Today, virtual elections and characters have created new rallying fields that compete with the Islamic regime. This virtual election continues until June 13, where the ""virtual winner"" will be announced on the morning of the actual Iranian presidential election on June 14. ""I want to send a message of hope to the people of Iran and to show them that the whole world is watching what happens there,"" Kasparov told CNN, a message he hopes can potentially model an opportunity to ""operationalize democracy in nations where people are not able to express their true political views.""

"(CNN) -- A proposed mosque and Islamic center in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, is dividing the city about 35 miles southeast of Nashville, Tennessee. Residents are battling about whether the center should exist, and if not, why not. The Islamic Center of Murfreesboro currently resides in the southwest part of town. The center purchased a new 15-acre site just a few miles to the east in November for $320,000, according to its website, with plans to build on the property. Proponents of the mosque allege the opponents are displaying religious intolerance, while people fighting the mosque say zoning concerns and worries about Islamic radicalism are their chief concerns. Several hundred opponents marching from a middle school to a courthouse faced off against roughly the same number of counter-protesters Wednesday. The rhetoric was heated. Protesters bore signs with slogans such as ""MOSQUE LEADERS SUPPORT KILLING CONVERTS."" ""In Islam, a mosque means 'We have conquered this country,'"" one man told CNN affiliate WTVF. ""And where are they? They're in the center of Tennessee. They're going to say, 'We have conquered Tennessee.'"" Despite the polarizing debate, the march was nonviolent. Murfreesboro Police spokesman Kyle Evans said Thursday that ""no reports of any kind"" were filed. Kevin Fisher, who led the protest, said opponents are ""going to contend every brick that's laid."" ""We're going to keep marching, attending meetings,"" Fisher said. ""There may be legal stuff coming down the road at some point."" Fisher said he's mainly concerned about water quality, soil contamination and traffic flow on the nearby Bradyville Pike, which he says is a dangerous highway. ""This has nothing to do with racism or religious intolerance at all. It's about a difference of opinion, and in America that's OK,"" said Fisher, an African-American who said he has experienced racial intolerance in his life. ""Religion. Race. These are just code words ... used to distract from the real issues,"" he said. ""If Home Depot was burying bodies in the water supply ... I would be equally concerned."" The water and soil concerns stem from the Islamic center's burying a body on the new property ""without a casket or proper embalming,"" Fisher said. Doug Demosi, the Rutherford County Regional Planning Commission Director, said Thursday the center had permission before interring the body and it doesn't appear any state regulations were violated. ""Generally, religious organizations are exempt from some rules,"" Demosi said. The center does not have approval for future burials and the planning commission has no plans to allow a cemetery on the grounds, Demosi added. Claire Rogers, the spokeswoman for the group that organized Wednesday's counter-protest, Middle Tennesseans for Religious Freedom, disputed Fisher's assertions. ""No one marches to a courthouse to deliver a petition based on traffic concerns,"" she said. The Facebook page for Rogers' group says, ""We, as tolerant and loving community members, come together to defend the right of any member of our community to worship and express his, her, or their faith no matter the religion. We will not stand idly by while Muslim people in our community are represented falsely and assaulted on a psychological level."" While some of the marchers may have been inspired to protest by the water, soil and traffic concerns, ""from signs being held and things supporters said, it was evident that was not the driving force. It's a result of Islamaphobia and misinformation about local Islamic community,"" Rogers said. Fisher said his ""group of concerned citizens"" is focused on stopping the new facility from being built. He has filed a grievance against the Rutherford County Regional Planning Commission, claiming that commission failed to provide adequate public notice on the internet when it was considering the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro's site plans. Demosi said the commission has been cleared of any violation of open meeting requirements. Demosi said that since the Islamic Center offered site plans for approval that didn't involve rezoning, the commission only was legally bound to post a notice in a general circulation newspaper, which it placed in the Murfreesboro Post. The commission has placed its notices in the Murfreesboro Post for the past two years, after years of posting them in Murfreesboro's larger Daily News Journal, Demosi said. He said the change was made in an effort to save taxpayer dollars. Demosi admitted the commission didn't make any mention on its website of plans to discuss the Islamic Center at its May 24 hearing, and said he wasn't sure why that information was never posted online. But he said internet postings are a ""courtesy we haven't been doing all that long,"" not a legal requirement. ""We followed our protocols and feel that we did it according to the letter of the law,"" Demosi said. But Jay Heine, campaign manager for Republican Congressional candidate Lou Ann Zelenik, said that the commission didn't do its due diligence scrutinizing the Islamic center's funding and ties, rushing the process through. Earlier this week, Zelenik called for a ""clean accounting and thorough investigation"" of individuals involved with funding the proposed Islamic center and expressed concerns that one of the center's board members had hate speech on his MySpace page and supports Hamas, which the United States has designated a terrorist group. CNN affiliate WTVF reported that Islamic leaders said a board member has been suspended while they investigate the hate-speech claims. ""Lou Ann was on the planning commission until she ran for Congress. These are things she herself would have looked into more,"" Heine said. Zelenik is running in the August 6 primary. On the Democratic side, candidate Ben Leming, a U.S. Marine and veteran of the Iraq war, has criticized Zelenik's position on the mosque, saying she and other local leaders are using fear to divide the community. ""What do we have to be afraid of? During my deployments around the world, I have worked, trained, and broken bread with Muslims. ... The people that want to build a house of worship in Murfreesboro are not the enemy,"" he was quoted as saying in a June 18 story published in the Daily News Journal. Repeated calls to the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro were not immediately returned Thursday. A statement on the center's website said that 95 percent of the money for the project was raised locally, in middle Tennessee, in a three-month period. ""This is the first step in multistage endeavor process that may last up to several year[s] based on our community's growth and the fundraising,"" the website said. The long-term plans for the new Islamic Center call for a buildout to 52,000 to 53,000 square feet, but the first phase would be less than 10,000 square feet, Demosi said. He said that because of the relatively small initial size of the center, he didn't believe traffic impact would be as bad as Fisher expected, but added, ""In 20 to 25 years it may be worse and we can re-assess."" Murfreesboro's population has spiked in recent years. It grew about 33 percent, from 68,816 people to 92,559, between 2000 and 2006, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2000, about 5 percent of Murfreesboro's populace was foreign-born -- almost twice the average in the state of Tennessee, the Census Bureau said. Rogers said the population influx may have sparked some xenophobia on the part of some residents, but she said it ""helps enrich"" the college town. Murfreesboro is home to Middle Tennessee State University, which has an enrollment of 25,188, according to the university website.","Islamic Center of Murfreesboro wants to change location, build a mosque .

""It's something we never dreamed of, to try to win four in a row. It's too hard to dominate in doubles,"" he added. ""Maybe we had a little luck involved along the way. We just took one at a time.

"(CNN) -- Ghassan Hitto once held court as an information technology manager in a safe Texas office. Now he's halfway across the world, in charge of a corner of hell. Hitto is the new head of the Syrian opposition's interim government. He'll use his ample and savvy management experience -- honed by his years as an executive in the IT field in Dallas and his activist work for his native Syria and Muslims -- to administer the large swaths of territory seized by rebels from the Bashar al-Assad government during the raging civil war. People who've worked with Hitto are proud of his achievement and say he'll do well. Oday Shahin, a Muslim community leader in Dallas, said he thinks Hitto will seize the day during a ""historic moment"" for war-torn Syria. That's because he's sharp, forthright, passionate, inspiring, well-respected and a ""consensus leader."" ""He's one of those executives in a board room that impress you. He knows what he's talking about,"" Shahin said. ""He's sacrificing his career. He's sacrificing his family. He's sacrificing his safety."" Hitto's life straddles the Middle East and the United States. He is a dual citizen of the United States and Syria. Born in Damascus in 1963, Hitto spent much of his school and working life in the United States, first in Indiana and most recently in Texas. He earned a bachelor's degree in computer science and mathematics from Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and then a master's in business administration from Indiana Wesleyan University. For more then a decade, he worked as a senior executive at an IT firm in Dallas. 2 years into Syrian uprising, revolutionaries on dreams, cost . A passionate U.S. activist . He's married to Suzanne Hitto and they have four children. One of his sons, Obaida, has worked for the opposition in Syria and was hurt in a bombing there. Ghassan Hitto supports the efforts of his son, who had been intent on going to law school but decided to help families in Syria. ""My son Obaida consulted me at the beginning of the revolution, asking me to allow him to enter Syria to participate in the relief and first-aid work. With the difficulty of this situation, I agreed without hesitation."" ""Now he is working with his fellow revolutionaries to transfer facts and to help people in distress and I am proud of him. Of course I wish from the almighty God to bring him safe to me and to return all Syrian youths safely to their families unharmed and victors,"" Hitto said recently. During his years in Texas, Hitto was active in community affairs, working as a board member at a Muslim school, Brighter Horizons Academy, and the Islamic Service Foundation, a nonprofit ""dedicated to establishing an educational institution conducive to an Islamic environment."" His wife teaches English at the academy and three of his children are graduates. The academy said that Hitto's ""management and leadership skills"" helped the groups and fostered their successes. ""During his time as a volunteer, we saw him as a practical man with great management experience. He was always open minded and open to debate. He conducted himself with the highest honesty and integrity,"" the academy said in a statement. ""His talent for bringing people together for the common good will be missed in our community. ... His management and leadership skills benefited our organizations tremendously,"" the academy said. As the Arab Spring unfolded two years ago, Hitto threw himself into Syrian activism. He was a founder of the Syrian American Council, the Coalition of Free Syria and the Shaam Relief Foundation. ""Mr. Hitto was a pioneer to raise funds to send direly needed humanitarian aid to Syrians, as well as raise awareness of the events happening in Syria,"" the Shaam Relief Foundation said in a statement. When he visited the region, he got involved with the opposition Syrian National Coalition and became the opposition's humanitarian aid commissioner, charged with allocating and distributing relief in the areas seized from the al-Assad government, Shaam Relief said. Several months ago, he took a leave of absence from his IT work in Texas to focus on working with the National Coalition's Assistance Coordination Unit. That entity is responsible for forging ties with nongovernment organizations and increasing the flow of Syria-bound aid. At a protest last year in Texas, Walk for the Child of Syria, Hitto's passion against the al-Assad government was on bold display. He spoke proudly of his son's activities in the Syrian area of Deir Ezzor and passed along Obaida's perspective about the citizens' morale. He described the government's violence against children, and pleaded for help from the dozens who came out to listen. ""The Syrian people,"" he said, ""are proud people. Asking for help is not in our nature. This is something new to us."" But people who are dying of hunger or are injured there need help, he said, and help can come from Dallas through donations. The humanitarian crisis stoked by the Syrian civil war is so widespread that potential donors might be discouraged from thinking they can make a difference. Hitto takes on that mindset. He hits home the message that local is global and global is local. ""The situation in Syria is a disaster from a humanitarian perspective. Don't get to the point where you convince yourself that your donation and your contribution will not make a difference,"" he said at a recent Shaam banquet. ""Unless we pull together, all of us as individuals, and as countries, and as organizations, and try to figure out how to solve the problem of relief in Syria -- how to feed people -- then we've got us a disaster of a magnitude that is beyond any one of us to handle. We've got to act, and we've got to act now."" The cost of war . A political outsider takes the reins . Shahin, the Muslim community leader in Dallas, said he believes Hitto is the perfect man for the job in Syria -- a hybrid of outsider and native. He's hopeful that Hitto will ""come up with a solution that fits for the majority of people."" ""At a time when there's so much baggage in the Middle East, they need an outsider. He's an outsider in the sense of no political loyalties."" Hitto has Kurdish heritage, one of the ethnic minorities in diverse Syria. The general view about the civil war is that the al-Assad government is dominated by Alawites, and Sunni Arabs represent much of the opposition membership. But there are many more groups in Syria, ethnic and religious, and questions of allegiance or nonallegiance can be complicated and fluid. The choice of Hitto suggests that the opposition is working to be inclusive. Hitto earned the leadership post in a vote by Syrian National Coalition members on Tuesday. He received 35 out of 48 votes during a meeting in Istanbul, where Syrian opposition groups have been based. Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center, said in an essay that many Syrians will be suspicious of Hitto and his support from the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood -- a Sunni movement regarded as hard-line by some and brutalized by the ruling Baathist party since al-Assad's father, Hafez, ran Syria. ""Since the announcement, I have heard both Syrian nationalist figures and those from some minority communities -- inside and outside the country -- talk dismissively about the move."" For them, he wrote, Hitto is a ""pawn of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood."" ""There is a sense that Hitto's appointment has allowed the Muslim Brotherhood, assisted by key regional actors, to walk in through the front door and assume control of Syria's opposition movement."" Even if such views are ""exaggerated,"" they should be worrisome, Shaikh said. ""The appointment of Syria's first interim Prime Minister should be a watershed moment for all Syrians. That it may not prove to be so, does not bode well for the impending post-Assad transitional period."" On Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Ted Poe, a Texas Republican, asked Robert Ford, the U.S. ambassador to Syria, about Hitto's connection to the Muslim Brotherhood. Ford told Poe at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing that he had met Hitto twice. ""He struck me as more Texan than Muslim Brotherhood,"" Ford said. ""I don't know what his political affiliations are, but I do know that he also has a tolerant vision of Syrian society. He is not a religious extremist, far from it."" Shahin said the al-Assad government will try to associate Hitto with the Brotherhood. But Hitto is merely involved with the Muslim community and is American, with all that means, he said. Hitto will carry with him American values of liberty, justice and merit that transcend tribal and ethnic identity, Shahin said. He is hoping that Hitto's American citizenship will help forge a close relationship with the United States. The Brotherhood rhetoric is ""the typical thing to say for people that are more secular-leaning. Rather than having political discourse to consolidate differences, many will use the 'Islamist' swear word as a focus to get most Western support,"" Shahin said. With Hitto's help, Shahin said, one day Syria will mature and its peoples' identities will be based on values, not tribe. But it'll be a long haul, he said. ""Imagine being in a country where everyone spied on one another. People are highly suspicious,"" he said, referring to the al-Assad police apparatus. ""There are going to be a lot of taboos he'll have to break."" CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report .","New head of Syrian opposition's interim government is Syrian-born, U.S.-educated .

"(CNN) -- On the fifth anniversary of the war in Iraq, with nearly 4,000 American lives lost, is Iraq really on a path to peace? Three factors are often cited in explaining the improvement in security: the U.S. troop surge, the political ""awakening"" of the Iraqi people, and the cease fire ordered by anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. But some say a controversial fourth dynamic is at play as well -- cash, being doled out by the barrelful. It's a truth many hold to be self-evident that more American troops translate into less Iraqi violence. As President Bush said in January's State of the Union speech, ""Some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is no doubt."" But some military experts do have doubts, arguing there's actually a mightier force at work -- hundreds of millions in cash given to Iraqis, for everything from picking up garbage to taking up arms against al Qaeda.  Watch Bush discuss the troop surge » . Retired Army Col. Doug Macgregor, a longtime critic of top Iraq commander Gen. David Petraeus, said it's a ""cash-for-peace"" scheme that is bound to backfire.  Watch CNN's Kyra Phillips interview with Gen. Petraeus » . ""Normally when you begin paying off your enemy on the scale that we are, it is seen by your enemy as well as others as a tacit admission of failure, not of success,"" Macgregor said. It's hard to pin down exactly how many millions are going to former insurgents to switch sides, but Macgregor argues the result is artificial progress. ""What we've done is we've also flooded the Sunni-Arab insurgents with cash to create a temporary cease-fire to reduce the numbers of U.S. casualties,"" he said. Gen. Petraeus' former deputy commander bristles at the suggestion that the U.S. is bribing bad guys to back off. ""That is such a simplified look at it. It's much more complex than that. I believe it to be the right thing to do. It's about reconciling them with the rest of the government of Iraq. It's a confidence-building measure in reconciling them with Iraq,"" Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno told CNN. Former Defense Secretary William Cohen is concerned that direct payment is not ""particularly savory,"" but concedes it may be necessary ""to buy the support of people who otherwise would be a raid against you."" ""Is that helping to turn the tide? If it's only a question of a tactical distribution of money for a short period of time, then it won't stand up, and it will be reversed the moment we leave,"" Cohen said. But U.S. commanders on the front lines insist anger, not greed, is what's behind he so-called ""awakening,"" and has given rise to grass-root groups called *""Concerned Local Citizens"" and ""Sons of Iraq.""  Watch Bush's remarks on the fifth anniversary of the war » . ""When we first started these programs, these guys weren't getting paid a dime,"" said Col. John Charlton, 1st Brigade Commander with the 3rd Infantry Division. ""We didn't advertise, you know, 'Join the police force, and we'll give you money.' These guys lined up by the hundreds because they were sick and tired of what al Qaeda was doing to their communities, and they knew that they had to stand up and fight."" So that happens when the money dries up? Critics, Macgregor among them, predict a quick return to civil war. ""We have to understand that this expedient policy of paying your enemy is very dangerous. It's fragile, and eventually, hatred of the foreign occupier overwhelms greed,"" he said. E-mail to a friend .","Fifth anniversary of the war in Iraq commemorated Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- The destruction that Superstorm Sandy inflicted on 13-year-old Ryan Panetta and his home has taken six months to be complete. In the end, it wasn't the wind and water that did in his house in Broad Channel, New York. It was the claws of a giant excavator, sent this week by the city to demolish the home his entire family had been laboring nights to rebuild since Sandy struck. ""I would want to be here to see it but I didn't know it was going to be so tough,"" said Ryan as machinery crushed the home he had lived in since birth, where he was raised along with his two brothers and little sister. The neighbors, seeing a bit of what may lie in their future, hugged each of them silently. One neighbor told them, ""new home, new memories."" Rain sprinkled and a cool, gray sky full of clouds bubbled high above. As the rooms where they'd celebrated dozens of birthdays and Christmases splintered into piles of wood, the Panettas began to cry. ""I knew it was going to be hard, though, you know? I knew we couldn't live there anymore but this is where I put all my babies' home to -- and to watch it just being broken down like this is tearing me up,"" said Karen Panetta, Ryan's mom. ""It's -- the impact of Sandy -- we're reliving it every single day for the last six months. Every home we can't go back to -- a place we called home, we relive it. Every day."" Sandy developed into a hurricane in October as it crashed through the Caribbean then raked the East Coast of the United States, making landfall near their home as a post-tropical cyclone. It killed more than 180 people in Canada, Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica and the United States. It also contributed to tens of billions of dollars in damages, especially along shoreline communities in New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut. Photos: Board by board, Jersey Shore rebuilds . CNN has been following this family's story, but this sudden crash exactly a half year after the day of the storm was unexpected. Ryan had repeatedly told everyone his home would be rebuilt, even if he had to do it with his own young hands. ""We will be back in our home. I'm sure of it,"" he had said. The beginning of the end of 803 Church Street was on October 29, when the raging water enveloped Broad Channel, an island in Jamaica Bay, while the father, Joe Panetta, was at work. Ryan swam for help. ""I jumped out ... I wasn't even thinking that a log would hit me or anything,"" Ryan recalled, the memory still vivid. He didn't worry about the danger of electrical power lines in the water, either. His youngest brother, Christian, chokes up recalling how he believed he would drown. Ryan's mother credits Ryan with saving their lives, but their home was flooded so severely it couldn't be occupied. To make matters worse, the rising water of the ocean had met the bay in the nearby Rockaways and Ryan's school, Scholars' Academy, was flooded. The city counted 73,000 students displaced by the storm. At the end of the year, Sandy was still eating away at Ryan's life as the displaced family shared a one-bedroom temporary apartment while mold grew inside their empty home and school and saltwater corroded everything. Ryan commuted two hours to a replacement school. He was one of 5,400 students whose school buildings were not yet repaired. Scholars' Academy had been looted, needed a new boiler and cleaning was hampered because sewage from a neighboring treatment plant had penetrated the basement and first floor. Some of his teachers and the principal were in temporary housing. Playgrounds in storm areas memorialize Newtown victims . Most evenings Ryan had mined hope by going back to his damaged home to join his family pulling out the rotting floor and walls and trying to rebuild while the family navigated insurance settlements, city rebuilding rules, federal assistance and emergency housing. Some nights it was all too much. ""This community was our entire world. We all grew up here. But it's been very hard on the kids moving from one place to another, not getting enough sleep, not having any of their things or their school. The one thing that's held together is our family. And we will rebuild this house because we have so many Christmases and birthdays and memories here,"" Karen Panetta said in December, standing in a shell that was once their living room. Work on the school also progressed with urgency. ""We need this place to be there for kids like Ryan because they need the consistency, they need one place they can count on, "" lamented Principal Brian O'Connell, whose life mirrored Ryan's as he went from temporary housing to a temporary school, then to oversee the restoration of his Scholars' Academy and his own home blocks away. Rebuilding NYU's research labs after Superstorm Sandy . By January 14 he had gotten his wish. Ryan and 700 other middle school kids marched back in wearing T-shirts that read ""Scholars' Strong, Rockaway Resilient."" From the gym floor to the piano in the school auditorium, much had to be repaired or replaced. iPads and other items were lost to looters. Everything else had been replaced. A temporary boiler was chugging away. O'Connell said donations had been overwhelming and the repairs swift, but the emotional toll on his students and faculty was high. Additional counselors had been brought in to provide guidance to the children of the storm. Weekend, early morning and after-school programs were offered to provide academic support. The only smile you can get out of Ryan is when you talk about his school, where the boys' varsity basketball team made the playoffs for the first time and the girls' team won the city championship. Scholars' has a record number of kids entering good high schools and scholarship money and assistance is starting to come in. It's the one thing that's been made right. Then in late January, FEMA released new maps covering the areas damaged by Sandy. The maps are used to determine the level of flood risk to an area, which also determines the costs set for federal flood insurance. They can make a difference in people's decision to rebuild before they even consider whether their construction plans would square with city regulations. According to Dan Watson, FEMA press secretary, the maps had not been revised for Broad Channel since the 1980s; the new one showed the Panetta home in a V zone. Homes in these zones are ""subject to high-velocity wave action (a 3-foot breaking wave) from the 1% annual chance coastal flood."" Because of the risk, Zone V is subject to more stringent building requirements than other zones. To the Panettas, that translated into building higher, which also meant more money for flood insurance, even as they are discovering the insurance they had was insufficient to make them whole. Queens families: Power company to blame for homes burned during Sandy . ""That's the way they are -- you pay, pay, pay and then, you know, when it's time to pay back out, they don't do it. They're nickel-and-diming me for everything. And when I say everything I mean everything,"" Joe Panetta said as he pointed to a $1,000 front door that would be reimbursed at $252. The storm door was $360 but wasn't covered. They had no insurance on the contents. Frustrated, Joe Panetta insisted the insurance company send an engineer and assess whether the home could be saved. The Panettas have been living in temporary housing with assistance from FEMA since Sandy hit. With engineering reports signaling structural compromises and mortgage payments and rent costs piling up, Joe Panetta pushed the insurance company and the city, which made the decision to demolish. That left the Panettas standing outside this week in matching Broad Channel sweatshirts, a bright green shamrock stamped on the front like a team jersey. Ryan missed a precious school day because he wanted to be there when the house went down, something like sitting by an ailing patient in hospice care. He waited all morning on his street, where the homes looked very much like the beach bungalows they had been for generations, housing the families of New York City's public employees, like the firefighters, paramedics and police officers whose union stickers and idling service vehicles line the streets. Flags still fluttered from front doors and flowers bloomed in pots. But inside, many of the homes are mostly gutted and several were to come down that day. The city contractors said they have 19 homes to tear down in the neighborhood because of Sandy -- the Panetta's was just number three. But neighbors gathered with the Panettas to show their support, which is why, the Panetta's said, they are still determined to rebuild -- right there.","Panetta family gathers with neighbors to watch house razed .

"(CNN) -- A fire that sparked huge explosions and injured three workers on a pair of Mobile River barges is out, the U.S. Coast Guard said Thursday. Three workers who were preparing the barges for reloading Wednesday night were severely burned, according to Mobile fire officials. They were in critical condition Thursday at the University of South Alabama Medical Center, according to a spokesman. Authorities don't believe any workers are missing. The barge was empty at the time of the initial explosion Wednesday night, but authorities believe a spark ignited vapors in it, causing an explosion that ignited a second barge, CNN affiliate WALA TV reported, citing Coast Guard Lt. Mike Clausen. At least seven explosions rocked the barges, according to the Coast Guard. At the Fort Conde Inn across the river they sounded like ""planes above you dropping bombs,"" general manager Alan Waugh told WALA Wednesday. ""We were up on a second floor balcony and the sky lit up in orange and yellow,"" he said. With the fire out, the Coast Guard has lifted the safety zone around the scene, allowing the shipping channel to reopen, the agency said in a news release. The barges are moored across the river from the Carnival Triumph, the cruise ship that lost power in February and drifted in the Gulf of Mexico for days before being towed to Mobile for repairs. At least 500 employees working on the ship were evacuated, Huffman said. CNN's Chuck Johnston, Michael Pearson, Tina Burnside, Dave Alsup, Jessica Jordan, Greg Botelho and Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","NEW: The Mobile River barge fires are out, the U.S. coast Guard says .

"(CNN) -- Just one week after suffering an on-field cardiac arrest, soccer player Fabrice Muamba was able to watch most of his team Bolton's emotional victory over English Premier League relegation rivals Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. ""The fact he was able to watch a large part of the game, given where we were a week ago, is great news,"" Bolton manager Owen Coyle told the club's website on Monday. ""He was pleased that his teammates won the match, although he fell back asleep when the score was 2-0."" The 23-year-old midfielder's heart stopped for 78 minutes following his collapse during the previous weekend's FA Cup quarterfinal against Tottenham, which will be replayed on Tuesday following its initial abandonment at halftime. Bolton beat Blackburn 2-1, boosting the club's hopes of staying in the top division. Fans lay shirts outside the stadium showing their support for Muamba before the match, then inside they held up cards which spelled out his name and shirt number in a huge mosaic. His continued recovery has been described by the head of world football, FIFA president Sepp Blatter, as ""a miracle"" and his plight has attracted international attention, with players across Europe taking to the field in t-shirts expressing support for the Kinshasa-born player. ""In the last 48 hours he is beginning to become aware of the global response, and he is overwhelmed by all the support,"" Coyle said. ""His family continue to spend time with Fabrice and a couple of players will visit him over these next few days to represent the squad. He is still in intensive care and it's important that he doesn't have too many visitors as he continues his recovery, step by step."" The London Chest Hospital, where Muamba is being treated, confirmed that he is making progress. ""His condition is serious but stable,"" it said in a joint statement with Bolton. ""He continues to make encouraging progress in his recovery. ""Over the weekend, he has been able to sit out of bed for a short time, watch television and has begun to eat. However, he will need to continue to be closely monitored by the medical team here for some time."" Born in what is now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Muamba came to the UK with his family in 1999 at the age of 11 and went on to captain England's Under-21 team. He made his name at Birmingham before joining Bolton in 2008.","Fabrice Muamba was able to watch some of Bolton's 2-1 win against Blackburn .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama took his case for attacking Syria overseas and gained some momentum in the Senate, but his deputies faced another line of tough questioning from lawmakers about military involvement and Russia cautioned about unilateral U.S. action and sought to influence the political process in Washington. Here are five things we learned from Wednesday's developments on Syria: . 1) 'The world set a red line' Obama headed for the G-20 summit by first stopping in Sweden where he directed his pitch for military action against Syria to the world leaders he will soon meet in Russia. The president challenged other nations to join him in upholding global treaties banning the use of chemical weapons, saying the red line he drew on that issue more than a year ago should be recognized globally, not just by him. Inaction on Syria, he said, ""becomes more dangerous not only for those people who are subjected to these horrible crimes, but to all of humanity."" Secretary of State John Kerry said there are a number of countries that have indicated they would support some action against Syria if they believe the allegations are true. Senate panel backs strike plan . 2) No escalation of conflict . On Tuesday, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee made it clear they wanted no ground forces to be part of any military action in Syria. On Wednesday, their House counterparts grilled Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey at a hearing on the potential for any U.S. military strike to escalate the Syrian conflict and require additional American involvement. Kerry stressed the limited nature of the proposed mission to degrade Bashar al-Assad's ability to deliver chemical agents. But Dempsey, on multiple occasions, had to say there were no guarantees. ""I can never drive the risk of escalation to zero,"" Dempsey said, though adding that the limited scope of the strike and the U.S. partnerships in the region ""limit that risk."" 3) Momentum for military action . The Senate Foreign Relations Committee gave Obama some momentum on proposed military action in Syria, but not before rewriting his plan. The panel voted 10-7 to move ahead with a punitive strike with Ed Markey -- Kerry's replacement in the Senate from Massachusetts -- not taking a position. The committee set a 60-day deadline for use of force, with an option for an additional 30 days. An amendment accepted by the panel from Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Christopher Coons of Delaware added language to say the military response was intended to reverse al-Assad's battlefield momentum, a stronger objective than the one being pushed by the administration. The White House commended senators for swift action with polls showing that a majority of Americans oppose a U.S. military strike. Kerry told one House lawmaker that he expects Obama to address the nation on military action. Many members of Congress have been calling on Obama to make his case directly to the public. 4) Putin weighs in, Russia to lobby Congress . Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday in an interview that he ""doesn't exclude"" backing a U.N. resolution for military action, though only if there is irrefutable proof Syria's government is behind the latest attack. Samples taken by U.N. inspectors at that site were due at the world body's laboratories this week and will be tested ""strictly according to internationally recognized standards,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. Putin also said, in the same interview with Russia's state Channel 1 television and The Associated Press, that it would be ""absurd"" for al-Assad's forces to use chemical weapons when they have the upper hand over rebel fighters. The Syrian government not only has denied waging chemical weapon attacks, it has accused opposition fighters -- whom it routinely refers to as ""terrorists"" -- of using them. A new wrinkle in the lobbying equation is Russia, which said it sent an official request to meet with congressional leaders to discuss Syria. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner told CNN that he would not meet with the Russian delegation. What's the evidence? 5) The political calculation . So far, the politics of seeking congressional approval have favored bipartisanship even though it's far from certain whether Obama's wish for military action will be approved. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee plan was put together and approved across party lines, and in the House, the reception for Obama lieutenants at a hearing on Wednesday was respectful. The only sharp exchange centered around last year's Benghazi terror attack -- not Syria. A White House statement on the Senate committee action said America is stronger when ""the president and Congress work together"" and promised to ""build on this bipartisan support"" for limited military action. This follows statements on Tuesday by top leaders of the Republican-dominated House in support of Obama's drive for military action. Of the congressional leadership, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is alone in not supporting Obama's call for military strikes. He says he's still undecided. Most criticism or concern from Capitol Hill has so far centered around the wisdom of the mission or aspects of how it would be carried out. There was, however, one pointed criticism of Obama on Wednesday by House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ed Royce, who said the president's policy on Syria has been adrift for two years. Though, he followed up by saying there were ""no easy answers"" on Syria. How will Senate vote? How will House vote? Ashley Killough, Tom Cohen, John King, and Lisa Desjardins contributed to this report.","Obama says the ""red line"" on Syria should reflect a global commitment to deter chemical weapons .
House members grill Obama deputies on risk military action will escalate Syrian conflict .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama faces a terrible choice in the coming days. It is whether to kill a number of Syrians who had nothing to do with a poison-gas massacre to show President Bashar al-Assad, who presumably did have something to do with it, that using chemicals weapons violates an international norm. Few would doubt the importance of international agreements to regulate war, particularly those that safeguard the rights of citizens, such as bans on chemical weapons and torture. If al-Assad is responsible for the use of chemical weapons, he had full knowledge of the norms he was violating. By way of comparison, President George W. Bush chose a policy that allowed torture in interrogations with full knowledge that it was outlawed by agreements to which the United States was a signatory. He made a strategic choice in the face of a threat to national security. Both are abhorrent actions on the part of national leaders, both taken for fundamentally the same reasons. An attack on the Syrian military by the United States would send a message to al-Assad, but it is not clear if Obama has any strategic objective beyond that. Whether he has such a plan or not, any U.S. attack will have implications for the civil war, no matter how much Obama says otherwise. If the United States launches missiles into Syria, those cheering the loudest will be the Syrian rebels. The United States will be intervening in the Syrian civil war on behalf of the rebels. A significant amount of research, including my own, demonstrates that military interventions from outside states lengthen and make bloodier civil wars. Much of this evidence is the result of statistical modeling of all civil wars and any associated interventions. The data include roughly 1,000 interventions into 100 civil wars over the last 60 years, with research carried out by multiple research teams. The results point to patterns in what happens when states intervene to try to help their preferred actor, and the results are strong and consistent that interventions rarely work to promote peace or reduce violence. For example, my own research has shown that the likelihood of a civil war lasting for four years without an intervention is 37%, but if there is an intervention the likelihood that it lasts for four years is 60%. The intervention accounts for the 50% increase in the length of the war. Longer wars are generally bloodier. Examples might include the Nicaraguan war in the 1980s, and the Syrian war up to this point. The meager support for the rebels has allowed them to push harder against the government, and whether or not we support the government, the killing and the war's duration has only increased. It's hard to predict exactly what will happen, of course, but once the United States bombs Syrian forces, it is possible that the rebels will take that moment to launch their own offensive, forcing the Syrian government to respond even more resolutely, greatly worsening the bloodshed. Even if a U.S. missile strike reflects inadvertent help for the rebels, history does not point to a good outcome for U.S. policy. The only pathway by which external interventions consistently make for shorter or less bloody wars is through diplomatic efforts to broker a peace agreement. The same modeling evidence suggests that the war in Angola, 1975-1991, could have been shortened by nearly 10 years with well-timed diplomatic interventions. From this perspective, a missile strike will only move the situation further from peace. Sometimes the difficulty for warring parties to come to a negotiating table is tied up in information that is held private, the very thing that mediators can manage. So why not engage in serious diplomacy? The United States has two stated policies, at least beyond the immediate question of punitive bombing in response to the chemical attacks. The first is to aid the Syrian opposition in its fight against the Assad regime; the second is to help broker a negotiated settlement. The second goal makes sense; the first is fraught with difficulties. Two aspects of the negotiated route pose a problem for the United States. First, the official U.S. policy is that al-Assad must go. Both former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of State John Kerry have made these claims. Second, the rebels have steadfastly refused to negotiate. The only policy on the table is to kill more Syrians to show the Syrian leaders that killing Syrians is wrong. In this regard, U.S. policies are inconsistent with past behavior, empirical evidence and logic. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Patrick M. Regan.","Patrick M.

"(CNN) -- ""Will & Grace"" star Sean Hayes is leading the way again. The openly gay Hayes, who played Jack on the NBC series ""Will & Grace,"" is one of the actors credited with helping change perceptions about gay people via that hit show. This fall he is coming back to his former network as the star of ""Sean Saves The World"" in which he will play a gay single dad of a teen daughter. But Hayes will not be among as big a crowd of gay leading characters on broadcast television as he would have been had his show premiered last year. Photos: Coming out in Hollywood . Last fall TV season a plethora of shows burst onto the small screen with leading gay characters in everything from comedies to musical dramas. Many of those series have since been canceled. Gone are shows like ""The New Normal,"" ""Happy Endings,"" ""Partners"" ""Don't Trust the B---- in Apt. 23,"" ""Smash,"" ""Go On,"" and ""Southland."" And it seems to be a bit of irony that while same-sex marriage support has been gaining ground, this year's fall TV season feels -- at least on the surface -- much less inclusive. ""For a lot of people, even still today, the only LGBT people they actually know are on their screens -- on television or in film,"" said Wilson Cruz, an actor and spokesperson for GLAAD. ""So it's a real opportunity for people to meet LGBT people in the comfort of their homes or the darkness of a theater to have an emotional experience and really understand the lives of LGBT people."" That means that a possible wedding between the characters of Mitchell and Cameron on ABC's ""Modern Family"" in the wake of the Supreme Court striking down the Defense of Marriage Act this summer could have an affect on those who may be still on the fence about same-sex marriage. Photos: Gay celebs who are married or engaged . ""Hearing our stories makes it harder for people not to support us when it comes to the ballot box or the politicians that they choose to support,"" said Matt Kane, GLAAD's associate director of Entertainment Media. ""It is important that our stories get out there and TV is one of the best ways to do that."" When NBC's comedy ""The New Normal"" premiered last fall, it was heralded by the LGBT community for its plot about a gay male couple trying to have a baby. David Wiegand, the San Francisco Chronicle's TV critic, noted that while that show didn't catch on with fans, NBC Entertainment Chairman Bob Greenblatt said at the Television Critics Association summer press tour that he didn't believe the gay characters on the show turned away viewers. Rather, as NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke pointed out, audiences are less patient these days in terms of giving a struggling series time to catch on. ""The takeaway for all of this is that in 2013, there can be a ""New Normal"" and it can fail, despite brilliant writing and performances, and there can be a 'Sean Saves the World,' which may fail or catch hold,"" Wiegand wrote. Kane said there are some bright spots in the upcoming broadcast TV season, including returning LGBT characters on shows like ""Glee,"" the aforementioned ""Modern Family"" and ""Grey's Anatomy."" He said there is greater racial diversity among LGBT characters this year, including Aisha Hinds as half of an interracial lesbian couple on CBS' ""Under The Dome"" and Andre Braugher portraying a gay police captain on Fox's new cop comedy ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" starring ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Andy Samberg. ""There will also be an increase in the role for Alex Newell on 'Glee' where he plays the transgendered student 'Unique' which we're very excited about as 'Unique ' will become the only trans regular on television, if you don't count Netflix,"" Kane said. GLADD recently put out the Studio Responsibility Index, which found that, with the exception of a handful of movies like ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and ""Pitch Perfect,"" most big films lack any significant LGBT presence. GLAAD also produces a report, ""Where We Are On TV,"" which Cruz said acts as a resource for networks. He said the trend this season will be diversity and GLADD would like to see even more of that as well as a greater variety of gay roles in various genres such as sci-fi. Kane said that is why his organization eagerly awaits ABC's new series ""Once Upon A Time in Wonderland,"" which will feature a gay character. He said diversity of characters goes beyond race and gender and means having gay characters of various ages and socioeconomic backgrounds. ""Our community is as diverse as any other,"" Kane said. ""Telling all of those stories is really important. It's important that we be seen as not just a group of gay, white men.""","Several of the broadcast series featuring gay lead characters have been canceled .

"Sheremetyevo International Airport Transit Lounge, Moscow (CNN) -- It seemed like an exciting assignment -- go to Moscow on the trail of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. After acknowledging that he leaked details to reporters about a massive U.S. government surveillance program, Snowden reportedly arrived at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport on a flight from Hong Kong on June 23, and settled in at the transit lounge. But he has remained out of sight. Could I find him? Would he be browsing the duty-free shops, amazed at the sheer volume of magnum bottles of liquor for sale? Would he be sipping cappuccinos in the coffee shop, miffed that they cost 5 euros, or $6.50, each? Is Snowden ready to take flight? Determined and anxious, I flew in under the cover of darkness on an overnight Aeroflot flight from Madrid, arriving at 6 a.m. The passport control officer told me to wait. ""Sit over there,"" she said, and walked off with my documents. Hmmm. Would I end up in legal limbo like Snowden, whose American passport was revoked by Washington, making it difficult for him to cross borders? Out of Russia: Snowden's possible flight paths . Well, no. After about 10 minutes I was waved through, and got out of there so quickly that I forgot to ask the passport officer if she'd seen Snowden lately. But there was no entry stamp to Russia in my passport. Because, like Snowden, I had not officially entered the country; instead, I was now in the lounge for passengers who are just transiting through, along with those who enter the area to board departing flights. It's a truly international place, filled with a broad swath of humanity. Citizens from the Russian Federation, Europeans, Asians, a small number of Americans and some Cubans. Young backpackers and rich business executives. Exhausted parents with children, including a brave little boy whose legs appeared disabled, struggling to take every step, squeezing his mother's hand. All trolling the transit zone, with its gaudy emporium of high-end shops wedged next to mom-and-pop trinket stores that sell souvenirs seemingly left over from the old Soviet Union, including a fold-up metal drinking cup, which I couldn't resist. Inside Moscow Airport's 'no man's land' There are coffee shops that offer Russian pancakes and Wi-Fi, and charge in rubles, dollars or euros. There's even a Burger King and a TGI Fridays. In this enormous transit lounge, Snowden surely has plenty of places to hide. Its three terminals -- D, E and F -- form a very long, curvy rectangle, with 60 boarding gates, and flights to a lot of places that Snowden can't go, for fear of being caught. Western Europe? Not a good idea for him to fly to Paris or Berlin. New York is obviously out of the question. Tokyo or Shanghai? Nyet. Nor Tel Aviv. Even Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, is probably risky. There is an Aeroflot flight to Havana, with connections to Venezuela, a country whose leftist government has offered asylum to Snowden. Airport stakeout: Hunting Snowden . On a Friday, my first day in the transit zone, there was no Havana flight to keep an eye on, which gave me a chance to explore. Russia and other countries can designate various locations and settings, even outside of the airport, as the amorphous transit zone. There could be detention areas, medical facilities, or other locations in Moscow given that designation -- so Snowden could be miles away from the airport but still in ""transit."" One part of the Novotel, not connected to the terminal but visible from it, is part of the transit zone. I decided to see whether Snowden was holed up there. I reserved two rooms -- one for me, the other for a CNN camerawoman who came from Berlin. Aeroflot ground agents directed us to a bus, which rolled across the tarmac as, officially, a moving part of the transit lounge. So we were leaving the airport in Russia -- but staying in the ""zone."" Accompanied at all times by minders, we checked in and were directed to the second floor, the secure transit zone floor. The guard in the hall made sure we didn't go down to the lobby or gym or to other floors. The only way to get food was from room service, which is actually not such a bad idea. We walked the hallway. Snowden could have been behind any of the 40 room doors on the second floor. He did not come out. At 4 a.m. the next day, we left the hotel, accompanied at all times, until we were back in the airport terminal transit lounge for our departing flights. The rules say you can stay a maximum of 24 hours in the transit lounge and then must leave on a flight. We did. But Snowden has apparently been in the lounge for nearly three weeks. How does he do it? I would need a second trip to find out more. Interactive: Movements and asylum requests . A few days later, I was back, this time alone. On the second trip, you begin to feel like something of an authority on the transit lounge. Snowden reportedly is traveling with several laptop computers. If they're heavy, he's got a problem. So did I. There are hardly any luggage carts in the transit lounge. I finally found one, and then a woman from India followed me around until I was done with it. I searched again, up and down, and when it got to be 12:30 a.m. -- when there are no flights for several hours -- I checked into the Capsule hotel in Terminal E, renting a tiny room for the minimum four hours. Didn't see Snowden there either, nor back in the terminal, starting at 5 a.m.. I figured the best shot was the Havana flight, leaving at 2:05 p.m. It's no secret that observers are closely watching that flight. I went quite early to the boarding gate, number 22 in Terminal D. A couple of guys with beards looked vaguely like Snowden. But no, one turned out to be Danish, the other Russian. I approached both. They laughed. The Danish man said I was the second person to ask him that. It was boarding time. A veteran Russian photographer and I were working the scene. There was a lot to monitor -- the passengers getting on at the gate, the stairway from the tarmac up to the boarding walkway, for crew and possibly someone else, and a terminal elevator, inside the secure zone, from which someone might be hustled aboard down the walkway. Watching all this -- and, it also turns out, watching us -- was a mysterious, middle-aged burly man. As the boarding was in progress, he made a mobile phone call, reporting back to someone -- in Spanish -- that two photographers were taking pictures. After the boarding finished, and the plane was about to push back with no sign of Snowden, I approached the burly man. I asked him, in clear Spanish, if Snowden was aboard. He pretended not to understand. I repeated the question in Spanish. He again feigned inability to speak Spanish. So I asked him in English. He replied that he didn't know. Could he have been from Venezuela or Cuba? He didn't say. At least I could see and talk to the burly man. So far, I haven't been able to do that with Snowden.","CNN's Al Goodman spent time in the transit zone of Moscow's airport .

"(CNN) -- Five patients who underwent surgery at a Cape Cod Hospital this summer may have been exposed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after their surgeries were performed using the same potentially contaminated medical equipment found in a New Hampshire hospital, according to a statement released by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health on Thursday. The specialized medical equipment had originally been used to operate on a patient now suspected of having Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday. The now-deceased patient had neurosurgery at Catholic Medical Center in Manchester, New Hampshire, and normal sterilization procedures don't get rid of the disease proteins, known as prions, the Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday. The surgical equipment used at both hospitals was from Medtronic Inc. according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. The five most recent cases in Cape Cod come one day after the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services announced it is monitoring eight patients for signs of the fatal brain disease. ""Our concern is with the health and well-being of the eight patients who may have been exposed to CJD,"" Dr. Joseph Pepe, Catholic Medical Center's CEO, said in a statement issued with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services on Wednesday. ""We will work closely with these families to help them in any way possible, even though the risk of infection is extremely low."" The five most recent patients each had spinal cord surgery at Cape Cod Hospital between July and August 2013, and all the potentially affected patients have been notified of the risk, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health said. The department added that the risk to the potentially affected patients is very low because they underwent spinal cord surgery instead of brain surgery. There is no danger to hospital staff or members of the public, according to the statement. An autopsy of the original patient to confirm the illness -- which differs from a variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease commonly known as ""mad cow disease"" -- is being conducted at the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center, Catholic Medical Center said Wednesday. The only way to confirm the illness is with an autopsy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says no cases of the disease have been linked to the use of contaminated medical equipment since 1976. Most medical devices are sterilized by heat, but the World Health Organization recommends the use of a caustic chemical like sodium hydroxide to disinfect equipment that may have come in contact with tissues that could cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease strikes fewer than 400 people a year in the United States, according to the CDC. Victims show signs of memory loss and cognitive difficulty early on; the ailment is ""rapidly progressive and always fatal,"" the CDC says. Florida boy dies from brain-eating parasite .

"(CNN) -- The unexplained beachings of scores of dolphins over the past month along Cape Cod, Massachusetts, is the largest ""single-species event"" of its kind on record in the northeastern United States, a marine mammal specialist said Monday. A total of 129 common dolphins have been found since the animals began stranding themselves in early January, said Katie Moore, marine mammal rescue and research manager for the International Fund for Animal Welfare. Team members have been able to successfully release 37 of the 54 they were able to recover alive, but 75 others were dead or had to be euthanized on the spot, for a total of 92 dead, Moore told reporters in a conference call. Specially equipped trailers have been used to treat and transport the living dolphins. The ones that are healthy enough are taken to the outer Cape Cod coast to be released. Nine of the dolphins have been tagged with satellite tracking devices, Moore said, and most of the six that are still transmitting are north of Cape Cod, ""where dolphins should be."" While dolphin strandings are not uncommon on the cape, Moore said this event is extraordinary in its ""protracted"" nature as well as the number of dolphins involved. ""We've seen see an (annual) average of 228 strandings of dolphins and seals over the past 12 years"" in the International Fund's Northeast region, which spans from Virginia to Maine, Moore said. ""There is a large variability year to year,"" she said, but this event represents ""more than half my annual average in a month."" Moore said the International Fund staffs a 24-hour hotline, and when they get reports ""from beach-goers or anyone who finds an animal,"" they alert one of their 300 trained volunteers and dispatch them to the scene. These responders are able to relay information about the dolphin's species, sex and condition. Once beached, a dolphin is vulnerable to predators and susceptible to organ damage and sunburn. If a dolphin is still alive, the responders get it onto its stomach, if it is not already, for easier breathing, keep away seagulls that would otherwise peck at it, and warm it with blankets or cool it with water as necessary, Moore said. Necropsies have been performed on nine of the dolphins, and blood and microbial swab samples have been taken from some that were found alive, Moore said, but so far no pattern of disease or trauma has been found that would point to a cause. Although the winter and early spring are the normal time of year for dolphin strandings to occur, the weather this season has been unusually warm, leading to speculation about climate change and subsequent ""distribution of prey"" as a possible causes. Last week, Wellfleet harbormaster Michael Flanagan explained that usually, in the winter, ""the harbor ices over and inhibits the animals from coming close to the shore. But now that the water is warmer, we're seeing lots more dolphins washing up than ever before."" However, the International Fund's Moore cautioned, while climate or other external factors such as acoustic disorientation can't be ruled out, ""we don't have a single answer."" ""As time goes on we can put more of the pieces of the puzzle together,"" she said. ""The sad fact in these events is that we often never come up with that answer, and that is incredibly frustrating."" She did, however cite the nature of the dolphins and the geology of Cape Cod as two contributing factors in these events, historically: . ""Common dolphins are incredibly social animals and form bonds to forage for food and avoid predators,"" she explained. Those bonds, while they serve the animals greatly in the open ocean they're accustomed to, can be devastating when the creatures are brought in contact with Cape Cod's gently sloping shallows and convoluted estuaries, which are ""very foreign to these species."" Moore said the event, because of its scale and duration, is taking ""a huge toll"" on the resources of the animal rescue and advocacy group, financially and physically. ""This is very hard labor. These animals can weigh 200 or 300 pounds each,"" she said. The organization, which gets its funding through donations and grants, has a base operating budget of less than $300,000, and she estimated this event has coast ""at least 50 or 60 thousand dollars,"" not including staff time.

"Washington (CNN) -- It is the second big speech of his presidency's second act, but there is little or nothing to suggest President Barack Obama's State of the Union Address offers any hope of a new beginning or a new spirit in divided Washington. Consider the vast partisan differences in expectations. ""Obama core supporters are getting what they hoped for in 2009,"" says veteran Democratic pollster and strategist Peter Hart. ""He is a president who seems both more confident and at the same time at home with himself both legislatively and philosophically."" If there is one certainty in today's political climate, it is that when one party is happy, the other is not. Security Clearance: Foreign policy will take back seat . ""Republicans should wear asbestos suits to the House chamber because they're going to be torched,"" said longtime GOP operative Ed Gillespie, a veteran of senior jobs in the House leadership, the Republican National Committee and the George W. Bush White House. ""President Obama seems to think that the best way to get things done is not by retail persuasion but by wholesale attacking."" The president's wish list already has him on a collision course with the GOP on several fronts, from the familiar sniping over taxes and spending and red ink to new battle lines over White House calls for sweeping changes to immigration and gun laws. Veterans of previous administration note the first year of the second term is critical. ""Of his second term, this is the one that will get the most attention,"" said Karen Hughes, the George W. Bush confidante. ""This is the list of what he still wants to accomplish as president."" As such, Hughes said, the biggest challenge is focus. ""It was never my favorite speech because it is a legislative laundry list and everyone is trying to get their piece in,"" Hughes said. Huge challenge: How will we reduce the deficit? The biggest immediate challenge is a carryover from the first term: Navigating differences over how to achieve a substantial deficit reduction package. A March 1 deadline looms when temporary fixes enacted in the first term essentially expire and across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration loom if no new plan is passed. ""The economy still languishes and the obvious threat is sequestration, which is omnipresent,"" is how Hart described the moment to CNN. ""But I think the president can look presidential and put the GOP between a rock and a hard place."" There is little doubt that the president has the upper hand in the battle for public opinion: what he calls a ""balanced approach"" of more tax revenues and spending cuts including, again in the president's words, ""modest"" savings in Medicare and Social Security. ""I am prepared, eager and anxious to get a big deal, a big package that ends governance by crisis,"" the president told House Democrats this week in offering a bit of a State of the Union preview. But there is no hint of any big deal in sight, and the president himself has called for another temporary fix to push the deadline back a few months. It is a glaring example of Washington dysfunction, and the longer the stalemate goes on, the more extremes in both parties try to block the path to any grand bargain. Conservative groups, for example, warn of retribution against Republicans who consider giving the president any additional tax revenues, and liberal groups repeatedly are reminding newly elected Democrats of their promises not to support Medicare cuts. As this plays out, again, White House aides talk confidently of the president's place in the political debate. But even in ""winning,"" there could be a price. A crisis of confidence . GOP pollster Bill McInturff notes a post-election drop in consumer confidence and says there are parallels to past battles over the debt ceiling and the fiscal cliff. In a consumer-driven economy, a collapse in confidence because of more Washington paralysis could stall an economic recovery that is critical to the president's second term political standing. ""Economic confidence plays a key role in building the type of optimism that encourages businesses to hire and people to spend,"" McInturff writes in a presentation offering his take on what he labels ""The Washington Economy."" ""It is important leaders in both parties begin to recognize how the tenor, tone and outcome of the policy debates in Washington are actually retarding economic confidence in a way that makes building a sustained recovery more difficult."" What about immigration and gun laws? Question marks also can be attached to other top State of the Union priorities. Some congressional action on immigration and gun laws seems likely, though what emerges could be significantly less than what Obama wants. Immigration is the most likely source of a major package. But it remains a highly divisive issue, and both parties will be tested. The biggest question mark, perhaps, is whether the Republican-controlled House would pass legislation granting a path to citizenship to the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. And if the House passed legislation granting legal status but not full citizenship to such immigrants, would the president accept that compromise? There is little question the president won't get his way in the gun control debate. He wants new universal background checks for gun purchases. More robust background checks do appear to have significant bipartisan support, but not as sweeping a plan as envisioned by the president. At the moment, the math is against the president when counting votes in Congress for his proposals to ban assault weapons and magazine cartridges that hold more than 10 rounds. On guns, Democrat Hart sees it this way: ""The president has the moral high ground but not necessarily the political high ground. It is still an intensity issue."" Republican Hughes recalls how President George W. Bush later regretted putting a push for Social Security reforms ahead of immigration, an issue that, back then, had better prospects for bipartisan action. Especially now, she says choosing priorities is critical. ""If I were in their shoes, I would be looking to get some things done,"" she said. ""Show people can work together and restore some confidence."" Hart predicts one line that will win applause across the political spectrum, in living rooms across the country if not in the House chamber: ""We will be out of Afghanistan in 2014. Americans cannot wait for this."" A more aggressive Obama . More broadly, he sees a new Obama in the second act even if Washington's partisan polarization is a sharp as ever. ""There is an aggressiveness to his action and a willingness to recognize that he can use his political strength either to win in policy terms or political terms or maybe both fronts,"" Hart said. ""Bottom line: The wind is at the president's back. The problems haven't changed or disappeared, but this is a more confident and politically sharp president right now."" Not surprisingly, Republicans see a different bottom line. ""It's not likely to produce much by way of legislative accomplishment,"" GOP strategist Gillespie said of the president's second term tone. ""I suspect this speech will be in the rear view mirror pretty quickly.""","President Obama to give his first State of the Union address of his second term on Tuesday .
On the eve of speech, gridlock in Washington continues to be the biggest obstacle .
He is expected to lay out an agenda focusing on the economy, guns, immigration .
Looking at other two-term presidents, this next year will be crucial to get things done ."
"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- ""Smoking hot"" was how many observers described Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard's blistering attack on sexism and misogyny in the bear pit of Australia's Parliament on Tuesday. The roar of support from Australian women on Twitter was deafening. So too was their rage when the parliamentary press gallery almost uniformly condemned Gillard's excoriation of the Leader of the Opposition coalition, Tony Abbott, as hypocritical and showing poor political judgment. For 15 minutes Gillard tore into Abbott before the Australian House of Representatives, the expression on his face going from a wry smile to embarrassment. The occasion was a highly charged debate on a motion brought by Abbott to sack the Speaker of the House, Peter Slipper. Slipper, a coalition turncoat who helped the government bolster its numbers by taking up the highly paid position last year, stepped aside in April amid allegations of fraud and sexual harassment. In court documents published last week, text messages between Slipper and his accuser in the sexual harassment action revealed deeply disturbing and offensive banter. In one of the messages, Slipper described female genitalia as looking like ""a mussel removed from its shell."" Abbott said the messages showed Slipper was not fit to be the standard-bearer of good behavior in Parliament. Gillard, while condemning the text messages, refused to support the motion to sack Slipper. Instead, she unfurled two years of pent up rage at the coalition leader for what she described as his own sexist, misogynistic attitude toward her and women generally. Shock jock targets Gillard . ""I will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man. I will not,"" she said, pointing at Abbott. ""And the government will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man. Not now, not ever. ""If he wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern Australia, he doesn't need a motion in the House of Representatives. He needs a mirror."" The prime minister then presented her evidence. She reminded Abbott of his response to a question about lower female representation in positions of power: ""What if men are by physiology or temperament more adapted to exercise authority or to issue command?"" She then cited his statements that ""abortion is the easy way out"" and ""what the housewives of Australia need to understand as they do the ironing ..."" during a debate on the recently introduced carbon tax. ""I was offended too,"" Gillard continued, ""by the sexism, by the misogyny of the Leader of the Opposition catcalling across this table at me, as I sit here as prime minister, 'If the prime minister wants to, politically speaking, make an honest woman of herself,' something that would never have been said to any man sitting in this chair. ""I was offended when the leader of the opposition went outside in the front of Parliament and stood next to a sign that said 'Ditch the Witch.'"" But the prime minister's anger turned into white-hot rage when she responded to Abbott's assertion, made during his speech in support of Tuesday's motion to sack the speaker, that every day Gillard supported Slipper was ""another day of shame for a government which should already have died of shame."" Just a week earlier, a coalition-supporting commercial radio presenter, Alan Jones, provoked outrage across the nation when he told a gathering of young Liberals that the prime minister's recently deceased father had ""died of shame."" The prime minister had refused to comment on the controversy. Yesterday she broke her silence: . ""I indicate to the leader of the opposition, the government is not dying of shame, my father did not die of shame. What the leader of the opposition should be ashamed of is his performance in this parliament and the sexism he brings with it,"" she said. Not long after Abbot's motion narrowly failed in a parliamentary vote, with the prime minister victorious, Slipper resigned his post. Gillard's speech has ignited excitement and debate internationally. The venerable New Yorker magazine implored U.S. President Barack Obama to learn a lesson from the way politics is played in Australia. ""After his performance last week, supporters of President Obama, watching Gillard cut through the disingenuousness and feigned moral outrage of her opponent to call him out for his own personal prejudice, hypocrisy, and aversion to facts, might be wishing their man would take a lesson from Australia,"" it intoned. Britain's Guardian applauded Gillard for pulling no punches but noted the prime minister ""isn't quite the stuff of feminist fantasies"" because she has repeatedly refused to support same sex marriage in Australia. From the journalists permanently reporting from the Australian Parliament, there were many questions -- in particular why the prime minister welcomed Peter Slipper's resignation over his bawdy and offensive text messages but was unprepared to sack him? Peter Hartcher, political and international editor for the Sydney Morning Herald, led the charge. Gillard faced a choice, he wrote, ""between the political defense of her parliamentary numbers or the defense of the principle of respect for women."" She made the wrong choice, wrote Hartcher. The prime minister chose power over principle in deciding not to support the sacking of the house speaker and in so doing, ""The prime minister gained nothing and lost a great deal,"" he added. Taking the pulse of social media, there are very few women who agree with him. ""Where does he get off taking the high moral ground pffft!"" posted @abissicus on Twitter. ""What utter s***"" wrote @vikkiking88. Australia now has a female prime minister, a female speaker of the House -- elected after Slipper resigned -- and a female governor-general. Just another day in Australian politics.","Australian PM Julia Gillard hits out at opposition leader in parliament .

When Barros was arrested, he had six different IDs and various checkbooks and credit cards, police said. To his credit, Barros didn't use Nicholson's name, instead signing the card Joao Pedro dos Santos. He's charged with use of false documents and falsification of a public document.

"(CNN) -- An oil sheen about four miles long has appeared in the Gulf of Mexico near the site of the worst oil spill in U.S. history, a Coast Guard spokesman said Thursday. It was not immediately clear where the oil is coming from, said Petty Officer 3rd Class Ryan Tippets. The Coast Guard found out about the oil sheen on September 16 after someone spotted it on a satellite image from the multinational oil and gas company BP, Tippets said. A Coast Guard response team went to the location to collect samples, and sent them to the Coast Guard Marine Safety Lab in Connecticut for testing. Test results are expected in a few weeks, Tippets said. The service's Marine Safety Unit Morgan City, in Louisiana, is heading up the investigation of the spill, which is in the part of the Gulf officially designated MC252. No one has reported any adverse effects on the environment or marine life, Tippets said. Timeline: Oil spill in the Gulf in 2010 . The sheen is near the spot where, on April 20, 2010, BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded over the Macondo well, killing 11 workers and spewing oil that spread across a huge portion of the Gulf. The badly damaged mile-deep well leaked oil into the Gulf of Mexico for five months. On September 19, 2010, retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who led the federal disaster response, declared that a cement plug had permanently sealed the leak, so that it posed no further threat. In total, about 4.9 million barrels (205.8 million gallons) of oil leaked into the Gulf, according to estimates from federal scientists. In an incident that appears unrelated to the new oil sheen, the Coast Guard's Morgan City unit also is investigating a small amount of oil leaked from a Gulf oil platform. Companies involved in 2010 Gulf spill didn't focus on accident risks . Apache Corp. reported the spill to the Coast Guard and regulators as soon as the company noticed the leak on Tuesday, said Apache spokesman John Roper.

"(CNN) -- European Champions League holders Bayern Munich have been drawn to face Manchester City in the group stages of the continent's most prestigious club competition. The German champions are now led by former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola, who secured 14 trophies for the Catalan club during his four seasons in charge. Guardiola has a hard task repeating Bayern's feats of last season when under Jupp Heynckes they won the Bundesliga, the German Cup and the Champions League crowns. At the draw in Monaco, Bayern's Franck Ribery was also named European Footballer of the Year, beating Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who plays for Real Madrid. ""It's always nice to win this trophy; it's a special moment for me to be here,"" he said. ""It was an extraordinary year for us, we'd wanted that trophy for so long and to play at Wembley was fantastic. I think Bayern deserved to win the cup after such a long time."" Despite huge investment in their playing squad, and winning the English Premier League title in 2012, Manchester City have failed to make it out of the group stages in the past two Champions League competitions. Russian club CSKA Moscow and Viktoria Plzen, from the Czech Republic, complete the line-up in Group D. Spanish champions Barcelona have been drawn in a particularly tough looking group alongside Italian giants AC Milan, Dutch title winners Ajax and Scottish champions Celtic. Celtic famously beat Barcelona in the group stages of last year's competition, and booked their place in the group stages with a last-gasp victory over Shakhter Karagandy from Kazakhstan on Wednesday night. English side Arsenal face a tough test to emerge from Group F alongside last year's beaten finalists, Borussia Dortmund of Germany, Napoli from Italy and French side Marseille. Carlo Ancelotti's first Champions League campaign as manager of Real Madrid sees him face Italian champions Juventus, Galatasaray from Turkey, and Denmark's FC Copenhagen. Jose Mourinho has been handed a favorable draw in Group E as Europa League winners Chelsea pulled German side Schalke, FC Basel from Switzerland and Romanian outfit Steaua Bucharest. English Premier League champions Manchester United will also be content with their draw in Group A as they face Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk, Germany's Bayer Leverkusen and Real Sociedad from Spain. French champions Paris Saint-Germain have been drawn alongside Benfica, from Portugal, Greek side Olympiakos and Anderlecht, from Belgium, in Group C. In Group G Portuguese side Porto have been drawn against Atletico Madrid, Russian side Zenit St Petersburg and Austria Vienna. The first round of group matches will be played on 17-18 September.

"(CNN) -- Two of Europe's smaller clubs got lucky on Friday following match-fixing sanctions imposed on Turkish teams. APOEL Nicosia and Tromso were the beneficiaries of match-fixing bans handed out to Fenerbahce and Besiktas relating to games in Turkish football. Fenerbahce had an appeal against a two-year ban from European competition rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Wednesday. Cypriot champions APOEL were beaten in this week's Europa League playoff matches by Belgium's Zulte Waregem, but emerged as the ""lucky loser"" plucked from a draw conducted by UEFA in Monaco on Friday.. It means APOEL will compete in the group stages of Europe's second-tier club competition against France's Bordeaux, Eintracht Frankfurt of Germany and Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv in Group F. APOEL are best known for a run to the Champions League quarterfinals in 2012, where they were beaten over two legs by Real Madrid. Besiktas, another Turkish club banned from European competition for match-fixing, also saw their appeal over a one-year sanction rejected by the CAS on Friday. The Istanbul team beat Tromso in the Europa League playoffs, but the Norwegian club will now take Besiktas' place in the group stages. Blog: Can Qatar's World Cup be moved?

"(CNN) -- Taryn Lopez doesn't think it got too terribly cold during the two days she was stranded on Alaska's Mount Mageik volcano. ""I think about 28 degrees was the lowest we saw -- but then the temperature gauge was frozen,"" she said Saturday evening from King Salmon, Alaska. Thanks to sleeping bags, waterproof gear and emergency supplies, Lopez, a fellow researcher and a pilot survived unharmed in their iced-over helicopter from Wednesday until a rescue chopper scooped them up Friday. Pilot Sam Egli took John Paskievitch, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, and Lopez, a post-doctoral researcher, about 6,500 feet up the volcano on Wednesday. The researchers were picking up instruments to save them from the upcoming winter. Their work is aimed at learning how seismic readings are linked to the underlying causes of earthquakes. Some volcanic earthquakes quakes are caused by moving magma, water or gas, Lopez said. Knowing which substance is moving could help assess the risk of eruptions, she said. The trio took advantage of a break in the weather Wednesday to land at their highest instrument site on Mageik. ""There were blue skies when we landed,"" she said. But within half an hour, Egli told the researchers he was concerned about ice on the rotors. ""We grabbed our stuff and got in the helicopter,"" Lopez said, but even in the few minutes that took visibility became too poor for takeoff. Egli could call for help by satellite phone and radio, but the weather prevented a rescue attempt on Wednesday. On Thursday, rescuers circled overhead but could not land. Meanwhile, the three stayed in sleeping bags inside the helicopter except to answer nature's calls and shoot a flare at the request of the rescuers. There was enough food and water on board. ""Even though it wasn't that cold, it was pretty foul when you were outside,"" Lopez said. Lopez, 33, grew up in Rochester, Minnesota, and has spent time on mountains in Russia and Alaska, so she was prepared for the cold. But she was grateful for Paskievitch and Egli's decades of experience in the field. ""I felt really luck to be with those people,"" Lopez said. ""I know they kept us all alive."" She also praised the Alaska Air National Guard, which rescued her. ""It was such a relief hearing them up there even when they couldn't get in,"" she said. Paskievitch wasn't available to talk Saturday -- because he was back out on the mountain. Lopez said he hoped to check on the condition of the helicopter, where the researchers had to leave their instruments.","NEW: Rescued researcher describes two days in sleeping bags inside chopper .

"United Nations (CNN) -- Arab and Western diplomats spoke in support Tuesday of a U.N. Security Council draft resolution that calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, while representatives from Russia and China slammed it as meddlesome. More effective than the resolution, Russia and China said, would be the fostering of dialogue within the country. ""The council cannot impose the parameters for an internal political settlement,"" said Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations. ""We are convinced that at a time of intense internal political crisis, the role of the international community should not be one of exacerbating conflict, nor meddling by use of economic sanctions or military force."" The Security Council is considering a draft resolution proposed by Morocco that calls for al-Assad to transfer power to his vice president. Both China and Russia appear poised to veto it. The resolution supports ""full implementation"" of an Arab League report that called on Syria to form a unity government within two months, but stopped short of supporting military intervention or economic sanctions. Russia -- one of the five veto-wielding permanent members of the Security Council, as is China -- has said it is concerned about Syrian civil war and does not want al-Assad pushed out of power. It has proposed its own draft resolution that assigns equal blame for the violence on both al-Assad and the opposition. Earlier, Arab leaders told the council that Syria has failed to make reforms. Qatar's prime minister said ""the hope of the Syrian people is in your hands."" Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani cited the history of negotiations between the Arab League and the Syrian government. ""The crisis started with absolutely peaceful demonstrations."" The prime minister reiterated calls for the violence to end. ""The government killing machine continues effectively unabated."" Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby called for free elections and a multi-party system. ""Do not let the Syrian people down in its plight."" The Arab League: No longer toothless? Meanwhile, Syria's envoy to the United Nations said the nation is the victim of a systematic campaign to distort facts. The Arab League, he said, is interfering with Syrian affairs and has ignored reports from observers inside the country. ""Syria is going through decisive challenges in its history,"" said Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari. ""We want this stage to be through the will of our people, not through the will of anyone else."" ""That organization (the Arab League) is not speaking on behalf of all Arabs right now. Without Syria, there is not Arab League,"" he said. The Security Council has been unable to agree on any resolution on Syria. In October, Russia and China issued a rare double-veto of a resolution that lacked sanctions but would have condemned the violence in Syria. This latest draft also lacks sanctions, but is tougher than the October version, which said nothing about transfer of power. The Syrian regime is a major weapons client for Russia. Analysts with Max-Security Solutions, a security consulting firm based in Israel, said Monday in the New York Times that recent Russian arms sales to Syria are worth $4 billion, and that Russian business investments in Syria amount to nearly $20 billion. A Congressional Research Service report in 2008 said the two countries had ""concluded several significant arms deals."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told the Security Council that ""evidence is clear that Assad's forces are initiating nearly all the attacks that kill civilians, but as more citizens take up arms to resist the regime's brutality, violence is increasingly likely to spiral out of control."" She said it is crucial that the international community not embolden ""the dictator."" ""I know that some members here may be concerned that the Security Council may be headed toward another Libya. That is a false analogy,"" Clinton told the council. ""Syria is a unique situation that requires its own approach, tailored to the specific circumstances on the ground. And that is exactly what the Arab League has proposed -- a path for a political transition that would preserve Syria's unity and institutions."" She told reporters: ""At the end of the day, every member of that Security Council has a choice to make. If you do not choose to try to stand on the side of the Syrian people, then you are standing on the side of the continuing killing and abuses that are carried out every single day."" Clinton's support of the draft resolution was echoed by British Foreign Secretary William Hague and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. The French representative said the silence of the council was ""no longer acceptable,"" while Hague stressed that the resolution does not call for military action, ""and could not be used to authorize it."" ""This is not the West telling Syria what to do. It is not the permanent members of the Security Council seeking to impose their view. This is the Arab Nations calling on the U.N. Security Council to help address the crisis in Syria and the threat that it poses to the stability of their region,"" he said. As diplomats debated, a humanitarian crisis is unfolding in several areas of Syria, according to opposition activists. At least 7,100 people -- including 461 children -- have died since the start of the anti-government uprising in March, the Local Coordination Committees in Syria (LCC), an opposition group that organizes and documents demonstrations, said Tuesday. The United Nations estimated last month that more than 5,000 people have died since March, though it has also said it has been unable to update that figure because of the situation on the ground. CNN cannot independently confirm opposition or government reports from Syria because access to the country is limited. At least 37 people were confirmed dead Tuesday, including 16 in Idlib, 12 in Homs, three in Daraa, one each in Damascus, Hama and Aleppo, and three in the Damascus suburbs, according to the LCC. The group reported 100 deaths Monday. Much of Ghouta, in the eastern suburbs of Damascus, faces a ""complete siege and closure"" after days of sustained bombings that killed dozens, the LCC said. Electricity, water, heating fuel and food are in short supply, and communications are interrupted, the LCC said. ""We appeal to the Red Cross and the Red Crescent and all relevant international organizations to go to the area and provide relief for its people with food, medicine, and shelter and to pressure the criminal regime to stop its ongoing crimes against our people,"" the group said in a statement. A spokesman for the rebel group Revolutionary Council in Irbin, just outside Damascus, told CNN Tuesday, ""What we are witnessing today is a heavy attack by tanks and artillery on the eastern outskirts."" At about 8 a.m., the army reached the main square, he said. There were several ""massive explosions,"" though it was not clear if they all came from within Irbin, he said. Earlier, by 6 a.m., the city was blocked and no one was allowed to leave amid a ""massive presence of soldiers,"" he said. The spokesman, going by the pseudonym Abu Sayeed, said there were two confirmed deaths in the city. On Monday, no one could get to a dead body for six hours because of sniper fire, he said. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Arwa Damon, Alla Eshchenko, Jill Dougherty, Richard Roth, Josh Levs, and Brian Walker contributed to this report.","NEW: British Foreign Secretary William Hague: ""This is not the West telling Syria what to do""

"(CNN) -- North Korea is one of the world's most mysterious and secretive states, regarded as a political pariah and at bitter loggerheads with its neighbor South Korea. Few people are allowed past its tightly-sealed borders but footballer Ryang Yong-Gi, who was born and raised in Japan by a loyally North Korean family, is in a privileged position when it comes to entering and exiting. The 31-year-old is captain of top Japanese club Vegalta Sendai, and also plays for the national side of North Korea -- which in the past has faced allegations of mistreatment of its sports teams after major events. ""My number one hope is for North and South Korea to become united,"" he told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I think it will contribute to the development of the country in many ways. I think it will open up new possibilities beyond soccer and sports."" A hero to football fans in both Japan and North Korea, Ryang symbolizes the unique power of sport to break down boundaries despite deep-seated differences. He does not talk about politics with his North Korean teammates -- ""They ask me about cars or soccer magazines I have with me"" -- but his own views have been shaped by his upbringing, in which he had to gain acceptance in two very different societies. The Korean community in Japan has an uneasy relationship, at best, with the indigenous population, amid a perpetual state of mistrust on both sides. Ongoing tensions over disputed territory -- a small group of islands situated between Japan and the Korean peninsula -- has ratcheted up the political rhetoric and fueled prejudices. But not only has Ryang won respect for his footballing feats, helping his team from J-League division two also-rans to top-flight championship contenders, he has also achieved cult status, regardless of his background. ""I think 90% of the Vegalta's supporters don't care about whether he is North Korean or Japanese,"" local businessman Shuichi Kanno, a loyal club fan, told CNN. Legendary player . ""We feel he loves the team. He is a legend and his story should be remembered, even after he retires,"" he added. Ryang, who has been with the club since 2004, admitted he was initially apprehensive about the reaction of fans. ""I wondered if people would cheer me, a North Korean, but once I was on the team and started playing, I felt l like I was being supported a lot,"" he said. ""The fans love this team, their local team, and they support me as a part of the team, maybe even more so than to other members."" Watch: Chasing North Korea's football team . Born in 1982, Ryang grew up in the city of Osaka with Korean parents, who are second generation immigrants to Japan. Japan occupied the Korean peninsula from 1905 to 1945. Well over half a million Koreans who came to Japan during that troubled period stayed after World War II ended, including Ryang's grandfather. The subsequent Korean War led to two bitterly divided states in the North and South, and Korean immigrants left in Japan also split into separate communities. Strict loyalty . One of the consequences was special North Korean schools, where the DPRK's flag could be seen flying in the playground, with portraits of leaders such as Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il on the classroom walls. Strict loyalty to that regime is engendered, and that is the education that Ryang received up until high school when, thanks to his sporting and academic achievements, he entered the mainstream Japanese university system. But the limited range of sporting opportunities in his early schooling also played an inadvertent role in his subsequent professional career. ""My father introduced me to football when I was two or three years old,"" he recalled. ""Then I went to North Korean schools where only football was available, and myself and other students would play from morning to night -- so in that sense, I think I was blessed."" Ryang was also blessed with a formidable talent and, on leaving education in 2003 found his place in the Vegalta Sendai squad, then playing in the J-League second division. It was not long before international recognition arrived -- though not for Japan (""I have never thought about it"") but through his upbringing and family ties, for North Korea. Representing his country in Macao, Ryang scored in a 2-0 win over South Korea in the semifinals of the East Asia Games. Winning acceptance . He admits his enthusiasm to impress, to win acceptance as an ""outsider"" got the better of him as he charged around the pitch in his midfield role. ""I played in a reckless manner. I felt the need to impress so they would invite me again to play in the national team."" Ryang did impress enough to secure further call-ups, one of a small cadre of Japan-based players with a similar background, who represent North Korea. He was top scorer as North Korea won the 2010 AFC Asian Challenge Cup, and also took part in a successful qualification campaign for that year's 2010 World Cup finals. But it is in club football in the highly competitive J-League where he has made the biggest impression, with Vegalta emerging as challengers for the first division title in recent seasons. Ryang has been an ever present and key member of the side, but it was the shattering events of March 11, 2011 -- when an earthquake and tsunami hit Japan -- which firmly cemented him as a fan favorite. Sendai was near the epicenter of the quake and Ryang was out driving when it hit. ""I thought my tires had gone flat or I had driven over the curb, but the shaking continued and I saw the windows of shops shaking too,"" he recalled. ""I knew it was a bad one and rushed home to see my wife."" Earthquake disaster . Ryang and his heavily pregnant wife spent the night sleeping in their car, fearful of further damage to buildings in an urban landscape that suffered severe wreckage. In the aftermath of the disaster, Ryang and his teammates made frequent visits to affected areas to lend support. The performances of the team also boosted morale, eventually finishing fourth in the J-League with Ryang providing inspiring captaincy, . Kanno, a restaurant owner in the coastal town of Kesennuma which was heavily hit by the tsunami, said Ryang and his teammates made all the difference in those terrible times for the area. ""During the tsunami year, Vegalta and his play gave us an energy, whether they won or lost,"" Kanno said. ""We are so grateful that he led the team to fourth in the league that year. ""We also would like to thank him that he has stayed with our team despite getting good offers from other teams (in the J-League)."" Ryang's international career has involved intermittent trips to Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, where he joins up with the domestic based players. It is seen as one of the most secretive setups in world soccer, due to the DPRK government's isolationist policies. Affluent lifestyle . However, aside from their interest in the trappings of the affluent lifestyle in Japan, Ryang said his teammates were well acquainted with the action from major football leagues such as the English Premier League and Spain's La Liga. ""Their in-depth knowledge of famous players demonstrates to me that they do watch a lot of soccer on television,"" he revealed. So when North Korea qualified for the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa, drawn to play mighty Brazil in the first group match, it's safe to say they would have known all about Kaka and Robinho and their teammates. Ryang missed out on selection for the tournament, though he trained with the squad as cover. Despite his personal disappointment, he describes North Korea's narrow 2-1 defeat by the five-time world champion Brazil team  as his ""most memorable match, a moving experience."" That match was a high point -- but North Korea's World Cup ended in embarrassment, losing 7-0 to Portugal and then 3-0 to the Ivory Coast. The squad and head coach Kim Jong Hun were reportedly publicly humiliated by government officials on their return home, though in August 2010 soccer's world governing body halted its investigation into the claims after failing to find enough evidence. In a statement on its official website, FIFA described the allegations as ""baseless."" Role models . Ryang had starred in North Korea's lifting of the AFC Asian Challenge Cup in the World Cup year, contributing goals from midfield (""every goal felt amazing"") and also helped the team retain the trophy last year. 2012 was also to prove his most successful season at club level, with Vegalta Sendai finishing second in the league, beaten to the title by Sanfrecce Hiroshima in the closing stages of the season. Despite being in the autumn of his career, Ryang has entertained no thoughts of retiring and retains a real love for his sport. ""Soccer is part of my life, and it's also my job and I never get tired of it,"" he said. His role models are players such as Andres Iniesta of Barcelona and former Serbian great Dragan Stojkovic -- both attacking midfielders in his mold. Ryang admits that Stojkovic, who is now manager of J-League side Nagoya Grampus, was his hero from boyhood days: ""I've always admired him."" Like Stojkovic, Ryang has assumed a captaincy role with his club and takes his responsibilities incredibly seriously. ""I need to have a strong presence in the team, and I also need to be trusted by other players,"" is his philosophy on leadership. ""I make sure that I run the most, try to stay in the game all the time and make a big effort to change the outcome."" He might be a dogged hard worker on the pitch, but off it he does indulge in a passion he shares with many football stars. ""I love cars. I do not have any favorite model, but when I am allowed to test drive one, I love it instantly and end up buying it,"" he says. ""As I am not a player blessed with speed, I tend to drive a fast car. Everyone tells me I drive fast and rough."" CNN's Chie Kobayashi contributed to this article.","Ryang Yong-Gi is a Japan-born footballer who represents North Korea .

"(CNN) -- Authorities imposed gasoline rationing on motorists in New York City and Long Island on Thursday, a day after a nor'easter added to the woes of a region still grappling with the damage left behind by last week's Superstorm Sandy. The orders from Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Gov. Andrew Cuomo restrict private owners to buying fuel for their vehicles on either odd- or even-numbered days, depending on their license numbers. Commercial vehicles are exempt from the order, which they said is aimed at easing a fuel crunch caused when Sandy smacked the region. ""Drivers are still facing long lines, frustrations are only growing and it now appears that there will be shortages for possibly another couple of weeks,"" Bloomberg told reporters Thursday afternoon. ""The best way, we think, to cut down the lines and help customers buy gas faster, to help gas stations stay open longer and to reduce the potential for disorder, is to alternate the days that drivers can purchase gas."" The order takes effect Friday morning. New Jersey, where Sandy made landfall October 29, put similar rules into effect last week in 12 counties. At least 658,000 utility customers remained without electricity across the region, most of them in New York and New Jersey, with the nor'easter that swept through Wednesday only adding to those totals. Cold brings fresh misery to Sandy victims . ""The main thing is we need heat and electricity,"" Christine Holland, a relief coordinator in Brooklyn's Gerritsen Beach neighborhood, told CNN. Holland appealed to plumbers, electricians and boiler mechanics to volunteer their help to residents, as well as counselors for people still dealing with the trauma of last week's storm. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told reporters Thursday morning that the nor'easter was responsible for 167,000 new outages, but praised utility workers who were trying to get the lights and heat back on. ""These men and women on the utility companies are working 16-hour days, every day,"" Christie said. ""So I know that unless your power is turned on, that doesn't mean anything to you -- but I'm telling you, I've watched these people work. They were working last night through the snow."" Thursday's temperatures were in the mid-40s in much of the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut communities that were ravaged by Sandy, which killed 111 people in the region, knocked out power to millions and flooded large swaths of the heavily urbanized area. The new storm brought snowfalls ranging from two inches on Atlantic City, where Sandy hit, to more than a foot of snow in parts of Connecticut. ""Just what New Jersey needs now,"" said Justin Page of Montclair, about 10 miles west of Manhattan. ""We have lost power where we never had before, and the winds are picking up dramatically, which is disturbing the debris left from Sandy."" About 6 inches of snow fell by Thursday morning on Newark, where Mayor Cory Booker called it ""Mother Nature's one-two punch."" Storm grants focus on low-wage workers . ""It's testing the resolve and the grit of my state and my city and, obviously, this region,"" Booker said on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" The new storm crashed into the area barely a week after Sandy, which Cuomo said Thursday had inflicted $33 billion in damage to New York state and $50 billion to the region. Freeport, along Long Island's southern coast, was one of the communities hit hard by the nor'easter. ""This storm just made everything worse,"" Shanel Francis told CNN affiliate News 12. Sandy swamped her home with 4 feet of storm surge last week. Bloomberg had urged residents in the city's low-lying areas -- especially Breezy Point, Hamilton Beach and Gerritsen Beach -- to ""consider going someplace else"" Wednesday night, ""to be a little bit on the safe side."" But he issued no mandatory evacuation orders, other than for a handful of chronic-care facilities and an adult-care center in areas that were hit hard by Sandy. ""If people think you're crying wolf, the next time, when it's really a serious threat, they might not do it,"" the mayor said. That was not the case in New Jersey, where the Brick Township Office of Emergency Management issued a mandatory evacuation order for all residents of low-lying waterfront areas of town. Flights continued to be affected, and authorities advised air travelers to check with their carriers ahead of the storm. ""Airlines serving the Port Authority's major airports -- Newark Liberty International, John F. Kennedy International and LaGuardia -- have canceled all or a significant number of their flights"" through Thursday morning. The storm that broke records -- and hearts .

"(CNN) -- An explosion rocked the Amuay oil refinery in northwestern Venezuela, killing 39 people, including a 10-year-old boy, a Venezuelan official said Saturday. More than 80 people were injured, Vice President Elias Jaua told state-run VTV. ""People are very scared,"" said Falcon State Gov. Stella Lugo, according to the state-run AVN news agency. ""They evacuated the areas that had to be evacuated, but the situation, as the technicians are telling within the refinery, is controlled."" President Hugo Chavez decreed three days of mourning and gave his condolences to families of the victims. The incident occurred at 1:11 a.m. when ""we had a release of gas whose origin we are going to determine,"" Rafael Ramirez, president of the state-owned petroleum company PDVSA, told VTV. ""The gas generated a cloud that then exploded and provoked fires in at least two tanks of the refinery and in the surrounding areas."" He said the explosion damaged the infrastructure of the refinery and nearby houses. The refinery -- one of the world's largest -- is part of the giant Paraguana complex in Falcon state. Venezuela, a founding member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is one of the world's largest oil exporters. The nation has a refinery capacity of more than 1 million barrels per day, according to OPEC. Venezuela's oil revenues represent some 94% of the country's export earnings, more than half of federal budget revenues and some 30% of gross domestic product, OPEC says. The South American country sends a large percentage of its exports to the United States, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu has a few choice words for the feuding family of Nelson Mandela: Resolve your differences, and stop tainting the former president's name. Tutu intervened after a bitter dispute among relatives over the burial of Mandela's three deceased children. His grandson exhumed them from Qunu two years ago, then reburied them in Mvezo. The rest of the family sued the grandson, and a court ordered him to return the remains to Qunu, where the former president spent his childhood. They were reburied there this week. The drama has played out in public, with the grandson, Mandla Mandela, lashing out at his relatives during a news conference. Mandela's family dispute comes at a precarious time. The statesman is hospitalized and on life support for a recurring lung infection. Though he has been getting kidney dialysis, he is not in a vegetative state and opens his eyes when people talk to him, a source with direct knowledge of the situation told CNN on Friday. The feud has appalled the nation, prompting Tutu to step in and appeal to the family to stop. ""Please, please, please may we think not only of ourselves. It's almost like spitting in Madiba's face,"" Tutu said in a statement, according to the South African Press Association. ""Your anguish, now, is the nation's anguish -- and the world's. We want to embrace you, to support you, to shine our love for Madiba through you."" Madiba is the revered statesman's clan name. Mandela has been hospitalized in Pretoria for nearly a month. Court documents filed in relation to the case revealed more details on the condition of South Africa's first black president. His health had declined so sharply last week that his family was considering whether to take him off life support, a court document revealed Thursday. His condition later improved. The document, known as a ""certificate of urgency,"" was filed on June 26. It stated that Mandela, 94, had taken ""a turn for the worst"" and doctors had advised his family to switch off his life support machine. ""Rather than prolonging his suffering, the Mandela family is exploring this option as a very real probability,"" it added. Mandela remains in critical but stable condition, President Jacob Zuma's office reported Thursday. Considered the founding father of South Africa's democracy, Mandela became an international figure while enduring 27 years in prison for fighting against apartheid, the country's system of racial segregation. He emerged from prison in 1990 and became the nation's first black president four years later. His lung problems started during his years in prison under the nation's now-defunct apartheid regime. Tutu, who was also a hero of the anti-apartheid movement, is friends with Mandela. The remains are Mandela's daughter, Makaziwe Mandela, who died as a baby in 1948; his eldest son, Madiba Thembekile, who died in a car crash in 1969; and Makgatho Mandela, father to Mandla, who died in 2005. Before they were reburied this week, a forensic test was done to confirm the identities of the bodies. CNN's Robyn Curnow reported from Pretoria, and Faith Karimi reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- She's the sea turtle that didn't want to get away. A rehabilitated Georgia sea turtle who never seemed to want to return to the ocean is finally getting a permanent home -- serving as her species' newest ambassador at Sea World. The loggerhead sea turtle named Caton has spent the past three years at the Georgia Sea Turtle Center on Jekyll Island after being found stranded in 2009 and diagnosed as severely debilitated. After months of treatment, Caton was deemed healthy enough to return to her native waters, but she simply sat on the beach, refusing to go in, the center said. Staff brought her back to the center and tried to release her again months later, but Caton just swam back and forth in shallow water, then got stuck on a sandbar. A third attempt last October seemed to be successful. This time, staff put her in a boat and released her offshore, watching her swim away into the Atlantic like a regular sea turtle. Their hopes for Caton's new life were dashed a week later, however, when she was found stranded on a Jekyll Island beach. She had swum back and didn't want to leave. A lucky loggerhead turtle survives the odds . ""For these reasons, we consider her unreleasable,"" said the center's director, Terry Norton. ""The center receives injured and ill sea turtles for rehabilitation purposes, but some of these turtles have permanent issues and are deemed unreleasable back to the wild. If an unreleasable sea turtle can survive comfortably in a captive setting, the center will make every attempt to place the turtle in a suitable facility."" After months of looking, staff managed to find a new home for Caton at Sea World Orlando. Caton will be taken there next week to be part of the park's new sea turtle exhibit, the center said. ""Caton is a beautiful sea turtle and will be a great ambassador for her species,"" Norton said. ""She is a favorite of many of our visitors and I am confident she will hold a special place in the hearts of her new visitors."" All sea turtles in U.S. waters are classified as endangered species. The center describes a plethora of threats from disease and algae blooms to natural predators like raccoons and sea gulls who nab the eggs and hatchlings. Human activity also poses problems for the reptiles' recovery. Besides pollution, boat strikes and coastal development, the turtles can get caught in fishing nets or crushed by fishing dredges that are dragged along the ocean floor. 7 prime spots for wildlife viewing .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- If you're trying to find a job these days, it might help to get rid of your cigarette habit. A hospital in the Atlanta suburbs is the latest employer nationwide that is refusing to hire smokers. Gwinnett Medical Center instituted the policy July 1, but other hospitals, including Cleveland Medical Center in Ohio, also have the policy. The Scotts Miracle-Gro Co., the lawn-care giant, hasn't hired smokers since 2006. Steve Nadeau, Gwinnett Medical Center senior vice president of human resources, said the policy is an extension of their efforts to promote better health. ""We believe it's just supporting good health, we're a health care provider,"" Nadeau said. ""We've had a smoking prohibition inside ... and outside and it's just really kind of a natural evolution,"" he said. Existing employees who smoke will not be fired. The medical center offers smoking cessation classes and has plans to revamp signage throughout their facility. Nadeau said the response from focus groups and employees has been ""good."" ""We hope it won't mean we will lose good employees, but I have no doubt there are going to be folks we won't be able to get. From a policy standpoint it's the right direction for us,"" he said. But Dr. Michael Siegel, a Boston University professor of public health, said the policy is an invasion of privacy and keeps qualified medical professionals away. ""From personal experience as a physician, some of the best nurses happen to be smokers,"" Siegel said. ""Are you willing to hire staff that is not the best qualified simply because you're trying to make this point about how bad smoking is?"" Siegel, who is quick to note he supports smoke-free workplaces, said ""regulating someone's private behavior in their own home ... really represents employment discrimination and has nothing to do with qualifications for the job. If the hospital is so concerned about health, you can make the exact same argument about overweight people."" The rate of smoking among physicians is low, Siegel said. But the rate among nurses is more than 20 percent -- higher than the general population. ""This policy will result in the hospital not hiring the most qualified people. You're eliminating 20 percent of the population,"" he said. The National Institute of Business Management's website reports that as of 2007, laws in 30 states and the District of Columbia prohibit employers from discriminating against employees or applicants based on the person's off-duty use of tobacco. Gary Nolan, a spokesman for Citizens Freedom Alliance: The Smoker's Club, is annoyed by the ban but supports private businesses' right to hire anyone they want. ""If you go in for heart surgery, do you really care if your surgeon smokes?"" Nolan said. But in Ohio, Cleveland Clinic officials say the hiring ban in place since 2007 is a success. ""It was a policy directive by our CEO (Dr. Delos Cosgrove) who wanted to fully enhance the idea of a health institution being what it says it is -- a healthy place to work,"" said Dr. Paul Terpeluk, Medical Director of Employee Health. ""He felt health care workers shouldn't be smokers."" Since the policy began, 250 potential employees have failed the drug test for nicotine. Cleveland hires 5,000 employees a year, Terpeluk said. Those who fail the test can reapply in 90 days. ""It does make sense if you're a health care institution, you want everyone to be as healthy as possible,"" he said, adding that employees are also given incentives to lose weight. Hospital officials don't think the policy affects the quality of employees they hire. ""Cleveland Clinic is a center of excellence and when people apply here they really want to come work at this institution. We don't want smokers. It's not in line with our caregiver mission,"" he said. Industries outside health care have also dabbled in banning smokers from employment. Scotts Miracle-Gro not only bans smokers from employment, it fires employees who smoke. Jim King, senior vice president of corporate affairs, said the self-insured company decided smokers' heath care costs were too high. ""Like everybody else, we were looking at wellness and health care and the drivers of health care costs,"" King said. Before the policy, 30 percent of Scotts' 8,000 employees smoked. Now that number is less than 7 percent.","Georgia hospital starts screening smokers out of the hiring process .

"(CNN) -- For the 20 million residents of Beijing, air pollution -- and the lack of official information about it -- is a constant concern. Until recently, eye-watering smog was the only reliable sign that car fumes and smoke had reached unsafe levels, but now two young designers have come up with a more elegant and accurate indicator of air quality. Xiaowei Wang worked with Deren Guler, a fellow design student, to develop the concept of FLOAT Beijing, a network of air-quality monitors fixed to the kites traditionally flown across the city. Lights controlled by sensorS and trailing along the kite string like fireflies would give a simple readout of pollution levels: green for safe and red for danger. Kites flying has a long history in Beijing, which helped Wang and Guler to get local residents involved in the project -- something that they considered crucial to its success. They organized a series of workshops at which people could modify their own kites, turning them into mobile air-quality monitors. ""At first we were really worried no local citizens would show up to any of the workshops, that it might just be university students or expats who already have access to things like Twitter,"" Wang says -- but they were amazed at how many elderly people joined in. ""They were incredibly excited and it tapped into their (sense of) youthful activism, and they started telling neighbors, bringing their grandchildren to the events."" Read this: Tiny computer takes prize at design awards . Wang said that the workshops also helped break down barriers between the kite fliers and the equipment they were working with. ""It was not just about putting technology into a black box or having people buy modules that they could read data off,"" she said. ""It was really allowing people to see how (the sensors) functioned and therefore develop a relationship to the technology."" The sensors used for the project measure carbon monoxide, ozone and general particulates. Guler acknowledges that the traffic-light readouts provide a ballpark guide to pollution levels rather than specific quantitative data, and that some critics and supporters have suggested they adopt a more rigorous approach. In response, she says that the simplicity of the data is one of its strengths. ""We didn't just collect the data and put it on a spreadsheet online,"" she says. ""We displayed it in a way that was really intuitive. Everyone understood that different colors mean different pollution levels and just the activity of kite flying itself was also a really exciting way to distribute information."" Designers often start with a small-scale solution to a big problem, according to Patrick Frick. He is a member of the jury for the INDEX: Awards -- held last week, and for which FLOAT was nominated -- and a partner at Social Investors, a consultancy that advises people trying to tackle social and environmental challenges. ""They start by sketching out an idea, followed by building prototypes that can then be tested with early users,"" he said. ""The feedback received can then be used to further improve the product. FLOAT is at that early stage. ""For FLOAT to have the maximum impact, it must succeed in creating a larger demand for its product and get it to the buyer. The hope is that FLOAT receives more attention now through the nomination, which in turn helps the designers to attract partners that can help develop the product further, mass-produce and distribute it."" One recent upgrade the designers have made is to add a GPS locator and a memory card to the sensor, so the kite fliers will now be able to record pollution readings over time and plot them on maps of the city. The intention is that these pollution maps should be open source, so that anyone in the city can analyze or add to the data. ""We're really interested in the more political aspects of data,"" Guler says. ""What we're really interested in is finding a way to distribute intelligence as opposed to just information, and empowering people to interpret the data.""","A pair of young designers have created kites that monitor Beijing's air quality .

"(CNN) -- What is jazz? This is an impossible question, and one with many answers. Having spent more than a decade as a jazz artist, I've garnered some insights. As a youngster growing up in New Orleans, surrounded by the city's sounds and rhythms, I was influenced by a wide variety of music: brass bands, blues, ragtime, R&B, soul, rock 'n' roll, Dixieland and more. I played the percussion in my family's band, switching to piano at age 11. Since then, music has been a part of my everyday life. I've had the good fortune to play with inspiring artists across many genres -- Wynton Marsalis, Prince, Busta Rhymes among them. What's given me the foundation to be able to join such varied musicians is my jazz training. Jazz is subtle, emotional and accommodating. It is intellectual and sometimes even scientific. Most genres of music are not nearly as multidimensional, which in part is why the art form has such a small audience. In stark comparison to pop music, contemporary jazz seems too circuitous for most listeners to enjoy casually. The challenge for the contemporary jazz musician, as I see it, is making this subtle and complex art palatable to the greater public. Jazz is complex. Some of the greatest musical minds of all-time were jazz artists. They were able to master their instruments, redefine music theory and repeatedly innovate the already formidable body of work present before them. Many of them did so while navigating through the tumultuous social climate from which the music was birthed. John Blake: Dave Brubeck, ambassador to a new America . As a performer, part of my job is to take the audience on a musical journey to somewhere they've never been. The Stay Human movement I've started is about experiencing music -- not about it being on a stage and untouchable, but something that you viscerally experience on the subways and streets. Stay Human has grown to be more than a band, and has become a local movement that is expanding and shifting the way people experience jazz. We're trying to harness all of the musical elements that I grew up absorbing in New Orleans, and couple them with contemporary mainstream sounds. I want people to feel and hear jazz as they never thought it could be played. In the midst of the ""plug in/tune out"" nature of modern day society, we believe that the human interaction of a live musical performance can uplift humanity. Stay Human can happen anywhere. Not only in a music hall or official venue, but on streets and subways or among unsuspecting (and often pleased) patrons at a restaurant. We refer to these moments as a #loveriot and anyone can join. Keeping the Jazz Fest alive . At the core of the experience is the band, a group of my friends who are all world-class, Juilliard-trained musicians in their 20s. The music is central to the experience, but it isn't just about the music. Ultimately, it's about people from all walks of life coming together to share an authentic and transformative moment through the power of music. Maya Angelou once said, ""I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel."" Jazz is a tradition. The way jazz musicians walk, talk and greet each other, and the way they play is very distinct. To be a jazz artist is to be a part of a lineage. To play jazz is to contribute to world history. To be a part of this tradition means that you are challenged to transform other people with the sound of your instrument. You are challenged to swing. You are challenged to contribute to the body of work established by some of the greatest artistic minds of all time, work that includes these treasures: . • A performance of ""Fine and Mellow"" by Billie Holiday, Lester Young and others from a CBS television broadcast in New York on December 8, 1957. It is generally considered one of the greatest moments for jazz ever broadcast on live television. • ""It Don't Mean A Thing"" by Duke Ellington features catchy vocals, hard swing, jazz violin and awesome horn section parts that epitomize what the jazz tradition is all about. • ""Every Time We Say Goodbye"" Ray Charles and Betty Carter from their album together. Exquisite! • ""I'm Just a Lucky So and So"" from the album by Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. It is a supreme example of the blues with utmost sophistication and feeling. The way Duke accompanies Satchmo is masterful, and the personality of the two of them signifies what jazz is all about. Gene Seymour: Brubeck, jazz master with a big heart . As an artist, it is exciting to explore the sound of your identity. Jazz music teaches you about who you are by exploring the humanity of others. It accommodates who you are. The inimitable genius Charlie Parker stated it best when he said, ""Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art."" Jazz is an experience. Jazz is wonderful because it's all about the moment, and I firmly believe in creating unforgettable experiences. With the Stay Human band, it's never only about the stage. What we love is taking the music to the people in the streets -- jumping off stage into the audience, performing in moving vehicles, New York subways, streets and, yes, unsuspecting restaurants. For me, jazz is all about transformation in the moment. It is the most immediate form of musical expression in existence, and the language that we use to state our deepest, truest feelings. It is the American art form that is globally owned. What is jazz? Jazz is now! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jonathan Batiste.","Jonathan Batiste: Jazz is the musical language used to state our deepest, truest feelings .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev visited islands claimed by both Russia and Japan on Tuesday, provoking an angry reaction from Tokyo. He held a meeting with the governor of Sakhalin and visited Kunashir Island, which is near Japan's large northern island of Hokkaido. Kunashir is one of the Kuril Islands, which Russia considers part of its Sakhalin region. But Japan claims some of the islands as its territory. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said Tuesday that Russia was taking the ""wrong position"" with the visit. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said there was nothing to comment on when he was asked about the visit. ""The Russian prime minister was on a scheduled tour of his country,"" he said. Lavrov said he hoped to meet his Japanese counterpart ""very soon"" to discuss cooperation between the countries ""substantively and constructively."" Medvedev held talks with Sakhalin's governor on improving air transportation between islands, according to the Russian Federation's government website. When he was president, Medvedev became the first Russian leader to visit the islands when he went there in November 2010. The Kurils stretch between Russia in the north and Japan in the south. Following Japan's defeat in World War II in 1945, the Soviet Union annexed the four southernmost islands, which previously belonged to Japan. Ever since, the islands -- called the South Kurils by Russia and the Northern Territories by Japan -- have been the subject of dispute. That dispute has prevented the two countries from signing a formal peace treaty following World War II.

"(CNN) -- The question is a serious one, and its answer has multiple political and security implications: Did a Mexican political party have agreements with organized crime, specifically the PRI which governed Mexico for 71 years? The way Mexican President Felipe Calderon answered this question when asked by New York Times reporters is creating quite a stir. Asked whether he fears that a victory by the PRI in next year's presidential elections may bring back a corrupt relationship with organized crime, Calderon, a member of the PAN, conceded that is one of his fears. ""It depends on who"" wins the elections, the president told the Times. ""There are many in the PRI who agree with the (hard-line) policy I have, at least they say so in secret, while publicly they may say something else. There are many in the PRI who think the deals of the past would work now. I don't see what deal could be done, but that is the mentality many of them have. If that opinion prevails it would worry me."" PRI congresswoman and former party president Beatriz Paredes lashed out at the president for making the statement. ""I don't consider it an appropriate statement for a head of state,"" said the former Tlaxcala governor. ""I cannot respect a Mexican president who travels abroad to make (irresponsible) statements about the opposition without proof. It sounds more like a statement from the member of a political party. I think that if the Mexican head of state has proof about that kind of allegations he would have to take legal action in Mexico,"" Paredes said. The controversy, which started Sunday with the publication of the president's comments, prompted Mexican Interior Minister Jose Francisco Blake Mora to make a public appearance Monday to clarify the issue in front of the Mexican media. ""The president didn't say anything that hasn't been said before, particularly the permissibility, the inaction and omissions that have weakened the institutions of our country,"" Blake Mora said. He specifically accused former Nuevo Leon Gov. Socrates Rizzo of publicly advocating a policy of negotiation with organized crime. During a speech to law students at the Autonomous University of Coahuila, Rizzo, a PRI member, said that in a way, prior administrations, in the hands of the PRI until the year 2000, had ""solved the problem of drug trafficking."" ""There used to be control, a strong state, a strong president, a strong attorney general's office and tightly controlled army. In a way, they (government officials) would tell them (organized crime): 'You cross through here and you through there; but don't touch these places,"" Rizzo said. His statement, made in February, was widely quoted by Mexican newspapers. Asked to clarify, Rizzo told Mexican media that he was referring to agreements between the different levels of government, not the drug cartels. Pressed on whether Calderon was accusing the PRI as a whole, Blake Mora said that ""it's false that the president has accused the PRI as an institution. He was referring to some PRI members who advocate that position."" Blake Mora pointed out that there are numerous Mexican public officials in prison, convicted of serving the interests of organized crime. ""Is this really something we don't know about?"" he asked reporters at the press conference. ""That's why we're working on a new dynamic, a new platform which will strengthen the institutions of our country,"" he said.","President Calderon suggests elections next year might give organized crime an opening .

"Editor's note: Campbell Brown anchors CNN's ""Campbell Brown: No Bias, No Bull"" at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays. She delivered this commentary during the ""Cutting through the Bull"" segment of Wednesday night's broadcast. CNN's Campbell Brown says President Bush is now a chastened cowboy. (CNN) -- It was one of the best known lines President Bush ever uttered. Just a few months after the September 11 attacks, who can forget what he said about catching Osama bin Laden: . President Bush: I don't care, dead or alive either way. I mean I uh, it doesn't matter to me. Secondly, I don't know if we're gonna get him tomorrow or a month from now, or a year from now, but we're gonna get him. That was Bush the cowboy with a pledge to the American people. At the time, it felt as though there was no bigger priority. But it's now eight years later. Listen to President Bush talk about bin Laden now, at the end of his presidency, a chastened cowboy at best: . Larry King: ...Are we ever, ever going to find bin Laden? Bush: Yes, of course. Absolutely. King: You are confident, based on -- . Bush: Because we have a lot of people looking for him, a lot of assets out there. He can't run forever. Just like the people who allegedly were involved in the East African bombings, couple of them were brought to justice recently. King: Did we ever come close? Bush: I don't know. I can't answer that. King: You don't know. Bush: I really don't know. I'm not trying to hide anything. You would think that of all people, he would be able to answer that question. So looking ahead -- well frankly, the view seems pretty grim. Vice President-elect Joe Biden and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham are just back from a Middle East tour, including visits to Iraq and Afghanistan. They are giving President-elect Barack Obama a dire warning -- the fight in Afghanistan is about to get ugly.

"(CNN) -- Thirteen patients who underwent surgery this summer may have been exposed to a fatal brain disease after their surgeries were performed using the same potentially contaminated medical equipment, according to health officials in two states. The specialized equipment was originally used to operate on a patient now suspected of having Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday. The now-deceased patient had neurosurgery at Catholic Medical Center in Manchester, New Hampshire. The only way to confirm the illness is with an autopsy. The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday that it is monitoring eight patients who were operated on with the same equipment for signs of the fatal brain disease. On Thursday, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health followed with its own statement, saying five additional patients who underwent surgery at a Cape Cod Hospital may also have been exposed. The surgical equipment used at both hospitals was from Medtronic Inc. according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Normal sterilization procedures don't get rid of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease proteins, known as prions, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Most medical devices are sterilized by heat, but the World Health Organization recommends the use of a caustic chemical like sodium hydroxide to disinfect equipment that may have come in contact with tissues that could cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It's common for hospitals to share this kind of specialized medical equipment, said Dr. Donald Guadagnoli, chief medical officer for Cape Cod Healthcare. ""People apparently are unaware, at least in some specialties, that it is regularly common for instruments to be moved around, to be rented and loaned,"" he said. ""We are comfortable with our sterilization process."" The five patients in Massachusetts each had spinal cord surgery at Cape Cod Hospital between July and August, and all the potentially affected patients have been notified of the risk, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health said. The department added that the risk to the potentially affected patients is very low because they underwent spinal cord surgery instead of brain surgery. There is no danger to hospital staff or members of the public, according to the statement. ""Our concern is with the health and well-being of the eight patients who may have been exposed to CJD,"" Dr. Joseph Pepe, Catholic Medical Center's CEO, said in a statement Wednesday. ""We will work closely with these families to help them in any way possible, even though the risk of infection is extremely low."" An autopsy of the original patient to confirm the illness -- which differs from a variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease commonly known as ""mad cow disease"" -- is being conducted at the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center, Catholic Medical Center said Wednesday (PDF). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that no cases of the disease have been linked to the use of contaminated medical equipment since 1976. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease strikes fewer than 400 people a year in the United States, according to the CDC. Victims show signs of memory loss and cognitive difficulty early on; the ailment is ""rapidly progressive and always fatal,"" the CDC says. Florida boy dies from brain-eating parasite .

"(CNN) -- The ripple effects of an alleged chemical attack in Syria are being felt across the globe. The rhetoric is ratcheting up with talk of punishing Syria, even though Syria denies using chemical weapons. Allies of President Bashar al-Assad accuse the rebel forces of carrying out the chemical strike. Meanwhile rebel forces, who also deny responsibility for the strike, say 1,300 people died in the attacks on the outskirts of Damascus. CNN correspondents and experts explain the different positions of some key nations involved in preparing for -- or warning against -- international military attacks on Syria. United States . As the guarantor of international order the United States has to do something after the large scale use of chemical weapons, and the United States believes the Assad regime was responsible for the attacks. But it faces something of a quandary. Launching the kind of large-scale campaign necessary to topple Assad would be lengthy and whoever replaces Assad could be even worse for U.S. interests than Assad himself, given the fact that the most successful opposition groups on the ground are aligned with al Qaeda. So, the military intervention has to be large enough to punish Assad but not so large as to actually overthrow him. For U.S. policymakers this is the least bad decision they likely feel they can make. For the U.S., Syria is a problem from hell . China . It is a long-time ally of Syria and wants to keep its influence. China says it is firmly opposed to the use of chemical weapons and supports the U.N. chemical weapons inspectors. It wants the inspectors to be able to do their job and has warned against prejudging the results. Why Russia, Iran, China stay loyal to Assad . It also says it wants peace and suggests continuing with the second Geneva Conference on Syria, an initiative that is currently in doubt. ""A political solution is always the only realistic means to resolve the Syria issue,"" Foreign Minister Wang Yi said. Russia . It doesn't want a repeat of Libya or Iraq. Much has been said about Russia trying to protect the Syrian government because of its military and economic interests in the country but Russia's key policy goal is blocking American efforts to shape the region. Russia doesn't believe revolutions, wars and regime change bring stability and democracy. It often points to the Arab Spring and the U.S.-led war in Iraq as evidence. Sources: Intercepts implicate Syrians . Russia also doesn't trust U.S. intentions in the region. It believes humanitarian concerns are often used an excuse for pursuing America's own political and economic interests. Russia has maintained influence throughout the conflict by using its veto in the U.N. Security Council to shield Syria from international pressure. But it's unclear if the U.S. and its allies will rely on a U.N. mandate to launch any military strike. Iran . For Iran, Syria is a strategically key ally . Iran's position, as outlined by Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and new President Hassan Rouhani, is that the Syrian government is a victim of international plots. Iran believes the West and almost all Arab countries are in cahoots in an effort to implement regime change in Syria. Iran says the main objective of this plot is to make the region safer for Israel. Syria was also Iran's only Arab ally during its eight-year war with Iraq, and Syria together with the Hezbollah-controlled areas of Lebanon are considered to be Tehran's first line of defense in case of an attack on Iran by Israel or the West. So, Iran's interest in Syria is motivated by its longtime friendship, as well as Syria's strategic importance for Tehran. Iran says a U.S. military strike would spark disaster . United Kingdom . Wants a proportionate response to the alleged chemical attack. Prime Minister David Cameron pushed for a vote in parliament on taking part in military action in response to the Syrian attacks -- and lost. He now says it is important United Kingdom has a ""robust response to the use of chemical weapons, and there are a series of things that (Britain) will continue to do."" Opposition leader Ed Miliband told the Press Association: ""The House of Commons spoke for the British people who said they didn't want a rush to war, and I was determined we learned the lessons of Iraq, and I'm glad we've made the prime minister see sense,"" Labour Party leader Ed Miliband. Cameron had argued that the military response needs to be proportionate, legal and aimed at deterring the use of chemical weapons. Britain also tried to secure a U.N. resolution on the matter. Read UK intelligence on chemical weapons . Jordan . It wants to stay out of trouble. Jordan wants a diplomatic solution but it was also host to a military meeting involving the United States, European nations, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar. Despite that meeting, Jordan does not want to be seen as hosting the meeting where it is decided there will be intervention in Syria. Jordan feels that would put them in a dangerous situation with possible missile strikes from Syria and terror strikes precipitated by the Syrian regime. It is an open secret that Saudi Arabia is using Jordan to smuggle weapons into Syria for the rebels. Jordan says it is doing all it can to prevent that and does not want to inflame the situation in Syria. Jordan is feeling vulnerable, buffeted by the Arab Spring and internal tensions such as allegations of official corruption and a less popular king, and it wants to stay out of trouble. France . It favors a punishment strike. France has taken a very forward leaning position on punishing Syria for its apparent use of chemical weapons against its own citizens -- maybe that's because of its colonial era ties to the Middle East or because it sees its itself as a global force for good. But it's still surprising as it comes under the leadership of Francois Hollande, who arrived in office declaring he was pulling French troops out of Afghanistan immediately and was not going to be prone to military adventuring the way his predecessors were. Now Hollande is apparently reversing the position he's held for months -- that any intervention in Syria would require UN approval -- to indicate he is standing side-by-side with the U.S. to join a new ""coalition of the willing"" which might go into action without UN approval. ""France is ready to punish those who gassed civilians,"" Hollande told his ambassadors gathered this week. And a senior diplomat told journalists that if there is a strike against Syria it would be as a sanction for the regime's defiance of the international agreement to never use chemical weapons and not an attempt to change the course of the Syrian civil war. Israel . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says it is ready for any scenario and is warning Syria he will respond with force if Israel is attacked. Saudi Arabia .

"(CNN) -- A gang rape allegedly involving the teenage son of a famous Chinese ""singing general"" has caused outrage in China, unleashing a tide of public anger over the behavior of so-called ""princelings,"" the children of elite families. Li Tianyi, 17, stood before Haidian People's Court in a closed hearing in Beijing Wednesday and Thursday, one of five defendants accused of raping a woman in a hotel room in February after drinking with her in a bar. Li, who also goes by the name Li Guanfeng, told the court he was drunk and could remember little of the night in question, but denied beating or having sex with the woman, the state-run Beijing News reported. While Li's four co-accused issued guilty pleas by the trial's end, Li continued to deny the allegations, state media reported. Li is the baby-faced son of 74-year-old Li Shuangjiang, a celebrity singer for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and dean of music at the PLA Academy of Arts, who became a household name for his renditions of patriotic anthems on television. The teen's mother, Meng Ge, is also a well-known PLA singer, and attended court to support her son. Li has previously made headlines for running afoul of the law. In 2011, aged 15, he was arrested after attacking a family in a road rage accident. Li, who was driving a BMW with no license plates, angrily confronted the occupants of a vehicle blocking his way, threatening bystanders and daring them to call police. Explore: China's new leaders . He had previously racked up 36 traffic violations while driving without a license, according to media reports, triggering an outcry when the incident was reported. He was subsequently sent to a juvenile detention center for a year, and his father issued a public apology. Tian Canjun, lawyer for the alleged victim in the rape case, said his client had been hospitalized due to stress and would not be attending the trial, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Lawyers for the accused have argued in pre-trial hearings that the woman was a prostitute, and the matter should be tried as a prostitution matter, rather than a rape case. The trial has caused a sensation in China, focusing public attention once again on the excessive lifestyles of China's rich and powerful and their families, who are widely seen as entitled and corrupt. It comes hot on the heels of the sensational trial of former Communist Party kingpin Bo Xilai, which offered a lurid snapshot of alleged corruption among China's political aristocracy. Chinese social media users have been scathing of Li, who has become one of the most infamous examples of a ""taizidang,"" or ""princeling."" ""This just demonstrates that the elite class is above the law in China,"" wrote a user called @woshixiaojuanmao_loving on the popular Chinese micro-blogging service Sina Weibo. Read more: Privileged kids anger Chinese public . ""Meng Ge has totally failed in educating and nurturing her son,"" wrote another, using the handle @ingyunyixiuge777. ""This case gives us a glimpse of the corruption in China, and the government should punish the criminal severely to sound a warning to others."" In July, hackers attacked the website of one of Li's lawyers, leaving a message stating: ""We just want to return justice to the client."" Public opinion has been mounting against the princelings since an incident in 2010, when the drunk-driving 22-year-old son of a deputy provincial police chief fatally ran over a student and shouted: ""Sue me if you dare! My father is Li Gang!"" The phrase has since become synonymous with nepotism and corruption in China. Recognizing the threat posed by the popular discontent over the issue, President Xi Jinping has made a priority of stamping out abuses by officials, with a high-profile anti-corruption campaign that has toppled senior figures including the former railways minister and a top economic planning official. He has recently focused his attention on the PLA's musicians, many of whom have celebrity status. On Monday, he publicly rebuked PLA musicians following a series of embarrassing reports detailing their privileged lifestyles and exposing incidents of commercial exploitation of their positions. The dressing down was accompanied by new measures, signed off by Xi and detailed in the PLA Daily, the official organ of China's armed forces, designed to curb the excesses of military musical troupes. Xi's wife, the noted soprano Peng Liyuan, herself served in a PLA performance troupe. Prosecutors said the gang rape accused who are juveniles -- four of the five on trial are aged under 18 -- should receive lesser punishments due to their youth, and that the defendant who helped authorities build their case against his co-accused should have his sentence further diminished, Xinhua reported. It said the court would issue its verdict on the case in due course.

"(CNN) -- Call it a ""Grande"" surprise. Snakes in unexpected places can startle anyone. For Bruce Ahlswede the unexpected place was a San Antonio Starbucks bathroom, where he had stopped on Tuesday after a business presentation. He froze for a moment thinking the snake, lying across the toilet, was a toy left by a prankster. Then it started to move. He backed out of the room and found a store employee. ""I said 'Hey you've got a snake in your bathroom and she's kind of freaking out,' "" Ahlswede told CNN affiliate KSAT. Bruce, his wife and store employees all crowded into the bathroom and watched as the snake, perhaps just as surprised as the rest, slithered around the toilet bowl and disappeared, the station reported. Ahlswede's wife, Michele, managed to snap a photo. She promptly posted it to Facebook. ""It had to have crawled up the pipes,"" Michele wrote on her page. ""I have heard of it happening but have never seen it in person. Its a python guess he like coffee also."" KSAT consulted a snake expert who told them it was likely a non-poisonous rat snake. A website for the University of Austin Amphibian and Reptile Diversity Research Center describes rat snakes as similar-looking to pythons that have reached 7 feet in length. The site says the snakes pose no threat to humans. ""A lot of people were really freaked out and some said 'thanks a lot,"" Michelle Ahlswede told KSAT. KSAT reports the South Texas Herpetology Association responded to the store at Starbuck's request. Starbucks issued a statement to KSAT confirming the store is safe, even though store employees tell the Ahlswede's the snake wasn't caught. The couple says despite the encounter they plan on remaining Starbuck's customers. Michele Ahlswede also says she'll be double-checking every toilet from now on.","Bruce Ahlswede surprised to find snake in Starbucks bathroom .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- A court sentenced a Chinese crime boss known as the ""godmother of the underworld"" to 18 years in prison Tuesday, state-run media reported. Xie Caiping ""was convicted of organizing and leading a criminal organization, running gambling dens, illegal imprisonment, harboring people taking illegal narcotics and giving bribes to officials,"" the Xinhua news agency reported. She was also fined 1.02 million yuan (about $150,000). Twenty-one others were given jail terms ranging from one to 13 years by Chongqing No. 5 Intermediate People's Court. A massive crackdown, which began in China's Chongqing municipality in June, has implicated millionaires, gangsters, and even police officers. Known as dahei or combat triads, the campaign has put the spotlight on organized crime and how it has infested local bureaucracy and businesses through bribery, extortion, blackmail and violence. Police operations have led to the arrest of more than 4,800 suspected gangsters and the confiscation of 1,700 illegal firearms. Investigations led to many city officials, including police officers. More trials are expected as the city fights at least 14 mafia-style gangs. Given China's opaque political world, it is notable that the trials are being extensively covered by the Chinese media. For years after the Cultural Revolution, Chongqing languished as a decrepit mountain-city in Sichuan province, better known for its spicy food. It became the world's largest city in 1997 when the central government, by administrative edict, incorporated a huge area adjacent to the city into what is now Chongqing. China's goal was to build Chongqing into a modern megacity that would serve as the new economic engine in central China. Over the years, thanks to the influx of corporate investments and central government funding in infrastructure projects, the city of 31 million has been at the center of an economic boom. But the economic boom has also led to the resurgence of local gangs engaged in human and drug trafficking, illegal gambling, prostitution, extortion and protection rackets. Gangsters were blamed for heinous crimes of murder and kidnapping. Local officials were accused of ""economic crimes""-- bribery, profiteering and corrupt behavior in public office, involving public funds and property. Such abuses have prompted popular anger and social unrest.","Xie Caiping sentenced to 18 years in prison for organized crime .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN)  -- Several people were killed and more than 300 were arrested in anti-government protests in Tehran Sunday, Iran's Deputy Police Chief Ahmad Reza Radan said on state television station IRINN. The toll was the result of clashes that broke out between demonstrators and security forces as large crowds gathered for Ashura, a major religious observance. Five people were reported killed in the fighting, Iranian state-run Press TV said late Sunday. A French government statement put the number of fatalities at eight. With tight restrictions on international media, CNN could not independently verify the casualties. Without giving an exact number of casualties, Radan said those killed included one person who fell off a bridge and two others who were killed in a car accident during the protests. One of the victims was killed by a bullet, Radan said. But ""considering the fact that the police did not use firearms, this incident is extremely suspicious, and is being investigated,"" he said. The Web site of opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi reported that Mousavi's nephew, Seyed Ali Mousavi, was killed in the demonstrations around noon local time Sunday by a gunshot to the heart. Press TV, meanwhile, late Sunday quoted unnamed police officials as identifying one of the dead as ""Seyyed Ali Mousavi."" Press TV's report did not mention any relationship between that victim and opposition leader Mousavi, nor did its report include any mention of the elder Mousavi. Tehran Police Chief Azizollah Rajabzadeh denied any protesters were killed by security forces. Are you in Iran? Share your photos and video and tell us what's going on. Police did not fire any shots in Tehran, ""and security forces were not in possession of firearms,"" Rajabzadeh told the semi-official news agency ISNA. Since the disputed presidential elections in June, protesters have turned public gatherings into rallies against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was declared the overwhelming winner of the race. Police, wary of the potential that Ashura gatherings could present, were out in full force Sunday to quell disruptions but did not stop demonstrators holding widespread protests. Near Imam Hussein Square in central Tehran, security forces used tear gas to disperse demonstrators and blocked roads to prevent more from arriving, a witness said. Protesters seized a motorcycle belonging to a security force member and set it on fire. Elsewhere in the city, witnesses reported seeing protesters being beaten with batons. Demonstrators chanted ""death to the dictator"" and some ripped down a picture of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. Police helicopters hovered above city squares while small trucks brought in more riot police in parts where clashes were fierce. Protesters played cat-and-mouse with security forces -- gathering, then scrambling and gathering elsewhere. U.S. National Security Council Spokesman Mike Hammer said the United States condemns the ""violent and unjust suppression of civilians in Iran seeking to exercise their universal rights."" ""Governing through fear and violence is never just, and as President Obama said in Oslo -- it is telling when governments fear the aspirations of their own people more than the power of any other nation,"" Hammer said in a statement. The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement Sunday expressing ""great anxiety"" following the violent clashes. The statement said at least eight people were killed and several were wounded in the clashes. France condemns the arbitrary arrests and the ""acts of violence committed against demonstrators who came to defend their right to freedom of speech and their aspiration to democracy. Facing the persistence of popular movements and the worsening of the repression, France is calling for a political solution in Iran,"" the ministry's statement said. The unrest Sunday followed daylong clashes between the two sides in the streets of Tehran on Saturday. On Saturday evening, a pro-government mob barged into a mosque where former president and reformist leader Mohammad Khatami was speaking. The dozens-strong group forced Khatami to end his remarks abruptly when it interrupted the gathering at Jamaran mosque. Earlier Saturday, scores of security forces on motorcycles charged protesters on sidewalks whenever they started chanting anti-government slogans, witnesses said. Sunday marks Ashura, the observance of the death of Imam Hussein, grandson of Prophet Muhammad. Hussein, who was killed in battle in Karbala in 680 A.D., is regarded as a martyr. The battle that led to his death is one of the events that helped create the schism between Sunnis and Shiites, the two main Muslim religious movements. Iran is predominantly Shiite. During Sunday's protests, some demonstrators compared Khamenei to Yazid, the caliph who killed Hussein. Religious mourning during Ashura is characterized by people chanting, beating their breasts in penance, cutting themselves with daggers or swords and whipping themselves in synchronized moves. Sunday also is a week to the day since the death of Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, a key figure in the 1979 Iranian revolution. Montazeri, who went on to become one of the government's most vocal critics, died December 20. The seventh day after a death is a traditional time for mourning in Islam.

"(CNN) -- Forget policies. One thing guaranteed to get the electorate talking ahead of any vote is a steady stream of cringe-inducing moments, and on that front Australia's federal election campaign hasn't disappointed. Tony Abbott, the man who looks set to become the country's next prime minister, won international headlines for all the wrong reasons with his misguided reference to suppositories. But he's not the only one leaving voters squirming in their seats. Here are our top 10 moments of the Australian campaign trail, in no particular order. 1. Abbott: Vote for me because my daughters are hot . Okay, he didn't actually say that but that's what Coalition leader Abbott implied when he and current Prime Minister Kevin Rudd appeared on Australia's version of reality hit ""Big Brother."" (Yes, Big Brother still airs there and presumably has enough of an audience to convince both politicians that it was worth a shot at the youth vote.) While Rudd reduced more than one housemate to tears with talk of love and gay marriage, Abbott shot from the hip with a comment (presumably aimed at the nation's blokes given his views on gay marriage): ""If you want to know who to vote for, I'm the guy with the not bad looking daughters."" As commentator Nick Galvin noted: ""Adrift uneasily in the no man's land between daggy and plain weird, Abbott looked strangely like Robert Palmer from the era when the late British singer surrounded himself with Amazonian beauties, because . . . well . . . he could."" (For the uninitiated, ""daggy"" means uncool, unfashionable, etc.) READ MORE: Could political brawler be next PM? 2. Getting hot and sweaty . They may not have been ""Amazonian beauties,"" but when Abbott found himself surrounded by a high school netball team it seemed he couldn't help himself. ""A little body contact"" never hurt anyone, he told them after the girls apologized for being sweaty and crushing his suit during a photo call, according to national broadcaster the ABC. It followed some effusive but what many considered inappropriate praise for a Liberal candidate's ""sex appeal."" The cack-handed ""compliment"" was aimed at Fiona Scott, who days later offered a comment of her own crowned by the country's immigration minister as ""the silliest of the campaign."" Read on. 3. Asylum seekers? Clogging up traffic . Anyone with half an eye on the Australian election will have noticed a lot of debate and angst about what to do about asylum seekers who arrive in the country's waters by boat. When prompted to talk about the ""hot topic"" of asylum seekers, Scott said, ""Yes it's a hot topic here because our traffic is overcrowded. How much fun is the M4 in peak hour? It's not fun, at all."" The M4 connects the inner-west with the outer suburbs of Sydney. Scott's comment prompted a stream of tweets, including one which asked whether jams were caused by ""all those refugees towing their boats down the motorway."" After the furor, Scott claimed her quotes had been taken out of context. 4. Things that make you go 'ummmm' While we're on asylum seekers and Liberal candidates, Jaymes Diaz deserves a mention. When asked about the party's six-point plan to ""stop the boats,"" the election candidate failed to name the other five. In the days following, it seemed to become a sport for Australian journalists to track Diaz down and pitch the question to him again to see whether he'd managed to commit them to memory. However, he was nowhere to be found. In a six-minute video attached to an article headlined ""Where are Abbott's wallies?"" reporter Lucy Carroll tried to find him. After two days of phone calls and attempted doorstops she only managed to locate his mother. 5. Islam. A new one for the map . Diaz may be hard to find, but at least he's hanging in there for the vote, unlike Stephanie Banister who withdrew her candidacy after making a series of jaw-dropping comments, all within one interview. ""I don't oppose Islam as a country, but I do feel that their laws should not be welcome here in Australia,"" Banister told Seven News. She went on to confuse ""haram"" with the Quran and said Jews followed Jesus Christ. A candidate for the fringe One Nation Party, 27-year-old Banister quit just 48 hours into her campaign. In a statement to the ABC, party leader Jim Savage said she'd withdrawn ""following the disgraceful way she has been portrayed by recent media [and] ridicule over a minor gaffe."" 6. See ya. Candidates shown the door. While Banister quit of her own accord, the ruling Labor party made sure candidate Geoff Lake made it nowhere near the polling booths. He was dumped after admitting to verbally abusing a disabled female councilor in 2002. ""I was a young mayor and I got angry one night and I spoke to her in angry way, which I acknowledged then and I acknowledge now,"" Lake told local media. Another nudged out of the race was North Queensland candidate Ken Robertson who called Abbott ""racist"" and ""a very, very bigoted person."" It came days after Rudd called for a ""positive campaign."" 7. 'Be careful of Rupert' Allegations of racism weren't the only ones flying around. Mining magnate Clive Palmer, perhaps better known outside Australia for his ambitious plans to build a replica Titanic, shocked morning viewers by making some stunning accusations on live TV . ""Rupert Murdoch's wife Wendi Deng is a Chinese spy,"" Palmer said. ""She's been spying on Rupert for years, giving money back to Chinese intelligence."" ""Clive, have you lost the plot?"" asked the visibly shocked presenter. Palmer is standing for a Senate seat as leader of his own party, the Palmer United Party. Polls show the party could possibly win one seat. 8. 'You're the voice' It must be hard to entertain oneself while hiding from authorities in a foreign embassy for months on end. That's the only reason we can think why WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange thought it was a good idea to don a fake mullet and sing his own version of John Farnham's classic Aussie hit ""You're the voice."" (For those unfamiliar with the terminology, ""mullet"" refers to a type of hairstyle, not the fish). Assange is attempting to win an Australian Senate seat for his WikiLeaks Party, despite the surprise resignation of his running mate Leslie Cannold -- who quit due to a lack of transparency and accountability, of all things. It's not clear whether Assange will be able to take up his seat if he wins. It is clear that singing will NOT be a viable career option. 9. Slipper recycles . Another candidate relying on blasts from the past is former federal speaker Peter Slipper, who has defended his use of old campaign signs in his bid for re-election. It's clear from the posters that they don't feature a recent image. They're black and white. Oh, and Slipper is now running as an independent candidate, so he's had to cut off any Liberal Party logos. Not obvious at all. The former speaker could be forgiven for wanting to avoid any more cameras. He was hauled over the coals and through the courts after being accused of sexually harassing a male colleague. A federal court judge eventually threw out the case last December, saying that he'd come to the conclusion the claims were made to cause Slipper ""significant, public, reputational and political damage."" 10. Will it end after the election? Probably not... It seems appropriate to end this list with Abbott, as the likely next prime minister and the country's most prolific provider of head-slapping gaffes. Abbott hasn't won yet, but if he does then writer Alan Stokes has imagined the contents of his election speech. It starts with ""My drear men and women of Australia. I stand here tonight, on this maleficent evening, as your prime minister, to spank you very much and say how bumbled I have been to receive your thrust."" To read the whole ""screech,"" click here.","Five-week election campaign filled with colorful quotes, unfortunate gaffes .

"(CNN) -- Members of Congress working to pass immigration reform are divided on many issues, but there's one they agree on. Democrat and Republican, virtually all have been adamant since the debate began that President Obama should stay out of it-- that pressure from the White House would only spur resistance on Capitol Hill. Still, there's an exception to every rule. The president has the power to transform the immigration debate by one simple action: nominating a tough, law-enforcement Republican to replace Janet Napolitano as secretary of Homeland Security. The prospects of passing reform hang uneasily in the balance this month as members of Congress spend time at home in their districts. Back in Washington, an all but unbreakable House rule mandates that passage of any law as momentous as immigration reform requires a ""majority of the majority"" -- in today's House, 118 GOP votes. And many Republicansâ€”a majority, I believe--are still up for grabs. In the past, many House Republicans have opposed immigration reform, but attitudes have changed dramatically in recent months, thanks largely to a new understanding of the Latino vote's power. A dwindling minority still oppose reform at all cost. A growing but still small minority is generally favorable to an overhaul. And the rest -- the majority in the middle -- are wrestling to come to terms with an issue they're suddenly seeing in a new light. They are reexamining the facts, questioning old assumptions, trying on new policy ideas and asking themselves how far they can stretch. The ferment is palpable --as are the possibilities. Opinion: Key to immigration reform -- worker visas . The biggest obstacle: House Republicans don't trust that Obama will enforce the law. This mistrust has deep roots, and Obama has only inflamed it in recent years. The last time Congress passed an immigration overhaul, in 1986, it was cast as a grand bargain: amnesty for the millions of immigrants then living in the country illegally in exchange for tough enforcement on the border and in the workplace. By the early 1990s, 3 million formerly unauthorized immigrants had earned legal status and were on their way to citizenship. But the border was more porous than ever, and workplace enforcement had all but ground to a halt, as a new cottage industry in forged identity documents erased all hope of meaningful control and a frustrated immigration service threw up its hands. Enter President Obama, who from day one has shown what House Republicans consider a decidedly selective approach to the law. Whatever you think of Obamacare or the Defense of Marriage Act, they are the law of the land -- but the president has enforced them only when he felt like it, if he felt like it at all--putting a hold, for example, on the Obamacare employer mandate. On other issues, he has thumbed his nose at the Constitution's federal balance of power, bypassing Congress to appoint members of the National Labor Relations Board and grant legal status to young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. As for immigration enforcement, there has been some progress in the Obama years on the border and in the workplace, but two huge congressional directives remain just that, unfulfilled directives. One is completing the 700 miles of fence mandated in 2006, the other building an electronic ""exit"" system to track that foreigners visiting the United States on visas leave the country when they say they will -- a mandate that dates to 1996. There's nothing Obama can do to restore Republicans' faith in him -- that horse left the barn years ago. And not any Republican appointment to the top immigration enforcement job will reassure the GOP. A Republican seen as a dove on immigration will change nothing -- might as well go with a Democrat. So, too, a Republican popular in the mainstream media or among sophisticated elites, and that rules out even accomplished law enforcement officials like, say, Bill Bratton, former police commissioner in New York and Los Angeles, or Raymond Kelly, now the top cop in New York City. Opinion: Crunch time for immigration, budget fights . What's needed is someone so reliably tough and so committed to enforcing the law that even diehard immigration hawks do a double-take when the name surfaces. Part of the point, after all, is neutralizing criticism from immigration restrictionists. And of course, such a choice will make many Democrats gasp. That, too, is part of the point. Without it, skeptical Republicans will not be convinced. The other indispensable requirement is that a nominee should be someone with enough national stature -- a household name, if possible -- to push back against the president if need be. House Republicans need to know that this person will hold the line, no matter what the president tries, will take his or her case to the media if necessary, and will have enough popular support to make a national appeal effective. Who fits this bill? It's not a long list. Would Rudy Giuliani take the job? Condoleezza Rice? A respected general? Someone who proved his law and order bona fides in the last Bush administration -- former Attorney General John Ashcroft, for example? Or former Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, a committed immigration enforcement hawk and among the Republican lawmakers, sitting or retired, most knowledgeable about the issue? Coming up with the right name won't be easy, but ultimately this is a question about Barack Obama. Is he strong enough -- and self-confident enough -- to take this step? Can he brook the dissent and give up control? If he means what he says when he talks about enforcing the law, he should put his money where his mouth is. Nothing would do more to improve the chances of passing immigration reform on his watch. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tamar Jacoby .","Tamar Jacoby: Obama can help immigration debate by picking tough DHS secretary .
She says he should pick a well-regarded Republican to win trust of GOP on reform .
She says Congress, returning from break, will respond to gesture when debate resumes .
Jacoby: Giuliani, Rice, Ashcroft? One could spur reform. Can Obama give up control and do it?"
"(CNN) -- In public at least, the message was defiant. Beleaguered Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, sitting alongside Iran's intelligence chief, proclaimed Tuesday ""the determination of the people and government of Syria to cleanse the country of terrorists."" His Iranian visitor, Saeed Jalili, responded, ""What is happening in Syria is not an internal issue but a conflict between the axis of resistance on one hand and regional and global enemies of this axis on the other."" Jalili's comment was made public by the Syrian news agency that al-Assad's government runs. It's a familiar theme for the Iranians, who have cast events in Syria as part of a much broader ideological battle. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has similarly characterized events in Syria as a ""war between the front of hegemony and the front of resistance."" Ayham Kamel of Eurasia Group believes the Iranians must be alarmed that the tide is running fast against al-Assad. ""Iran probably has excellent information regarding Assad's position. That information would make clear that Iran is increasingly likely to lose its only ally in the region, greatly reducing its strategic reach,"" he says. The last thing Iran wants is a Sunni-dominated Syria that abandons the ""axis"" -- especially as the rebels' main supporters are Iran's Persian Gulf rivals: Qatar and Saudi Arabia. ""How can those who have never held an election in their country be advocates of democracy?"" Jalili asked in Damascus, with a less than oblique dig at the Gulf monarchies. Assad also blasted as ""unacceptable"" that certain foreign countries were ""supporting terrorism in Syria"" through arming the rebels. Iran is al-Assad's last regional ally, and Western intelligence officials believe the Islamic Republic has provided technical help such as intelligence, communications and advice on crowd control and weapons as protest in Syria has morphed into resistance. A United Nations panel reported in May that Iranian weapons destined for Syria but seized in Turkey included assault rifles, explosives, detonators, machine guns and mortar shells. Iran's Foreign Minister acknowledged Wednesday that some of the 48 Iranians kidnapped last weekend by the Free Syrian Army near Damascus were former military personnel. ""Some retired individuals from the (Revolutionary) Guards and army were dispatched to Syria to make a pilgrimage,"" Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi told the official Iranian news agency, a statement that will likely be seized upon by the rebels as confirmation that Iran is directly aiding the al-Assad regime. Al-Assad's inner circle: Mostly family, like 'mafia' Syria and Iran vs. Israel . Syria also matters to Iran because it is the main conduit to the Shi'ite militia Hezbollah in Lebanon, the proxy through which Iran can threaten Israel with an arsenal of short-range missiles. In 2009, the top U.S. diplomat in Damascus disclosed that Syria had begun delivery of ballistic missiles to Hezbollah, according to official cables leaked to and published by WikiLeaks. ""Syria's actions have created a situation in which miscalculation or provocative behavior by Hezbollah could prove disastrous for Syria and the broader region,"" the diplomat wrote. The regional picture that was so favorable to Iran a few years ago -- as events in Iraq moved in its favor and those in neighboring Afghanistan moved against the Western alliance -- is now much more challenging. International sanctions imposed chiefly by the United States and Europe are biting, renewed political violence is destabilizing Iraq, and Iran's relationship with Turkey has eroded badly. Not so long ago, Iran and Turkey were on good terms. The government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan tried to be the honest broker in Iran's confrontation with the West over its nuclear program; both governments worried about Kurdish separatism; and Turkey's guiding principle was 'zero problems with neighbors.' Erdogan said this week at a meeting of his Justice and Development Party: ""When no one else was by its side, Turkey stood by Iran, despite everything. Turkey defended its right to nuclear energy."" Not any more. Erdogan has been infuriated by Iran's attempts to paint Turkey as conspiring with the West on Syria. This week, Iran's chief of staff Hassan Firouzabadi accused Turkey of helping the ""belligerent objectives"" of Western powers, prompting the Turkish Foreign Ministry to condemn ""groundless accusations and extremely inappropriate threats"" of Iranian officials. Erdogan joined in. ""On Syria, once again I ask the Iranians: Does defending a regime that kills its brothers, and I think it has reached 25,000 by now, suit our values?"" Two days in Aleppo: Guns, graveyards and stairwell beds . Playing on differences . Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi traveled to Turkey Tuesday in an effort to mend that fence. He left with what the Turkish Foreign Minister called a ""frank and friendly"" message about intemperate language. Iran and Turkey are shaping up for the next phase of the struggle for Syria, according to Michael Young, Opinion Editor at the Daily Star in Beirut. And it is likely to be a Syria where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures. ""If the Alawis are afraid and fall back on their heartland, there too you're going to have a situation where a new central government in Damascus will have to wrestle with a state that is not strongly unified,"" Young told the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations. ""In that context, it will create openings for the Iranians to play on differences."" Turkey will be working for the opposite outcome, wary that Syria's Kurds might seek common cause with its own restive Kurdish minority and concerned that prolonged instability will spill into Lebanon and across Syria's long and porous border with Turkey. If its rhetoric is accepted at face value, Iran may be ready to step up support for al-Assad. But does it have the resources? As Ayham Kamel at Eurasia Group notes: ""Sanctions are biting, oil revenues have been compressed, inflation is rampant, and reserves are limited."" But backing al-Assad, at least in the short term, may be an overriding imperative. The United States says Iran is intensifying its support for the Assad regime. And most analysts expect at least more Iranian cash and more expertise to be made available. ""The diversion of perhaps tens of millions of dollars or euros in cash would certainly assist Assad's government as its foreign exchange reserves dwindle,"" says Kamel. The provision of additional arms and intelligence is also likely in the near term, he says. Less predictable, analysts say, is whether Hezbollah will of its own accord or at Iran's behest put its considerable military expertise at Assad's service. Iranian intelligence chief Jalili met Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah before going to Damascus. Nasrallah has nailed his colors to the mast. He said last month that the four senior Syrian officials killed in a bomb blast in Damascus were ""martyrs"" and boasted that the rockets Hezbollah had fired at Israel in 2006 were made in Syria. Hezbollah's nightmare is a hostile Israel on one side and a hostile Sunni Syria on the other, even if its internal position in Lebanon is secure. But both it and Iran are now trying to peer into a future as gloomy as it is opaque. CNN exclusive: Inside Syria .","Iranians have cast Syria conflict as broad ideological battle .

"(CNN) -- In Spain, out of economic pain and adversity, opportunity is emerging. The country is in a deep recession and unemployment sits at a painful 26%. But there are signs of a comeback -- in the auto industry, at least. Ford, Renault and Volkswagen have all decided to expand production in Spain because of cheaper labor costs. Japanese automaker Nissan is also expanding, but it's also doing something else quite radical: it's hiring. Read more: Cornish pasties filling hunger for jobs . This month, Nissan Barcelona received $178 million dollars in investment to produce 80,000 cars. The deal will help create 1,000 direct and 3,000 indirect jobs. This agreement would not have been possible had it not been for Nissan's negotiation of new working practices with Spanish trade unions. Read more: Diageo: Europe must be more competitive . Nissan struck an agreement with the unions, limiting wage increases and giving the company more flexibility with its temporary workforce. The difference, believe it or not, is quite substantial. According to the OECD, Spain's labor costs have dropped almost 5% percent from 2009 to 2012. In that same period, France -- where labor costs are a contentious issue -- has seen its costs increase by 4.3%. Germany's, comparatively, have increased 1.9%. Even Italy, where costs have risen 2.7%, and the UK, up 2.2%, haven't adapted to the tough economic times. Read more: Could emerging markets be Lindt's new sweet spot? Frank Torres, director general of Nissan Motor Iberica, told CNN lowering labor costs were an achievement for Nissan Barcelona and for Spain itself -- making it an increasingly competitive location for manufacturing and exporting cars. But labor market reforms are not enough to make Nissan Barcelona competitive on the global stage. Torres said the company needed to make logistical savings to stand out from other automakers and Nissan manufacturing hubs, it needed to make savings on the ground. That's exactly what it did. It now has twenty key suppliers under their roof and a port less than five minutes away from their doorstep. It's this logistical innovation that has enabled Nissan Barcelona to cut costs by as much as 30%; and for an industry that accounts for 10% of Spain's industry, this is a crucial part of Spain's long haul to recovery.","Ford, Renault and Volkswagen expanding production in Spain because of cheaper labor costs .

"New York (CNN) -- Ex-NFL star Aaron Hernandez is asking a Miami federal judge for a delay in defending himself against a lawsuit accusing him of shooting a man in the face in Florida. Hernandez, currently facing murder charges in the slaying of a man in Massachusetts, asked the court on Tuesday to grant him a temporary stay in the lawsuit. Alexander Bradley of Connecticut is suing Hernandez, claiming the then-New England Patriot tight end shot Bradley in February after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club. In a lawsuit filed in June, Bradley said Hernandez fired at him during a limo ride after leaving the club and that Hernandez intentionally ""possessed a gun which he was not legally licensed to have."" Bradley said he lost sight in one eye and continues to receive treatment. DA: High-profile case bring extra pressure, 'we welcome it' In a motion filed by his lawyers, Hernandez argues that he's unable to defend himself while battling murder and weapons charges stemming from the execution-style killing in June of Odin Lloyd. Bradley appeared in July before a grand jury investigating Lloyd's death. Prosecutors won't comment on why Bradley was called to testify citing the secrecy of the proceedings. However, one of Bradley's lawyers has asserted the grand jury likely wanted to relate Hernandez's alleged conduct in Florida to Lloyd's slaying in Massachusetts. Hernandez's lawyers state ""it is beyond any reasonable contention that the issues in Bristol County (Massachusetts)... overlap those of this case."" Investigation turns to Hernandez's fiancee's actions . In court papers, Hernandez maintains it would be difficult to adequately defend himself while simultaneously battling a murder charge from a jail cell where he's being held without bail. His lawyers also argue that if he had to answer questions in the civil lawsuit during an ongoing criminal case, he would be forced to invoke the Fifth Amendment to protect himself from self-incrimination. In some jurisdictions, they add, invoking the Fifth Amendment would amount to an admission of guilt. Bradley's attorneys have until September 20 to file a response. Messages to Hernandez's lawyers were not answered. Hernandez is next expected to appear in court Friday in Fall River, Massachusetts, for arraignment on a grand jury indictment in Lloyd's slaying and weapons charges. He's expected to plead not guilty. Union presses Patriots to give Hernandez $82K in bonuses .","Ex-NFL player Hernandez accused of shooting man in face in Florida .

"Aleppo, Syria (CNN) -- In a small village outside of Aleppo where we are hunkered down for the night, our host apologizes profusely. He doesn't have enough blankets for us and it's bitterly cold. He and his family were forced to flee their home in the city to their unfurnished, humble residence in the countryside with nothing but the clothes they could carry. He spent 25,000 Syrian pounds -- around $300 -- to pay a truck driver just to bring out the bedroom furniture and a TV from their Aleppo home. He couldn't afford another run. Syrian family hides from attacks in underground 'prison' We went to stay with his brother, who was also full of apologies because he couldn't offer us tea. The power was out and there was no cooking gas. In the dark, we chatted about the situation in Aleppo, Syria's largest city. There, airstrikes have transformed buildings into heaps of rubble, and most of the city is now under rebel control. Many Aleppo residents fled when the fighting began, finding themselves crowded into relatives' homes or in refugee camps as winter set in. The bitter cold and financial hardships brought them back. Others, like this family, returned only to retrieve some belongings and then quickly left again. In Aleppo, the battle lines are fluid and, in some neighborhoods, snipers are a constant danger. Where the fighting has subsided, there are other threats. ""The incredible cost of living is causing a lot of problems,"" our host's brother told us. ""Criminality has gone up significantly. Each day we are catching thieves, even young boys. People are hungry and cold."" Syrian refugees face brutal cold in Lebanon . The cost of a canister of cooking gas in this village jumped from 450 pounds to 3,500 -- from about $5 to $45 -- and that's when it's available. ""If the situation doesn't improve soon, people are going to start tearing each other apart,"" he laments. Skyrocketing food prices and shortages mean some Syrian children are eating only one small meal a day, if that. Residents in one Aleppo neighborhood have taken matters into their own hands, collecting money to buy food for the neediest -- but it's never enough. Children elbow and shove each other, the smaller ones trying to wiggle through for a ladleful of cracked wheat cooked in a huge vat in the middle of the street by the neighborhood volunteers. Amid the chaos, little hands try desperately to grab small bags of hummus passing overhead. A block away, residents clamor for bread. Fatme waited in line for three hours. She had fled Aleppo with her family, and returned a month ago when they thought it might be safe. They were wrong. Her husband was wounded by shrapnel in an explosion shortly afterward. ""Of course I am afraid,"" Fatme said. ""But what can I do? Are my children not going to eat?"" Across the city, what were once staples are now luxuries. A child carries away two bowls with the burnt remains of the cracked wheat. It's all too much for one of the volunteers, Abu Abdo. ""Until when are we going to live like this?"" he cries. ""Look, people are eating burnt food!"" NATO chief echoes warning over chemical weapons . Everywhere in Aleppo, there is evidence that the fighting has taken a heavy toll on the most vulnerable. Close to the bombed-out Dar el-Shifa hospital -- once the city's main field clinic, now a pile of debris -- families pick their way through rubble. Some stop and peer up at what is left, expressions of shock and deep sorrow etched across their faces. Few are able to comprehend what has become their reality. Hamza, 14, gathers with other children near a massive crater filled with grimy water from a burst water main, exploded in a blast a few days before. His parents sent him to fill a container with water after an airstrike cut off their supply. He speaks softly, his arm in a sling. ""I was wounded in a strike in the village we fled to,"" he says simply. Gunfire rings out on the streets of Sakhour, an Aleppo neighborhood that regime forces hope to retake so they can cut off a main artery for opposition forces and reopen a route to Aleppo's airport. Amid the street fighting, a group of women invite me into a house, venting their frustrations and anger. ""We know freedom has a price, but how long can we keep on living like this?"" one woman asks. Another tells of how her roof caved in from an explosion. ""Each time I hear one, I look up and expect to die."" Syria shut down Internet, security firm says . She and her family moved around three times before they ran out of money. ""At least if there was work, anything, it would be a little easier,"" she says. For many children here, gunfire has become background noise. Khawle, 12, sits on the sidewalk, cradling a neighbor's infant daughter. She doesn't move or stop talking as the gunfire intensifies, simply hugging the baby and rocking back and forth. Others flinch at the sound of each pop and blast of weapons. Every time Saleh Hadidi leaves his house, his 4-year-old daugher clutches his leg and begs him not to go. Metal rods protrude from his bandaged arm, a bullet wound he sustained at a government checkpoint that he says was meant for his daughter. ""She was sitting in the front (of the car) when the gunfire started and I put my arm around her,"" he recalled. ""She was drenched in my blood, and the soldiers were screaming, accusing me of being a rebel fighter. They held a gun to my head three, four times and she was screaming, 'Daddy!'"" The girl flinches and clasps her hands, looking away as her father recounts that day. As we leave a woman whispers to me, ""Sometimes I want to die rather than live like this."" Journalist Ammar Cheikhomar contributed to this report.","Rebel forces control most of Aleppo, Syria's largest city .

"(CNN) -- Beyond the golden beaches and beneath the blue waters of the Puerto Rican island of Vieques is a site that resembles more of a munitions graveyard than a Caribbean paradise. James Porter measures a 2,000-pound Navy bomb in the waters off the Caribbean island of Vieques. Hundreds of corroding and unexploded bombs litter the sea floor, leaking toxins and taking a toll on nearby marine life. The munitions were left by the U.S. Navy, which had a training site on Vieques for six decades. ""We know that these munitions are leaking cancer-causing materials and endangering sea life,"" said marine ecologist James Porter, associate dean of the Odum School of Ecology at the University of Georgia, who recently completed a research trip to Vieques. Responding to a request by the governor's office of Puerto Rico, Porter tested the island's waters for the presence of radioactive material surrounding the sunken USS Killen, a World War II-era destroyer used as target practice for Navy missiles. Instead, Porter stumbled upon another finding: cancer. He discovered that feather duster worms, sea urchins and various types of coral found near bombs and bomb fragments contained high levels of carcinogenic material -- in some cases 100,000 times more than what is considered safe for commercially edible seafood. ""We have not yet traced these contaminants from the reef to the dinner table, but we definitely know these contaminants are in the marine ecosystem,"" he said. Porter was scheduled to present his findings Thursday at the Second International Dialogue on Underwater Munitions in Honolulu, Hawaii. The conference brings together scientists, military officials and underwater technology companies to discuss how to identify and clean up hazardous undersea munitions dumps from the Caribbean to the Baltic Sea. ""Any country that has a coastline and has ever had war is going to be a place where you can find this problem,"" said Porter, who warns that removing underwater munitions takes careful planning. ""If you pick up a bomb, you pick up a problem."" Vieques, which lies just east of Puerto Rico's mainland, has had a long history of U.S. military involvement. The Navy used the island as its main Atlantic training site for 60 years before pulling out in 2003. In 2005, the Environmental Protection Agency designated portions of Vieques Island a Superfund site, classified under a federal program to clean up the nation's hazardous waste. The U.S. Navy has allocated an estimated $350 million in recent years to clean up areas of Vieques where unexploded bombs could come into contact with residents or tourists, said Christopher Penny, head of the U.S Navy's Vieques Restoration Project. But these efforts so far have been limited to the land and shoreline. Vieques is one of many ocean sites around the world affected by abandoned ordnances, said scientists and military officials. ""In the U.S. and countries around the world going back to World War II, it was common practice to ... take munitions to a site well offshore and dispose of [them],"" said Addison Davis, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Environment, Safety and Occupational Health. That changed in 1982, when the United Nations passed the Law of the Sea Treaty, which made it illegal for countries to dump excess weapons in open waters. But cleaning up after history has its own unique challenges. One of the many political and environmental obstacles to addressing this issue is the lack of a munitions ""map."" There is no national or international registry that can pinpoint where these dump sites are, Porter said. Many of the bombs also have been corroded by saltwater over decades, making it more difficult for restoration crews to identify and safely remove them. Toxic elements such as TNT, mustard gas and the chemical weapon Lewisite also can be hard to detect in large bodies of water. ""It is a combination of looking at the safety, health and environmental risks and establishing levels for the cleanup,"" said the Army's Davis. One highlight of this week's conference in Honolulu is the Army's plan to remove old explosive rounds dumped in the shallow waters of Pokai Bay off Oahu's Wai'anae Coast, an area known as Ordnance Reef.  The Army has allocated about $4 million to clean up the area, which is estimated to hold more than 2,000 explosives. ""What we're going to attempt to do is look at those munitions in the water that have the greatest potential for harm for people and the environment and to go after those first,"" said Davis. Conventional and chemical weapons have historically been detonated or left to corrode, which presents a challenge when cleaning up ordnances from the sea floor. But a retired Navy bomb-disposal technician has invented a remotely operated vehicle he says can find, collect and dispose of these munitions in a safe way. James Barton calls his prototype an Ordinance Removal System. The machine picks up unexploded bombs off the sea floor and delivers them to a lift basket for surface disposal or deep-sea burial. It is operated remotely with toggle switches and relies on an underwater hydraulic system designed by Barton, president of Underwater Ordnance Recovery Inc. ""I built this technology to help this problem, because people want these munitions out of the water,"" Barton said. Scientists and military officials hope Porter's findings and Barton's device will help bring attention to an environmental problem that for years has been out of sight, out of mind. ""The environmental cost, preparation and training for war has huge environmental impacts that normally are not considered,"" Porter said. ""We normally think of this kind of defense as national security. But in the long term we live on one planet, and taking care of that is maybe our best self-preservation and self-defense.""","Scientists are concerned about corroding, unexploded bombs that litter the sea floor .

"(CNN) -- Captain Cristiano Ronaldo scored a 16-minute hat-trick as Portugal came from behind to beat Northern Ireland 4-2 in a stormy match to stay on track for automatic qualification for the 2014 World Cup. After Russia beat Luxembourg 4-1 earlier Friday to claim a one-point lead in Group F, Ronaldo's team went 2-1 down in pouring rain in Belfast against a team ranked 109th in world football. Bruno Alves put the seventh-ranked visitors ahead in the 21st minute, but Gareth McAuley equalized and Portugal striker Heldar Postiga was sent off before the break. The Irish took the lead through Jamie Ward soon after halftime, but lost the initiative when Chris Brunt was sent off for a second yellow card, recklessly sliding into a tackle. Ronaldo took advantage of the extra space, heading home from a corner in the 68th minute and then nodding in Fabio Coentrao's lofted forward pass on 77. Northern Ireland striker Kyle Lafferty received a straight red three minutes later for a late sliding challenge, and Real Madrid star Ronaldo wrapped up the scoring with a deflected low free-kick. It left Portugal two points clear of Russia, having played one more match, as the road to Rio heads into its final rounds of matches. The Irish had held Portugal 1-1 last October on Ronaldo's 100th appearance for his country, but this time the 28-year-old netted his first international treble to overtake Eusebio as Portugal's second-highest scorer on 43 goals. The Russians can reclaim top spot by winning their game in hand at home to Israel on Tuesday, after which all the teams will have two matches remaining. World and European champion Spain took control of Group I, beating Finland 2-0 while second-placed France dropped points in a 0-0 draw away to Georgia. A goal in either half from defender Jordi Alba and striker Alvaro Negredo was enough to put Vicente del Bosque's team three points clear -- though France can close the gap again by winning in Belarus on Tuesday, ahead of Spain's next match in October. Germany stayed five points clear in Group C as veteran striker Miroslav Klose equaled his country's scoring record in a 3-0 win over neighbor Austria. The 35-year-old matched Gerd Muller's leading tally of 68 when he put the home side ahead in Munich, while Toni Kroos and Thomas Muller netted in the second half at the stadium of their club Bayern. Muller's goals came from just 62 games, while former Bayern star Klose -- now playing in Italy with Lazio -- has needed 129 matches. Austria had been second on goal difference, but lost that position to Sweden -- which beat the Republic of Ireland 2-1 in Dublin. The Irish led through Robbie Keane's national-record 60th goal but striker Johan Elmander leveled and 37-year-old Anders Svensson grabbed a second-half winner on his 143rd international appearance -- matching the most by a Swedish player. England's hopes of automatic qualification were boosted by a 4-0 win over Moldova which put Roy Hodgson's side top of Group H on goal difference. Forward Rickie Lambert scored his second goal in successive matches after Steven Gerrard's opener, while striker Danny Welbeck scored two more -- but picked up a suspension after being booked. It gave England the edge over Montenegro, which dropped points in a 1-1 draw away to Poland as Robert Lewandowski canceled out Dejan Damjanovic's opener for the visiting team. Third-placed Ukraine warmed up for Tuesday's home clash with England by thrashing San Marino 9-0, as eight players found the net and Yevhen Khacheridi scored twice. Belgium went five points clear at the top of Group A after a 2-0 win in Scotland, while second-placed Croatia dropped points in a 1-1 draw in Serbia which ended its neighbor's slim hopes of a playoff place. Italy marched seven points clear in Group B with a 1-0 win over second-placed Bulgaria, as veteran striker Alberto Gilardino netted the only goal seven minutes before halftime. Three teams were left a point behind Bulgaria as Armenia shocked the Czech Republic 2-1 in Prague while Denmark's hopes were boosted with a 2-1 win at bottom side Malta. The Netherlands stayed top in Group D despite being held 2-2 in Estonia, with Robin van Persie's 90th-minute penalty leaving the Dutch six points clear -- though it ended the only 100% record in European qualifying. Arjen Robben scored the opener before Konstantin Vassiljev netted twice for the home side, which had defender Raio Piiroja sent off for bringing down Van Persie at the end. Romania moved up to second place with a 3-0 win at home to Hungary, which dropped its neighbor to third. Turkey thrashed Andorra 5-0 to stay in the hunt for a playoff place, as Umut Bulut scored a hat-trick. Switzerland's Group E lead was trimmed to four points following a 4-4 draw with Iceland. Stephan Lichtsteiner scored twice for the home side but Johann Berg Gudmundsson completed a hat-trick in the 90th minute to keep fourth-placed Iceland in the playoff race. Norway moved up to second with a 2-0 win over bottom team Cyprus, while Slovenia beat third-placed Albania 1-0 to also remain in contention. In Group G, Greece joined Bosnia and Herzegovina on 16 points at the top after a 1-0 win away to Liechtenstein, with both teams having a player sent off. Bosnia lost 1-0 at home to third-placed Slovakia, which is a further four points adrift. Meanwhile, Ghana became the fourth nation to qualify for the final round of African qualifying after beating Zambia 2-1 in Kumasi, ending the visiting side's hopes of going through. Six other places will be settled in this weekend's last round of group matches, while Algeria, Ivory Coast and Egypt have already won spots.","Portugal top of Group F after coming from behind to beat Northern Ireland .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Serena Williams will play second-ranked Victoria Azarenka in a rematch of last year's U.S. Open final on Sunday as she attempts to become the oldest winner of the New York grand slam. The American blew away the hopes of Li Na, who had been hoping to become the first Chinese player to contest the title match of the hard-court event, as she triumphed 6-0 6-3 in Friday's second semifinal. The defending champion, who turns 32 at the end of this month, made a blistering start against Li but the fifth seed battled back in the second set -- Williams required seven match-points to reach her seventh U.S. Open final. She has won four of those, suffering defeat in 2001 and 2011. ""I got a little nervous there at the end but I was able to close it out,"" Williams told the crowd. ""I'm excited to be in another final. We always have really good matches. ""Vika's a great player and she lifts her game when it counts. I think that's what makes the difference."" Williams has lost just four times this year -- two of those to Azarenka -- and dropped only 16 games in 12 sets on the way to the final. The Belorussian was largely untroubled in reaching her fourth grand slam final, beating Italian underdog Flavia Pennetta 6-4 6-2 in a match marred by service struggles for both players. Pennetta, ranked 83rd in the world, was playing in her first major semifinal but had a 1-1 record against Azarenka. ""It's been a long road to the final and it's an amazing feeling to come out here and fight for that trophy on Sunday -- I'm definitely giving myself the best chance for my dreams here,"" said the two-time Australian Open winner, who has a 12-3 losing record against Williams. ""Today was a great match, a lot of emotions. I think the turning point was when I finally held my serve and won the first set. I stayed tough and played really well on return games and on important moments.

"(CNN) -- The sudden death at the age of 27 of a footballer in Qatar has prompted an outpouring of grief across the world but also fevered speculation as to the cause of his passing. Wednesday shed some light on Ecuadoran footballer Christian Benitez's death after his club Al Jaish released a statement saying he died from heart failure. ""The official medical reports were issued by official state entities and stated that the sudden death was caused by heart failure,"" read the statement issued by the club. ""Since the Ecuadorian star passed away on Monday morning in a sudden way, sadness and sorrow prevailed all over the club after hearing the sad news especially that Benitez has joined the team for few days only."" The club has pledged to pay for all the expenses of transferring the player's body from Doha back to Ecuador. ""The management assures again its endless support to Christian's family and standing by their side during this hard time,"" added the Al Jaish statement. ""The club has also made a special visit to the family and wife of the late player who are currently staying at Doha. The visit was made to check on the family situation and to assure that the management stands by their side and supports them."" The 27-year-old died in a Qatari hospital where he was taken after complaining of abdominal pains. He had only made his debut for the club on Sunday. With Qatar hosting the World Cup in 2022, Benitez's death has sent shockwaves through the football world. ""This is a terrible tragedy, just awful news,"" said a Qatar 2022 spokesman, while football stars also took to Twitter to pay their respects to the man nicknamed 'Chucho'. Fellow Ecuador star Antonio Valencia, who plays for Manchester United, uploaded several photos of him with the forward and wrote: ""This pain (is) very strong my brother but we love you."" Ecuador's interior minister Jose Serrano was among those who took to the micro-blogging site to comment, writing: ""Dear Chucho, thank you for your goals and your happiness."" Sunderland's Craig Gardner, who played with Benitez at Birmingham City between 2009 and 2010, also paid tribute to his former teammate. ""Can't believe Christian Benitez has died,"" Gardner wrote. ""I had the pleasure to play with him. He was a top bloke. My thoughts go out to his family."" Ermen Benitez, the player's father, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol Tuesday that his son had never had any heart problems before he arrived in Qatar. ""When a football player is signed, they always do tests,"" he said. ""And he passed."" Benitez joined Al Jaish on July 6 after signing a three-year deal. He was a favorite in Ecuador, scoring 24 goals in 28 appearances for the national team. Benitez established himself as a promising talent at El Nacional, the same club where his father starred during the 1980s. After leaving the Quito-based club, Benitez enjoyed success in Mexico with Santos Laguna before earning himself a loan deal to play in the English Premier League with Birmingham City in 2009. He scored four times in 36 appearances, making his debut at Old Trafford against Manchester United and scored his first goal against Liverpool. But his failure to earn a permanent deal in England saw him return to Santos Laguna where he finished the season as top scorer. He joined rivals America in 2011 and helped it win this year's Clausura title -- finishing as top scorer along the way. Benitez died on Monday, one day after playing his first game for new side El Jaish. ""The club would like to offer its sincere condolences to the family of the player,"" a club statement said on Monday. ""Benitez had recently joined the club from Club America for three seasons. The player participated for the first time with the team during yesterday's match against Qatar Sports Club in the Sheikh Jassem Cup without complaining of any health problems. ""His sudden departure is a big shock for each member of the technical and administrative staff. He was a player that over the short period he was here was regarded for his high moral character."" In recent years Daniel Jarque, Antonio Puerta and Marc-Vivien Foe are some of the other footballers to have died from heart problems.","Christian Benitez passed away on Monday in Qatar .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two weeks ago, the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill on a 68-32 vote, with 14 Republicans joining the Democratic majority to send the measure drafted by a bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" to the GOP-controlled House. President Barack Obama pushed for the House to quickly take up the measure that would provide a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants living illegally in the country while bolstering security along the Mexican border. The proposal also includes stronger worker eligibility verification standards and overall border entry-exit controls. However, House Republicans made clear Wednesday they opposed the comprehensive approach of the Senate and intended to consider the issue in a series of bills that will take months to reach final votes. In addition, the House GOP caucus was deeply divided on the question of eventual citizenship for undocumented immigrants, with some calling for a path to legal status while others opposed any kind of what they labeled amnesty for those who broke the law. While House leaders warned the party faced political harm if it failed to act on immigration legislation, a vital issue for Hispanic Americans who comprise the nation's largest minority demographic, the piecemeal approach and divisions over the legalization issue portend a messy and uncertain future for the issue. Here are five reasons why: . Bipartisanship necessary in Senate, not the House. A 60-vote majority is needed to push major legislation through the 100-member Senate, which means Senate Democrats and Republicans usually have to work together to get anything substantive accomplished. The House, however, does not often require such a super-majority. As long as a simple majority sticks together, it can do virtually anything it pleases. Mix that rule with increasing ideological orthodoxy and a decreasing willingness to compromise -- particularly within the conservative ranks of the majority House GOP -- and you have a recipe for stalemate with the Democratic-controlled Senate. ""Passing any version of the Gang of Eight's bill would be worse public policy than passing nothing,"" conservative pundits Bill Kristol and Rich Lowry argued Tuesday in National Review Online. ""House Republicans can do the country a service by putting a stake through its heart."" In today's hyper-partisan political climate, doing nothing is the easiest path for House Republicans to take and even a bragging point for tea party conservatives who came to Washington to shake up the status quo. While moderate House GOP leaders call for passing some kind of immigration legislation to avoid a potential political backlash, conservatives in the rank-and-file say such fears are unfounded as voters will reward Republicans for opposing what they call a bad Senate bill. Republicans don't trust Obama on border security. Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp might have said it best. The two-term conservative Republican tweeted Wednesday that ""trusting Obama (with) border security is like trusting Bill Clinton (with) your daughter."" Ouch. Virtually every congressional Republican says the Mexican border needs to be properly enforced before Democrats get their priority -- a path to citizenship for America's 11 million undocumented residents. Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, and John Hoeven, R-North Dakota, added billions for Mexican border security to the ""Gang of Eight"" bill. For a lot of Republicans, though, the issue involves trust, not money. They remember the last major immigration reform effort, in 1986 under GOP President Ronald Reagan, that also called for tightened immigration controls while giving three million undocumented immigrants legal status. They say the amnesty occurred but the tougher border controls didn't, leading to the much-worse situation today. Now they don't trust Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to secure the border. They also claim Obama's recent decision to delay implementation of part of health care reform showed the administration can't be counted on to fully enforce any law. By taking a piecemeal approach, House Republicans hope to secure the tougher border security they seek before acting on a separate plan that could provide legal status for at least some undocumented immigrants. In short, pass a border security bill now, and then come back to the legalization issue once everyone agrees the border is sealed. Democrats reject such an approach. The conundrum of citizenship/legalization . While the Senate measure provides a multi-year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants, House Republicans made clear Wednesday they remained split about 50-50 on the matter. Reasons for opposing any kind of legalization range from punishing lawbreakers to political protectionism, with conservatives fearing that most immigrants given what they call amnesty and the eventual right to vote will lean Democratic. However, the issue of legalizing immigrants is broad and complex, creating lots of uncertainty. For example, the Senate bill would automatically give immigrants living illegally in the United States temporary legal status as ""registered provisional immigrants."" Only when certain border security steps had been taken could they apply for permanent residency, or green cards, as a step toward potential citizenship in process that would take more than a decade. Many House Republicans made clear they don't want any kind of legal status for undocumented immigrants until the borders are secure. Even those open to legalization don't want it to include a path to full citizenship. The labels and definitions of legal status will be a major sticking point in the continuing debate, but also could be a source of compromise. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia told Wednesday's GOP caucus meeting that children of undocumented immigrants brought illegally to America through no fault of their own should be provided a path to legal status, a position strongly favored by Democrats. The backing of Cantor and other House Republicans for such a provision showed room for maneuvering exists. After meeting with Obama at the White House on Thursday, GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona called on House Republicans to negotiate an immigration bill. ""We are ready to sit down with you and negotiate and bring this issue to a conclusion,"" said McCain, part of the bipartisan Senate ""Gang of Eight."" Sweeping reform isn't popular with GOP in either chamber. There may be more Senate GOP support for comprehensive immigration reform, but not that much. Only 14 of 46 GOP senators backed the ""Gang of Eight"" bill heralded in its creation as a triumph of bipartisanship in a sharply divided Congress. Why should House Republicans be more in favor? Remember that all politics is still local -- especially in the House. Many House Republicans represent ruby red districts with few Hispanics, where any path to citizenship is unpopular and the big fear is a primary challenge from the right. Which leads us to ... The Hastert rule . House Speaker John Boehner has made clear that the House will only take up immigration reform that is backed by a majority of its Republican members. That is keeping with the maxim of former House Speaker Dennis Hastert that prevented votes on legislation that lacked strong support from the controlling party. Democrats contend the Senate version would pass the House with a few dozen Republicans joining them to overcome opposition by most of the GOP caucus. While it is unclear if that's true, permitting it to happen would antagonize many of Boehner's fellow Republicans. ""If the speaker allows a vote on any immigration bill that results in passage despite a majority of the Republican conference voting against it, then it will be interesting to see if he can muster the votes to get re-elected after the next election,"" Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks recently told CNN.","House Republicans oppose the comprehensive bill passed by the Senate .
A key sticking point is the pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants .
Lack of trust is another obstacle, as GOP legislators remember the 1986 bill .

"(CNN) -- From luxury hotels in colossal tower blocks to traditional ""ryokan"" and functional capsule hotels, there's plenty of variety in Tokyo's hotel scene. Sample the salaryman lifestyle at the Capsule Inn Akihabara. If you can afford it -- and you probably can't -- you owe it to yourself to stay at the Peninsula Hotel (1-8-1 Yurakucho, Chiyoda-ku). As well as overlooking the Imperial Palace, what makes this hotel so special is the incredible array of high-tech mod cons in the rooms. There are wall panels that show the outdoor weather conditions, in-room nail dryers and espresso machines and, best of all, the toilets have a heated, self-lifting seat and built-in power deodorizer -- ingenious. Another top-end option is the Park Hyatt (3-7-1-2 Nishi Shinjuku), immediately recognizable as the setting for the movie ""Lost in Translation."" The hotel occupies floors 41 to 52 of the Shinjuku Park Tower, and with breathtaking views over the city and towards Mount Fuji, its popularity with visiting celebrities is understandable. A more economical option is the Park Hotel Tokyo (Shiodome Media Tower, 1-7-1, Higashi Shimbashi), which also has great views, along with modern, unfussy rooms. The hotel even employs ""Pillow Fitter"" staff to make sure you get a good night's sleep. Marunouchi Hotel (1-6-30 Marunouchi, Chiyoda-ku) has comfortable rooms and is surprisingly luxurious for a business hotel. A ""ryokan"" is a traditional Japanese-style inn, often featuring communal baths and rooms with futons and ""tatami"" (straw mat) flooring. They also tend to be cheaper than regular hotels. Family-run Ryokan Sawanoya (2-3-11 Yanaka, Taito-ku) is cheap and homely. The English-speaking owner is exceptionally helpful and keen to immerse you in Japanese culture. If you're lucky, his family will put on a tea ceremony or lion dance for your viewing pleasure. Ryokan Asakusa Shigetsu (1-31-11 Asakusa, Taito-ku) is a more expensive but more traditional option. Most rooms have private bathrooms but it's worth using the communal baths just for the views of the nearby five-storied pagoda. 'Western-style' rooms are also available. If you're on a tight budget, or just curious, you could always try a 'capsule' hotel, where guests sleep in coffin-sized capsules, just big enough to sit up in. Aimed primarily at workers too tired or too drunk to make it home, capsule hotels are only really suitable for single-night stays. Asakusa Riverside Capsule Hotel (2-20-4 Kaminarimon, Taito-ku), with a women-only floor, is one of the few capsule hotels in Tokyo that allows female guests. You'll be provided with a dressing gown and toothbrush and you'll have access to communal bathing facilities. Be sure to take earplugs, as the snores of drunken salarymen won't do much for your beauty sleep.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A terrorist wanting to smuggle radioactive material from Canada into the United States probably would find it easy to do, a new report from congressional investigators said. A clearing through the forest marks the U.S.-Canada border near Beecher Falls, Vermont. Government investigators were able to cross from Canada into the United States carrying a duffle bag with contents that looked like radioactive material and never encountered a law enforcement official, according to a report released Thursday by investigators from the Government Accountability Office. ""Our work clearly shows substantial vulnerabilities in the northern border to terrorist or criminals entering the United States undetected,"" the GAO's Greg Kutz testified Thursday at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the topic. ""Although the southern border appears to be substantially more secure, we did identify several vulnerabilities on federally managed lands where there was no CBP [Customs and Border Protection] control."" The investigators made crossings from Canada into the United States three times in fall 2006, the report said.  Watch GAO video of a man with a gym bag easily crossing into the U.S. from Canada » . In one of those instances, the GAO said, the Customs and Border Protection agency reported an alert citizen notified authorities of the suspicious activity of the undercover investigators and described their vehicle. However, the report said the Border Patrol was not able to locate the rental vehicle. The GAO's task was to perform what it called a ""limited security assessment to identify vulnerable border areas."" The focus was on border ports where the U.S. government does not maintain a manned presence 24 hours a day and has no apparent monitoring equipment in place. The study was meant to simulate how easy it would be to cross the border with radioactive material or similar items. Senators voiced concern about the report's findings during Thursday's hearing. ""There may not be an awful lot of crossings across the northern border, but the vulnerability is obvious. ... Are you going to reassess it and redeploy personnel based upon the vulnerability of the northern border?"" Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, chairman of the Finance Committee, pointedly asked Ronald Colburn, national deputy chief of the Border Patrol. ""We already knew this, senator,"" Colburn answered. ""This is not a surprise report to us."" He defended the priorities set by the Border Patrol, pointing out that a vast majority of the traffic coming into the United States comes across the southern border, not the northern one. He also testified that federal authorities are making progress toward getting operational control of both borders. ""We are getting there,"" Colburn said. ""We are bringing manpower. We are bringing ... unmanned aerial vehicles. We are bringing aircrafts. We are bringing boats, and we are bringing more manpower and sensing systems."" Investigators also noted several ports of entry have posted daytime hours and are not manned overnight. In addition, the GAO investigators identified a security vulnerability regarding federally managed land adjacent to the U.S.-Mexico border. ""These areas did not appear to be monitored or have a manned [Border Patrol] presence during the time our investigators visited the sites,"" the report said. While the U.S.-Mexican border has received much of the national attention lately with the recent debate over illegal immigration, the report pointed out the dramatic disparity in the law enforcement presence at crossings there versus ones between the United States and Canada. As of May, the U.S. government had 972 Border Patrol agents on the northern border but almost 12,000 on the southern one. The United States and Canada share more than 5,000 miles of border, while the U.S. and Mexico share 1,900 miles. The border report was the second in two days to show how terrorists might find ways to strike the United States. CNN reported on Wednesday that the U.S. electrical grid could be vulnerable to a cyber attack that would make generators self-destruct.

"(CNN) -- Swedish mountaineer and professional skier Fredrik Ericsson died Friday while trying to summit K2 in Pakistan, his friend David Schipper told CNN in a telephone interview. The incident occurred between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. as Ericsson was attempting to become the first man to ski from the summit to base camp, said Schipper, who said he learned of the accident on the world's second-tallest peak in a satellite call from fellow climber Fabrizio Zangrilli. Ericsson, in his mid-30s, was at a place called the bottleneck, at an altitude of around 8,300 meters (27,231 feet), between Camp 4 (8,000 meters) and the summit (8,611 meters), said Schipper, a Moab, Utah-based climber. He described the bottleneck as a ""steep and narrow section with thousands of meters of exposure below."" Ericsson, along with his climbing partners Trey Cook and Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner, had begun the summit push between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m. in low-visibility weather. After several hours of climbing, they approached the bottom of the bottleneck. At this point, Cook returned to Camp 4, leaving Kaltenbrunner and Ericsson to continue their ascent. As Ericsson was attempting to fix ropes to the snow and ice along the route he ""lost his purchase and was unable to arrest his fall,"" Schipper said. Ericsson's body, resting at about 7,000 meters, will remain where it fell, Schipper said on Ericsson's website. ""His parents have requested it remain in the mountains he loved,"" he wrote. ""Retrieval would be exceptionally dangerous.""","NEW: Skier's body will not be recovered .

"(CNN) -- No city better exemplifies China's investment in its western interior than Chengdu, the booming capital of Sichuan, famous for pandas and spicy food. The city recently hosted the Fortune Global Forum and announced that visitors from 45 countries can enjoy a 72-hour visa-free stay, further cementing its rise as a major tourism destination. Yet only two hours from this metropolis of 14 million people lies a town that has remained fundamentally untouched by the economic changes that have transformed so many lives in China over the past 35 years. Bagou -- a coal town that has seen its population fall from a peak of 20,000 to 1,500 in the years since the mine ceased operation -- is an anomaly in China. It's a town that's actually worse off in 2013 than it was in 1963. The vast workers' auditorium, miners' cottages (several built by the British in the 1930s), schools and hospitals are all empty and in a state of abject disrepair, but the fact that more tourists are arriving on the steam railway means the town's worst days may now be behind it. The narrow-gauge rail line was built to connect Bagou with the river town of Shibanxi in 1958 and has six intermediate stops along its 19.8-kilometer (12.3-mile) route. Although used primarily for the transportation of coal, it continues to provide a passenger service. In fact, until 2012 there was no road to Bagou and the town could be reached only by train or on a motorbike running alongside the tracks. Tickets for ""local"" trains cost 5 RMB (about 80 cents) to ride the line in its entirety, while those for the new tourist trains from Yuebin are RMB 50 ($8). These services are air-conditioned, provide a seat (not guaranteed on local trains) and will usually stop in Jiaoba to allow passengers to photograph the most scenic part of the route. All trains are powered by one of six working steam engines that are housed and serviced in Shibanxi. More on CNN: Checking in on Chengdu, China's latest urban star . China's industrial heritage . Most passengers, both locals and tourists, disembark in Bagou, but an interesting alternative is to continue to the final stop, Huangcun, to take in the Cultural Revolution slogans and artwork that decorate the buildings right next to the platform. Huangcun is also home to the coal mine Bagou and its surrounding villages relied on for more than 70 years. The mine has been open as a tourist attraction since 2008 and daughters of former miners (the guides are all female) lead informative tours. After emerging back into daylight, the 20-minute walk to Bagou through plantain groves passes many buildings of interest, including the former Occupational Disease Clinic, hospital and middle school. With a well put together museum in Bagou, housed in the Soviet-built former town-administrative center, the mine and steam engines mark the beginning of a nascent interest in industrial heritage in China. Steam enthusiasts arrive from, chiefly, the UK, Germany, the U.S. and Japan, but it's Chinese tourists that the town is trying to attract in larger numbers. An increasing number of chartered trains bringing in groups from Chengdu and further afield attest to the success of the local campaign sign-posting the railway as ""a living fossil of the Industrial Revolution."" Along with the industrial heritage appeal, Bagou is attracting tourists interested in the social history aspect of a town that has been frozen in time. Cultural Revolution artwork and slogans that adorn many buildings have been repainted and the original ""Mao stage,"" where only 40 years ago ""struggle sessions"" viciously humiliated supposed class enemies, has been authentically restored. The Jiayang Railway makes a fascinating addition to the well-established local itinerary of Emei Mountain and Leshan Big Buddha. With outstanding hiking opportunities in the bamboo-covered hills that surround the line, fresh, fiery and delicious Sichuan food and accommodation at RMB 50-100 per night it also makes for an ideal weekend excursion from Chengdu. More on CNN: CNNGo TV in Chengdu . Essential info . To get to the train line, take a taxi from downtown Chengdu to Shiyang bus station for RMB 25 and purchase a ticket to Qianwei for RMB 68. Buses run every hour and the journey takes approximately two hours. Once in Qianwei town take a local bus, taxi or motorbike taxi (RMB 50) to either Shibanxi -- the true beginning of the line -- or Yuejin, where the tourist trains commence. It's possible to hike the entire length and attendants are on hand to say when it's safe to pass through each of the six tunnels. Accommodation is available en route but it's easiest to find in Bagou. A local guesthouse will cost in the region of RMB 50-60 per night and a room in the new station hotel is RMB 100. Visitors arriving in Shanghai can take the 431 kmh (267 mph) Maglev to begin their China experience on the world's fastest train. The contrast between this and the Jiayang trains trundling along at 30 kph perfectly encapsulates the divide between old and new and rural and urban that so marks modern China.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer will not feature in a Grand Slam final in the same calendar year for the first time since 2002, after he was knocked out of the U.S. Open by Spain's Tommy Robredo. The winner of 17 Grand Slam titles, including five in New York, suffered a straight sets defeat in his fourth round match at Flushing Meadows, losing 7-6 (7/3) 6-3 6-4 late Monday. The defeat denied the Swiss star, arguably the finest player to have played the game, a quarter-final showdown with long-time nemesis Rafael Nadal, after the in-form Spanish star beat Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 6-3 6-1. Robredo had never beaten Federer before their latest rain-delayed encounter on the Louis Armstrong Stadium court. But with 43 unforced errors to his name and only two break points converted from 16, the former world number one looked unlikely to extend that run. ""I'm going to feel like I beat myself,"" Federer told reporters after the match. ""It was up to me to make the difference and I just couldn't. ""I self-destructed, which is really disappointing. When things came to the crunch I just couldn't do it. It's frustrating."" Robredo, by contrast, was full of confidence as he hit 70% of his first serves and sent numerous forehand winners whistling past his illustrious opponent. ""I'm delighted. It's unbelievable. The difference is I won the break points today,"" said Robredo. With the ignominy of another early exit from a Grand Slam tournament, Federer, whose ranking has slipped to an unfamiliar No. 7, will face renewed speculation about his future. At 32, some question whether he can arrest the recent decline in his fortunes -- his last major title was at Wimbledon in 2012. ""Roger is in a very vulnerable state. He's in a vulnerable position because he's moved down to No. 7 now,"" said legendary coach Nick Bollettieri in a recent interview with CNN. ""Remember Pete Sampras went through a tough period. Fortunately for Pete he won a big one before he left the tour."" But with younger rivals Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray improving all the time, Federer will be acutely aware that his window of opportunity is rapidly closing. He has even experimented with a larger racquet head in a bid to find a solution to his on-court problems. And for Bollettieri, who has coached a number of former Grand Slam champions including Andre Agassi, there's a real concern that an underwhelming end to his career could undo the Federer legacy. ""It would be a shame if people forgot who he was,"" he said. ""Look at what he brought to the game. He brought class. He lived a beautiful private life. ""He's quiet. He's always respectful of the sport. He's respectful of his opponents. You don't find too many people who represent life, whether it be business or sports, like this guy.""","Five-time U.S. Open champion Roger Federer loses 7-6 (7/3) 6-3 6-4 to Tommy Robredo .

"(Lonely Planet) -- While many visitors to Canada -- especially those who think Canadians live under a permanent blanket of snow -- are surprised to learn that wine is produced in Canada, their suspicion is always tempered after a drink or two. Canada's wines have gained ever-greater kudos in recent years and while smaller-scale production and the industry dominance of other wine regions means they'll never be a global market leader, there are some truly lip-smacking surprises waiting for thirsty grape lovers. The best way to sample any wine is to head straight to the source, where you can taste the region in the glass. You won't want to miss the multitude of top table wineries in Ontario's Niagara region or British Columbia's Okanagan Valley -- the country's leading producers -- but a visit to the smaller, often rustic wineries of Québec and the charming boutique operations of Nova Scotia and Vancouver Island's Cowichan Valley can be just as rewarding. Wherever your tipple-craving crawl takes you (with a designated driver of course), drink widely and deeply and prepare to be surprised. And make sure you have plenty of room in your suitcase -- packing materials are always available, but you'll probably drink everything before you make it to the airport anyway. Regional Wine List . Depending on how thirsty you are, you're rarely too far from a wine region in Canada. Which means that most visitors can easily add a mini tasting tour to their visit if they'd like to meet a few producers and sample some intriguing local flavors. Here's a rundown of the best areas, including the magnum-sized larger regions and the thimble-sized smaller locales: . Lonely Planet: In vino veritas: Italy's regional wines . Okanagan Valley . The rolling hills of this lakeside BC region are well worth the five-hour drive from Vancouver. Studded among the vine-striped slopes are more than 100 wineries enjoying a diverse climate that fosters both crisp whites and bold reds. With varietals including pinot noir, pinot gris, pinot blanc, merlot and chardonnay, there's a wine here to suit almost every palate. Most visitors base themselves in Kelowna, the Okanagan's wine capital, before fanning out to well-known blockbuster wineries like Mission Hill, Quail's Gate, Cedar Creek and Summerhill Pyramid Winery (yes, it has a pyramid). Many of them also have excellent vista-hugging restaurants. Find out more about BC's wine regions and annual festivals -- and download free touring maps -- at www.winebc.com. Golden Mile . Some of BC's best Okanagan wineries are centered south of the valley around the historic town of Oliver, where the Golden Mile's hot climate fosters a long, warm growing season. Combined with gravel, clay and sandy soils, this area is ideally suited to varietals like merlot, chardonnay, gewürztraminer and cabernet sauvignon. While the 20 or so wineries here are not actually crammed into one mile -- it's more like 20 kilometers -- the proximity of celebrated producers like Burrowing Owl, Tinhorn Creek and Road 13 Vineyards makes this an ideal touring area. And if you're still thirsty, continue south to Osoyoos and check out Nk'Mip Cellars, a First Nations winery on the edge of a desert. Vancouver Island . Long-established as a farming area, Vancouver Island's verdant Cowichan Valley is also home to some great little wineries. A short drive from Victoria, you'll find Averill Creek, Blue Grouse, Cherry Point Vineyards and Venturie-Schulze. Also consider Merridale Estate Cidery, which produces six celebrated ciders on its gently-sloped orchard grounds. For information on the wineries here, visit www.wineislands.ca. Niagara Peninsula . This picture-perfect Ontario region of country inns and charming old towns offers more than 60 wineries and grows more than three-quarters of Canada's grapes. Neatly divided between the low-lying Niagara-on-the-Lake area and the higher Niagara Escarpment, its complex mix of soils and climates -- often likened to the Loire Valley -- is ideal for chardonnay, riesling, pinot noir and cabernet-franc varietals. This is also the production center for Canadian icewine, that potently sweet dessert drink made from grapes frozen on the vine. Home to some of Canada's biggest and best wineries, including Inniskillin, Jackson-Triggs and Peller Estates, don't miss smaller pit-stops like Magnotta and Cave Spring Cellars in the Escarpment area. Lonely Planet: Tripping California Wine Country . Prince Edward County . Proving that not all of Ontario's wineries are clustered in Niagara, this comparatively new grape-growing region -- located in the province's southeastern corner and almost three hours drive from Toronto -- is a charming alternative if you want to avoid the tour buses winding through the main wine area. A long-established fruit-growing district with generally lower temperatures than Niagara, cooler-climate wines are favored here -- including chardonnay and pinot noir. The most intriguing wineries include Closson Chase, Black Prince Winery and Grange of Prince Edward. If your taste buds are piqued, consider checking out other Ontario wine regions like Pelee Island and Lake Erie North Shore. Eastern Townships . Starting around 80 km southeast of Montréal, this idyllic patchwork farmland region in Québec is studded with quiet villages, leafy woodlands, crystal clear lakes and winding countryside roads. A rising tide of wineries has joined the traditional farm operations here in recent years, with rieslings and chardonnays particularly suited to the area's cool climate and soil conditions. But it's the local icewines, dessert wines and fruit wines that are the area's main specialties, so make sure you come with a sweet tooth. Wineries to perk up your taste-buds here include Domaine Félibre, Vignoble de L'Orpailleur and Vignoble le Cep d'Argent. Montérégie . The dominant player in Québec's wider Eastern Townships, this bumpy and bucolic area is packed with vineyards and orchards (not to mention a surfeit of maple groves). A major fruit farming region -- this is an ideal spot to try ciders and flavor-packed fruit wines -- growers here are happy to try just about any red or white varietal, but it's their rosés that are particularly memorable. Recommended wineries include Domaine St-Jacques, Les Petits Cailloux and Vignoble des Pins; and keep in mind that Québec restaurants often encourage diners to bring their own bottles, so fill your car as you explore the region. Nova Scotia . Divided into six boutique wine-producing regions -- from the warm shoreline of Northumberland Strait to the verdant Annapolis Valley -- Nova Scotia's two-dozen wineries are mostly just a couple of hours drive from big city Halifax. One of the world's coldest grape-growing areas, cool-climate whites are a staple here, including a unique varietal known as l'Acadie Blanc. Innovative sparkling wines are a Nova Scotia specialty and they tend to dominate the drops that are on offer at the popular stops such as the excellent Benjamin Bridge Vineyards. Other highly recommended destinations to fill up your glass include Gaspereau Vineyards, Jost Vineyards and Domaine De Grand Pre. Lonely Planet: Top 10 Canadian adventures . © 2011 Lonely Planet.

"(CNN) -- Well humans, it's been a good ride, but after being eviscerated by IBM's supercomputer Watson on ""Jeopardy!,"" it's probably time to pack up the truck and let the machines inherit the Earth. Or is it? Despite Watson's tremendous performance, the Final Jeopardy question at the end of Tuesday night's airing revealed the Achilles' heel that computer scientists have known all along: Watson doesn't really ""think"" anything, and it struggles with simple questions that most humans can answer without a second thought. Most of the clues on the ""Jeopardy!"" board mention proper nouns -- specific places, events, people, songs, books and so on, says Dr. Douglas Lenat, a machine learning pioneer, former Stanford professor of computer science and CEO of Cycorp, a company that develops semantic technologies. ""This gives the Watson algorithm a great deal of 'traction.' To us viewing the show, it's impressive if it correctly knows that Franz Schubert's birth date was January 31, 1797. But if that date had been part of the clue, could Watson correctly pick out [Schubert's] maternal grandmother's birth date from a list where only one of the dates was earlier than 1797?"" We could, because we understand that everyone is younger than their own mother and grandmother, but Watson is unable to understand this, Lenat explained. At the end of the day, Watson is not really conceptualizing a clue's meaning. It simply number-crunches its way to the right answers by comparing vast amounts of data. This is why it dominates the ""fill in the blank"" knowledge clues (Aeolic, spoken in ancient times, was a dialect of this), but falters on some more ""common sense"" deductions. The biggest blunder was in the first game's Final Jeopardy round. Lenat broke down IBM's explanation of why Watson guessed ""Toronto?"" to the clue in the category of ""U.S. Cities:"" ""Namely, the string 'U.S.' often appears in articles near the word 'America,' which appears often near the phrases 'North American' and 'American League,' and so on, all the way to the word 'Toronto.' "" As Dave Ferrucci of IBM Research says, this points out the limitations of relying so heavily on statistical reasoning. The result, as in Watson's case, is akin to a human autistic savant."" ""Jeopardy!"" is challenging because the clues are esoteric. No one would watch a battle of common sense. But Lenat notes that a question like ""If a snowman melts and later refreezes, does it turn back into a snowman?"" would be nearly impossible for a statistical reasoning program to tackle. You can't answer it by calculating how many times ""snowman"" appears next to ""melt"" and ""refreeze"" in every article and book ever written. Not so hot now, are you Watson? Last week, I interviewed Stephen Baker, a journalist with unfettered access to Watson's development at IBM. I asked him about people's concern that computers with natural language capabilities could replace members of the work force. ""People have good reason to worry about machines supplanting them,"" Baker said. ""That's what technology does. Tractors, forklifts, word-processing software, they all took away jobs. And people, with their creative minds, have used them throughout history to figure out where the next jobs will be."" And like its forebears, Watson's eventual commercial incarnation will be a tool, not a human replacement. Lenat thinks of Watson or Deep Blue or even the steam-powered hammer that bested John Henry in American folklore as an ""impressive demonstration that a certain task can, despite popular intuition at the time, be performed better by a machine."" Watson's natural language abilities might make it a good candidate for work in call centers, where it could interpret customers' needs and direct them to the right information (or people) via conversation. There's also been discussion of how Watson could be used in medicine to cross reference a patient's symptoms with compendiums of digitized medical journals and data -- a sort of statistical second opinion to a doctor's professional experience. But because Watson is only a ""statistical brain,"" and not an analytical one, don't expect to see it managing your HR department or running a daycare facility anytime soon. We'll still be getting up early and trudging off to do those jobs for the foreseeable future. Thanks for nothing, IBM. Matt Silverman is an editor at Mashable.

"(CNN) -- The man touted as the next savior of Australian swimming has arrived. Just don't ask him how much he knows about, well, swimming. Sailing legend John Bertrand has been named as the new president of Swimming Australia, tasked with the mighty mission of turning around a team criticized for its ""toxic"" behavior during a woeful Olympic performance in London last year. While 66-year-old Bertrand has no direct experience with professional swimming, he does know a thing or two about breaking sporting droughts. This, afterall, is the man who skippered ""Australia II"" to victory in the 1983 America's Cup -- the first foreign team to beat the U.S. in the 132-year history of the race. He became a national hero, with the victory recognized by the Confederation of Australian Sport as the ""greatest performance in 200 years of Australian sport."" ""I've had an association with high performance sport and high performance teams for more than 40 years and this appointment is one of the highlights of my career,"" Bertrand said in a statement on Friday. ""Swimming has a proud history in this country and a reputation for hard work, humility and success. This tradition needs to continue and be a clear focus for all athletes and coaches as we head towards Rio in 2016."" Bertrand replaces Barclay Nettlefold, who resigned in June amid claims of inappropriate comments to a female staff member. He had held the position since October last year. His departure followed a string of controversies for Swimming Australia which is trying to rebuild both its team and its image after its worst Olympic performance in the pool in 20 years. It was the first time Australia -- a nation renowned for its prowess in the pool -- had failed to win more than one swimming gold medal since 1992. An independent report pointed to a lack of leadership at the top and unacceptable behavior from athletes. ""Standards, discipline and accountabilities for the swim team at the London Olympics were too loose,"" the report said, having canvassed 94 individuals and received 30 submissions. ""There were enough culturally toxic incidents across enough team members that breached agreements (such as getting drunk, misuse of prescription drugs, breaching curfews, deceit, bullying) to warrant a strong, collective leadership response that included coaches, staff and the swimmers. No such collective action was taken."" It was a different story for the country's sailing team which emerged from London 2012 as the nation's best-performing sport with two gold medals and a silver. Bertrand -- himself a dual Olympian and bronze medalist at the 1976 Montreal Games -- served as the sailing team's chairman of selectors at the London and Beijing Games. Acting chair of Swimming Australia, Clem Doherty, also pointed to Bertrand's business credentials, saying: ""He brings a unique mix of corporate expertise, government relations, sporting prowess and leadership of high performance teams and will be a valuable asset to the sport."" One year on from the Games, there have been signs of improvement for Swimming Australia, with the team finishing sixth at the World Championships in Barcelona earlier this month. Now all eyes will be on Bertrand to see if he can finally return Australian swimming to the top of the medal podium.","Sailing legend John Bertrand new President of Swimming Australia .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Cape Town's archbishop led Nelson Mandela's family in prayer on Tuesday, calling for ""a quiet night and a peaceful, perfect, end"" for the former South African president. Archbishop Thabo Makgoba prayed with Mandela's family at the Pretoria hospital where the anti-apartheid icon remains in critical condition, the South African Press Association reported. ""Fill them with your holy courage and the gift of trusting faith, and take away their fears so that they may dare to face their grief,"" he said, according to a copy of the prayer posted on the bishop's website. ""Guide the medical staff so that they may know how to use their skills wisely and well, in caring for Madiba and keeping him comfortable,"" Makgoba said, using Mandela's traditional clan name. ""And uphold all of us with your steadfast love so that we may be filled with gratitude for all the good that he has done for us and for our nation, and may honor his legacy through our lives."" As night fell, well-wishers outside the Pretoria hospital where Mandela lay chanted his name, hung signs of support on bulletin boards and left flowers. ""We wish him well. We are calling on the world to unite and pray for Madiba,"" said 24-year-old Innocentia Moselane. ""He is our icon, and we love him."" During his 27 years behind bars for fighting apartheid, Mandela became a rallying symbol for those fighting South Africa's white-minority rule at home and abroad. His release in 1990 was the beginning of the end of apartheid, the system of legalized racial segregation the South African government enforced for more than 45 years. ""He is our hero. He is my mentor, my father. He is everything to me,"" 36-year-old Kuda Nyahumzvi told CNN outside the hospital. ""But when it is his time, we wish his soul could just rest. He spent so long in jail and struggling."" While crowds of supporters appeared to have gone home by early Wednesday morning, the South African Press Association reported, scores of journalists remained outside the Medi-Clinic Heart Hospital in Pretoria. Mandela's wife, Graca Machel, spends every night at the hospital, where the former president has been since June 8 for a recurring lung infection. Previously, authorities had described his condition as serious but stable. But over the weekend, his health took a turn for the worse, with the South African president's office saying he was in critical condition. ""The doctors are doing everything possible to ensure his well-being and comfort,"" President Jacob Zuma told the nation Monday. When the country held its first multiracial elections in 1994, Mandela became the South Africa's first black president. He stepped down in 1999 after serving a single term. Though he continued to be a voice on the world stage for developing nations, human rights and the fight against AIDS after leaving office, Mandela, 94, has been sidelined by advancing age and bouts of illness in recent years. He last appeared in public in 2010. Journalist Hamilton Wende and CNN's Matt Smith and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: Cape Town's archbishop leads Mandela's family in prayer .

"(CNN) -- What's the one thing you would tell girls about education? Think carefully about your answer; after all, it can be the most important factor in lifting a girl from poverty, mistreatment and drudgery into a fulfilling and rewarding life, for both her and her family. This is the question we asked people from around the world to share with us as part of the premiere of CNN Films' ""Girl Rising,"" airing in June, which follows remarkable young girls from Peru to Afghanistan in their brave quest for an education. CNN received dozens of responses, many from people sharing moving personal stories of their own struggles or those of mothers and grandmothers who had sacrificed so much so that future generations of girls would grow up enriched by knowledge. 'Never stop trying' In a small town called Sivakasi in southern India, poverty and hardship meant many young girls would trudge every morning not to school but to work in the city's matchmaking and firework industries. Meera Vijayann, who is from Sivakasi but who studied and now lives in Bangalore, was all too aware of these girls and the life that lay ahead of them. But she was determined to fight for her education, eventually succeeding in becoming a writer and nongovernmental organization worker. ""Today, I feel proud that I had proved all those people wrong, despite coming from a small town where so many girls still face hardships in accessing a proper education,"" the 26-year-old said. She says that from an early age, she knew she wanted more for her life, even though people made fun of her for wanting simply the freedom to choose. And she wants girls around the world to know that there is nothing to fear about wanting to learn. ""My message to girls around the world is to accept education but embrace knowledge. Always be open to learning, even when away from the classroom."" Only then, she says, does a world of opportunity open up. ""Never, no matter how hard, stop trying."" Choose your own destiny . Mexican Irene Moreno Jimenez said her thirst for knowledge was inspired by her mother, who died of cancer when Jimenez was 17 but who always instilled in her daughters a sense of purpose. ""I have (the) freedom to choose my own destiny all because of her teachings,"" she said. The 27-year-old now works in Washington as a communications consultant for a development bank, a job helping others in honor of her mother, who she says was a brave, generous and ""visionary"" leader who worked as a professor but gave her daughters lessons in life impossible to study through books. ""She set the highest example on how to live and love for my sister and me,"" she said. Despite losing her several years ago, Jimenez says, her mother lives on through her daughters' love of education and desire for other girls to know that the mind is a place where freedom is fought for -- and won. ""When you have education, you are free to think and to accomplish your thoughts,"" she said. ""You are able to see possibilities where before there were walls. I have learned that you can lose it all, but you will never lose what's in your mind."" 'Make your dreams come true' A mother's inspiration was all Niena Sevilla from the Philippines needed to put her on the right path. Unable to attend high school due to poverty, her mother fought every step of the way to succeed. ""She had to plead for my grandfather's approval to let her go to the city so she could work and study later,"" the administrative assistant said. ""At the age of 13, she worked at a gasoline station in our town, 30 minutes away from the farm. She had worked as a housekeeper and as a cook as well."" Through sheer determination and persistence, her mother managed to save precious funds for a vocational course in tailoring before opening a successful shop in her hometown. Sevilla, like many Filipinos, works thousands of miles from her own children. She works in Saudi Arabia to bring in an income for their future. But she says her mother's struggles inspired her to instill in her own children a sense that education is not just about what degree you hold but the work you put in to achieve your goals. She wants other girls to feel the same. ""Knowing my mother's story makes me believe that education is not about holding a master's degree or college degree; it is about how you make your dreams come, regardless of what kind of education you have attained,"" she said. 'Strive hard' As a proud father to 12-year-old Beatrice, Filipino salesman Rummel Pinera feels all too keenly that educating a girl is about ensuring her independence and improving society as a whole. Beatrice, now a second-year high school student, inspired her father to hope that a solid education will provide her with a stable career and a chance to contribute to ""the betterment of her village and society in general."" ""Girls and women all over the world must strive hard to go to schools and finish their studies,"" he said, ""because education would surely unlock their full potential of becoming achievers in their chosen vocations, careers and professions. ""An educated woman will surely contribute to the well-being of this planet and to overall human progress."" 'Follow your heart' But sometimes it's the simplest advice that is the most heartfelt and the most wise. Andrea Barr is training to be an elementary school teacher at Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois. The 19-year-old also works at a summer camp in the area, teaching swimming and helps counsel young children, too. Despite her love of children, and of teaching, she faced pressure from family and friends over her career and life choices. Undeterred, she enrolled at Bradley and fought to make her own way. Her struggles to choose her own path in life inspired her to provide a simple message for girls: ""Follow your heart."" ""Do not allow anyone to tell you what you can and cannot do,"" she said. ""Do what you like, because that, in the end, will make you most happy. You are the sum of the choices you make."" What do you think? Share your thoughts at iReport or the comments below .

"(CNN) -- For many girls in Afghanistan, the simple act of walking to school can be a life-threatening journey. ""You close the door behind you, and you enter a war zone,"" said Nushin Arbabzadah, an American-based author and scholar who was raised in Afghanistan. There were at least 185 documented attacks on schools and hospitals in Afghanistan last year, according to the United Nations, and the majority of those attacks were attributed to armed groups opposed to educating females. But ""the walk from home to school is -- and has always been -- the most dangerous part,"" Arbabzadah said. ""You are told to stay covered, keep your head down and walk quickly ... and stare at your toes."" The life of a schoolgirl in Afghanistan is a far cry from reading, writing and arithmetic. Some girls have been maimed by acid attacks. Others have had their drinking water poisoned or been targeted by bombers who think females should be forbidden from school -- as they were during the Taliban's rule. ""It is unfathomable that anyone would want to hurt them. But that is the reality,"" said Beth Murphy, a documentary filmmaker who recently traveled to Afghanistan to work on a feature film about girls' education. Amid the violence, however, there is promise: In a country where just 6% of women 25 and older have received any formal education, millions of girls are at long last enrolling in school. Ten years ago, fewer than a million Afghan children attended school, according to UNICEF. Today, more than 8.2 million children are going to schools like the one founded by Razia Jan, one of the Top 10 Heroes of 2012. Jan and her team at the Zabuli Education Center are providing a free education to about 350 girls in rural Afghanistan. ""Most of the (local) men and women are illiterate,"" Jan said. ""Most of our students are the first generation of girls to get educated."" Who should be CNN Hero of the Year? Cast your vote . The obstacles facing Afghan girls are both ""Herculean and heartbreaking,"" Murphy said. While she was filming at one school, there was an attack at another school nearby that killed 100 children. That very same day, Murphy watched as young students embraced their opportunities to learn. ""To see these girls walking to school, delighted to be learning and spending time together in the classroom, writing their own names for the first time, reading their first words -- I felt hope for the future,"" Murphy said. ""Not in a naive way but with the realization that if it's working here, it can work other places, too."" Although the violence against Afghan schoolgirls has dominated news headlines recently, reports from humanitarian groups like UNICEF, Oxfam and Save the Children say that a great deal of progress has been made. ""The overall education of girls in Afghanistan is a great success story,"" said Christine Roehrs, spokeswoman for Save the Children in Afghanistan. ""Basically, you didn't have girls educated in 2001. And now we have 3 million girls in school."" Roehrs says there's still much work to be done, however, because there are approximately 4 million children in Afghanistan -- most of them girls -- who are not enrolled in school. One major area of focus is the number of female teachers. ""In Afghan culture, parents don't consider it appropriate for girls to be educated by a man,"" Roehrs said. ""There is a high dropout rate of young girls after the early grades because there are not enough female teachers. So the secret of getting and keeping girls in school is to get more female teachers."" Only 31% of all teachers in Afghanistan are female, Roehrs said, and a disproportionate amount of those women are in urban areas. The lack of infrastructure in rural areas also makes it even more difficult for girls to get an education there. ""There are 400 rural districts. In 200 of them, there are no female teachers or girls' schools,"" Roehrs said. ""When I am talking to parents, they are favorable to girls' education. But the schools and teachers need to be close and safe."" To improve those rural numbers, Save the Children has implemented high school training programs so girls can become teachers right after graduation. Another obstacle to girls' education is early marriage. The legal age for marriage is 16 in Afghanistan, but there have been many reports about girls being forced to marry well before that. Murphy and her production crew met a 12-year-old student named Khudija whose marriage had been arranged by her brother, the oldest man in her family. ""The way kids in America might trade baseball cards on the playground, these boys traded their sisters: 'My sister will marry you; your sister will marry me,' "" Murphy said. ""Now it is Khudija's fiance and her fiance's father who dictate her life. ""Among the first decrees: No more school."" Knowing this is often the case, Jan goes to the homes of some of her young students and asks for permission to delay marriage. In some cases, she's had success. In others, she has seen students forced to withdraw from school. ""My heart breaks for them,"" Jan said. ""Hopefully, things will change. Many fathers and grandfathers are proud to see their girls learning, so there are positive signs."" Still, across an already greatly divided country, old gender biases are hard to undo. ""You can have these huge kinds of variations and attitudes about education within the same family,"" Arbabzadah said. ""I met a young female math teacher whose own family was split greatly on the topics of education. She told me her own cousin was very proud that he never sent his daughters to school. He thought it was the worst thing you could do."" In some cases, physical and emotional abuse keep girls out of the classroom. Many young women are accustomed to being hit and working as virtual slaves at home. Jan recalls asking a young student a question and seeing the child put her hand in front of her face, afraid she would be struck. ""She and her sister had burn marks and scars on their bodies,"" said Jan, who stepped in to provide clothes and food for the children and threaten the girl's aunt with arrest. According to the U.N., violence against women has been persistent in Afghanistan due to women's low status and the country's long exposure to hostilities and conflict. Gender discrimination can also be traced to a combination of factors, including poverty, local tradition and the effects of war. But female students still have high aspirations. In a recent Oxfam survey (PDF), more than 70% of the girls interviewed said they want to continue their education. ""Once they enter the classroom, they are so involved being a student and trying to learn as much as they can,"" Jan said. ""They want to learn. They want to get educated."" Advocates like Jan and Save the Children agree that if true change is to come in Afghanistan, it's crucial to educate this next generation. Afghanistan has one the highest proportions of school-age children in the world: About one-fifth Afghans are between the ages of 7 and 12. Roehrs said that 57% of all Afghans are children. ""They form the future Afghanistan that some in the international community are afraid of and others might want to ignore,"" she said. ""But it is paramount to look at these children and get the best education for them. ""These children are the Afghanistan we are looking at in 10 or 15 years.""","Millions of Afghan girls are now getting the education that their mothers couldn't .
But as a result, the girls and their schools are often targets for violent attacks .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- About 200 Kurdish demonstrators marched up a narrow Istanbul street behind a large banner that said ""political prisoners are our pride, we will not stay silent over the deaths in prison."" The group's organizers were expecting trouble. They were marching on Tuesday without a government permit. Barely 200 yards up the road, the crowd encountered a squad of armored Turkish riot police and a big police vehicle blocking the road. Without any verbal warning, the vehicle lurched forward and unleashed its water cannon on the crowd. The demonstrators huddled behind their banner for a moment, until riot police unleashed a volley of tear gas canisters into the crowd. As stinging, acrid smoke engulfed the neighborhood, the middle-aged Kurdish demonstrators quickly gave way to masked youths hurling stones and fireworks at the police. Tuesday marked the second time in two days Turkish riot police used force against unsanctioned gatherings of political groups challenging the government. On Monday, security forces in Ankara used pepper spray and water cannons to disperse secularist groups trying to hold a rally celebrating the anniversary of the foundation of the Turkish republic. Participants gathered in defiance of a government ban. The next day, Turkey's chief prosecutor announced he was launching an investigation into the secularist gathering. The crackdown during Republic Day in Ankara highlighted how powerless Turkey's once dominant secular establishment has become. It has also led to accusations by long-time supporters in Turkish newspapers that Turkey's Islamist-rooted prime minister is adopting the same authoritarian tactics of the secularist ancient regime. Tuesday's Kurdish clashes reflect a different power struggle. The riots in Istanbul and other Turkish cities mark yet another day in a bloody 30-year cycle of violence between the Turkish state and the Kurds. It is Turkey's oldest and deadliest ethnic conflict, one that has claimed more than 30,000 lives. The conflict developed a disturbing new dynamic in recent weeks as a mass hunger strike has spread through the Turkish penal system. According to the Turkish government statistics, at least 680 Kurdish prisoners are now starving themselves, some for nearly 50 days. ""They want two things,"" said Gulcin Isbert, a member of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), which is Turkey's largest and best-organized Kurdish nationalist party. ""The right to education and defense in court in their native language, and for the leader of the Kurds, Abdullah Ocalan, to have health, security and freedom."" For decades, the Kurdish language was banned in Turkey despite the fact the Kurds make up the country's largest ethnic minority. Those restrictions have been relaxed over the past decade by the government of prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, which introduced a state Kurdish-language television station. But Kurdish partisans want to expand those linguistic freedoms. The demand for the release of Ocalan is much more problematic. He is the founder of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, a group that Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union label as a 'terrorist organization.' Though Ocalan has spent more than a decade imprisoned on a Turkish island in the Marmara Sea, the guerilla war he began against the Turkish state continues to be fought. Last month, the nonprofit conflict mediation organization International Crisis Group published a report arguing Turkey's PKK conflict had reached its deadliest levels in some 13 years, with more than 700 people killed during a 14 month period. Last weekend, Turkey's semiofficial Anatolian Agency reported a police officer was killed in an apparent rebel attack in southeastern Turkey, the main battle ground in the conflict. The ICG report also cited Turkish Ministry of Justice statistics indicating Kurds have been targets of a massive wave of detentions, with more than 7,000 prisoners accused of PKK links thrown behind bars over the past several years. The parents of some of those prisoners were in a tent in a park in Istanbul's Okmeydani neighborhood Tuesday morning, staging a sit-in to support their children on hunger strike. Women in Kurdish head-scarves sat on carpets, some of them decorated with traditional facial tattoos, swaying and singing folks songs in Kurdish. ""Of course we are worried,"" said Feride Akdogan, whose 26-year old daughter Sehnaz had been on hunger strike for the past 15 days. Asked whether it was worth losing her daughter to improve prison conditions for PKK-leader Ocalan, Akdogan said simply ""thousands of our people have thrown themselves on the fire for our leader."" Ebu Bekir Polat and his wife, Behiye, were participating in the sit-in for their daughter Ciyan. She was arrested two and a half years ago at the age of 18, Polat said, and accused of membership in a terrorist organization, though she had yet to be convicted in court. ""No one has the right to make our kids rot in jail like this for two and a half years,"" Polat said. He insisted the hunger strikers were staging their potentially lethal protest in the interest of peace. ""These kids have given their bodies to the fire of hunger ... not just for the Kurdish people, but for the future of Turkey. So that this war can end, so that neither soldiers, police or guerillas in the mountains die,"" Polat added. Last week, Turkey's Justice Minister made a televised appeal to prisoners to stop their hunger strike. ""Reform and change, work on expanding freedoms is ongoing,"" Sadullah Ergin said during a visit to a prison in Ankara. ""For your bodies, for your health, for the family members who love you ... stop this action."" But on Tuesday, riot police in Istanbul had little sympathy for relatives of the prisoners. As squads of riot police and armored cars chased stone-throwing Kurds through the streets of Okmeydani, a police vehicle rounded a corner and started firing its water cannon at the tent where at least 20 mostly middle aged Kurdish women sat on carpets. A lawyer for the Kurds rushed forward, arguing that the sit-in by the Kurdish mothers was peaceful and had nothing to do with the nearby street clashes. ""They are throwing Molotov cocktails at us,"" a police commander answered. ""They can have 15 minutes to leave the area."" But less than five minutes later, armored police officers began ripping down the tent. Another officer popped open a tear gas canister and tossed it into the tent, at the feet of the increasingly panicked women inside. As women stumbled to their feet half-blind trying to escape, a Kurdish man kicked the canister out of the tent. A police officer in a suit and gas mask then picked it up and threw it back into the tent. ""Get the mothers! Get the mothers out of there!"" yelled a silver-haired Kurdish man named Ali Riza Bilgili, as he struggled to help a woman out of the tent. A half dozen police officers in helmets and gas masks then worked together to rip down one of the metal ribs holding up the tent. ""Enough!"" another Kurdish man screamed. ""What has this woman done wrong? You're only doing this because I don't have a gun."" Moments later, the police withdrew. Reinforcements were arriving in the neighborhood. But the protests were also growing. A kilometer away, young Kurdish men momentarily blocked a major commercial road...intimidating drivers by laying rocks on the pavement. Turkey's Kurdish conflict is still very far from over.","Tuesday is the second time in two days Turkish riot police used force against protesters .

"(CNN) -- High in the hills between Ramallah and Nablus in the West Bank sits a huge construction site its developers hope will transform the lives of Palestinians for generations to come. Rawabi is the first planned city of its kind and is not short on ambition. The renderings for the $1 billion development show many shiny amenities that might seem out of place in an area that has a per capita income of $1,610. The vision for the project that began construction in January 2010 includes homes for 40,000 residents, a park, a 20,000-seat amphitheater, a convention center and a theater. Bashar Masri, the Nablus-born, American-educated entrepreneur behind the project, is going well beyond the traditional call of duty for a private developer. He is negotiating with international companies to ensure there are jobs ready for the city's inhabitants, and is even building the waste water treatment plants, the water reservoirs and three public schools. ""We were shocked when we realized we'd have to build the schools,"" he says. ""That is something I didn't plan for. We appealed to the Palestinian government to come in and assist us with at least that, but unfortunately, they're broke and have other priorities."" Read more: Demand for British butlers in the Middle East . Masri's investment is both emotional and financial. For him, Rawabi is not just a housing development but an economic lifeline for the people in the Palestinian territory. The project, which employs 5,000 Palestinians, is already the West Bank's single biggest private sector employer. When the first tenants move in, ideally in January, he hopes the city will provide a further 1,500 jobs. ""If you created 10 projects like this, you'd create a huge difference in the Palestinian economy,"" he says. The project is also his grassroots attempt at nation-building. A strong Palestinian economy, he argues, could one day be the answer to a fully independent Palestine. According to Mark Regev, the spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the project has support on both sides of the green line. ""It's not a zero-sum game,"" he says. ""If the Palestinians have a better economy and a healthier political system, and life is better for Palestine, then life is better for us as well. It's crucial that you augment the peace process with tangible economic steps, and Rawabi is definitely a tangible step that we support."" While Masri acknowledges that Rawabi does not represent the answer to all the problems facing a peace settlement, saying he ""didn't design it thinking Israel and Palestine would kiss and be happy,"" he does harbor hopes that economic development will play a favorable role. ""In signing a peace agreement, there are concessions to be made, and if people are happy with their lives, they will be more supportive of making those concessions and getting their leaders to sign the dotted line,"" he says.

""Even if it got constructed and filled to capacity and became a thriving city, it will not change the underlying geo-political realities where Palestine is divided between two different governments, or address the settlements, which remain the biggest hurdle,"" says Kamran Bokhari, the vice president of Middle Eastern and South Asian affairs for Stratfor, a global intelligence company. Bokhari also questions whether the Palestinian economy is strong enough to fill the units, the first 700 of which went on sale last month. Though more affordable than other West Bank properties, at $60,000 to $170,000, their price tag is aimed at the middle class. ""The Palestinian economy is in shambles. It does not have too many indigenous sources of revenue,"" Bokhari says. Masri, however, says he's already sold 90% of the listed units. ""We're selling units as fast as we can process them right now, which is a great problem to have."" Read more: Stunning photos of Dubai from above the clouds . One feature that makes the apartments both popular and difficult to process is the financing options available. The West Bank doesn't have a traditional mortgage system in place; often, accommodation is paid for up front, in cash. In 2010, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the International Finance Corporation set up a $500 million mortgage fund that has revolutionized the Palestinian property market. ""I'd say 99% of buyers at Rawabi wouldn't be able to afford it without financing,"" says Masri. ""It's a process you're used to in the U.S., but it's new to us, and takes four to five hours to go through an application."" However there remains the worry that buying -- let alone developing -- a property in the West Bank is a risky investment. ""Let's say some sort of strike begins in the West Bank, or there's spillover from Syria and Israeli authorities have to crack down. This kind of project will obviously be vulnerable,"" says Bokhari. ""The people funding this project will hit the brakes."" Masri acknowledges that Rawabi would be in trouble under such an occurrence, though it is not something that seems to cause him much distress. ""A little downtrend in politics will hurt Rawabi, but never destroy Rawabi,"" he says. ""It may delay it another year, or two, or five, but it will never kill the idea.""","Rawabi is the largest privately-funded development project in Palestinian history .
The finished project will include homes for 40,000 residents, a convention center and three schools .

"(CNN) -- After a prolonged courtship with Seattle, the Sacramento Kings are officially staying put. About two weeks after rejecting a sales bid that would have had the team moving 750 miles north to Washington state, the NBA board of governors on Tuesday approved the Kings' sale to a local ownership group helmed by Vivek Ranadive. The vote was unanimous, the NBA said in a news release, and ""the transaction is expected to close shortly."" Terms of the deal were not released. ""Thanks to entire NBA for approving sale of Kings to our organization,"" tweeted Ranadive, the founder and CEO of TIBCO Software in Palo Alto, California. ""It is an honor & a privilege to be part of such an amazing community."" The Maloof family -- known for ownership of properties in Las Vegas, such as the Palms, among other business ventures -- has been trying for months to unload its majority owner stakes in the pro basketball franchise. The family members have on multiple occasions reached apparent deals to sell the team to a Seattle-based group, including investor Chris Hansen and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, only to be rebuffed by other NBA executives. In January, these two parties reached a deal for that group to buy the Maloofs' 53% share of the team as well as minority owner Bob Hernreich's 12% stake. But the board of governors never signed off. The Maloof family and Hansen's group, though, kept on talking, leading to another deal for a higher price and a vote earlier this month by the NBA board. Public officials in Sacramento, meanwhile, never gave up on their efforts to keep the team. Led by Mayor Kevin Johnson, who is a former all-star NBA guard, they worked on a stadium plan and collaborated with a group led by Ranadive that was intent on keeping the team in northern California. On May 15, the 22 members of the league's board of governors rejected the Kings' relocation bid, while eight voted in favor. After that vote, Commissioner David Stern cited the existence of a ""strong ownership group,"" a construction team and a plan for a new arena, plus strong support from officials and residents in the Sacramento area. Johnson celebrated that day, and again on Tuesday. Congrats to @Vivek & the new ownership group!"" the mayor wrote on Twitter.

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Authorities increased security around a Pretoria hospital where former South African leader Nelson Mandela remained in intensive care, three days after being rushed there with a recurring lung infection. Police set up gates and fences around entrances to the facility Tuesday, closely checking vehicles trying to gain access. The increasingly frail Mandela was taken to a hospital in Pretoria on Saturday. Later in the day, the South African president's office said the 94-year-old former leader was in a ""serious but stable condition."" He was breathing on his own and his wife was by his side, the office said at the time. The government said Tuesday that Mandela's condition remained unchanged. President Jacob Zuma visited Mandela late Monday and was satisfied with the medical care he was receiving. ""Yesterday I met the team of doctors who are treating him,"" Zuma told a reporter. ""They gave me a very thorough briefing and really I was very confident that they know what they are doing and they are doing a good job. Whilst it is very serious, he is stabilized. And we are all praying for him to recuperate quickly."" Meanwhile, Mandela's daughter Zenani Dlamini, who is the South African ambassador to Argentina, has flown back to South Africa to be with her father. African National Congress lawmaker and Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie, also visited him Monday. Mandela has been in and out of hospitals in recent years. Each episode has sparked renewed concerns.

"(CNN) -- Australian Daniel Ricciardo has landed a drive with all-conquering Red Bull for the 2014 season, the team said Monday. The 24-year-old, who is currently with Red Bull's sister team Torro Rosso, will replace his compatriot Mark Webber, who is quitting F1 to race sportscars. The announcement ends speculation that former world champion Kimi Raikkonen would be leaving Lotus for the reigning constructors' champions. Red Bull team chief Christian Horner said he was delighted that Ricciardo would be teaming up with three-time defending champion Sebastian Vettel. ""He's a very talented youngster, he's committed, he's got a great attitude and in the end it was a very logical choice for us to choose Daniel,"" he said in a statement. ""He's got all the attributes that are required to drive for our team: he's got a great natural ability, he's a good personality and a great guy to work with. ""Daniel knows what the team expects from him; he'll learn quickly and it's very much a medium to long term view that we're taking in developing him."" Ricciardo has been groomed by Red Bull since joining Torro Rosso, claiming 21 points from 41 Grand Prix races. He started in F1 with the HRT team in 2011. Ricciardo is following in the illustrious footsteps of Germany's Vettel, who also learned his trade with Torro Rosso before joining Red Bull in 2009. The announcement comes ahead of this weekend's Italian Grand Prix, with Vettel again holding a commanding advantage over Fernando Alonso of Ferrari in this year's title race.","Daniel Ricciardo lands coveted drive with Red Bull for next season .

"(CNN) -- Talk about eerie. One of two recent UFO sightings in China occurred almost on the 63rd anniversary of news that a ""flying disc"" had been found in Roswell, New Mexico. And like in 1947, people either choose to believe or be skeptical that visitors have stopped by from outer space. Nothing has officially been ruled in or out by Chinese officials, who are looking into whether the objects were private or military aircraft, rocket flares, reflection in the sky or something else. The first sighting occurred at Hangzhou's Xiaoshan Airport, in the eastern part of the country, according to the state-controlled Xinhua news agency. Eighteen flights were delayed or rerouted and operations shut down after twinkling lights were spotted above the terminal around 9 p.m. July 7, the agency said. According to Xinhua, speculation has centered on a private aircraft. The state-run China Daily quoted a source saying the object had a military connection. ""No conclusion has yet been drawn,"" said Wang Jian, head of air traffic control with Zhejiang branch of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, and the investigation continues. Purported photos of the unworldly object have appeared online and on YouTube. Meanwhile, The Shanghai Daily reported a UFO appeared above the city of Chongqing on Thursday. Witnesses said four ""lantern-like objects forming a diamond shape"" hovered for an hour above a park. ""I stared at it and it did not move,"" one resident told the newspaper. ""After hovering for an hour, the thing started to fly higher and finally out of people's sight."" UFO sightings around the world are common, but a little rarer in China. The International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico, educates visitors, conducts research and receives sighting reports. Its website summarizes the Roswell incident, which came to light July 8, 1947. ""Once it became public, the event known as The Roswell Incident, the crash of an alleged flying saucer, the recovery of debris and bodies and the ensuing cover up by the military was of such magnitude and so shrouded in mystery, that 60 years later there are still more questions than answers."" The U.S. government has long contended that no aliens or spaceships were found. Mark Briscoe, library director for the museum, said the center looks for credibility whenever it records UFO reports, including a documented date, time and location. He sees many photos, and an outside researcher provides information. ""You can tell some of them are a little different. A little off,"" Briscoe said of some UFO submissions. But he recently recorded 300 he found to be credible. He said one of the photos circulating about the Chinese airport could be legitimate, but he had not seen the others. The blog Forgetomori weighed in on Internet and news media images purporting to be from Xiaoshan Airport. ""All of these other photos, with the exception of a single one, are also simply long-exposure photos of aircrafts, but in this case, helicopters,"" the blog says. ""Not only that, they have nothing to do with China and were published on the web long ago."" CNN's Helena Hong and Journalist Annie Tai contributed to this article.","Two UFO sightings were recently reported in eastern China .

"(CNN) -- At the end of life or in critical care situations, it's common for doctors to use terms that may sound vague to friends and family members. Former South African President Nelson Mandela, 94, remained in critical but stable condition Monday, suffering from a recurrent lung infection. He's been hospitalized since June 8 in Pretoria, South Africa. His condition worsened last week, according to family members who described his health as ""delicate"" and said ""anything is imminent."" His daughter Zindzi Mandela told ITV, however, that her father is alert and recognizes when a new person enters his room. Here are some terms likely to be used in such situations -- as defined by Dr. Darlene Nelson, a pulmonary and critical care specialist at the Mayo Clinic: . Aware: To be conscious or ""awake,"" to understand what is going on around you. Responsive: The ability to react (or respond) to a stimulus (pain, for example). Serious condition: No specific definition but generally means the patient is acutely ill and the outcome is questionable. Critical condition: Once again, no specific definition, but generally means that the patient's vital signs are not stable. The patient is often in an intensive care unit, and death may be imminent. Life support: Any technique used to maintain life after one or more vital organs fail. This can be secondary to many causes, such as trauma, infection, cancer or other chronic disease. Some examples are dialysis, mechanical ventilation, certain intravenous medications and nutritional support. South Africa: Following Nelson Mandela . Intubated: It means a patient has a breathing tube in his or her windpipe (trachea) either to protect the airway (during trauma) or help the patient breathe. If patients need assistance in breathing, they are often connected to a mechanical ventilator. Ventilator: A machine that supports breathing. Resuscitation: This term is generally used as part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR. CPR is the lifesaving technique used when someone's heart has stopped beating or the person has stopped breathing. It generally involves chest compressions, assistance with breathing and often medication to help support blood flow to organs. Advance directive: Written instructions regarding your personal medical care preferences. These can include a living will, a designation of your medical power of attorney (or decision maker) and your preference regarding resuscitation (e.g., DNR or do not resuscitate). These are used when patients are unable to make their own health care decisions. Living will: A written legal document that details the types of medical treatments and life-sustaining measures that a patient would want or doesn't want. It usually includes instructions regarding mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes and resuscitation. TEDMED: 'Grace' at the end of life . Coma: A state of prolonged unconsciousness that can be caused by a variety of problems (such as injury, stroke, drug or alcohol intoxication, infection, brain tumor, severe illness). Patients during this time are not aware of their environment, and they are not able to be aroused. (This state is different from a persistent vegetative state, where they can be ""aroused."") Persistent vegetative state: A patient in this state can have a state of ""wakefulness,"" but they are not ""aware."" It is usually secondary to a significant brain injury from prolonged lack of oxygen to the brain. It can be seen as a person transitions between coma and recovery or between coma and death. In this state, a person has no awareness of self, the environment or ability to interact with the environment. There are no voluntary movements and no evidence of language comprehension or expression. Patients can have periods of sleeping and wakefulness. It can become a permanent state. Brain-dead: A patient is brain-dead when all brain and brain stem functions permanently cease. The patient cannot breathe on his or her own. Once the patient is declared brain-dead, the person is legally dead. Brain stem: A part of the brain that controls heartbeat and respiration.

"(CNN) -- Angry supporters of the Syrian president rallied Saturday night at embassies and consulates of countries that voted hours earlier to suspend Syria's membership in the Arab League, anti-government activists said. Videos posted on YouTube purportedly showed several of the events. One from Damascus shows a large crowd of people chanting as they gathered outside Saudi Arabia's embassy in Damascus. Another, from Aleppo, shows angry backers of President Bashar al-Assad yelling as they appear to break through barriers at the Turkish consulate. Some demonstrators are seen taking a Turkish flag, which previously hung over the consulate, and burning it. Neither YouTube video showed any evident violence. Anti-government activists tell CNN that supporters of the Syrian regime also attacked the Turkish and French consulates in Latakia. CNN could not independently confirm the accounts because Syria has not granted international media access to the country. The developments came after 18 of the Arab League's 22 members voted to punish Syria in an emergency session at its headquarters. The move to suspend Damascus' membership in the alliance -- a stinging blow to al-Assad -- takes effect Wednesday. Only two member nations -- Lebanon and Yemen -- voted against the measure. Iraq abstained and Syria was barred from voting. Why did Arab League move on Syria? The league also called for sanctions against al-Assad's regime, but did not specify what those may include. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim read the league's decisions at a news conference after the meeting of the foreign ministers. The league called on member states to withdraw their ambassadors from Damascus, a decision that will be left up to each nation. And perhaps most surprising of all, the league urged the Syrian army to stop attacks on civilians and said that it will hold a meeting with opposition groups in the next three days to discuss a transitional phase in Syria's future. The Syrian National Council, a leading opposition group, welcomed the league's decision, calling it ""a step in the right direction, and a clear condemnation of the Syrian regime."" ""The National Council emphasizes its readiness to participate in discussions regarding the transitional period within the scope of the Arab League, to ensure the stepping down of Bashar Al-Assad and the transition to a democratic government that represents the Syrian people and does not (include) anyone from the regime whose hands have been tainted with blood,"" it said in a statement. The fact that the league, the formal family of Arab states, took such a bold step against a nation that prides itself as the beating heart of Arabism, is a major development, said Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Centre at the London School of Economics. ""Syria is now as isolated as ever,"" Gerges said. ""I would call it a game-changer."" The Arab League's stated purpose is to strengthen ties among its member nations, coordinate their policies and promote common interests. But the divisions among the 22 nations have diminished its effectiveness. In the case of Syria, however, the league's decision could open the door for broader international sanctions against the al-Assad regime. The punitive measures come after al-Assad's failure to abide by an Arab League proposal earlier this month to halt all violence, release detainees, withdraw armed elements from populated areas and allow unfettered access to the nation by journalists and Arab League monitors. But none of that has happened, according to daily reports streaming out of Syria. There have been reports of civilian deaths in the last few days and Saturday was no exception. The Local Coordination Committees, a network of opposition groups, reported 21 people dead, including 10 in Homs, the restive city that has emerged as the epicenter of the uprising. With pressure on Syria ratcheted up, some fear an escalation of brutality in the next few days. Syria's representative to the league, Yousef Ahmad, blasted the alliance's decision as illegal. He said it was ""a eulogy for Arab common action and a blatant announcement that its administration is subordinate to U.S.-Western agendas,"" according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency. Earlier Ahmad had reiterated the government's claim that terrorist gangs were behind the violence and said Syria ""made strides"" in quelling the violence ""despite armed groups' attempts to foil the plan since it was announced."" Western leaders welcomed Saturday's decision. ""After the al-Assad regime flagrantly failed to keep its commitments, the Arab League has demonstrated leadership in its effort to end the crisis and hold the Syrian government accountable,"" said U.S. President Barack Obama. ""These significant steps expose the increasing diplomatic isolation of a regime that has systematically violated human rights and repressed peaceful protests,"" he said in a statement. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton echoed those comments, calling the action ""strong and historic."" ""The United States commends the principled stand taken by the Arab League and supports full implementation of its efforts to bring a peaceful end to the crisis,"" Clinton said in a statement. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said the league's actions show ""that it is time to increase pressure on the Syrian regime."" Human rights activists have been pushing for weeks for the United Nations to take action and Amnesty International said Saturday that the Arab League's decision should pave the way for the Security Council. ""Now that the Arab League has taken decisive action, it is time for the U.N. Security Council to finally step up to the plate and deliver an effective international response to Syria's human rights crisis,"" said Philip Luther, the monitoring group's Middle East and North Africa director. Human Rights Watch has also urged the Security Council to impose sanctions. It published a damning 63-page report Friday, based on interviews with victims and witnesses in Homs, that said al-Assad's regime's ""systematic"" crackdown on civilians amounted to crimes against humanity. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said earlier this week that more than 3,500 people have been killed in the brutal suppression of dissent since the Syrian uprising began eight months ago. CNN's Ben Wedeman and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy in Cairo contributed to this report.","NEW: The Syrian National Council cheers the Arab League's decision .

"Washington (CNN) -- The closer Congress gets to voting on whether to back President Barack Obama's call for a military attack on Syria, the more election politics influences the debate. Splits exist on both the left and right, revealing the political calculations of Washington regarding next year's congressional elections and the 2016 presidential vote. While the 2014 contests faced by every House member and a third of the Senate are more proximate, the machinations at work in debating and acting on the Syria issue also are heavily focused on the balloting three years from now to choose Obama's successor. An expected Republican presidential contender, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, on Wednesday demonstrated the art of present and future political messaging in his statement explaining why he voted against a resolution authorizing limited military strikes in response to what he agreed was Syria's use of banned chemical weapons. Rubio blamed the Obama administration for mishandling U.S. reaction to Syria's civil war, with help from Republican isolationists, by failing to strongly back opposition rebels when the conflict erupted in 2011. While he called then for ""a more robust engagement"" to help the Syrian people topple Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, Rubio said, he never advocated the use of U.S. military might in the conflict. ""Had we forcefully engaged in empowering moderate rebels, today we would have more and better options before us,"" he said. ""But instead, unfortunately, the president, with the support of some voices in my own party, chose to let others lead instead. And now we are dealing with the consequences of that inaction."" That stance protected his conservative credentials by asserting military expertise, and also implicitly criticized two potential rivals for the White House in 2016 -- former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. As Obama's top diplomat, Clinton is automatically associated with the administration's response to the Syrian crisis until she stepped down early this year and was succeeded by John Kerry, a veteran Democratic senator. House Dems proving tough sell for Obama on Syria . Clinton, who had pushed for arming the Syrian rebels but was overruled by Obama, is considered the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination if she decides to run, which is widely expected. Her only statement so far on the current Syria question, issued by an aide, backed Obama's decision to seek congressional support for a military response. Meanwhile, the libertarian Paul follows the same non-intervention policies espoused by his father, former GOP Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, who mounted several unsuccessful runs for president. Like Rubio, Rand Paul also voted against the Syria authorization measure at Wednesday's meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which passed it by a 10-7 margin. To distinguish himself from Paul, Rubiov used his statement to directly attack what he called isolationist policies, saying: ""Just because we ignore global problems doesn't mean they will ignore us."" ""Instead, they become bigger and harder to solve, and sadly, Syria is just the latest example of that fundamental truth,"" Rubio said. Another leading conservative voice, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, adopted a similar stance to Rubio on Thursday, even though he had called for possible air strikes on Syria in March 2012 when he was seeking the Republican presidential nomination. ""Had President Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acted then in support of pro-democracy forces when that rebellion was taking place, we could have removed Assad and helped usher in stability for that country,"" Santorum said in a statement. ""But we have a very different situation today. After nearly two years, 100,000 people killed, a rebel force comprised of al Qaeda and a Syrian regime in a much stronger position, a military strike would no longer be in our national security interest."" The positions of Rubio and Santorum follow a game plan laid out this week by Republican strategist Alex Castellanos, a CNN contributor, that called for GOP legislators to reject Obama's push for congressional authorization to attack Syria. Though Obama ""has told the country he has the power to intercede in Syria, he would like to make Congress 'President for a Day' so members can share his responsibility,"" Castellanos wrote in an opinion piece this week. ""Should Syria turn into a car wreck that lasts for years and further destabilizes what Obama's weakness has wrought in the Middle East, the president would prefer to be one of 536 decision-makers,"" he added, imploring House Republicans to block any vote on authorization. The big debate: Should U.S. strike Syria? Obama wants to punish al-Assad for what the United States calls a major chemical weapons attack on August 21 that killed more than 1,400 people in suburban Damascus. He argues a failure to act puts at risk the credibility of international treaties banning weapons of mass destruction, which would represent a threat to the world. Lacking international backing so far, the president is seeking congressional backing despite his insistence he has the power to order attacks based on national security interests. However, support in Congress for a resolution authorizing limited military strikes -- expected to be missiles launched from Navy ships -- appears tenuous at this point despite intense lobbying by the president and top officials including Kerry. Passage by the Democratic-led Senate is more likely than in the Republican-led House, but both parties lack unity on the issue so far. Liberal Democrats who traditionally oppose war in any form reject the idea, as do libertarian Republicans like Paul who say it's none of our business. Among those in the middle from either side, the main questions are whether the limited strikes Obama proposes will work, and if unintended consequences will lead to U.S. involvement in another war halfway around the world after more than a decade of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""We don't know what's going to happen the day after we bomb,"" Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey said Thursday on CNN. The Senate version of the resolution approved by the Foreign Relations Committee sets a 60-day deadline for use of force in Syria, with an option for an additional 30 days. An amendment accepted by the panel from Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Christopher Coons of Delaware added language to say the military response was intended to reverse Assad's battlefield momentum, a stronger objective than had been outlined by administration officials. The resolution also makes clear there would be no U.S. boots on the ground as part of a response in Syria. It now goes to the full Senate for an expected vote next week, when the House also will take up the issue. Interactive: How the House and Senate will vote. A concern for House members and senators facing re-election next year is a primary challenge by a more extreme candidate who could attack them for backing the president's proposed military move. Already, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and veteran GOP Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming face primary races against opponents claiming stronger conservative credentials. Both McConnell and Enzi are undecided on a military response in Syria. With polls showing public opposition to a military attack on Syria, legislators are facing pressure at home. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, acknowledged Thursday that her constituents don't like the resolution. ""Every day I get a report on what the calls are, where the calls are coming from, what the nature of the argument is and there is no question that what is coming in is overwhelmingly negative,"" said Feinstein, who then added that ""they don't know what I know, they haven't heard what I've heard."" A supporter of a military response in Syria who won re-election last year, Feinstein I like to believe now after 20 years I have some skill in separating the wheat from the chaff in this thing."" However, GOP Rep. Matt Salmon of Arizona said he remained unconvinced. ""I agree that there are sometimes that you need to just go out and lead and do what you believe is the right thing to do and hope that you can convince the people to follow,"" Salmon told CNN. ""But, right now, I don't think that this administration has provided a very, very winning argument or series of arguments that we should engage in this conflict.""

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, held what each man described Friday as a ""constructive"" talk about Syria, though there's no indication it produced any breakthrough consensus. What began as small talk after Putin approached Obama led to the two pulling up chairs in the corner of the room and talking almost entirely about Syria for 20 to 30 minutes, as other leaders watched, a senior Obama administration official said. Afterward, Obama described the exchange on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Russia as ""candid"" -- but acknowledged that Putin was unlikely to support his call for military action against Syria. Putin gave reporters a similar account, adding, ""He doesn't agree with me, I don't agree with him, but we listened to each other."" Both leaders said they could work together to seek a political solution to the Syrian crisis. The two men hold opposing views over whether military action should be taken against the Syrian government over its alleged use of chemical weapons against its own people. Obama is seeking to rally domestic and international support for a military strike, while Putin -- an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -- has challenged the assertion that regime forces were behind the alleged chemical weapons attacks. Putin repeated the Syrian government's accusation that ""militants"" used chemical weapons in a bid to get aid and support from ""those countries who support them."" He told reporters that Moscow will continue to provide Syria with arms and humanitarian aid. He and Obama also talked about ways to solve the Syrian crisis peacefully, he said. A statement issued Friday by a bare majority of the G20 -- 11 of its 20 members -- said that ""the evidence clearly points to the Syrian government being responsible for the attack, which is part of a pattern of chemical weapons use by the regime."" ""Those who perpetrated these crimes must be held accountable,"" it said. Obama said he believed most of the leaders at the G20 meeting were ""comfortable with (the) conclusion that the Assad government was responsible"" for using chemical weapons in an attack last month on a Damascus suburb. But he said divisions arose over whether military action against Syria must be authorized by the U.N. Security Council, where Russia has blocked action. Citing Security Council ""paralysis"" on the issue, Obama said countries should be willing to act without the council's authorization. Obama: 'World cannot stand idly by' ""If we are serious about upholding a ban on chemical weapons use, then an international response is required, and that will not come through Security Council action."" But he said he was encouraged by the discussions in St. Petersburg. ""There's a growing recognition that the world cannot stand idly by,"" Obama said. The U.S. president showed emotion as he talked of the gassing on August 21 of what his country estimates was more than 1,400 people in Syria, 400 of them children. ""This is not something we fabricated, this is not something we are using as an excuse for military action. ... I was elected to end wars, not start them,"" he said. ""But we have to make hard choices when we stand up for things we care about."" Putin said the leaders in St. Petersburg were split nearly ""50-50"" over whether to intervene militarily. He said that action against Syria without U.N. Security Council approval would be illegal. Russia and China, which has also opposed military intervention in Syria, have veto power. But that need not rule out action, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters Friday. ""We cannot allow Syria to act with impunity because one or two countries refuse to hold them accountable in the Security Council,"" she said. The Syrian government has said that opposition fighters launched the attack on the outskirts of Damascus. The United Nations has said more than 100,000 people -- including many civilians -- have been killed since a popular uprising spiraled into a civil war in 2011. That toll rose Friday, with the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reporting at least 64 people killed nationwide. Tensions affect some U.S. staff in Lebanon, Turkey . As tensions ratchet up over Syria, the U.S. State Department on Friday ordered the withdrawal of nonessential personnel from the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, and authorized nonemergency staff to leave a consulate in Adana in southern Turkey. ""Given the current tensions in the region, as well as potential threats to U.S. government facilities and personnel, we are taking these steps out of an abundance of caution to protect our employees and their families, and local employees and visitors to our facilities,"" a statement said. Many observers fear that the civil war in Syria, which has become increasingly sectarian in nature, could spill into neighboring countries. The State Department also issued revised travel warnings Friday for Lebanon and Turkey, both of which share a border with Syria. It urges U.S. citizens to ""avoid all travel to Lebanon because of current safety and security concerns"" and to be ""alert to the potential for violence"" if traveling to or living in Turkey. Many in Lebanon worry that the involvement of the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah in Syria's civil war could destabilize their own nation. Lebanon has been shaken by a series of deadly bombings in recent weeks, including a blast in a Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut. Al-Assad warned this week that a regional war could break out if Syria is attacked. ""The Middle East is a powder keg, and the fire is approaching today,"" he told French newspaper Le Figaro in an interview Monday. Obama pushes for congressional action . Obama is seeking congressional approval for possible U.S. military strikes against Syria, although no vote is expected until after lawmakers reconvene from recess on Monday. The president said Friday that he had expected skepticism from the public and from lawmakers. He knew it was going to be ""a heavy lift"" when he announced Saturday that he was putting the proposal before Congress, he said, with some lawmakers foreseeing a ""slippery slope"" toward a prolonged U.S. involvement in Syria. ""For the American people who have been through over a decade of war now, with enormous sacrifice of blood and treasure, any hints of further military entanglement in the Middle East are going to be viewed with suspicion,"" Obama said. ""That suspicion will probably be even stronger in my party than in the Republican Party."" The Syrian parliament has urged the U.S. House not to support the proposed U.S. military action, the country's state news agency, SANA, said Friday. In a letter addressed to U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, his Syrian counterpart, Jihad al-Laham, called upon the House to communicate through civilized dialogue, not blood and fire, the news agency said. He said Islamic extremists have seized and possess chemical weapons, SANA reported. Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor have both backed Obama, but Boehner has said it is up to the White House to get the 217 votes needed to secure his resolution there. According to CNN's count, 109 House members plan to vote ""no,"" while 23 -- including a number of high-profile Republicans -- plan to back it. More than 280 representatives remain undecided. Syria offers rewards . Meanwhile, Syrian authorities are offering rewards, amounting to nearly $4,400, for handing over non-Syrian ""terrorists,"" Syrian state TV said Friday. The Syrian government often refers to rebels as terrorists. Officials offered nearly $1,800 for reports on the whereabouts of these individuals or help leading to their arrest, the state broadcaster said. The identity of those providing information would remain confidential, and they would be provided with protection, state TV said. CNN's Barbara Starr, Jason Hanna, Hamdi Alkhshali and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 64 are killed in Syria on Friday, an opposition group reports .

"(CNN) -- It's no James Bond. But then again, 007 probably couldn't patrol the ocean depths, in disguise, for hours at a time. Meet Cyro, the robotic jellyfish. Designed by a team of researchers at Virginia Tech's College of Engineering, the robot is 5 feet, 7 inches wide and weighs 170 pounds but is stealthy enough to one day be used as an underwater spy for the military. Cyro is part of a nationwide, multi-university $5 million project funded by U.S. Naval Undersea Warfare Center and the Office of Naval Research. The goal is to create self-powering, autonomous robots that could be used for underwater surveillance or to monitor the ocean environment. ""We are trying to get it as close as possible to the natural animal,"" said Alex Villanueva, a Virginia Tech doctoral student in mechanical engineering. ""The way it looks, the way it moves, the general feel of it."" The Navy has been involved with robotic jellyfish in the past, but none has been of this magnitude. Virginia Tech's research team, led by mechanical engineering professor Shashank Priya, unveiled an early prototype called RoboJelly in 2012. But that robot was only as big as a man's hand. ""One reason to develop a larger vehicle is payloadâ€”more room to put instruments, allowing you to achieve more complex missions,"" Villanueva said. ""But another important thing is that as your robot gets bigger, it actually becomes more efficient ... biologists have shown that the animals, as they get bigger, actually use less energy going from point A to point B."" Cyro, named after the jellyfish Cyanea capillata, has eight aluminum arms and a white, flexible silicone covering. It is designed to mimic the way a real jellyfish propels itself through the water. A control box in the middle of the jellyfish serves as the robot's ""brain."" The robot does not currently carry a camera, but researchers say one could be added, along with other monitoring instruments. ""Cyro has a basic control system. We program Cyro beforehand and basically map out what we want it to do. So when we turn on Cyro in the water, it follows this mission that we pre-programmed,"" Villanueva said. One of the limitations of this prototype is how long it can swim. The robot can last about four hours continuously using a rechargeable nickel metal hydride battery. ""We're somewhat limited by the batteries,"" Villanueva said. ""The idea behind the project is to develop these vehicles that can last as long as possible and require as little maintenance as possible. In the future, we're trying to leave this robot in the ocean for weeks and months at a time."" The research team is exploring alternative energy sources to power the robot. ""If you look at the natural animal, it can't swim infinitely without eating. It's the same thing with the robots. They have to refuel,"" he said. ""We're looking into energy harvesting using any sources that we can in the ocean â€” solar, wave energy. We're also looking into some more novel methods such as the digestion of nutrients in the ocean waters using microbial fuel cells."" Although this prototype is still years away from being deployed in the ocean, there are plenty of potential uses. The robot could be used to study schools of fish, monitor ocean currents or handle cleanup duty from oil spills. Not to mention play a role in covert military surveillance operations. ""One of the strengths of the jellyfish as far as stealth is that it's an animal you don't really feel threatened by,"" Villanueva said. ""If I saw a shark and a jellyfish ... and both of them turned out to be robots, I would definitely pay more attention to the shark.""","Researchers develop a robotic jellyfish that could be used for undersea surveillance .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- At least 70 people in one Chinese province have suffered food poisoning in recent days after eating pig organs contaminated by a banned food additive, state-run media reported Monday. Health officials in the Guangdong province in southeast China said most were treated at hospitals and released, but at least three people remained hospitalized, the China Daily newspaper reported. The victims complained of stomach aches and diarrhea after eating pig organs bought in local markets since Thursday, China's Xinhua news agency reported. A local health official said initial investigations indicated that the pig organs were contaminated by clenbuterol, an additive that is banned in pig feed in China. Three people were detained for suspected involvement in raising and selling contaminated pigs, authorities said. Clenbuterol can prevent pigs from accumulating fat but is harmful to humans and can be fatal. One of the largest food poisoning cases involving clenbuterol happened in Shanghai in September 2006, when 336 people were hospitalized after eating pig meat or organs contaminated with the additive, China Daily said.","Xinhua: Victims complained of stomach aches and diarrhea after eating pig organs .

"(CNN) -- A Florida man fleeing a traffic stop almost got away, police say. Until he met up with an alligator. Bryan Zuniga escaped police early Thursday, but was arrested at a Florida hospital hours later following the painful encounter with the gator. The incident started after deputies pulled over the 20-year-old in Pinellas Park for allegedly failing to maintain a single lane. He stopped the vehicle, jumped out and broke through a nearby fence, successfully eluding police, the Pinellas County Sheriff's deputies said in a statement. But his freedom did not last long. Authorities arrested him a few hours later at a local hospital, where he was getting treatment after the alligator attack. Zuniga told deputies an alligator bit him near a water treatment plant in St. Petersburg, which is a few miles from where he ditched his car. Deputies took him into custody after he was treated for multiple puncture wounds to the face, arm and armpit area, the sheriff's office said in a statement. Authorities booked him into the county jail on various charges, including driving without a license and fleeing police. Zuniga did not respond to CNN affiliate Bay News 9's request for comment while authorities were walking him into the jail, and CNN has been unable to identify his lawyer. Once endangered, the Florida alligator has made a comeback and can be found in county water bodies, according to Pinellas County's Animal Services website.","Incident started after deputies pulled over 20-year-old in Pinellas Park .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The controversial interrogation technique of waterboarding has served a ""valuable"" purpose and does not constitute torture, former Attorney General John Ashcroft told a House committee Thursday. John Ashcroft says waterboarding yielded more valuable information than other interrogation techniques. Testifying on the Bush administration's interrogation rules before the House Judiciary Committee, Ashcroft defended the technique while answering a question from Rep. Howard Coble, R-North Carolina. ""Waterboarding, as we all know, is a controversial issue. Do you think it served a beneficial purpose?"" the congressman asked. ""The reports that I have heard, and I have no reason to disbelieve them, indicate that they were very valuable,"" Ashcroft said, adding that CIA Director George Tenet indicated the ""value of the information received from the use of enhanced interrogation techniques -- I don't know whether he was saying waterboarding or not, but assume that he was for a moment -- the value of that information exceeded the value of information that was received from all other sources."" Waterboarding is a technique designed to simulate drowning. The agency has acknowledged using it on terror suspects. Some critics regard it as torture; others say it is a harsh interrogation technique, and proponents say it is a useful tool in the war on terror. Ashcroft, who stated his opposition to torture, said the Justice Department has determined that waterboarding -- as defined and described by the CIA -- doesn't constitute torture. ""I believe a report of waterboarding would be serious, but I do not believe it would define torture,"" Ashcroft said, responding to questions from Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California. He added, ""the Department of Justice has on a consistent basis over the last half-dozen years or so, over and over again in its evaluations, come to the conclusion that under the law in existence during my time as attorney general, waterboarding did not constitute torture."" Waters asked Ashcroft whether such techniques would be regarded as ""totally unacceptable and even criminal"" if they were used on American soldiers. ""Well, my subscription to these memos, and my belief that the law provides the basis for these memos persisted even in the presence of my son serving two tours of duty overseas in the Gulf area as a member of our armed forces,"" Ashcroft said. Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, asked Ashcroft how many times waterboarding had been performed. Ashcroft said that it's his ""understanding it has been done three times"" as part of an ""interrogation process."" He said he thinks the subjects of the interrogations ""would be labeled as high-valued detainees."" The House of Representatives failed to muster the two-thirds majority it needed this year to override President Bush's veto of a bill that would have banned certain CIA interrogation techniques, including waterboarding. The White House applauded the vote, saying an override ""would have diminished the intelligence community's ability to protect our nation."" The bill was an effort to curtail the CIA's ability to use harsh interrogation techniques that the military and other law enforcement agencies ban. It would have restricted U.S. interrogators to techniques outlined in the Army Field Manual. The White House said the restriction ""would have eliminated the legal alternative procedures in place in the CIA program to question the world's most dangerous and violent terrorists.""","Ex-attorney general says waterboarding more effective than other techniques .

"(CNN) -- An Arizona lawman said the suspicious package addressed to controversial Sheriff Joe Arpaio ""would have caused a major explosion"" if someone had opened it. Jerry Sheridan, chief deputy of the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department, told reporters Friday the package was noticed by an alert postal employee in Flagstaff who thought he spotted gunpowder residue. Arpaio was at Sheridan's side as he spoke. Police in Flagstaff X-rayed the package, noticed what appeared to be an explosive device, and rendered it safe by blowing it up with a water cannon. Sheridan said the package was mailed Thursday, a day after the department received a death threat from a major drug cartel. The department has received other threats in the past, but, Sheridan said, this development is ""something that was brought to the height of seriousness."" ""That is a very serious threat. It was labeled to come here, to this building and to be opened by Sheriff Arpaio,"" Sheridan said. He said injuries, burns and maybe death could have resulted. The FBI and deputies were trying to track down ""a person of interest."" Arpaio, well-known for his hardline anti-immigration policies that have led to accusations of civil rights violations, vowed that he would not be brought down by his enemies. He spoke after Sheridan briefed reporters. He said he's been besieged by certain groups and people and has been slammed with rhetoric criticizing him. He said he's resolved to do his job and won't be intimidated by people who want to force him out of office or kill him. ""My answer is it will not deter me from doing my job,"" he said. ""I'm not running scared. ""All I know is I'm going to keep being the sheriff,"" he added. ""I want everybody to know that."" Earlier, sheriff's department spokeswoman Lisa Allen said it was her understanding that the package had gun powder, wires, a battery -- all the components for an explosion. U.S. Postal Inspector Andrew Rivas in Flagstaff, who screened the package Thursday, considered it suspicious enough to call a local police bomb squad and the FBI. ""We evacuated the post office, got all our employees to safety,"" Rivas told CNN affiliate KTVK. Rivas said authorities have an idea of where the package may have come from, but declined to specify, citing the ongoing investigation. Allen said the origin of the package is one of the underlying issues in the investigation. At present, the department is not opening mail and is checking to see if any suspicious packages have made it through, Allen said. Neither she nor Flagstaff police knew if the box contained a message. The FBI declined to release details. ""I can confirm the FBI is involved in the investigation,"" said FBI spokesman Manuel Johnson in Phoenix. ""At this time the FBI is not commenting further due to the matter being ongoing."" The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also is investigating, ATF spokesman Mike Campbell said. Flagstaff is about 150 miles north of Phoenix, the seat of Maricopa County. A lightning rod for controversy . Arpaio has made national headlines for years with his unorthodox -- and often controversial -- style of justice. And he has been the object of threats before. Since August 2011, nine threats have been directed at Arpaio that were were credible enough to be investigated. There has been at least one arrest in the past involving threats. While Arpaio already has reasonable security, Allen said, ""we are going to have to augment"" it either by getting more personnel or adding electronic security. Arpaio has housed thousands of inmates in tents and forced all inmates to wear pink underwear. He has boasted about feeding each inmate on less than $1 a day. His critics say he has a long history of launching bogus criminal investigations against political opponents and anyone else who gets in his way. He was the subject of a civil lawsuit by the Justice Department alleging civil rights violations. According to the complaint, the sheriff's office has displayed a pattern of discrimination against Latinos that includes racial profiling, unlawful detention and searches, and unlawful targeting of Latinos during raids. Arpaio has denied any discrimination, and one of his attorneys called the Justice Department investigation a ""witch hunt."" His office website touts his ""get tough"" policies and says his chain gangs contribute thousands of dollars of free labor to the community. Male chain gangs, as well as the world's first-ever female and juvenile chain gangs, clean streets, paint over graffiti and bury the indigent in the county cemetery. After winning his sixth term last November, the 80-year-old sheriff said he doesn't plan on leaving office anytime soon. ""For my critics out there, I'm going to say right now: In January, I'm signing up for 2016. So I'm not a lame duck,"" he told a crowd of cheering supporters. CNN's Greg Morrison, Ashley Fantz and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: ""All I know is I'm going to keep being the sheriff,"" Arpaio says .

"(CNN) -- Civil rights groups filed a complaint this week against a federal judge in Houston after she allegedly said during a lecture that some minorities are prone to violence. Judge Edith Jones, who serves on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and was a Bush-era Supreme Court frontrunner, allegedly made the comment while speaking on the death penalty to The Federalist Society at the University of Pennsylvania in February. The Federalist Society describes itself on its website as ""a group of conservatives and libertarians interested in the current state of legal order."" In her remarks, Jones also is alleged to have said race plays no role in the administration of the death penalty, but certain ethnic groups commit certain types of crimes more often than others. Civil rights groups, including the J.L. Turner Legal Association, say Jones' comments reveal a strong ethnic bias. They are pushing for an investigation that could lead to her removal from the bench. The J.L. Turner Legal Association is an African-American bar association in Dallas. Its president, Mandy Price, told CNN that some attendees were shocked at what they heard and later complained. ""The reaction in the room when she made these remarks was one of shock, surprise, and offense,"" according to one account that the legal association collected from some of the attendees. The Federalist Society itself, however, called the allegations ""frivolous accusations."" ACLU: Blacks busted for marijuana at much higher rates than whites . According to the some of the accounts in the complaint, the judge said, ""Racial groups like African- Americans and Hispanics are predisposed to crime."" They are ""'prone to commit acts of violence,"" she said, according to the complaint. When challenges to her comments arose, she allegedly countered them by saying that ""blacks and Hispanics"" outnumber ""Anglos"" on death row. Price says such comments reveal strong predispositions sitting judges should not harbor. ""We expect that they're going to be fair, impartial, not that they have predetermined their case,"" she said. A representative from the court, which is headquartered in New Orleans, declined to comment to CNN, and said Jones also is ""not making any comment regarding the matter."" Jones was on President George W. Bush's short list for the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005, though legal observers remarked at the time that her reputation has a staunch conservative -- firmly upholding the death penalty and vocally critical of the Roe v. Wade decision, among other issues -- hurt her odds. ""The decision for which Judge Jones is really best known is her opinion saying, 'While I'm a lower court judge, I will apply Roe v. Wade, but I think it was wrongly decided and should be overruled,'"" Supreme Court expert Tom Goldstein told CNN. ""That really typifies her role as a lower court judge but signals what she would do if she became a Supreme Court justice.""

"(CNN) -- Is anyone surprised that more than half of births to American women under 30 now occur outside of marriage? Or that marriage is losing ground in Middle America? What's the big deal? After all, some Americans believe that ""marriage is just a piece of paper,"" while others think that fathers are no longer essential. Despite these worrisome statistics and views, the institution of marriage is not disappearing in American life. Marriage is certainly not in trouble for the privileged and powerful. Forget Kim Kardashian, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Tiger Woods. In spite of the high-profile marital misbehavior of a few politicians, professional athletes and Hollywood starlets, marriage is actually growing stronger, in many respects, among educated and affluent Americans. For Americans with a college degree, divorce is down, marital quality is stable, and family stability is up since the divorce revolution of the 1970s and early 1980s, according to research I have conducted. However, marriage is in trouble not only in poor communities but also increasingly in Middle America -- communities where most people have a high school degree but not a four-year college degree. For Americans without a college degree, divorce remains high, marital quality is falling, and nonmarital childbearing is surging. The problem with the growing marriage divide in America is that children -- and men -- often pay a big price. For instance, research indicates that boys who are reared outside of marriage are about twice as likely to end up in prison by the time they turn 30, compared with boys raised in an intact, married home. Similarly, studies show that girls raised in fatherless homes are at least twice as likely to end up pregnant, compared with girls raised in intact, married homes with their fathers. In general, children born and raised in a married household are more likely to graduate from college, find employment and enjoy stable marriages as adults. Likewise, married adults are happier and less depressed than their unmarried peers. And because they work harder, act more strategically and carefully after they tie the knot, men enjoy a wage premium that may exceed 10% compared with their single peers. Married men are also much less likely to abuse alcohol, drugs or run into trouble with the law, compared with their unmarried peers. In the words of Nobel Laureate George Akerlof, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, ""Men settle down when they get married: If they fail to get married, they fail to settle down."" Thus, the problem with the retreat from marriage in poor and working-class communities is that fewer children, not to mention adults (especially men), benefit from the meaning, direction and stability afforded by an intact, family life. Conversely, American adults and children hailing from more educated communities and affluence are more likely to be doubly blessed with high levels of income and education as well as strong and stable families. There are at least two ways to bridge the growing marriage divide. First, liberals correctly note that one reason marriage is disappearing is that men in poor and working-class communities are having greater difficulty finding stable, decent-paying jobs -- particularly as manufacturing jobs head overseas. Our government should aim to strengthen vocational education and job programs in these communities. Conservatives are also correct to point out that the cultural foundations of marriage have weakened in poor and working-class communities. For instance, since the 1970s, less-educated Americans have become more accommodating of divorce, whereas college-educated Americans have become more intolerant of divorce and are in fact, more likely to embrace what I call a marriage mind-set. Accordingly, policymakers should consider a public health campaign to educate people, especially those in poor and working-class communities, about the value of marriage and fatherhood, much like they have educated the public about the dangers of smoking and drunken driving. Such a campaign may seem quixotic, but the evidence suggests such campaigns can drive behavioral changes. Given the importance of a strong and stable family life in children's lives, our leaders should take actions that will strengthen the institution of marriage. The alternative is a future where children from some communities are consigned to increasingly unstable and unhappy homes. That is simply not acceptable. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.

"Milwaukee (CNN) -- Rebecca Edmonds grew up a military kid and, like most military families, often moved as her dad rose through the ranks of the Navy. Enamored with the military and her father's service to his country, Edmonds decided in high school that military life was calling her. ""I think it's definitely a tight-knit community, and I was willing to be a part of that,"" Edmonds recalled of her decision to join the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, commonly called ROTC, at age 18. ""I think the families are welcomed. I remember going to a base, and we'd be welcomed by these families we didn't even know. "" When the Air Force offered her a full scholarship to Marquette University, Edmonds jumped at the chance to become a nurse and serve her country. Marquette is a Catholic university, a perfect fit for the practicing Catholic. Nothing captured her feeling of community and sense of military pride more than when her equally proud father, Capt. Tony Edmonds, swore in his oldest child as a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force. ""It was very special,'' she recalled of her commissioning in July 2011, shortly after college graduation. ""I was so happy that (my parents) had an opportunity to come out and be a part of that ceremony and have him administer the oath of office to me as an active-duty officer."" Today, her dream of serving her country has been shattered. Weeks before being commissioned as a military officer, Edmonds discovered that she was pregnant. That was before she says she learned the Air Force forbid single parents from enlisting. The reason for the policy, according to Air Force officials, is that the demands of deployment and military service put strain on family life and even more so for single parents. The Air Force accused Edmonds of committing fraud, ejected her from its ranks and revoked her $92,000 scholarship. Her case is currently under review. Edmonds' mother, Karen, a military wife for 25 years, said deployments are tough on all service members and their families, married or not. If her daughter were to deploy, Karen Edmonds said, her grandson would be well cared for by an extended family that includes the child's father and both sets of grandparents. Edmonds' mother said she believes the policy discriminates against single women and encourages pregnant single women to abort their pregnancies. ""The Air Force is making an assumption that single parents cannot provide adequately for their children if deployed,"" Edmonds' mother said. ""That's what burns me up."" After she was ""dis-enrolled"" from the Air Force -- the military term for the separation from service -- Edmonds appealed to the Air Force and her congressman, Rep. Paul Ryan, now the Republican nominee for vice president. The Air Force rejected her initial appeal but said this week that her case is now being reviewed at the highest levels. Edmonds has also hired a military attorney, Daniel Conway. Edmonds, her family and her attorney claim that the Air Force is encouraging its members to give up their children, through either adoption or abortion, a position they say was revealed in a comment from an Air Force colonel. In a letter responding to Ryan's inquiry on Edmonds' case, Col. Kelly L. Goggins wrote, ""If Ms. Edmonds had reported her pregnancy she would have been placed on medical recheck status until she gave birth. At that time she would have been been able to commission if she were not a single parent, for example, if she were married, or had given the child up for adoption."" CNN has repeatedly asked to interview Goggins, to no avail. Edmonds said that letter confirms her fear at the time she discovered she was pregnant. She had just found out that she was expecting when she had what would be one of her final counseling sessions with an officer, as required by the Air Force ROTC. ""He just says, 'I don't know what would happen to a cadet if she were to become pregnant. But I don't think it would be good. So just don't get pregnant,' "" Edmonds recalled of the conversation with the officer. ""He said that word for word to me. At that point, I thought, 'OK, I don't think I have to tell anybody this. I'm scared now.' "" Edmonds completed all her physical and academic requirements, telling only her boyfriend and her family of her pregnancy. Abortion was never an option, she said, because of her Catholic faith and her personal beliefs. Thirteen weeks into her pregnancy, she was sworn in by her father as a second lieutenant and started making plans to go to Virginia to begin her military service. Five months into her pregnancy, she said, she told her new commanders that she was going to have a child, and they told her they didn't think it would be a problem. But they were wrong. Citing a contract she signed in 2007 when she enrolled in ROTC at age 18, the Air Force said she committed a fraud by not reporting a change in her medical condition, as indicated in the contract. The Air Force ejected her, noting in its ruling, ""It is not the responsibility of the staff to constantly remind you of the terms of your contract."" It further stated that her file contained eight forms in which she was briefed on the medical change reporting requirement. Edmonds said no one ever brought the issue up during her subsequent counseling sessions while she was enrolled at Marquette. Edmonds said she asked the officer who informed her that she was being ejected from the Air Force, ""Had I terminated the pregnancy before my commissioning, would I have been able to commission at that point?"" And, according to Edmonds, ""He said, 'Well. Technically, yes.' That was the hardest part of all of this. Someone telling me to my face that had I gotten an abortion, then I would be eligible for service."" In a statement to CNN, a spokesman for the Air Force said it had no knowledge of that conversation. ""Any such counseling would have been inappropriate and I have seen no evidence of any such discussion,'' Maj. Joel Harper wrote. ""However, Ms. Edmonds' case is under review by the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records."" Harper also said the Air Force would never tell non-married service members to give up their children, despite Goggins' letter to Ryan. ""The assertion that the Air Force would in any way encourage single parents to give up their children is unfounded,"" he wrote. The Edmondses and their attorney feel otherwise. ""This offends me on a number of different levels,"" said Conway, the attorney. ""Because we're telling young single woman that they cannot serve if they have a child. That they have to get married, give the baby up or have an abortion."" Edmonds said she realizes there will be those who say she shouldn't have gotten pregnant or have gone public with her story. She said that she may have made a mistake but that she now has a beautiful 10-month old son, Dominic, to show for it and he is no mistake. She is taking responsibility for her actions and raising her child. She hopes that because she has told her story, the military will reconsider its policy on single parents being allowed to enlist. As she waits for her situation to be resolved, Edmonds is working as a pediatric nurse, paying $100 a month -- with interest -- toward the $92,000 scholarship debt. After all, Karen Edmonds points out, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta recently stated his commitment ""to removing all the barriers that would prevent Americans from serving their country"" when hailing last year's decision to abandon the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy for gay men and women serving in the military. She hopes his words will apply to women like her daughter. ""I believe a woman has the right to choose life, go on to serve and reach (her) full potential, including being an officer in the Air Force,"" Karen Edmonds said. Watch Erin Burnett weekdays 7pm ET.

"(CNN) -- The murders of two Texas prosecutors has raised concerns about the safety of others in those positions, but the slayings of prosecutors in the U.S. is ""beyond rare,"" according to a leader of the nation's state and local prosecutors. Scott Burns, executive director for the National District Attorneys Association, indicated Tuesday that there is no need for overreacting to the recent shooting. Burns said the best available figures show that only 13 prosecutors have been killed in the line of duty in the past 100 years. Neighbor of slain Texas prosecutor heard nothing unusual . A memorial in Columbia, South Carolina, erected to honor murdered prosecutors bears only 11 names, including just one federal official. The names of the two state prosecutors slain in Kaufman County, Texas -- District Attorney Mike McLelland and Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse -- will be added to the memorial at an appropriate time, the association said. While no one discounts the potential danger to prosecutors, officials are seeking to maintain perspective. The National District Attorneys Association has issued a statement to ""remind all prosecutors to continue to be vigilant with respect to their personal safety and take appropriate steps should they receive any threats or cause for concern."" Similarly, the Justice Department took a low key approach. ""We always take the safety of Justice Department personnel extremely seriously and take appropriate steps when warranted,"" said Justice spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle. In contrast to the handful of slain prosecutors in the nation, the count of sworn law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty continues to mount.

"(CNN) -- As an NFL player, Chad Johnson patted a lot of men on the butt when he liked their work, but on Monday, defendant Chad Johnson found out that one Florida courtroom was not the place to play that game. After Johnson patted his lawyer on the rear, Judge Kathleen McHugh rejected Johnson's plea to a probation violation in the domestic violence case involving Johnson and his then-wife, Evelyn Lozada. Johnson was arrested in May for not meeting with his probation officer and was in court Monday to enter a plea. After he was asked if he was pleased with his attorney, the former wide receiver once known as ""Chad Ochocinco"" gave his lawyer, Adam Swickle, a gentle pat on the rear. McHugh was furious when people in the audience laughed. ""There's nothing funny about what's going on here today,"" she told Johnson. Johnson, 35, replied that he wasn't laughing. Then McHugh said, ""I don't think anything's funny about it, Mr. Johnson. This isn't a joke."" Johnson said he didn't do it as a joke. Swickle agreed, saying: ""I don't think it was done as any disrespect to the court. I don't think he meant to get a reaction from the court room, judge."" The judge told Johnson she wouldn't accept a plea deal that involved only community service and more anger management counseling. Instead, she sentenced him to 30 days in jail and tacked three months onto his one-year probation, which would have ended in September. Johnson seemed resigned to his fate. ""Love me through the good and the bad because I'm gone love you regardless... See you in 30... "" he tweeted later. Johnson -- a six-time all-star whose name Ochocinco was a Spanish wordplay on his number, 85 -- last played in the NFL in 2011. He was released by the Miami Dolphins during the 2012 preseason after police said he headbutted Lozada, a reality TV star, during an argument at their home in Davie, Florida. Johnson and the ""Basketball Wives"" star were divorced in September. He changed his name back to Chad Johnson after the two were married last July.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court gave an Alabama death row prisoner another chance Wednesday to appeal his conviction after a mailroom mistake and other circumstances initially left him unable to pursue further claims in court. At issue was whether a missed deadline to file a key appeal provided justification to grant Cory Maples a second chance, when the error was not the inmate's fault and the result would mean a punishment as serious as lethal injection. The justices' 7-2 ruling was a setback for the state, and the inmate's case now goes back to lower courts. ""The uncommon combination of mishaps in Maples' case, we hold, provide just cause to excuse the procedural lapse in state court,"" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the majority. The compounding series of errors and negligence involved both state officials and the private attorneys once representing him. The prisoner's new legal team, supported by some civil rights groups, argued the criminal justice system was being turned on its head by potentially allowing prisoners to suffer the consequences of their lawyers' mistakes or incompetence. But state attorneys countered that long-established rules on filing often complex paperwork must be strictly enforced to ensure that all parties -- including the courts -- get a proper chance to hear the claims in an orderly fashion. And the state says that in this case, Maples' initial appellate attorneys were from a blue-chip law firm in New York. Maples was convicted in the 1995 murder of two companions, Stacy Alan Terry and Barry Dewayne Robinson II, with whom he had been drinking heavily. Court records showed that Maples took a .22-caliber rifle in his Decatur, Alabama, home and shot both men twice in the head, execution-style. He later confessed to police but offered no explanation for the crimes. He was convicted, and the jury recommended the death sentence by a vote of 10-2. After the conviction, two attorneys from the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, working on behalf of Maples for free, filed a motion in an Alabama court claiming ineffective assistance by the trial defense. The chain of errors may have begun when the appellate lawyers did not list the name of their firm in the papers filed in Alabama. When that court later sent two copies of its ruling denying the motion to the New York-based attorneys, the mailroom inexplicably sent them back unopened. The envelopes were labeled ""Return to Sender -- Left Firm"" and ""Return to Sender -- Attempted Not Known."" Both lawyers had, in fact, left the firm, but no notice of new legal representation at the same firm was given to either the court or to Maples himself. A local lawyer in Alabama not heavily involved in the appeals also received the initial ruling, but he, too, did not follow up to ensure that the New York lawyers continued the necessary filings. By the time the mix-up was discovered, apparently thanks to inquiries by the inmate's mother, Maples' window for appeals had run out. The local judge was not sympathetic, saying the county clerk was not required to follow up or investigate why the key documents were sent back without acknowledgment. ""How can a circuit court clerk in Decatur, Ala., know what is going on in a law firm in New York, N.Y.?"" Morgan County Circuit Judge Glenn Thompson asked in his ruling. Subsequent state and federal courts also refused to grant Maples another chance to file his appeals, saying the 42-day deadline was standard and non-negotiable. But the high court's majority spread the blame on both the state and, especially, Maples' attorneys. Ginsburg noted attorney ""negligence"" alone rarely gives inmates a second chance in court to contest their convictions. But the court majority said this case presented an ""extraordinary"" set of facts, including that Maples was ""abandoned"" by his lawyers. ""They did not inform Maples or the Alabama court of that reality,"" Ginsburg wrote. ""Through no fault of his own, Maples, an inmate on death row, was left unrepresented at a critical time for his state habeas petition. Moreover, he lacked any clue that he had better fend for himself."" The majority was also tough on the state's refusal to give Maples a break in light of these circumstances. Justice Antonin Scalia disagreed. ""If the interest of fairness justifies our excusing Maples' procedural default here, it does so whenever a defendant's procedural default is caused by his attorney,"" not the state, he said. ""That is simply not the law -- and cannot be, if the states are to have an orderly system of criminal litigation conducted by counsel."" Justice Clarence Thomas joined in the dissent. This high court victory for Maples does not mean he will eventually receive the new trial he is seeking. Because so much of the facts and testimony of the various parties remains in question -- particularly the actions of the county clerk and the in-state attorney for Maples -- lower state and federal courts could be wrestling with this case for years. Sullivan & Cromwell employs about 800 lawyers, charges premium client rates, and does significant pro bono work on behalf of a variety of indigent prisoners. The firm is more than 130 years old. Among the 34 states with the death penalty, Alabama alone does not automatically give all its 200 or so current capital inmates taxpayer-funded legal assistance to file papers challenging their convictions, sentences and lethal punishment. Big out-of-state firms like Sullivan and Cromwell often step in and tackle the usually long and expensive appeals process. Lawyers for Maples say that missed deadlines, whatever the reasons, have occurred before and that some flexibility should be built into the system, especially when it involves crucial issues like habeas corpus and the death penalty. ""It's really an almost unthinkable situation, and anyone, even the most ardent supporters of capital punishment, ought to be concerned about the result in this case and should not want a decision allowing a man to be executed in these circumstances, because that can only erode public confidence in the system of capital punishment,"" attorney Gregory Garre, who is now working on the case, told CNN in a recent interview. Garre is from the Latham and Watkins law firm, hired to represent Maples before the Supreme Court in the new round of appeals. The case is Maples v. Thomas (10-63).","An ""uncommon combination of mishaps"" justifies allowing an appeal, the court says .

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts police dog searching for a handgun not only found the weapon but fired it with his paw, a police chief said Sunday. No one was injured when K-9 search dog Ivan discharged a bullet as he indicated the gun's location, Lawrence Police Chief John Romero told CNN. ""Everyone on the scene was startled, including Ivan,"" Romero said with a chuckle. The search for the weapon began after a police officer on patrol early Saturday morning was responding to hearing three gunshots, according to Romero. The officer followed a vehicle, which sped off. A short time later, a passenger in the rear seat exited the vehicle and ran to a nearby snow bank to bury something. The passenger re-entered the vehicle, and the officer stopped it but waited for backup before ordering the three men out of the vehicle, Romero said. After the men exited the vehicle, Ivan's handler, Essex County Sheriff's Lt. John Pickles, commanded the dog to search for a gun after a shell casing was found in the backseat of the car, Romero said. Ivan is trained ""to paw"" if he finds something. ""I surmise that the snow was there for a week, and it was probably like ice,"" Romero said. ""The individual probably was not able to bury it very deep, and he had no time."" After Ivan recovered and fired the weapon, the three men were arrested and charged with possession of a firearm, possession of ammunition, receiving a firearm with a defaced serial number and receiving stolen property, Romero said. The individual believed to have buried the gun was also charged with discharging a firearm within 150 feet of a highway and carrying a firearm without a license. The semiautomatic Ruger was stolen from New Hampshire in October 2012. As of Sunday, all three were being held in jail and awaiting a Monday arraignment, Romero said.

"(CNN) -- The vetting process and the subsequent hiring of Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson seemed like standard procedure. But in recent days he has come under fire for the controversy surrounding his academic credentials. A graduate of Stonehill College, Thompson earned a bachelor's degree in accounting. But his official biography at Yahoo and Paypal, where he worked previously, says that he also has a degree in computer science. Thompson probably could have gone further and claimed he had a master's degree in engineering and no one would have questioned it. Holding these credentials seems very plausible for someone with Thompson's job history. And since he was a well known and successful executive, a background check was probably put on the back burner. Why? ""Groupthink"" is a possible culprit. The term groupthink was coined by Irving Janis in 1972 to describe ill-fated decisions like in the cases of the Bay of Pigs invasion or the destruction of the Space Shuttle Challenger. In these instances, small, cohesive committees engaged in flawed decision-making while being under the gun to produce a result quickly. Group members feel the need to conform and be in a consensus, despite what their gut instincts tell them. While we don't know all the factors that went into the vetting process of Thompson, the executive search committee that was responsible for his review may have engaged in groupthink. Fortunately, in Yahoo's case, the only bad outcome is that jobs were lost under Thompson's leadership. Thompson certainly isn't the only high profile executive to have been caught in this type of scandal. Plenty have come before him and plenty will come after him. In Thompson's case, it turned out that he didn't even submit a resume, and that he reached out directly to Yahoo about the job. How his record got embellished is not exactly clear at this point. Whether he was in any way involved with enhancing his biography or somehow the resume mistakenly incorporated incorrect information, the firestorm over Thompson serves as food for thought about the bigger issue of embellishing one's resume. Resume fraud is not uncommon. It is committed to gain a competitive edge in landing a job, but the rationale that people use to justify the fraud is less clear. Some people actually perceive their lies to be 80% truths and therefore see no problem in fudging their resume. Other job seekers may feel the exaggerated information is permissible as a way to compensate for the many hard knocks they have endured in life. The more times that false information goes undetected, the more desensitized people become to their own deception, and will likely continue with this pattern of behavior. Research has suggested that the best predictor of one's future behavior is one's past behavior. The more pieces of the puzzle that a job search committee can put together about a candidate's past, the more accurate it will be in assessing that individual. Nowadays, with a competitive job market and fewer jobs, recruiters should take extra precautions against resume fraud. In addition to background checks and verification of credentials, the interview process is an opportune time to ferret out any falsified information. Structured job interviews with standardized questions are ideal for determining how qualified a candidate is for a job. But employers should be just as concerned about the candidate's characteristics, especially their level of integrity. The unstructured employment interview -- informal questioning or conversation -- is better at revealing a candidate's personality traits. Candidates are usually caught off guard with small talk over dinner and drinks and inadvertently end up spilling the beans. Any red flags in a candidate's past will have a high probability of being raised if they exist. Vetting a candidate thoroughly can sometimes be costly and time consuming, but it is worthwhile for the long-term health of the organization. I'm sure this has been an expensive learning experience for Yahoo. Hopefully, others will take note. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Melinda Blackman.","Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson has come under fire for lying about his academic degrees .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City have completed a sensational transfer deadline-day swoop for Brazilian forward Robinho in an estimated £32.5 million ($58 million) deal with Real Madrid, following the English Premier League club's takeover by an Abu Dhabi group on Monday. Brazilian Robinho joins Manchester City for a British transfer record of £32.5 million. Chelsea had been leading the chase for Robinho, who had insisted he wanted to play for the London club. However, Real had stood firm in insisting that they did not want to sell 24-year-old Robinho and  refused numerous Chelsea offers in recent weeks, putting an end to that deal. But City -- with new financial clout provided by their Middle East-based owners -- met the valuation placed on Robinho by the Spanish giants, breaking the British transfer record. Robinho told City's Web site: ""I knew that Manchester City is a very big club, there's a great team there already and this is an exciting project. ""I liked the project, and when City made the offer to Real Madrid, I decided to come here. I liked the plans that Manchester City have and I want to succeed with them."" Robinho confirmed the presence of his international team-mates Jo and Elano at City was a factor in his decision to sign, even though Chelsea appeared a more likely destination at the start of transfer deadline day. Hughes, who had a playing spell in Spain with Barcelona, has spoken to his new signing and Robinho is keen to work with the former Blackburn and Wales manager. ""I met with the manager today and it went very well,"" said Robinho. ""I know that he was a great player and I think that will be a big help to me. I want to help the manager and the team to win the Premier League, that's my ambition here."" City also attempted to muscle in on arch-rivals Manchester United's acquisition of Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov. Tottenham accepted City's bid for Berbatov, but the Bulgarian international opted to join the Premier League champions. Earlier in the day, City agreed to a takeover by the United Arab Emirates business group, a deal that will end former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's brief ownership of the Premier League club. The Abu Dhabi United Group for Development and Investment will now look at the club's accounts and contracts before a takeover is officially completed. The group reached an agreement late on Sunday night with Thaksin, said board member Sulaiman Al-Fahim, who brokered the deal. Thaksin will retain a minority stake and remain on the board as honorary president without any administrative responsibilities, Al-Fahim said. The club said in a statement that a ""memorandum of understanding"" has been signed and the deal is subject to a due diligence, allowing investors to request information from Man City and the Premier League. Financial terms were not immediately available, but the UAE group described it as a ""huge takeover"" which gives the consortium ""all the management rights."" Thaksin, who bought City last June, had his assets frozen and fled to Britain last month to escape corruption charges in Thailand, claiming that he could not be assured of a fair trial. Al-Fahim -- chief executive of Abu Dhabi-based developer Hydra Properties -- reached the deal with Thaksin and Khalid Kadfour Al-Muhairy, the legal chief of the Emirates Group. Al-Fahim said the group was attracted to the ""richest European competition with more than $3 billion revenue."" Like Thaksin, the new owners want manager Mark Hughes to deliver Champions League qualification by breaking into the top four of the Premier League. After two wins in their first three matches of the season, City are third in the standings -- one point behind leaders Chelsea. Al-Fahim said on Tuesday that Hughes would be given the financial clout to help him meet the aspirations of the new owners. He told Sky Sports News that he plans to meet Hughes and talk over future transfer targets. ""I will come to the UK in a few days to meet the manager Mark (Hughes),"" he said. ""We will sit down with him and see what it is he needs now."" Confirming that the bid to sign Berbatov from Tottenham ahead of city rivals United was a serious one, he added: . ""That was genuine. It was very close but we couldn't get him, we were unlucky."" Of the takeover he said: ""It might take a month, it depends on the final approval of the authorities.""","Manchester City sign Robinho from Real Madrid in the £32.5m ($58m) deal .

"(CNN) -- Edward Snowden's father defended his son's actions Monday and slammed those who would focus on the ""sinner"" rather than the ""sins"" the younger Snowden revealed. ""He loves his country. I know my son. I know he loves his country. What he believed is that ... the American people needed to be aware of what their government was doing to them, spying upon them,"" Lon Snowden told CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 Monday night.

He urged his son to remain in Russia ""until we have assurances that he would receive a fair trial."" ""There has been a clear effort by those who have been threatened politically and/or embarrassed by these revelations to focus on the, so to speak, sinner -- my son who has revealed these -- instead of the sins, the actual revelations. It's clear they don't want to discuss that,"" Lon Snowden said. Snowden did not access 'crown jewels' of NSA intel, official says . His son is seeking asylum because he claims he would be tortured and face the death penalty if returned to the United States. In a letter to Russian authorities last week, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder wrote that the Justice Department would not seek the death penalty. He argued that Snowden's arguments for temporary asylum in Russia are without merit. The death penalty is not an option given the current charges against Snowden, and even if additional charges were filed, the United States would still not seek capital punishment, Holder wrote. Snowden's father has called on President Barack Obama to order the attorney general to dismiss the criminal complaint filed against his son. ""Our national character, much as with individuals, is determined by what we do when we think that no one is watching, when we think that we won't be held accountable.

Hers is a story of false promises, illegal immigration, verbal and physical abuse, drugs, forced prostitution and a risky escape. After being forced to work as a prostitute, Claudia says she started thinking about ways of escaping. ""It was a very traumatic experience,"" she said. ""The first day I started working was very hard because I had to sleep with 20 men in rapid sequence."" For several months she saved up tips, just a few dollars at a time, that she would hide in a refrigerator. She discreetly would ask older women, who were also forced into prostitution, about directions to the nearest bus station and streets around the area. When she felt she had enough for a bus trip, she ran away to the bus station and bought a ticket to a city she didn't know. She has been a free woman for several years now, but she says she still suffers from nightmares and says her life has been scarred. Many people associate prostitution with women walking the streets in shady areas and being picked up by johns. But Claudia says the prostitution ring for which she was forced to work had a long list of clients who knew the price they had to pay, who to call and where to go. It's a well-organized and lucrative underground industry. Luis CdeBaca monitors human trafficking at the U.S. State Department. He says there are no reliable figures on the scale of the problem, but forced prostitution from Mexico and Central America is a big part of it. ""They know that their victims are not going to go to law enforcement,"" said CdeBaca.  ""They know that their victims are afraid. In fact, sometimes one of their threats is to turn people over to the immigration service."" Claudia was 15 when she was forced to become a prostitute, but there are younger victims, as CdeBaca found out when he worked as a federal prosecutor at the U.S. Justice Department. ""I ended up seeing cases with girls as young as 13 and women in their 40s and everything in between,"" he said. According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), the United Nations agency that monitors employment, standards, and social protection issues, there are about 12.3 million victims of human trafficking around the world. The ILO also estimates that at least 1.39 million of those are victims of commercial sexual servitude in their own countries or abroad. But the current trafficking from Mexico and Central America is of special concern for CdeBaca. ""We have situations in the United States, cases that I've worked on, when I was with the Justice Department involving women who had to serve as up to 50 customers a day; just a crushing amount of what in fact is a daily set of rapes,"" said CdeBaca. Several cases have been successfully prosecuted in states, including Georgia and New York, against prostitution rings that operate in the same way. They lure women in Mexico with promises of a good job only to be forced into sexual slavery once here. In the Atlanta area, Amador Cortes-Meza, a 36-year-old Mexican national, was charged with involvement in a prostitution ring that victimized women and girls smuggled from Mexico. Some were as young as 14. Otto Jaime Larios-Perez, 27, who has admitted one count of providing false information, drove victims to several secret locations in the Atlanta area, forcing them to see multiple clients a day. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agent Brock Nicholson says that all of the victims fell into the same trap. ""They were brought in with romantic promises, with job promises, young girls, from a certain state of Mexico, brought up, smuggled in, immediately forced into prostitution,"" Nicholson said. Ten years ago, the U.S. Congress passed a law that allows victims of human trafficking to stay in the country if they testify in court against perpetrators of the crime. Danielle Conley, an immigration attorney who helps victims of human trafficking, said this law known as the Trafficking Victims Protection Act helps both victims and prosecutors. Victims get a visa to live in the United States and prosecutors get powerful testimony to build strong cases against suspects of human trafficking. ""They actually have quite a few rights, but unfortunately that's not widely known among both the immigrant community and American citizens,"" said Conley. Claudia has now moved to a different city in the United States, where she tries to live a normal life. She's still afraid of retribution and wants to remain anonymous. Asked why she decided to share her painful experience, she pauses for a moment and then answers without hesitation. ""Because I want authorities to realize that this is a problem and a serious one,"" she said.  ""Also, I want parents to know that sometimes because of their work they forget about their children, especially girls, and leave them abandoned.""","There are over 12 million human trafficking victims, international data shows .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- I've spoken to doctors in Baghdad before, but never one this optimistic. Solar panels similar to these are bringing renewable and regular power to two clinics in Iraq. When I interviewed Dr. Thamer Al-Musawi, he told me his clinic is offering new hope to their patients. Not because of any new medicines housed inside. But because of the high tech equipment placed on the outside -- 64 solar panels to be precise. About 4 months ago, they were installed on the roof of the Al-Dakhil Medical Center, where Dr. Thamer works, as part of a project being underwritten by the U.S. Military and supported by Iraq's Health Ministry. Only two other clinics in all of Iraq have been given access to the same technology. Dr. Thamer excitedly explained its significance. ""It means we can give our patients the care and medical aid they need,"" he said, ""and we can do it 24 hours a day."" Round the clock medical care may not sound like anything special, but in Iraq, where the power grid is unreliable and blackouts are frequent, most clinics can open only a few hours a day. And that's not the worst of it. Without dependable electricity, Dr. Thamer explained, certain medications can't be kept at the right temperatures. At one point, Al-Dakhil even had to cancel their children's vaccine program because the vaccinations couldn't be stored properly. That all changed with the arrival of the panels -- for a few months at least. The clinic recently suffered a setback. Before we visited, someone tampered with a key circuit board and that's preventing the clinic from using electricity still being stored in the batteries. Until it's fixed, Al-Dakhil is back to using what most other clinics must use, expensive and polluting diesel generators. But that hasn't dampened Dr. Thamer's enthusiasm. He fully expects the solar panels will be powering the clinic again within a few days. As a doctor in Baghdad, he's faced far worse, and he's determined to overcome this challenge. More than anything, he simply wants to make sure his patients can get access to the best care possible.","CNN visited one of only three solar-powered clinics in whole of Iraq .

"Beijing (CNN) -- President Hu Jintao has said what so many others have been thinking: the Chinese Communist Party is under threat. In front of more than 2,000 delegates at the opening of the 18th Communist Party Congress in Beijing, Hu made plain there is a cancer at the heart of the system and it is called corruption. ""Combating corruption and promoting political integrity is a major political issue. If we fail to handle it, it could prove fatal to the party and even cause the collapse of the party and the fall of the state,"" he said. It would be tempting to dismiss this as empty rhetoric, an attempt to placate an increasingly anxious and angry population. But this isn't just about words. Chinese politics has been battered this year; a year of scandal, embarrassing revelations about the riches of party leaders, a slowing economy and a perilously widening wealth gap. With one former leader, Bo Xilai, purged from the party and awaiting trial, Hu was putting others on notice. ""All those who violate party discipline and state laws, whoever they are and whatever power or official positions they have, must be brought to justice without mercy,"" he warned. This is the last time Hu will address the Congress as party chief. Xi Jinping is preparing to be appointed General Secretary at the end of the meeting next week, and next year will be installed as state president. Hu ends his ten years at the helm of a country that has risen to be the second biggest economy in the world -- closing fast on the United States. Yet, the nation is far from Hu's much vaunted ""harmonious society."" The economy is overdue for reform, the old model of high investment, mass exports and cheap labor is looking tapped out. The party is trying to shift gears to be more domestic consumption-orientated, but economists say that is going to require significant investment in the social safety net to turn a nation of nervous savers into spenders. Social unrest is on the rise with people, especially in rural areas, protesting against everything from environmental pollution to the rule of law and land seizures. Ethnic groups continue to complain of victimization. Just this week there have been more reports of Tibetans setting themselves alight as part of a campaign for political and religious freedom. Human rights groups say dissidents -- particularly lawyers, writers and artists -- are languishing in prison or under house arrest. Some China watchers say Hu's warnings about the fall of the party are meaningless, rather it his leadership that should be blamed. ""These are only empty words which sound good. In these ten years, China is nothing close to harmonious but the conflicts and contradictions have become worse. In fact, it is reaching a crisis moment,"" said Zhang Min, from China's Renmin University. It will fall to Xi to save the party from itself. But this is a man who remains a mystery to many China watchers, though someone who has risen through the ranks being careful to keep his views to himself. On a trip to Mexico in 2009, he lifted the veil just a little. Speaking to Chinese workers, he revealed a leader who may be more inclined to look for blame outside China than to criticize his own. ""There are some bored foreigners with full stomachs who have nothing better to do than point fingers at China,"" he said at the time. As Hu ponders the party's demise, historian Zhang Lifun says Xi above all else will be dedicated to its survival. He's a son of the party, labeled as a ""princeling"" because his father was a revolutionary hero. ""He is part of a consensus to keep the Communist party as the only ruling party. Any so-called liberty must only be on the condition of the survival of a one-party dictatorship,"" he said. Xi's very future depends on it.","Outgoing President Hu Jintao warned against corruption in China .

"(CNN) -- The cooling system for a nuclear reactor at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi plant lost power for hours Friday afternoon but was operational again, officials at the Tokyo Electric Power Company said. The outage is one of several that has hampered the facility recently. There have been many repairs at the plant since the devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 that triggered a nuclear disaster there. Fukushima's nuclear ghost town . Last month, power outages at the critical nuclear facility were blamed on rats short circuiting a switchboard, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported. Officials said at that time that the temporary power loss did not trigger a known release of radioactive material. Metal panels were to be installed Friday around the cooling system to ward off small animals, a Tokyo Electric Power Company spokesman said. The tsunami that hit Fukushima Daiichi after Japan's historic earthquake knocked out power and coolant systems at the plant, resulting in meltdowns in three reactors. The result was the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl, as the crippled reactors spewed enormous amounts of radioactive particles into the environment. The Tokyo Electric Power Company, the operator of the Fukushima plant, has said it is monitoring radiation contamination levels around the plant.","The outage is one of several recently .

"(CNN) -- It's not often supermodels are selected for their social awareness -- unless, of course, you're flipping a fashion and photography status symbol on its head. Pirelli, a tire company best known for outfitting the world's speediest race cars and superbikes, also has a reputation for publishing calendars featuring stunningly beautiful women in the raciest of poses. The formula for 40 years has been simple: Start with the world's top models (Kate Moss, Miranda Kerr, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), subtract most or all of their clothes, add backdrops from the most scenic locales (Mallorca, Corsica, Seychelles) and multiply it all through the lenses of the best fashion photographers (Herb Ritts, Karl Lagerfeld, Terry Richardson). Voila! You have the world's most sought-after calendar, the Ferrari Daytona of pinup collections. Well, Pirelli has decided to scrap this high-performance model for something more sensible. It's still sexier than a minivan but quite a departure from years past. ""In tough times, like the one the world is going through ... the idea was to find positive images and transformations in the world,"" said Paolo dal Pino, executive president of Pirelli Latin America. It's not that the Italian tire maker's executives haven't heard the adage, ""If it ain't broke ...,"" but rather, they decided it was time for a change, dal Pino said. Instead of a fashion photographer, Pirelli brought in Steve McCurry. The self-described ""street photographer"" is renowned for his image of an Afghan teen in a ragged burgundy scarf, whose peridot eyes peered out from the June 1985 National Geographic cover. McCurry acknowledges he was surprised to get the call but said he wasn't daunted because it isn't so dissimilar to the shots he considers his forte. ""I think a lot of what I do is portraiture, and it did seem to me that could be why they called me,"" he said. Curiosity inspires iconic photographer . As for the models, social consciousness was considered more of an, ahem, asset than what might slip out the sides of a string bikini or loosely draped serape. Karlie Kloss and Liya Kebede, for instance, were chosen less for their perfect physiques than for their work to bring health care to the underprivileged. Petra Nemcova wasn't selected for her hypnotic hazel eyes but for the more than five dozen schools constructed through her Happy Hearts Foundation. ""They're there not only for their fantastic beauty but also their social commitment,"" dal Pino explained. Rio de Janeiro was chosen, he said, because of the economic transformation experienced there over the last 10 years, which by some estimates has lifted as many as 40 million people out of poverty. Rio: The 'perfect Shakespeare stage' Oh, and it doesn't hurt that Brazil is one of the world's most colorful and soulful destinations -- and a familiar haunt, as Pirelli staged shoots there in 2005 and 2010. Pirelli began speaking to McCurry in February, dal Pino said, and the photographer drove around Brazil before arriving at his blueprint for the project. ""I wanted Rio to be a presence,"" McCurry said. ""I wanted a sense of the place to be part of the pictures."" The shutterbug said he was pleased with the freedom he, the models and staff had to roam the city's favelas, many of which were considered unsafe for visitors just a few years ago. Today, there are football/soccer fields and recreational centers under construction in these once-destitute parts of Brazil's second-largest city. Dal Pino noted that showing the development in these onetime shanty towns was integral to depicting the social transformation in Brazil. ""The fact we were able to photograph freely ... demonstrates that some of these places are getting built up,"" McCurry said. ""That, hopefully, is evident in the work."" McCurry sought to capture the country's essence, not only through its vivid settings, but also through its people. In addition to the philanthropic temptresses, he photographed slices of Brazil, whether it was MaringÃ¡-born actress SÃ´nia Braga, pop singer Marisa Monte or simply a faÃ§ade bearing one of Rio's elaborate street art installations (the city actually differentiates between street art and graffiti ""tagging,"" with the former permissible by law). He also wanted everyday people. So where 1995's calendar featured Calvin Klein model Christy Turlington with bare breasts propped atop a metal corset, hands bound at her side, the 2013 shoot brings you images of the Capoeiristas practicing their dance-based martial art that dates back to 16th-Century slaves. And where 2010's calendar pictured Brazilian beauty Andrea Beatriz Barros topless, licking a rooster she clutched by the throat, McCurry's calendar contains an image of a vegetable vendor with an arresting gaze, her halter-top blending in with the peppers at her produce stand. (Because we're intuitive enough to know you'll be off to hunt for some of these images, we'll save you the trouble, but be forewarned: As artistic as the photos are, they absolutely and unequivocally are 100% NSFW.) Yet the biggest difference between McCurry's vision and past Pirelli calendars was the clothes. That is, the models wore some. Clothing didn't make them any less beautiful -- ""I think they're still sensuous, and the sexuality comes through,"" said McCurry -- but he was going for a certain elegance in the portraits. He wanted to take these top models, who know the cameras and themselves so well and who are so skilled at their craft, and portray them in a natural setting, to ""let them be photographed the way they wanted to be photographed, the way they wanted to be seen,"" he said. He further explained, ""These are women that are making a difference in the world. Let's photograph them the way they are without it being too dramatized, without it being too campy."" And what bespeaks natural and beauty more artfully than Brazilian bombshell Adriana Lima -- pregnant? ""When I heard she was pregnant, I thought, 'Well, great. We can work with that.' It's who she is, natural,"" McCurry said. ""I saw it as a plus. I never questioned whether it might be appropriate. This is fundamental to life."" Lima gave birth to her second daughter, Sienna, in September, but not before McCurry captured her against a stone wall, lips and belly in full pout, lifting her hair back from her neck. Though McCurry has shot fashion models in the past, the bulk of his more-than-30-year-deep portfolio focuses on what he calls ""conflict journalism"": the ravages of war, refugees' desperation, a spate of ""vanishing cultures,"" as he puts it. Asked if tapping him for the Pirelli shoot was akin to yanking a fish from water, he humbly demurred. ""I think it's possible to kind of walk and chew gum at the same time,"" he said with a chuckle. So, to the question that many are asking after catching wind of the calendar: How does one acquire a copy? The answer, sadly, is you probably can't without dropping some coin. Back issues of the calendar can be purchased on eBay for anywhere from $20 to $150, but the auction site, as of Thursday afternoon, had only three copies of the 2013 edition. They were commanding between $600 and $1,000 plus shipping. Pirelli made only 20,000 of this year's calendar, and they're handed out as gifts to Pirelli's clients, certain members of the press and fashion and art societies, dal Pino said. The Pirelli executive believes this year's calendar will be embraced, despite its departure from naughty tradition, and he doesn't see any backlash to this year's inclusion of clothing. ""We do believe that this (backlash) is not going to happen,"" he said. ""We do believe many people will say, 'It's about time.'

"(CNN) -- 2012 ended for 162 passengers on a Spirit Airlines plane with an unexpected bump. Their Airbus A320 had just arrived from Atlanta at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida Monday night when a wingtip hit the tail of another plane. ""After landing and while taxiing to the gate, our aircraft made contact with another parked aircraft,"" Spirit spokeswoman Misty Pinson confirmed to CNN. ""There were no injuries and customers deplaned at the gate as normal."" The US Airways plane that was hit was parked in a remote area away from the gate where aircraft are stored overnight. No one was on board at the time. ""An A320 was parked in an approved parking spot when it was struck in the tail by another aircraft,"" Andrew Christie, a US Airways spokesman said. ""The extent of the damage is yet to be determined."" Broward County sheriff's officers who were called to the scene described the damage as a ""gash in the tail section,"" but found no fuel leaking. The Spirit aircraft has resumed flying, while the US Airways plane is out of service for inspection and repair of its damaged tail cone, the airlines reported. In September the National Transportation Safety Board recommended the Federal Aviation Administration require large planes and other aircraft on which the wingtips are not easily visible from the cockpit to have cameras or other devices to monitor the wings. The safety board said at the time that 12 accidents since 1993 had involved a large aircraft's wingtip hitting another airplane or object on the taxiway. Most recently, a Boeing 747 hit a regional jet at O'Hare airport in Chicago in May, a 767 hit a regional jet in Boston in July 2011 and an A380 hit a regional jet in April of 2011 at New York's JFK airport.

"(CNN) -- A second person who had been taken hostage at a rural Louisiana bank this week has died, a hospital official said Thursday. Laden McDaniel, a woman who police said was among three Tensas State Bank employees taken hostage on Tuesday, died at Rapides Regional Medical Center, according to Sarah Clancy of the Alexandria, Louisiana, hospital. Authorities said Fuaed Abdo Ahmed shot McDaniel and Jay Warbington as police stormed the bank in St. Joseph just before midnight Tuesday. Police shot and killed Ahmed, Louisiana State Police Col. Michael Edmonson said. He said the gunman had threatened to kill the hostages. Warbington died later, police said Wednesday. The third hostage had been freed before the shooting began. In 2012: Gunman wounded, ending French hostage incident . Ahmed had with him a book on torture and a bag with items he could use to torture people, state police Trooper Albert Paxton said Thursday. He also had a book on hostage negotiations, Paxton said. Police said Ahmed, 20, was known to police, and Edmonson described him as a paranoid schizophrenic. Ahmed told hostage negotiators that he heard voices and wanted to have a device removed from his head. Born in California, Ahmed moved with his family to northeastern Louisiana, where his family owns a convenience store, Edmonson said. The Mississippi River community of St. Joseph is about 35 miles south of Tallulah, Louisiana, and 35 miles north of Natchez, Mississippi. It is the seat of Tensas Parish, home to about 5,000 people. Ahmed entered the bank branch with a handgun around 12:30 p.m., and took the three bank employees hostage, according to officials. After word got out about the hostage situation, local, state and federal law enforcement agents descended on the usually quiet community. Law enforcement agents were able to talk to the hostages as well as the gunman. Edmonson said he talked to, and prayed with, relatives of the hostages.

"Midland City, Alabama (CNN) -- Two bombs were discovered Tuesday inside the bunker where an FBI team rescued a 5-year-old boy from his kidnapper, the agency said. The FBI said they ""disrupted"" the two explosive devices. One was in the bunker and another was in the PVC pipe that hostage taker Jimmy Lee Dykes sometimes used to communicate with the authorities, Special Agent in Charge Steve Richardson said in a written statement. The agency sent in a hostage rescue team after negotiations broke down with Dykes, who apparently had bombs in the bunker and shot at agents when they stormed the bunker. The search for other bombs will continue Wednesday, Richardson said. Dykes had held a 5-year-old named Ethan since abducting him from his school bus. Ethan's mother said she awoke Tuesday to what she will forever remember as ""the most beautiful sight ... my sweet boy."" For almost a week, Ethan, had been held by Dykes until an FBI team rescued him Monday afternoon. Mother and child were reunited at a hospital. ""I can't describe how incredible it is to hold him again,"" the mother, who has not been publicly named, said in a written statement. ""Ethan is safe and back in my arms, and I owe it all to some of the most compassionate people on Earth."" Ethan was released from the hospital Tuesday afternoon, Alabama state trooper Kevin Cook said. Dozens of people attended a prayer vigil for Ethan on Tuesday night and signed a huge birthday card for the boy, who turns 6 on Wednesday. Tough negotiations . A law enforcement source told CNN that Dykes was contentious with authorities from the beginning of the nearly weeklong standoff, but the conversations deteriorated rapidly toward the end. The source said investigators talked with Dykes on the phone, exploring several strategies to resolve the situation, without success. ""The team kept going back to the same place -- that they had to go in and get Ethan,"" the source said. They knew the rescue might be difficult. ""Dykes built this bunker specifically for law enforcement not to get in and him to not get out,"" the source said. Dykes had reinforced the bunker to prevent others from getting in, Richardson said. Law enforcement officers were able to see what was going on inside the underground bunker where the child was held hostage with a camera they slipped into the hideout, a law enforcement official said. FBI sources said surveillance drones constantly monitored the situation. As the standoff dragged on, an FBI hostage rescue team practiced on a nearby mockup of the bunker until kidnapper Dykes' declining mental state forced them to move in Monday afternoon, law enforcement sources said Tuesday. The resulting assault -- from the top of the bunker, according to another law enforcement source -- ended with Dykes dead and Ethan free. The other law enforcement official wouldn't say what exactly was done to get into bunker, but the FBI team didn't go in through the hatch. Authorities took Ethan to the hospital for evaluation. ""He was running around the hospital room, putting sticky notes on everyone who was in there, eating a turkey sandwich and watching 'Spongebob,' "" Dale County Schools Superintendent Ronny Bynum said. The kidnapping . Authorities said Dykes abducted the young boy from a school bus January 29. Dykes approached the bus and demanded that the driver hand over two children. Dykes killed driver Charles Poland as he blocked the aisle -- allowing children to escape from the back of the bus -- but Dykes seized Ethan and fled to the bunker, according to authorities. Late Alabama bus driver called a hero . During the ensuing standoff, authorities were extraordinarily tight-lipped about what was happening, but said they were in contact with Dykes and said they believed he had not harmed the boy. He also allowed authorities to deliver food, medicine and at least one toy for the boy to play with, according to authorities. The details about the law enforcement response to his abduction are the first provided by authorities about how they knew what was going on inside the bunker and why they decided to move when they did. But many questions remain, including whether the Defense Department provided sensing equipment to aid in monitoring what was happening inside the bunker and why Dykes acted as he did. 'A big boom' At one point Monday, Dale County Sheriff Wally Olson told reporters that Dykes had ""a story that's important to him, although it's very complex."" But according to a law enforcement source, Dykes' mental state deteriorated in the 24 hours before the Monday afternoon rescue. Experts from FBI units, including a crisis negotiation team, tactical intelligence officers and a behavioral sciences unit, had determined Dykes was in a downward psychological spiral, the source said. At 3:12 p.m. (4:12 ET) on Monday, the FBI team went in. While the law enforcement source said FBI agents went in through the top of the bunker, the source declined to say specifically how they breached the roof, how many agents were involved or whether Dykes shot himself or was killed by FBI gunfire. A Dale County official told CNN that Dykes had been shot multiple times. The body remains ""in the area"" and will be examined by the county coroner before it is taken to Montgomery, Alabama, for autopsy by the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences, the official said. Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director, said the rescue likely was complicated by the layout and materials used to build the underground bunker. Rescuers would have had to come down stairs, exposing their legs and meaning Dykes would see them first, he said. And if there were brick walls, the FBI agents would have to shoot carefully to guard against ricochets -- all that after probably tossing in a flash grenade to stun the kidnapper. ""The FBI hostage rescue team is the best in the world, and they proved it yesterday,"" said Fuentes, who was not involved in Monday's rescue. A law enforcement source would neither confirm nor deny that a flash grenade was used. What's next for Ethan? While Ethan recuperated Tuesday from his ordeal, school officials began planning a party to celebrate the boy's birthday and to honor Poland, the bus driver hailed by school officials as a hero. While the party won't be ready by Ethan's birthday, it will be held soon -- likely at the Dale County High School football stadium, Bynum said. After being kidnapped, the recovery ahead . Ethan's elementary school principal, Phillip Parker, said teachers are eager to have him back and ""wrap their arms around him."" ""Everybody knows Ethan. He's a good kid, a friendly kid,"" Parker said. Relief that Ethan was safe was palpable in Midland City, but many questions remain about what comes next for him. How does a 5-year-old heal from this ordeal? How does a youngster go on after witnessing his bus driver shot to death, then being dragged to an underground bunker by a gun-toting stranger? How will he deal with what he experienced the six days he languished in that hole and what he saw during the explosive rescue Monday that killed his captor? ""It's very hard to tell how he's going to do,"" said Dr. Louis Krause, a psychiatrist at Chicago's Rush Medical Center. ""On the one hand, he might get right back to his routine and do absolutely fine. But on the other hand, the anxieties, the trauma, what we call an acute stress disorder, even post-traumatic stress symptoms, can occur."" A psychologist said even if Ethan appears to be doing well on the outside, he needs to talk out what happened to him. Hoping the 5-year-old will forget what happened would be a bad strategy, said Wendy Walsh.

""It is better to process it, get some therapy."" When terrible things happen: Helping children heal . Someone who knows all too well what Ethan may go through is Katie Beers, who as a 10-year-old was held underground in a concrete bunker for two weeks by a New York man. ""I am ecstatic that Ethan has been retrieved safe and sound,"" said Beers, who recently released a book about her abduction. ""As for my ordeal, I just keep thinking about the effects of it: being deprived sunlight, nutritious food and human contact. And how much I wanted to have a nutritious meal, see my family."" Beers says she still feels the effects of her kidnapping. ""The major issue that I have is control issues with my kids and finances,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Dallas police Saturday said DNA evidence has provided a breakthrough in an investigation of nine sexual assaults in South Dallas this summer. Police asked for the public's help in locating Van Dralan Dixson, 38, who is named in an arrest warrant for aggravated sexual assault. His DNA matched evidence gathered in one case, a police statement said. Samples for other cases are awaiting analysis. Dallas police had said officers were ""saturating"" the area of the attacks and that a task force had been created to investigate the crimes. Police have said a single suspect was believed responsible for attacks on nine victims from June 22 through September 1. All of the victims were walking between midnight and 6 a.m. when an armed man forced them to nearby secluded areas. The victims were robbed and sexually assaulted. Victims said the attacker covered his face with a mask or bandanna, CNN affiliate WFAA-TV reported. WFAA said a sexual assault was reported near an abandoned store in the same area early Saturday. Police did not immediately say whether that attack was similar to the previous nine.","At least nine similar assaults have been reported in South Dallas this summer .

"(CNN) -- Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden are two American men in their 20s. They're both fascinated by -- and adept at -- computer use and held jobs that gave them access to some of their country's most secret and sensitive intelligence. They chose to share that material with the world and are now paying for it. But that may be where the similarities end. What did they do? United States Army Pvt. Bradley Manning leaked hundreds of thousands of classified documents about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and sensitive correspondence written by U.S. diplomats -- information that WikiLeaks published. Some of that information was also analyzed and reported by The New York Times, Der Spiegel and The Guardian newspapers as well as other news outlets. A military judge acquitted Manning on Tuesday of aiding the enemy, but convicted him of violations of the Espionage Act. The proceedings for his sentencing could take days or even weeks. He could get 136 years. Edward Snowden, a former CIA employee and National Security Agency contract employee, told a Guardian journalist that the NSA was operating classified surveillance programs that track cell phone calls and monitor the e-mail and Internet traffic of virtually all Americans. To tell his story, he left his job and life in Hawaii, fled to China and is now in Russia, where he has been granted temporary asylum. Read more: New Snowden leak: NSA program taps all you do online . How did they do it? Manning had access to intelligence while working as an analyst stationed in Iraq. Snowden worked for NSA contract firm Booz Allen Hamilton, a job that gave him access to the sensitive programs. What are their stated motives? When Manning entered his guilty pleas on certain charges in February, he spent more than an hour in court reading a statement about why he had leaked the information. He said that the information he passed ""upset"" or ""disturbed"" him, but none of it, he thought, would harm the U.S. if it became public. Manning said that he thought the documents were old and that the situations they referred to had changed or ended. ""I believed that if the general public, especially the American public, had access to the information ... it could spark a domestic debate on the role of the military and our foreign policy in general as it related to Iraq and Afghanistan,"" he said, according to a statement that Manning's lawyer, David Coombs, posted a link to on his site. Read Manning's full statement . Manning's statement also explains why he enlisted: ""my natural interest in geopolitical affairs."" Snowden has said that he just wanted the public to know what the government was doing. ""Even if you're not doing anything wrong you're being watched and recorded,"" he said. Explaining his motivation to Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald in an edited video published on the newspaper's website in June, Snowden said the NSA's activities were tantamount to ""abuses."" He also revealed to The Guardian that he had access to everyone working at the NSA, the entire intelligence community and undercover assets around the globe. ""I'm just another guy who sits there day to day in the office, watching what's happening, and goes, 'This is something that's not our place to decide.' The public needs to decide whether these programs or policies are right or wrong,"" he said. How much damage did they do? Manning was acquitted Tuesday on the most serious charge of aiding the enemy, and experts say that clearly illustrates that the government did not provide convincing evidence that he helped enemies of the United States through his leaking. He was convicted on several other counts and now probably faces a lengthy term in a military prison. At Manning's sentencing proceeding, the prosecution called retired Army Brig. Gen. Robert Carr, who at one point had headed up the Information Review Task Force, which assessed the possible damage that Manning's actions had caused. Carr testified that there were concerns about some 900 Afghans who were identified in some way in the documents. But he didn't say if any of those Afghans were harmed. Asked if Manning had made the jobs of junior intelligence analysts more difficult by damaging their superiors' trust in them, Carr said it was ""hugely important to empower these young intel analysts."" But experts outside the courtroom say the mere fact that sensitive information was able to be leaked by an Army private damaged the image of the U.S. and its ability to influence global affairs. ""Manning's leaking of classified cables made diplomats and officials wonder, 'Well, if I talk to an American, will whatever I say wind up in the newspaper or published online?"" said James Lewis, director and senior fellow of technology and public policy program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. ""It suggested to the world that we couldn't keep secrets and we couldn't control people with access to secrets."" Much of the information contained in Manning's leaks was outdated, Lewis points out. Some of the cables were years old. Snowden case is different . Snowden's case is different, officials say, because he disclosed how the government actually collects telephone and online information, leaving the NSA to try to reassemble its surveillance networks. Justice Department and security officials have said that the surveillance programs were necessary to combat terrorist threats. In an interview with CNN, Secretary of State John Kerry called Snowden ""an individual who threatened this country and put Americans at risk."" ""People may die as a consequence of what this man did,"" Kerry said. ""It is possible the United States will be attacked because terrorists may now know how to protect themselves in some way or another, that they didn't know before."" In congressional testimony, NSA Deputy Director John Inglis said that Snowden's acts ""constituted an irresponsible and real damage to the capabilities"" of the NSA. Former CIA chief Michael Hayden had some of the harshest language for Snowden. In a CNN op-ed, Hayden said that Snowden far eclipsed the damage that Manning caused. Read Hayden's editorial . ""First, there is the undeniable operational effect of informing adversaries of American intelligence's tactics, techniques and procedures. Snowden's disclosures go beyond the ""what"" of a particular secret or source. He is busily revealing the ""how"" of American collection,"" Hayden wrote. ...""there are already reports of counter-terrorism targets changing their communications patterns. And I would lose all respect for China's Ministry of State Security and Russia's FSB if they have not already fully harvested Snowden's digital data trove."" Military law attorney Eugene Fidell told CNN that there is some good that can come of Snowden's leaking, though the former president of the National Institute of Military Justice is quick to add that he has little sympathy for Snowden. His leaks helped lead to congressional hearings and a re-examination of how much intelligence gathering is appropriate and when it may be venturing into abusive territory. ""The public knowing, at least being aware, of the powers of the FISA court showed new and sweeping powers being exercised by the executive branch,"" Fidell said. ""This is a democratic country, a democratic society. An informed electorate is essential. Not every voter should know everything,"" he said. ""But there is increasing concern across the political spectrum"" that those powers may be overreaching.","WikiLeaks leaker Bradley Manning was convicted of violations of the Espionage Act .

"New York (CNN) -- The worst of the storm has passed, but the recovery effort is just beginning. A mammoth blizzard that dumped as much as 3 feet of snow in parts of the Northeast headed out to sea Saturday, as workers across New York and New England struggled to get airports, trains and highways back online. The snowstorm, a product of two converging weather systems, is being blamed for at least nine deaths in three states and Canada. It forced the cancellation of more than 5,000 flights, and knocked out power to more than 635,000 customers. That figure had fallen to around 459,000 Saturday night. ""We had a bad storm here with heavy, heavy snow -- starting with a wet snow early, which stuck to the trees, which brought them down on the power lines, and then the temperatures dropping and then high, high winds all combining to a lot of power outages. We have our challenges here,"" Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee told CNN. Track the storm . Forecasters say the storm was still swirling across eastern New England with gusts up to 40 mph in cities that include Providence, Rhode Island, and Boston. But as most of the heavy snow tapered off, a travel ban across Rhode Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts was lifted at 4 p.m. Blizzard warnings were lifted, along with coastal flood warnings for New England. Mandatory evacuations were issued earlier Saturday for Massachusetts coastal regions near the town of Hull because of flooding concerns, and high winds whipped throughout the area. Authorities advised residents to leave shoreline areas in Marshfield and Scituate. While the blizzard did not fulfill record-breaking predictions, travel remained slowgoing. Hundreds of cars were stranded on the Long Island Expressway in New York after motorists got stuck driving in the snow. They outnumbered the tow trucks and crews deployed to the area for the storm, according to Suffolk County police. Map, timeline of the storm . The blizzard prompted the U.S. Postal Service to suspend deliveries in seven states. Postal worker Karlene Calliste left her job around 3 p.m. Friday, got caught in the storm and ended up sleeping at a firehouse in Middle Island, New York, where dozens of other stranded residents were holed up. ""It's crazy. They weren't prepared,"" she said, adding that a lack of snow plows contributed to the scores of cars and trucks left stuck in the snow. Three of New York's busiest airports resumed limited service Saturday morning. At least one runway at Logan International Airport in Boston was to reopen late Saturday, with flights expected Sunday. Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, was expected to reopen Sunday morning. Roads turn deadly . At least nine people were killed in accidents related to the storm -- five in Connecticut, according to the governor, two in Canada, one in New York and one in Massachusetts -- a 14-year-old Boston boy who was helping his father shovel snow. The boy hopped in the snowed-in family car to warm up. The engine was running and the exhaust pipe was blocked by snow, causing carbon monoxide to back up in the car. Firefighters were unable to resuscitate the boy. Boston police said they were investigating whether a man in his early 20s found dead a vehicle succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning. The department put out a public safety advisory and cited calls related to individuals being overcome while trying to stay warm in vehicles in which exhaust pipes were blocked by snow. In Poughkeepsie, New York, an 18-year-old woman lost control of her car in the falling snow and struck a 74-year-old man walking near the side of the road, police said. He later died from his injuries. Other accidents occurred in Connecticut and southern Ontario. Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island ahead of the storm ordered all non-emergency vehicles off the streets under threat of imprisonment and fines -- up to a year in jail and $500 in Rhode Island. Rail transportation came to a virtual halt, with commuter trains running on a patchwork schedule. Snow piles up; power goes out . Connecticut saw the most accumulation, with 40 inches in Hamden. At its height, the storm heaped snow on the state at a frenzied rate of 4 to 5 inches an hour. iReporter Scott Green posted a photo of his deck in Cromwell -- covered waist-high with snow. In Massachusetts, Worcester and Boston received 27 and 21 inches, respectively, with winds howling up to a hurricane-strength 75 mph. Snowfall in Manhattan reached just under a foot, with heavier accumulations in Long Island, where 27 inches fell in Stony Brook. ""This state had consequences, but nothing like our neighboring states,"" said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. He announced Saturday plans to send utility workers and snow plows to New England to help with recovery. Snowfall blanketed an area from eastern Pennsylvania to Maine, with overnight lows under 20 degrees as governors in six states declared states of emergency. The states hardest hit in terms of power outages were Massachusetts and Rhode Island. By Saturday evening, close to 308,000 customers were without power in Massachusetts, while more than 115,000 customers remained without electricity in Rhode Island. Stay safe with the power out . Electricity dropped out at a nuclear power plant in Plymouth, Massachusetts, said fire spokesman Ed Bradley, but backup generators sprang into action. Stay connected in the storm . Stay charged when the power goes out . Stranded at the Walmart . More than two dozen people were forced to spend the night at a Walmart in Long Island. ""The roads were just completely impassable,"" said Jean Miller, who spent at least seven hours on the road before throwing in the towel. ""We were just happy to be indoors and not out there,"" she said. Miller, whose home is just two miles from the store, says she plans to stay so long as road conditions are dangerous and Walmart allows it. ""They equaled the Red Cross,"" she said of the big-box retailer. Hoops snowed out . The nor'easter has swatted down travel arrangements for pro basketball teams headed to New York City, leaving the New York Knicks, San Antonio Spurs and Brooklyn Nets grounded. The Knicks are stuck in Minneapolis, where they played the Timberwolves on Friday, a spokesman said. They have a home game at Madison Square Garden on Sunday against the L.A. Clippers. Canceled flights forced the Nets to attempt to get home by train from Washington after a game there against the Wizards. The San Antonio Spurs, who were originally flying to New York to play the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday night, are stuck in Detroit. CNN's Jill Martin, AnneClaire Stapleton, Pauline Kim, Erinn Cawthon, Jake Carpenter, Phil Gast, Ben Brumfield, Chris Boyette and Marina Carver contributed to this report. David Ariosto and Mary Snow reported from New York and Dana Ford reported and wrote from Atlanta.","NEW: Boston, Connecticut airports to reopen .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- The America's Cup, the most prestigious yachting race in the world and its oldest at 162 years, will seemingly join the aviation age this weekend when a new design of boat sails as fast as 52 mph. The sight of these modern catamarans -- whose mainsail is even called a ""wing"" -- has been described as ""flying"" sailboats because the hulls will rise out of the water and ride on hydrofoils, moving faster than the wind itself. As one race skipper said in the race's promotions, ""once the boat foils, it's like hitting a turbo button in a car."" If this spectacle seems mind-boggling, it's intended: The America's Cup is better known for its old-fashioned sailboats -- the sloop, which has one hull with a fabric mainsail -- that in 2007 reached a top average speed of 14 mph, or 12 knots. Now the organizers of America's Cup -- led by Silicon Valley executive Larry Ellison, whose Oracle team won the last championship in 2010 -- have transformed the sport into ""a new-age speedster"" event, designed to draw new audiences to international sport's oldest trophy, which predates the modern Olympics by 45 years. To lure spectators, the America's Cup is being held for the first time inshore, not offshore, in San Francisco Bay, where gusty winds and a scenic shoreline are part of a strategy to make the regatta a sensational made-for-TV sport. As to be expected with such grand plans, however, the new America's Cup is roiling in controversy and concerns that its thrill-seeking is just too deadly. One sailor was killed in May while practicing for the race in the bay aboard the Swedish Artemis Racing team's boat when it capsized in winds only a little above normal at 25 to 35 mph. Andrew Simpson, 36, was a double Olympic medalist. The race has a high financial price, too -- scaring off some racers. ""We've had our issues, we've had our accidents, we've had a tragic loss of life,"" acknowledged Iain Murray, regatta director of the 2013 America's Cup. The cost to field a team -- around $100 million-- is being blamed for a smaller-than-expected field of challengers. The regatta begins Saturday and could end September 14 at the earliest. Entry requires a specially designed sailboat, called the AC72, the shorthand for the 72-foot-long America's Cup catamarans. As such, it has become a billionaire's pastime to build a boat and assemble a crew. The four boats vying for the Cup -- the smallest fleet in history -- mirror such wealth. Ellison, the world's fifth richest man, has again funded Oracle Team USA in this year's finals. Team Artemis of Sweden belongs to Torbjorn Tornqvist, an oil entrepreneur in that country. Italy's Luna Rossa is backed by the head of the fashion house Prada, Patrizio Bertelli, who is worth $6.7 billion. And the New Zealand team is financed by its government and Emirates Airlines as well as other sponsors. Critics say the 21st century marketing strategy of the race tarnishes the grand ol' Cup, founded in 1851. ""It was big money before. This time it's mega-money, and that's one of the failings of this edition of the America's Cup. This one has just been too expensive for the times and too complicated in terms of the technology needed,"" said Jack Griffin, an expert on sail racing who's regarded as a historian of the America's Cup. Enthusiasts such as Griffin were expecting as many as 15 teams, including from China, Korea and Australia, to seek the Cup. That number didn't materialize. ""I think people just said this is too hard for me. I can't win,"" Griffin said. Race officials acknowledge how an expensive sport is getting more expensive, but that's true for other sport teams, whether it's baseball or football. ""Well, I think you can look at many sports -- you can look at a NASCAR team, a Formula One team, you can look at a polo team -- you can spend that amount of money on a lot of different teams,"" said regatta director Murray. Even so, he said he wished more boats sought this year's Cup. But the payoff could be legions of newcomers fascinated by speed and technology -- as well as the coastal vistas. America's Cup sailboats can reach 35 knots, or 40 mph, in winds of almost half that amount, at 18 knots or 21 mph. Hydrofoils reduce drag and boost speed. ""There's no denying that the hundreds of millions being spent are bringing a new excitement to the sport and perhaps some new fans as the final series of the Cup is about to get underway,"" Murray added. A new era is unfurling in sailing, Murray said. Though it's strongly criticized, Murray defended the modernization of a world classic. ""We have boats sailing around 50 mph -- which is unheard of in the history of sailing,"" Murray said. ""The way these guys are pushing these boats, it's quite remarkable and a huge test of the competency of putting a crew together to race in the America's Cup. So I look back and say it was the right decision.""","The America's Cup will feature a new design of boat, a catamaran with hydrofoils .
The boat can sail 52 mph, ""an unheard of"" speed in sailboat racing .
But fewer teams are entering the race because it's now so expensive .
Race organizers defend their strategy to seek new audiences for the race ."
"(CNN) -- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi fired back Sunday at a CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" report that highlighted several instances of what it suggested could be ""soft corruption."" The show looked at the investments of various lawmakers -- including Pelosi, House Speaker John Boehner and Republican Rep. Spencer Bachus of Alabama -- who reportedly bought stocks around the same time legislation involving those investments was being discussed. Pelosi and her husband participated in an initial public offering of Visa in 2008, according to CBS. They bought 5,000 shares at the initial price of $44; two days later, shares were trading at $64, CBS said. The network reported the investment came at the same time a piece of legislation that was opposed by credit-card companies was making its way through the House. ""Congress has never done more for consumers nor has the Congress passed more critical reforms of the credit card industry than under the Speakership of Nancy Pelosi,"" Pelosi spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in a statement soon after the report aired Sunday night. ""It is very troubling that 60 Minutes would base their reporting off of an already-discredited conservative author who has made a career of out attacking Democrats,"" he added. CBS said it used as a starting point for its story the research of Peter Schweizer, a fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank at Stanford University. About a year ago, he began work on a book about ""soft corruption"" in Washington, CBS reported. The network said it had independently verified the material it used. Pelosi's spokesman criticized the CBS story for failing to note that the ""legislation in question was reported out of the Judiciary Committee on October 3, 2008 -- the day the House was consumed in passing TARP and also the last day the House was in session before the November election."" It also failed to note that in September 2008, the House passed the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights, Hammill said. ""In the next Congress, the House and Senate passed and President Obama signed the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights and the Dodd-Frank legislation, which included a stronger, more direct approach to addressing swipe fees,"" the spokesman said. In addition to Pelosi, the CBS report took a look at the investments of of Bachus and Boehner. In mid-September 2008, Bachus, then a ranking member on the House Committee on Financial Services, met with then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and lawmakers about the imminent collapse of the global economy, CBS reported. At the same time, Bachus bought options funds, betting markets would go down, CBS said. He also traded General Electric stock, and roughly a third of GE's business is in financial services, CBS reported. Bachus declined to talk to CBS, but his office provided a statement that said the representative never trades on non-public information, or financial services stock. Meanwhile, Boehner, who in 2009 was the House Minority leader, bought health-insurance stocks during the health care debate, all of which increased in value after the so-called public option was killed, CBS reported. Boehner was very much against the public option. He also declined to be interviewed, but spoke to CBS' Steve Kroft at a press conference. ""I have not made any decisions on day-to-day trading activities in my account -- and haven't for years. I don't -- I do not do it, haven't done it and wouldn't do it,"" he said. A senior House GOP aide told CNN that Boehner's financial adviser bought a range of blue chip stocks around the same time -- not just health care stocks -- after he closed out the retirement account from his small business. ""The idea that the Republican leader in the House opposed the public option -- policy favored by the left of the left -- for personal profit is, frankly, stupid,"" said the aide. CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" airs a report looking at lawmakers' investments .

"Paris (CNN) -- You may have been surprised by the about-face by French President Francois Hollande who -- after initially stressing the need for urgent action on Syria while insisting there was no need to wait for the United Nations inspectors' report on the August 21 attack -- said on Friday that he now wants to wait for their findings. Then, Saturday in Lithuania after four hours of talks with Secretary of State John Kerry, the European Union foreign ministers issued a statement blaming Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for the chemical weapons attack, calling it a ""blatant violation of international law, a war crime and a crime against humanity"" and calling for a ""clear and strong"" international response. But the statement said U.N. inspectors investigating the incident should report their initial findings before any action is taken. What's going on? It is all about European politics. European diplomats say Hollande seemed to be left hanging when President Barack Obama decided to seek authorization for strikes from Congress. He is facing pressure from the French public and Parliament for a stronger international backing and U.N. imprint before taking military action in Syria. European diplomats tell CNN that Hollande struck a deal with the European Union. In exchange for more European political support for action, he would wait for the U.N. inspectors' report. That was the genesis of the E.U. statement, which now has all 28 countries on record. Until now, just a few countries were even expressing support for such action, as evident by the fact only 10 countries joined the United States in signing onto the G-20 statement (France, the U.K. and Spain were the only European nations). EU urges strong response, as Kerry seeks support for military action . You may note Germany did not initially sign onto the G-20 statement Friday. But on Saturday, the Germans publicly endorsed it. Senior U.S. and other officials in the E.U. meeting with Kerry said the Germans were the ones that called for the European Union to issue this statement. Although the statement does not explicitly endorse military action, European diplomats tell CNN it is interpreted as tacit approval and political cover for strikes -- once the U.N. inspectors present their findings -- although it is important to note the European Union does remain divided and some countries will never publicly endorse military action, even with the U.N. report. Diplomats say waiting for the report doesn't really slow up military action for several more weeks -- because the E.U. statement refers to a ""preliminary report"", which it said should be presented ""as soon as possible."" And as CNN's Nick Paton Walsh has reported, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon has instructed the inspectors to speed this up. So the debate in Congress and a U.N. report should come to a head around the same time. 'Constructive' talks, but little headway on Syrian crisis . Many E.U. nations need the U.N. stamp as a legitimacy for supporting action in Syria, even politically. It doesn't have to be a U.N. Security Council resolution. It could be something less formal; it just has to have some U.N. imprimatur. So this let's everyone get a little of what they want. Hollande gets European political cover. The Europeans get a U.N. address and Obama gets more international consensus. Kerry told the E.U. no decision has been made to wait, but he appreciated the statement and would take it back to the president's national security team. Officials traveling with Kerry naturally trying to put a positive spin on this: they didn't expect a statement and see this as a clear show of European support for action. Obama may say he doesn't have to wait for the U.N. report -- but Hollande does, so Obama is going to have to deal with it if he wants any European support, especially from France.","Leaders decide they want inspectors' report first .
Officials want signal of backing from U.N.
It's a sign of European politics ."
"(CNN) -- Arizona's top politicians blasted the Obama administration and federal officials over the denial of aid in the wake of the state's deadly wildfire. The Yarnell Hill blaze killed 19 firefighters, called ""hotshots,"" in late June, when it changed directions and engulfed them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency denied the state's request for assistance based on insurance rules, it said in a statement Friday. It determined that not enough uninsured private individuals had become victims to warrant a payout. FEMA said it is not permitted to ""duplicate benefits provided by insurance companies or other federal agencies."" The agency also declined to issue a ""major disaster declaration"" for affected areas. Solemn 100-mile procession for fallen firefighters .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Before Michael Jackson asked a doctor to treat his insomnia with propofol, he tried falling asleep to the physician reading him bedtime stories. The pop star's desperate decades-long search for sleep ultimately led to his death when he overdosed on the surgical anesthetic on June 25, 2009. The trial to decide if Jackson's last concert promoter is liable for his death is nearing an end after more than four months of testimony. AEG Live's lawyers plan to rest their defense case this week, with Jackson lawyers presenting several rebuttal witnesses. Closing arguments are likely the last week of September. Dr. Barney Van Valin, whose video testimony was shown to jurors Friday, refused Jackson's request for propofol infusions in 2003, but six years later -- in Dr. Van Valin's words -- another physician ""put him to sleep like a dog."" Jackson's mother and three children contend AEG Live is liable for his death because the company hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for Jackson's propofol overdose. Murray told investigators he gave Jackson nightly infusions of the drug to treat his insomnia the last two months of his life. AEG Live lawyers argue Jackson, not their executives, chose and controlled Murray and that the company had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments in the privacy of the singer's bedroom. The producers ignored warning signs that Jackson's health was deteriorating, and instead of finding another doctor to intervene, they kept Murray and made him responsible for getting Jackson to rehearsals for his comeback concerts, the Jacksons contend. MJ and doctor were ""best friends"" Dr. Van Valin's practice is near the Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County, California, where Jackson lived until his acquittal in a child molestation trial in 2005. ""We were best friends, you know,"" Dr. Van Valin testified. ""I didn't have a better friend and I don't think he did."" Jackson ""would just show up"" at Van Valin's home every week or so without warning, he said. The doctor would open his door to leave for work in the morning ""and he would just be standing there."" His driver told him once that Jackson had been waiting at his door for 35 minutes, not wanting to knock because he thought that was impolite. Van Valin's children would stay home from school some days Jackson visited. ""I'd come home from work and there's Michael there at the house and they're watching cartoons or, you know, eating pizza,"" Van Valin said. At first it was a novelty, but after several years it was routine, he said. The doctor was asked under cross examination if Michael Jackson a good father. ""No, he is an amazing father,"" he answered. ""Because I'm a good father and he was better than me. He respected them and as they respected him and he would correct them gently."" Doctor: Jackson didn't fake pain to get drugs . AEG Live's defense includes the contention that Jackson cultivated friendships with doctors to gain access to drugs to feed a secretive addiction. But Van Valin denied Jackson ever used their friendship to get prescriptions to medication that were not clinically indicated. Although he was compelled to testify as a witness for AEG Live, Van Valin's testimony boosted the Jackson case by showing that Jackson's use of painkillers was medically justified by chronic pain suffered in a 1997 stage accident, Jackson lawyers said. The doctor said Jackson showed the ""classic symptoms of lower back pain"" and an MRI study confirmed a bulge in a disc in his lower spine consistent with where his pain was. Dr. Van Valin said he never suspected Jackson was faking his pain to get painkiller shots. ""I looked for that because there are plenty of people that come in and try to scam me, so I'm always looking for that,"" he testified. While the doctor said ""nothing implied"" that Jackson was abusing painkillers, there was one incident during house call in 2002 that caused him to suspect Jackson might be getting additional shots of the powerful opioid Demerol from another doctor. He noticed ""a little blood spot"" on Jackson's T-shirt after he gave him a shot, he said. ""I lifted it up and there's a little Band-Aid over it and I said, 'Michael,' I said, 'you have another doctor that gave you a shot.' I said, 'You realize what risk you put yourself and me at by doing that? Who came and gave you a shot?' 'Oh, no, I didn't -- it was not a shot.'"" Van Valin said. ""But it was. He was lying."" AEG Live contends Jackson kept doctors in the dark about other doctors' treatments. The argument is important to their contention that his dangerous drug use would have shortened his life even if he had not died in 2009. The shorter his life expectancy, the less money they might be ordered to pay in damages if found liable in his death. ""I told him, I said, 'You know what, I can't do this, okay, 'cause if you're doubling up, you know, I give you a shot and then you've already had one,' I said, 'I could kill you,'"" Van Valin testified. Van Valin remained close friends with Jackson even though he stopped treating him soon after that incident, he said. Bedtime stories versus Diprivan . The doctor's testimony revealed more about Jackson's relationship with the drug that killed him -- the surgical anesthetic propofol, also known as Diprivan. AEG Live lawyers contend it was a drug Jackson knew a lot about, but that their executives had no knowledge of. Debbie Rowe, Jackson's former wife, testified earlier that German doctors infused the singer with it in a Munich hotel on two nights to help him sleep between ""HIStory"" tour shows in 1997. Jackson lawyers pointed out that Paul Gongaware, who is now the AEG Live co-CEO, was Jackson's tour manager then. Five years later, Jackson asked Van Valin to help him go to sleep. ""Sometimes, he'd say, 'Barney, do me a favor, see if I can sleep, I'm going to get under the covers on that rollout couch,' and he said, 'Just read me out of a book,'"" Van Valin testified. ""I'd find a book that looked interesting and I'd just start reading or I'd tell him stories. That didn't work because often times he got excited about the story and say, 'That really happened?' or something. Anyway, I'd read to him -- and when it seemed like he was asleep I'd slip out, you know, kind of hard because the door made a little noise. If I thought he was asleep I'd leave, and once in awhile he'd say, 'Good night, Barney,' and when I got to the door, he wasn't asleep at all."" Dr. Van Valin also tried to help Jackson sleep with sedatives, including Xanax, without success, he said. Jackson, however, revealed to him in 2003 that he had a stash of propofol in a closet of his Neverland Ranch bedroom, Van Valin said. ""He said, 'Would you put me to sleep, I haven't been able to sleep for four days,' and I said, 'With what?' And he goes, 'Well, I have this stuff,' and I said, 'Mike, I don't do I.V. sedation. You need an anesthesiologist to do that.' And he said, 'Oh, it's safe, man, I used it for all those years between shows and I got put to sleep.' I said, 'I can't imagine that was good sleep."" You know, he said, ""No, it works really well."" He said Jackson told him that during his world tours him a doctor ""would put in the I.V. and put me to sleep, and he'd stay there for eight hours and wake me up 'cause I would go -- if I had three days between shows, I would have three days I didn't sleep and, you know, that I couldn't put on the show I wanted to have, you know, I mean, I want my shows to be, you know, as high end as possible."" ""Sounds like a doctor who did his job, not like this other guy, who just started the drip and left the room and basically put him to sleep like a dog,"" Van Valin said. Jackson was ""pretty complacent"" when he rejected his request for help with propofol and he never asked for it again, Van Valin said. Dr. Conrad Murray told CNN's Anderson Cooper in April that Jackson had ""his own stash"" of propofol in his home before he began treating him with it in 2009. ""I did not agree with Michael, but Michael felt that it was not an issue because he had been exposed to it for years and he knew exactly how things worked,"" Murray said. ""And given the situation at the time, it was my approach to try to get him off of it, but Michael Jackson was not the kind of person you can just say 'Put it down' and he's going to do that."" Jackson lawyers argue that AEG Live was negligent for not checking out Murray's distressed financial situation before agreeing to pay him $150,000 a month. It created a conflict of interest that led Murray to ignore safe practices and his responsibility to Jackson's health, they contend.","Jackson had a stash of propofol in his Neverland bedroom, doctor testifies .

"(CNN) -- An attorney for a Montana teacher who admitted to raping his 14-year-old student is asking the judge in the case to cancel a hearing scheduled for Friday. In a response filed Thursday with the Yellowstone County Court, attorney Jay Lansing joined prosecutors in saying that the new hearing would be ""without legal authority."" The judge scheduled the hearing after admitting that the sentence he imposed may have been against the law. The case drew widespread attention when District Judge G. Todd Baugh imposed the 30-day sentence on Stacey Dean Rambold and made controversial comments about the victim, saying she ""seemed older than her chronological age."" In an order this week, the judge said that it now appears the mandatory minimum is two years, not 30 days. He said the court, ""if necessary and appropriate,"" would amend the sentence at Friday's hearing. Such a hearing, however, would ""create confusion and uncertainty for all parties left to interpret and execute the sentence of Mr. Rambold,"" Lansing argued. He said his client contends the sentence imposed, which prosecutors are appealing, is lawful and appropriate. Also Thursday, prosecutors filed an emergency petition with the Montana Supreme Court, asking it to stop the scheduled hearing. While acknowledging ""the district court's effort to correct the error at the trial court level,"" they wrote that the ""only remedy prescribed by statute and case law is appeal before this Court. ""Further, the September 6 hearing, if permitted to be conducted, will undermine the State's appeal and otherwise frustrate the just and orderly administration of ordinary appeal processes,"" the petition read. Rambold admitted raping the girl while he was her teacher at her high school. Cherice Moralez was 14 at the time. She took her own life shortly before her 17th birthday.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A senior Pakistani official says his country will release one of the founding members of the Afghan Taliban. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who's being held in a secret location, is a controversial member of the Afghan Taliban who used to be the organization's second-in-command, after Mullah Mohammed Omar himself. Sartaj Aziz, an adviser to the Pakistani prime minister on national security and foreign affairs, said that Baradar could be released as soon as this month. Speaking to CNN, Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, a spokesman for the Foreign Office, said: ""We have decided in principle to release Mullah Baradar, and he will be released at an appropriate time."" Baradar was captured in 2010 in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, which is known to be a haven for many militants from across the country and its bordering regions. This is the second peaceful overture by the newly elected Pakistani government to neighboring Afghanistan. On Saturday, it released seven Taliban figures to facilitate the peace process. That release came just two weeks after Afghan President Hamid Karzai visited the capital of Islamabad and stressed Pakistan's assistance in a path to peace. Karzai has long pushed for Baradar's release; his government was suspected to be in secret talks with the wanted militant when he was captured. Baradar had been under U.N. sanctions since February 2001, with his assets frozen and travel banned. The United Nations had forbidden selling weapons to him.","Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar could be released as soon as this month, an official says .

"(CNN) -- Thirteen Boston deputy fire chiefs have signed a letter of ""no confidence"" in Fire Chief Steve Abraira regarding his handling of the Boston Marathon bombings, according to the letter, which CNN independently obtained from a deputy chief who signed it but requested anonymity. The deputy chiefs wrote of their displeasure to Boston Mayor Thomas Menino on April 26, according to the letter. ""You can unequivocally consider this letter a vote of no confidence in Chief Abraira,"" the deputy chiefs wrote in the letter. They said the chief failed to assume command responsibility or show any leadership at the scene. ""Despite the fact that the members of the BFD command staff have become accustomed to this 'ghost fire chief,' nothing prepared us for his actions, actually inactions, on the day of the horrific terrorist attack at the Boston Marathon,"" the letter reads. ""At a time when the City of Boston needed every first responder to take decisive action, Chief Abraira failed to get involved in operational decision-making or show any leadership,"" the letter continues. In the letter, the deputies describe an e-mail that Abraira sent to all department members, saying that when he arrived at the scene, ""it was clear that our Command Officer had the incident well in hand and that our department was fully active in a support role with our law enforcement partners."" The deputies call Abraira's argument ""illogical"" and ""mere rationalization to justify his behavior,"" saying that when Abraira arrived, the Boston Fire Department was ""still heavily involved in the incident"" because of the possibility of ""second explosions,"" ""additional suspicious packages"" and ""structural stability concern of buildings,"" among other issues. But Abraira defended his actions to CNN. ""In their estimation, they believe that if you don't assume command, you don't have responsibility there for what goes on,"" he said. ""I tried to explain to them, if I'm on the scene, I'm still responsible. That's it. But they don't believe it."" Boston's top cop asked if bombing was preventable . The chief told The Boston Globe that he was comfortable with the way his commanders were handling the incident. ""The nationally accepted practice is that you only take command (as chief) if there's something going wrong or if you can strengthen the command position or if it's overwhelming for the incident commander, and none of those things were in fact happening,"" he told the paper. The president of the Boston City Council, Steve Murphy, told CNN Wednesday that he was at the finish line shortly after the bombings and ""personally I didn't see anything but selfless heroic acts on the part of the fire, EMT and police personnel."" But Murphy added, ""if all 13 of our district chiefs are expressing no confidence then that concerns me."" He said if the mayor did not act in response to the letter that the City Council, which funds the fire department, would look into the functioning of fire department command during upcoming budget discussions. The twin blasts at the end of the Boston Marathon on April 15 killed three people and wounded more than 260 others. Six people remained hospitalized Wednesday, according to a CNN count. One of two bombing suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died after a gunfight with authorities four days later. After much secrecy and protest, he was buried in a rural Virginia cemetery this month. To locals' surprise, Tamerlan Tsarnaev buried in Virginia cemetery . Police took his brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, into custody on April 19 after finding him hiding in a boat in the backyard of a Watertown, Massachusetts, home.

"London (CNN) -- British police arrested two men following a trespassing and burglary incident at Buckingham Palace this week, authorities said Saturday. The Metropolitan Police are still investigating the incident Monday night in which at least one man scaled a security fence to gain entry to the palace. One man was arrested for burglary, trespass and criminal damage, police said. The man was found inside the palace in an area open to the public during the day, police said. The second man was arrested for alleged conspiracy to commit burglary. No members of the royal family were at the London residence during the incident, police said. The incident has prompted a review of security at Buckingham Palace, the best known of Queen Elizabeth II's palaces. It's not the first time an intruder has managed to get into the central London palace. In 1982, Michael Fagan was arrested in the queen's bedroom after gaining access to the building via a drainpipe. According to news reports from the time, the queen woke to find him by her bed and talked with him until she was able to raise the alarm. That incident led to promises of tighter security at the palace. Other incidents have occurred since, but none has involved anyone getting as close to the queen as Fagan did. However, in 2004, a fathers' rights campaigner dressed as Batman evaded security to stage a protest on a Buckingham Palace balcony. Jason Hatch, a Fathers 4 Justice campaigner, used a ladder to scale the perimeter fence before climbing onto the balcony, where the royals appear on ceremonial occasions such as the wedding of Prince William and Catherine in 2011. Concerns escalated after a Daily Mirror reporter got a job at Buckingham Palace as a servant before U.S. President George W. Bush stayed there during a state visit in November 2003. Stand-up comedian Aaron Barschak had highlighted lax security by gate-crashing Prince William's 21st birthday party at Windsor less than six months earlier. Buckingham Palace's 19 State Rooms, filled with magnificent paintings, sculpture and antique furniture, are open to paying visitors in summer, when the royal family is elsewhere. The palace is the administrative center for the royal household, as well as the queen's London residence. Laura Smith-Spark reported from London and Nicky Robertson reported from Atlanta.","Police say they've arrested two men after one scaled a fence to get into Buckingham Palace .

"(CNN) -- Mark Hasse ""had an absolute passion for putting away bad guys, and he enjoyed nothing better,"" his boss said. Now investigators are looking into whether that passion led to Hasse being gunned down outside his office in Kaufman, Texas, where he was an assistant district attorney. Hasse was killed in the parking lot of the Kaufman County courthouse Thursday morning, shot several times after ""a very small, very short confrontation,"" Police Chief Chris Aulbaugh said. ""It was apparent that he was not expecting to have anything happen,"" Aulbaugh said. ""He was on his way to his office."" Investigators are looking into whether Hasse's killing was retribution for any of the prosecutions he led, Aulbaugh said, ""but we can't say we're confident that that's where it came from."" District Attorney Mike McLelland called Hasse ""a stellar prosecutor"" who knew that threats were part of the job, and he vowed to put away the ""scum"" who killed his assistant. ""I hope that the people that did this are watching, because we're very confident that we're going to find you,"" McLelland said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. ""We're going to pull you out of whatever hole you're in, we're going to bring you back and let the people of Kaufman County prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law."" Hasse was one of 13 prosecuting attorneys in Kaufman County, each of whom handled between 380 and 390 cases, McLelland said. ""He was a lot of fun. He was the premier storyteller of the office. He had lots of stories to tell,"" including surviving the crash of a World War II aircraft that left him in a coma, ""caved in half his skull"" and cost him his sense of smell. ""It was five kinds of miracles he survived that,"" McLelland said. There have been no arrests, and Aulbaugh and other officials who addressed reporters Thursday afternoon appealed to the public for help. The local CrimeStoppers group and a Kaufman businessman have put up a total of $20,000 in reward money for information leading to a conviction, Aulbaugh said. The Texas Rangers, the FBI and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have joined the manhunt, and ""we are in the process of running down many leads right now,"" he said. Kaufman County sheriff's spokeswoman Pat Laney said investigators are looking for an older-model, four-door sedan, either brown or silver, but it wasn't clear whether there were one or two suspects Thursday afternoon, Laney said.

"(CNN) -- An Arkansas sheriff died early Friday during a rescue attempt at a home deluged by floodwaters, officials said. Scott County Sheriff Cody Carpenter apparently drowned in the swiftwater rescue bid, according to Keith Stephens, spokesman for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. Two people at the home and a state wildlife officer who had been with Carpenter are missing, Stephens said. Scott County is about 150 miles west of Little Rock, near the Oklahoma border. Western Arkansas was hit hard Thursday by a powerful storm that also delivered blows to parts of Oklahoma and other states. The National Weather Service noted reports of tornadoes in at least seven communities in western Arkansas -- as far west as Polk, as far south as Garland County, and as far north as Oden. At least nine people statewide had suffered injuries as of Thursday night -- before the death in Scott County -- state emergency management spokesman Tommy Jackson told CNN. That figure includes four minor injuries in Oden, three in Clark County and two hurt by a lightning strike in Benton County. Two homes were destroyed in Oden, about 50 miles west of Hot Springs, according to Jackson. The weather service noted, too, that power lines were knocked down and Highway 88 was blocked at one point. Three houses were reportedly damaged and three people were injured around the small Clark County town of Amity, according to the same agency. Flooding was a problem in many places. In Coffeyville, Kansas, police rescued people from 16 vehicles in a 1Â½-hour stretch on Thursday afternoon after they got trapped due to intense flooding, fire department Capt. Wayne Joplin said. Water in the streets went up to cars' headlights, if not higher, after ""torrential rain"" fell on ground already saturated by storms the previous night. ""The gutters and our storm system couldn't handle it,"" the captain said.

"(CNN) -- China blasted the United States on Saturday for its recent public criticism and urging of diplomacy to address territorial disputes in the South China Sea, saying the U.S. statement shows ""total disregard for the facts"" and sends ""a seriously wrong message."" The blistering statement, from Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang, follows one issued the previous day by a counterpart at the U.S. State Department. The debate revolves around who controls islands and waters in the South China Sea. Countries such as Vietnam and the Philippines lay claim to some areas. Qin stated unequivocally Saturday that ""China has indisputable sovereignty over the South China Sea and adjacent waters."" Acting U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Patrick Ventrell began his statement Friday insisting the United States does ""not take a position on competing territorial claims ... and (has) no territorial ambitions in the South China Sea."" Yet he added that Washington believes countries ""should work collaboratively and diplomatically to resolve disputes without coercion, without intimidation, without threats and without the use of force."" Ventrell suggested that not all nations in the region are taking this latter approach, expressing U.S. concern about the ""increase in tensions in the South China Sea"" in the form of ""confrontational rhetoric,"" ""coercive economic actions and the incidents around the Scarborough Reef, including the use of barriers to deny access."" ""In particular, China's upgrading of the administrative level of Sansha City and establishment of a new military garrison there covering disputed areas of the South China Sea run counter to collaborative diplomatic efforts to resolve differences and risk further escalating tensions in the region,"" Ventrell said, before urging the nations involved to agree on ways to peacefully address disputes. Qin, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, started his statement -- which was posted on his ministry's website -- by accusing the United States of confounding ""right and wrong"" and undermining regional efforts to ""uphold peace and stability in the South China Sea and the Asia-Pacific region at large."" China's action in Sansha City, specifically, is a ""necessary adjustment"" that falls ""well within China's sovereign rights,"" the spokesman said. Qin accused other nations of not abiding by a 2002 agreement involving Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, members. The Chinese spokesman then singled out Washington for what he suggested was hypocrisy and ""unfounded accusations ... against China's normal and reasonable acts."" ""People cannot but question the true intention of the U.S. side,"" Qin wrote. He challenged the United States for overlooking other nations ""marking out a large number of oil and gas blocks in the South China Sea"" and claiming ""as its own China's islands, reefs and waters."" Washington, too, has ignored it when other nation's navies have threatened Chinese fishermen, Qin claimed. If the United States truly wasn't taking positions on territorial disputes, then why did it speak up now and ""stir up trouble at a time when countries concerned in the region are stepping up dialogue?"" he asked rhetorically. ""The United States needs to follow the trend of the times and respect the shared aspirations and consensus of countries in the region for peace, stability and development,"" Qin said. ""It should respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and act in a way that contributes to stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific and not otherwise.""","The U.S. issued a statement criticizing China on South China Sea territorial disputes .

"(CNN) -- I love Schrodinger's cat. There are many versions of this famous paradox but here's my favorite ... You put a cat in a bunker with some unstable gunpowder that has a 50 percent chance of exploding in the next minute and a 50 percent chance of doing nothing. Until we look in the bunker, we don't know if the cat is dead or alive, but when we do look, sure enough, it is dead or alive. If we repeat the experiment with enough cats and gunpowder, then half the time the cat will live and half the time it will die. But, before we look, the cat is dead and alive; it is only the act of looking that forces nature's decision. For the cat's part, it will either see the gunpowder explode or not. So, the gunpowder explodes and the cat sees it explode or the gunpowder doesn't explode and the cat doesn't see it explode. The cat's reality becomes entangled with the outcome of the experiment and it is only our observation of the cat that forces nature to collapse into one reality. Thank God -- or physics -- that football isn't as complicated. At least, it never used to be. The globalization of our game means that domestic football in this country is now represented by players from all over the world who bring with them different faiths and cultural traits that entangle with our own. Occasionally, some of these different cultures smash together with all manner of pundits, journalists and fans eager to give their interpretation of the results. If I were to ask members of our youth team on Monday morning whether anybody from the Football Association or the Premier League has ever spoken to them about racism, I will bet everything I hold dear to me that every single one of them will say ""no"". So one of two things happen: either players try too hard not to say something that could be construed as racist -- and do. Or nobody says anything. And that is particularly scary. The problem is there is a lack of real education on the issue. Throwing t-shirts at players to wear before matches is not education. Don't get me wrong. We all know what racism looks like in its crudest form, such as the disgraceful monkey gestures we've seen in the Premier League from some fans already this season or the throwing of bananas on to the pitch as happened to the legendary Brazilian left back, Roberto Carlos, while playing in Russia. What is required is a little education to fill in the gray areas. Take Alan Hansen, a former Liverpool player who is now a pundit on Britain's highlights show ""Match Of The Day"", who in 2011 described black players as ""colored"". There but for the grace of God -- or physics -- goes me. Because when we were growing up in the early 1980s, my father was at pains to point out the correct term for a black person was ""colored"" and not as some of the other kids in the street used to say, ""Darkie"". We were told to call the man that lived on the end of our row ""Indian"", even though I am convinced that nobody had a clue where he was from. You certainly never used the ""P"" word, even though at the time the word could be heard frequently on some of the nation's most popular television shows. But, of course, nobody is going to tap you on the shoulder 10 or 20 years later with an update and, as we know, so much of what a person learns in childhood will shape their adult life. But that doesn't make it acceptable to plead generational or cultural ignorance. It took an FA-led commission, the report of which ran to 115 pages, to determine whether or not Luis Suarez, the Liverpool striker, had racially abused Patrice Evra, the Manchester United defender, in 2011. The commission had to consider that in Suarez's native Uruguay, the word ""negro"" is a widely used term that black people use to greet one another. But, after all, Suarez is mixed race and playing his football in England. Suarez was eventually banned for eight games and fined $63,000 due to a lack of video evidence. Keep in mind that John Terry, the former England captain, was banned for four games, despite all the video evidence that was presented during his hearing on whether he had racially abused Anton Ferdinand, the Queens Park Rangers defender. Perhaps the most lenient punishment of all came last month when UEFA, football's European governing body, imposed what ""Kick It Out"" chairman, Lord Ouseley, described as a ""paltry"" $95,000 fine on the Serbian FA after England's black players were racially abused during an Under-21 match in Krusevac. The Professional Footballers' Association, a body which presents the interests of players in England and Wales, can occasionally be heard in the middle distance calling for tougher punishments. But its chief executive, Gordon Taylor, would do well to get in front of the players who he represents instead of the TV cameras he seems to prefer. In the absence of any leaders educating the next generation, we continue to see unsavory episodes. We are arriving very quickly towards a state of extreme paranoia, where everybody is a racist until it's proven that they're not. Take the absolute farce at Stamford Bridge last year when Chelsea complained referee Mark Clattenburg had called midfielder John Obi Mikel a ""monkey"". When I phoned my friend at Chelsea, who was in the dressing room as things were kicking off, he told me that even the rest of the Chelsea players didn't believe Mikel and said as much to him. But Mikel's claim was backed up by his Brazilian teammate, Ramires, who, as my friend put it: ""Hardly speaks any English."" It is common knowledge that Clattenburg calls almost every player on the pitch by his nickname and, as my friend said: ""We know in all likelihood that the ref has called him ""Mikey"" but what can we do?"" Premier League rules state that clubs have to make their complaint after the game, when tensions are obviously running high and people are emotional. Again, as my friend said: ""We didn't want to complain but we had to."" Fair enough, but the fact the story made its way into the public domain almost before the players had left the stadium could have cost Clattenburg his career if the story hadn't been so unbelievable. Fortunately, Clattenburg was later absolved. You don't need me to tell you that a football changing room is a unique place to work in. We bend more rules than the Catholic church and each player will be pushed as close to their tolerance threshold as possible in an attempt to find the boundaries of acceptable mockery. There are examples of this behavior every single day. During the running sessions in which the fitness coach will tell you that ""we're looking for winners"", the person who crosses the line first will usually be abused based on a strong feature that they have. So a person with a big nose might hear a fellow professional shout: ""He won it by a nose!"" A few weeks ago, somebody shouted to a black player: ""He won it by a lip!"" And everybody laughed, including the player who the comment was directed at. But there are also players who have their own unique relationship with each other. I know a black player and a white player who go out of their way to deliver insult after insult about each other's race and personal appearance. They are strong characters and enjoy engaging each other on that level and treat their relationship, it seems to me, as a test of quick wit. It's worth pointing out that they do it only in front of the squad. It's been like that at every club I've played for. I remember a ball getting stuck in a tree at one club and a black French player saying to an African player ""you climb this tree, you a bigger monkey than me"" before the pair of them fell about laughing. Some comments you will hear at most football clubs. They seem to travel as players move around and become entangled in the clubs' genes. Tackling racism should never be considered the job of one person or organization. The task is too great and, if I may say, too diverse. Nobody seems to know what the right thing to say is anymore and it could be that point which prevents people stepping forward to speak out. Maybe quantum mechanics is easier after all. In Schrodinger's book, ""What Is Life?"" he talks about each individual's consciousness as being only a manifestation of a unitary consciousness that pervades the universe. His best-known work on wave mechanics known as ""Schrodinger's Equation"" goes some way to explaining the inter-connectivity of the universe at a quantum level. Think of Suarez and Evra as ocean waves or tornadoes. At first glance, they appear to be two separate bodies, but they're not. That is simply the way we chose to perceive them. Waves and tornadoes are simply water and wind stirred up in different directions. The truth is that nothing is separate and everything is related. The colors that we see exist only in our own consciousness. ** With special thanks to The Secret Footballer's good friend Mr T, working at CERN.

"(CNN) -- If voters in the United Kingdom were offered the chance tomorrow, in a snap referendum, to change the name of the nation to ""Team GB"" the result would hardly be in doubt. Such is the mood of euphoria fostered by the country's gold medal-winning performers, and London's successful staging of an Olympic Games that some had predicted would become the latest in a long tradition of Great British cockups, that a country more used to wallowing in sporting failure is waking up to the unfamiliar feeling of giving itself a collective pat on the back. A little more than two weeks ago, London was a city pregnant with angst, the final preparations dogged by a security scandal that required 18,000 military personnel -- almost double the number of British troops currently deployed in Afghanistan -- to be drafted in to guard venues, fears of transport meltdown and lingering arguments over spiralling costs and an uncertain legacy. Now all of that has largely been pushed aside. Even self-styled sporting skeptics have been forced to abandon all pretense of curmudgeonliness as the nation basks in a self-congratulatory golden glow. ""Admittedly I'm the guy who wrote that I'd rather drink paint than have to sit in a stand and watch this stuff, but that was last week and the world has since changed,"" wrote Hugo Rifkind, summing up the endorphin-fueled mood swing in the Times newspaper. At a constellation of sites clustered around the Greenwich Meridian, London delivered a stellar spectacle that largely ran like clockwork. The showcase Olympic Park proved an elegant setting as Usain Bolt cemented his claim to be the all-conquering, swaggering sporting icon of his generation by defending his 100- and 200-meter sprint titles, and Michael Phelps confirmed his status as the greatest Olympian in history, adding four golds and two silvers to his total haul of 22 medals. Elsewhere, beach volleyball, played out incongruously amid austere ministries of government and not a little sniggering from the stands, served up a novelty hit in a country where beaches are more associated with donkey rides than bikinis, while the city's landmarks and parks offered telegenic backdrops and enthusiastic crowds whenever the games ventured onto the streets, culminating Sunday in a men's marathon bathed in sunshine. These were an open-minded and progressive games, in which a handful of women from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Brunei competed for the first time, and where the double amputee Oscar Pistorius, nicknamed Bladerunner, bestrode the gap between Olympics and Paralympics, by representing South Africa on the track. Yet the ultimate success and atmosphere of any major sporting event inevitably hangs on the fortunes of the hosts, and in this regard British competitors could hardly have delivered more. A tally of 29 gold medals and third place in the medals table represented Team GB's best performance at an Olympiad since 1908, leaving the country's traditional sporting antagonists such as Australia, Germany and France flailing in its wake. In cycling, London's homegrown hero Bradley Wiggins achieved cult status by riding to victory in the time trial just days after he had become the first British winner of the Tour de France. In the velodrome, home riders raced to seven of the 10 gold medals on offer, prompting frenzied French speculation that the British had developed ""magic wheels."" But it was a glorious Saturday night in the main stadium that would be Team GB's defining moment, as heptathlete Jessica Ennis, long jumper Greg Rutherford and 10,000-meter runner Mo Farah all won gold in quick succession. In the disparate backgrounds of the country's champions, some saw further proof of the sort of self-confident, inclusive society that Danny Boyle had sought to capture in an opening ceremony widely acclaimed as ""bonkers and eccentric"" but dismissed as ""multicultural crap"" by one right-wing lawmaker. Asked by a journalist whether he would prefer to be representing his country of birth, Farah, who left war-torn Somalia for London when he was a young boy and who would subsequently also stride to gold in the 5,000 meters, seemed to sum it up: ""Look, mate, this is my country. This is where I grew up, this is where I started life. This is my country and when I put on my Great Britain vest, I'm proud. I'm very proud."" Still, others also drew quiet inspiration from the performance of the flame-haired and freckled Rutherford. ""Seeing a ginger in the Olympics #hope,"" one teenager posted on Twitter. Even some of the Games' gaffes would prove triumphant vignettes. If all that was missing from the faux-green and pleasant land of Boyle's tone-setting re-imagining of British history was a village idiot, the Olympic Village soon found a ready-made one in the bumbling figure of Boris Johnson. Photographed stranded on a zipwire high over east London, wearing an unflattering blue safety helmet and clutching a pair of Union flags, London's maverick mayor proved himself immune to politics' normal gravitational laws, returning to Earth to dodge questions about whether his ""good Olympics"" had fueled prime ministerial ambitions. ""How could anybody elect a prat who gets stuck on a zip wire?"" was Johnson's knowingly self-deprecating reply. For a city of London's stature and international reputation, it might have surprised some observers that pessimists and doomsayers had been so confidently vocal in the buildup to the games. But British administrators had previous history of delivering dismally on grand projects, from the debacle of the unloved Millennium Dome -- re-purposed for the games as a basketball and gymnastics arena -- to the lengthy, budget-busting delays in rebuilding the Wembley football stadium, and the scrapping of plans to host the 2005 world athletics championships. Even Queen Elizabeth II's rain-soaked Golden Jubilee in June, endured with stiff upper lip stoicism by monarch and monarchists alike, appeared to offer a foretaste of grim gray skies and the embarrassing spectacle of a once mighty imperial power in perpetual decline. More seriously, preparations for the games were inextricably linked to the 2005 London bombings that killed 52 people just one day after the city had celebrated winning hosting rights. Nagging fears of a further atrocity would justify a heavy-handed security operation that included the deployment of warships in the Thames, rocket batteries on rooftops and a no-fly zone in the skies overhead, and the confiscation of family picnics at the entry to Olympic sites. Ultimately though, the games can be judged to have delivered a cathartic and regenerative moment for a city which just one year ago found itself under scrutiny for the wrong reasons amid the worst urban unrest in decades. If the face of London then was of a hooded looter clutching a stolen television, now the legions of purple-shirted volunteers, widely hailed as the heart and soul of the games, have become ambassadors for a society seemingly more at ease with itself in all its colors and contradictions. Whether that spirit of goodwill can be kept alive when the afterglow has faded and Britons wake up to headlines about their worsening economic problems and a coalition government in deepening disarray remains to be seen. The wider United Kingdom, which mostly seemed to put regional rivalries and London-bashing aside for the duration of the games, still faces the existential threat posed by the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, though the sight of gold medal-winning Scots such as Andy Murray and Chris Hoy posing with Union flags will have done no favours to the nationalist cause north of the English border. Attempting to make snap historical sense of seemingly seismic shifts in national mood is also a notoriously fickle business, and in the UK in particular there should be a wariness of getting caught up too exuberantly in the moment. The collective outpouring of grief that followed the death of Princess Diana in 1997 is now looked back on by many with bemusement, as is the brief ""Britpop"" moment of the mid-1990s, dubbed ""Cool Britannia"" by Vanity Fair magazine, which soon lost its lustre, exposed as a feeble parody of British music's 60s heyday. Other countries to have experienced a similar bounce in fortunes on the back of sporting triumph have also struggled to cling to the moment. France's celebrated victory on home soil at the 1998 World Cup, achieved by a team of black, white and Arab footballers, was widely hailed as a watershed moment for multiculturalism there, but few were still talking so complacently about social integration by the time the banlieues exploded into rioting in 2005. London's organizers, keen to distance themselves from the awesome projection of China's growing power put on by Beijing in 2008, were always modest about their expectations, choosing to draw instead on the spirit of the city's post-war ""Austerity Games"" in 1948 by pledging to host an event humbler in scale than its predecessor but warmer in tone. But, above and beyond that, the city triumphed in putting on a show rich in human spirit at its most optimistic that will shine with luminosity in the collective memory long after the extinguishing of the flame.","Britain widely hailed for its staging of 2012 Games, says Simon Hooper .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Tourism destinations deep inside India's tiger parks will be closed indefinitely after the Supreme Court of India imposed an interim ban on all tourism activities in core areas of tiger forests. ""(Until) final directions of the court, core areas in tiger reserves will not be used for tourism activities,"" the court said in the order issued Tuesday, according to a report by the Times of India. The decision also imposed a fine of 10,000 rupees ($178) on six states that did not comply with the court's previous decision in April, which required that all states must identify core zones and buffer zones of their tiger reserves as part of a rolling effort to regulate where tourist attractions can be located. India is home to the world's largest population of tigers -- 1,706 of them -- according to the World Wildlife Fund. That number has dropped from more than 100,000 at the beginning of the 20th century due to poaching and habitat encroachment. Read more: Photographer documents trafficking of endangered animals . There are 40 tiger reserves across the country, according to the National Tiger Conservation Authority of India. Tiger reserves are set up throughout India to provide a protected environment for animals still in the wild. Resorts and villages were set up for tourists, local as well as foreign, to see the tiger habitats and perhaps catch a glimpse of the big cat. Now the future of tiger tourism is in question. The ban is in place while the court considers a claim filed by a local environmentalist alleging that ecotourism was hurting the habitat and breeding grounds of the endangered species. The court is expected to release its final ruling on August 22. Ecotourism promises to bring travelers closer to nature with minimum environmental impact. The court is investigating whether tourism in India's tiger parks is in fact low impact. Read more: Which is safest country for animals? Toby Sinclair, vice president for the Ecotourism Society of India, told CNN he believes the government is allowing too many visitors into the parks. ""The eco in ecotourism has changed to economy,"" Sinclair said. Last April the court ruled that all states must identify core zones and buffer zones of their tiger parks as part of a rolling effort to regulate where tourist attractions can be located, according to the Times of India report. Tourist resorts and villages are to be located only in the buffer zones of parks. States are reluctant to identify buffer zones, however, for fear it will displace existing resorts, the Times reported. Sinclair, however, doesn't think buffer zones will solve the problems. ""Buffer zones are a step toward the solution,"" Sinclair said. ""But the question remains 'Who is going to manage the buffer zones?'"" Video: Meet India's tiger hunters . Wildlife enthusiast and photographer Shashanka Nanda of New Delhi, who has taken part in dozens of safaris in the past few years told CNN he believes that while the court's heart is in the right place, its approach is flawed. ""Responsible and regulated tourism forges a human connection to wildlife. Just seeing tigers in textbooks won't affect people to change,"" he said. ""If you stop tourists and enthusiasts, you're losing half the battle of wildlife conservation,"" he added. Nanda also argues that responsible tourism enforces a system of accountability. The presence of undesired elements like poachers gets noticed, he said. The decision is not expected to have major immediate impact on tourism as many tiger reserves are closed during the monsoon. If the ban remains in place, however, it is expected to have a significant impact on the livelihoods of communities in and around the reserves whose income depends on wildlife tourism. CNN's Sumit Galhotra contributed to this report.","India's Supreme Court has temporarily banned ecotourism in the country's tiger parks .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has been placed under house arrest, Pakistani media reported Thursday. The Pakistan government said earlier Thursday it would obey an order by Islamabad's High Court to arrest Musharraf, Pakistan's interim Minister of Information Arif Nizami said. The order is legally binding, said Nizami, who is acting as a spokesman for the government. The government had to act within 24 hours of the high court decision or face contempt of court charges. Local TV stations earlier showed police entering his villa compound, where Musharraf went after being quickly ushered from the court by his private security detail. The arrest order was made at the same time the court rejected Musharraf's request for a bail extension in a case he is facing over the detention of judges in 2007. The ruling set the stage for his arrest and has further undermined his political ambitions. Musharraf's office called the Islamabad court's decision ""unwarranted judicial activism"" that was ""seemingly motivated by personal vendettas,"" and said it would appeal against it at the Supreme Court. But Ibrahim Satti, one of Musharraf's attorneys, told local TV reporters that they had arrived at the court too late in the day and that the Supreme Court refused to accept the appeal. Satti said Musharraf's legal team would seek to file the appeal Friday instead, local TV stations reported. Since Musharraf's court appearance Thursday, his spokespeople have given contradictory statements about his legal status. Musharraf remains in his Islamabad home. Meanwhile, the Islamabad High Court issued a ruling calling the inspector general of Islamabad police to court Friday to explain why his officers did not arrest Musharraf in court Thursday as instructed. The high court ruling asks the inspector what precise steps police took to arrest Musharraf. The ruling also says that when Musharraf allegedly ordered the house arrest of senior judges in 2007, it was an ""act of terrorism"" to prevent the judges from doing their job. Musharraf halted from running for parliament, lawyer says . Return from exile . Musharraf resigned as president of the South Asian nation five years ago and went into exile in London and Dubai. He returned to Pakistan under heavy security to contest three court cases against him and run in upcoming elections. But so far, his return does not seem to be going according to plan. This week, Pakistani election officials barred Musharraf from running for a seat in parliament, a decision his lawyer has said he will challenge in the Supreme Court. That decision appears to have emboldened members of the judiciary, many of whom have bitter memories of their treatment by Musharraf during his time in power. The rejection of bail Thursday came in a case in which Musharraf faces accusations that he illegally imposed house arrest on senior judges during a period of emergency rule he imposed six years ago. It wasn't immediately clear how the high court's ruling would play out. Pakistani authorities also have an inconsistent track record in enforcing court decisions against prominent figures. A January court order for the arrest of Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf in connection with a long-running corruption case has yet to be carried out. No former Pakistani army chief has been arrested before, and former presidents have only ever been placed under house arrest, never sent to jail. When asked last week about his fears of arrest, Musharraf brushed the question aside. He had previously received bail extensions in the cases concerning him. And he was initially granted ""protective"" bail to ward off potential arrest when he returned to Pakistan. But the judiciary appears to have taken a more aggressive line than he may have expected, stepping up the pursuit of cases against him. Musharraf: 'There is no case against me' Accusations over Bhutto . Besides the case concerning the detention of the judges, Musharraf is also accused separately of not doing enough to protect the life of Benazir Bhutto, the first woman to be elected prime minister of Pakistan. A leading member of the opposition, she was assassinated on December 27, 2007, after leaving a campaign rally in Rawalpindi, just two weeks before the general election in which she hoped to be returned to office. In another case, he is charged with ordering his troops to kill Nawab Akbar Bugti, a popular tribal leader in the volatile province of Balochistan, in 2006. Musharraf was disqualified from contesting elections in Pakistan because of the state of emergency he declared in 2007. Even though he hasn't been tried for that action, the move was ruled an act of treason, making him ineligible to run for office. Musharraf maintains he should not be barred because he has not been convicted of any criminal acts. Some Pakistanis are happy to see the return of the ex-military ruler, hoping his leadership could help restore order to a country riddled with political division and plagued by extremist violence. But he also made many enemies in the final years of his presidency, notably among the judges he detained. The Pakistani Taliban vowed to send a death squad to hunt down the former president if he returned to the country. Musharraf has said he has been living under threats of death since September 11, 2001, when he supported the American war on terror and fought against the Taliban. The former general became president after a bloodless coup in 1999. Musharraf's popularity began declining in 2007 after he suspended the nation's Supreme Court chief justice for ""misuse of authority."" The move resulted in protests and accusations that he was attempting to influence the court's ruling on whether he could seek another five-year term.

"(CNN) -- By a margin of 82-56, the Maryland House of Delegates voted Friday to ban the death penalty in that state. The bill now goes to the desk of Gov. Martin O'Malley, who has pledged to sign it. ""To govern is to choose, and at a time where we understand the things that actually work to reduce violent crime, when we understand how lives can be saved, we have a moral responsibility to do more of the things that work to save lives,"" O'Malley said at a news conference. ""We also have a moral responsibility to stop doing the things that are wasteful, and that are expensive, and do not work, and do not save lives, and that I would argue run contrary to the deeper principles that unite us as Marylanders, as Americans, and as human beings,"" O'Malley added. NAACP President Benjamin Jealous called the action ""what courageous, principled political leadership looks like,"" and Archbishop of Baltimore William Lori said he applauded the general assembly ""for choosing to meet evil not with evil, but with a justice worthy of our best nature."" O'Malley thanked both the NAACP leadership and the state's faith leaders for their support. Baltimore County state attorney Scott Shellenberger, a prominent opponent of the bill, said eliminating capital punishment was unnecessary, since Maryland's current policy is judicious and one of the ""most restrictive in the country."" Since a law was passed in 2009, a judge can impose death in Maryland only if one of three factors exists: DNA evidence, a videotaped confession or a videotaped murder. Maryland has executed only five people since 1976, one of whom Shellenberger prosecuted in the '80s. Delegate Neil Parrott, a Washington County Republican, said most state residents don't want to see the death penalty abolished, but the governor and the ""Annapolis eite"" used political arm-twisting to push the bill through the legislature. But Parrott said the death penalty move ""does open a door"" to petition, or challenge, such a law and bring it up for a referendum. Parrott has set up mdpetitions.com, a website devoted to pursuing petitions targeting laws ""passed by a liberal-leaning legislature in Annapolis that simply do not make sense."" Parrott says it's too early to say how opponents of the ban will proceed if and when the bill is signed. He said it's ""excruciatingly difficult"" to get a petition on the ballot, but members of mdpetitions.com will be consulted on what to do. O'Malley will make a case-by-case decision regarding the state's five current death row inmates, according to a statement from the governor's office. Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown called Friday ""a great day for Maryland."" ""We saw a death penalty, a long history of racial bias, inaccuracies, injustices, and today, we decided that as a state we could do better. Today is a victory for those who believe that fairness and truth and justice, and not retribution or bias, are fundamental to our core beliefs as Marylanders,"" Brown said. Shellenberger said confining the racial argument to the state of Maryland, four studies on the issue have ascertained ""no purposeful racial discrimination done on anyone in any of those cases."" And when it comes to the retribution argument, Shellenberger said he believes in ""the deterrence of one,"" when a person is convicted of a heinous murder beyond a shadow of doubt, ""Every person will never be subjected to that person killing again."" O'Malley introduced the legislation in January. The state Senate approved the bill last week. Maryland will become the sixth state in as many years to replace capital punishment with life in prison without parole. Currently, 33 states, plus the federal government and the U.S. military, have the legal option of imposing the death penalty, while 17 plus the District of Columbia do not. CNN's Bill Mears and Joe Sterling contributed to this report .","Both houses of Maryland's legislature have now voted to ban the death penalty .

"(CNN) -- Indonesia's president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, has apologized to Singapore and Malaysia for the hazardous air pollution caused by smoke from forest fires raging in his country. Jakarta has sent planes, helicopters and an extra 3,000 personnel to fight the fires, which have been blamed on the clearing of land for palm oil plantations . ""For this incident, I, as President of Indonesia, would like to apologize to Singapore and Malaysia and ask for their understanding. Indonesia did not want this to happen and we are trying to address this problem responsibly,"" he told a news conference on Monday evening. Schools in many areas of Malaysia were closed on Monday and a state of emergency was declared in two southern regions after the country's air pollution scale spiked to hazardous levels on Sunday morning, Bernama, Malaysia's state news agency reported. The country's air pollution scale exceeded 700 in two areas of Johor state. According to the index, a reading above 300 is considered hazardous. ""The schools are ordered to be closed as a precautionary measure since the bad air quality will affect the health of students,"" Second Education Minister Datuk Seri Idris Jusoh said. Classes were back to normal for most schools on Tuesday as the air quality improved. Shifting winds also allowed Singapore, which has been enveloped in smog for most of last week, to breathe easier. The city's air pollution index stood at 52 at 11 a.m. local time on Monday, falling after the wind direction changed to southerly from southwesterly on Sunday. Last week, the index hit its highest levels since 1997, with a reading of 371. The city's National Environment Agency said air quality becomes ""very unhealthy"" when the index passes 200. Fires have raged in several spots on the island of Sumatra for more than a week, spreading acrid smoke to Singapore and Malaysia. Authorities have been using three helicopters to ""water bomb"" the flames and in the past four days 7,000 liters of water have been dumped on the areas hit by the fires. A Cassa aircraft is also being used to seed clouds in attempt to create rain. On Tuesday, Jakarta sent 3,000 firefighters, military and police personnel to reinforce the 2,000 already working to extinguish the fires in Sumatra, where 265 locations have been identified as hotspots. ""I have given instructions to mobilize the power we have, the resources we have including funding. There should be no obstacles in disbursing these funds,"" President Yudhoyono said. According to the US-based World Resources Institute, most of the fires are on land owned or managed by timber companies and palm oil plantation owners. Last week, it released a list of 17 timber companies and 15 palm oil plantation operators, including two headquartered in Singapore. The chief of Indonesia's National Disaster Agency, Syamsul Maarif has said that the government is investigating which companies operating in Sumatra may have caused the fires. Singapore said it would take legal action against local companies found to be involved and pressed Indonesia to provide evidence, the New Straits Times reported. ""We will offer no succor or refuge if the action of the companies have indeed been illegal in Indonesia and impacted on Singapore,"" Foreign Minister K. Shanmugam said. The minister added that he would raise the issue at the upcoming meeting of foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Authorities in Singapore are anxious to avoid a repeat of the 1997 Southeast Asian haze, which the government estimates cost $9 billion in health care costs and disrupted air travel and business. Journalist Katie Hunt wrote and reported from Hong Kong, CNN's Kathy Quiano reported from Jakarta .","NEW: Indonesia's president apologizes to Singapore and Malaysia over smog .

"(CNN) -- Eleven people died as Hurricane Sandy pummeled Cuba on Thursday, state media reported. Nine deaths occurred in Santiago de Cuba province and two bodies were recovered in Guantanamo state, national media reported, citing civil defense authorities. Cuban President Raul Castro will travel Friday to Santiago de Cuba, the country's second largest city, to survey the damage. More than 3,000 buildings were damaged in eastern Cuba, state television reported. ""I lost an upstairs room and part of my roof. There are trees down all over the place. Everyone is in shock. We have never had a storm hit like this,"" said a woman named Dulce, a doctor in the city of Santiago. Residents in Santiago spent Thursday assessing the extent of the damage. There was no electricity, and very few people had working phones, Dulce said. Heavy rain in Cuba brings with it potential health risks. Flooding over the summer in Granma province contaminated wells, leading to a cholera outbreak, the first Cuba had experienced in a century. The same province was hit hard by Sandy. In the Bahamas, as Olivia Jorjani and her mother were trying to watch the World Series game between power outages, tree branches in Nassau started to break and fall, and parking lots began to flood. It was just a matter of time before the lights went out again, and ""then we will play gin by candlelight,"" the iReporter said from her home on New Providence Island. Bahamians and their guests hunkered down Thursday night as Sandy, a Category 2 hurricane, tore through the islands with 100 mph wind and the potential for up to 12 inches of rain. New Yorker John Trudden was staying at Club Med on San Salvador Island, celebrating a friend's birthday with 10 buddies. He said they will be confined to the hotel, which gave them food and drink to take to their rooms, until 8 a.m. Friday, when officials expect most of the storm to have passed over. Before Sandy arrived, Nassau resident Stephan Rolle wasn't overly worried. It is a ""small storm"" with ""mediocre wind,"" he said. Rolle, 29, waited for 40 minutes in line at a grocery store to purchase nonperishable goods and bread. He moved the potted plants and emptied part of his family's pool to make room for the rainwater. Sandy may not be a Category 5 monster, but ""we take it seriously, and we just want to make sure we are comfortable,"" he said. As of 8 p.m. ET, the eye of the storm was 105 miles (170 kilometers) east of Nassau, sparing the Bahamas' largest city the worst part of the storm. ""I don't think that it's going to do significant damage. Think there could be some debris, but in Nassau things are not as bad as they may be in the outer islands,"" CNN iReporter Cynthia Russell, an administration manager, said. Along the U.S. East Coast, residents were told to be wary headed into the weekend. CNN meteorologist and severe weather expert Chad Myers said Sandy could have a bigger impact than Irene did last year, when it glanced off North Carolina before plowing into the Northeast. ""This could be like the 'Perfect Storm' 21 years ago,"" he said of the potential damage. ""It depends on where it hits."" The ""Perfect Storm"" was the result of a nor'easter and Hurricane Grace combining into a one storm. In this case, a system approaching from the west is expected to interact with Sandy. To what extent is the question to be answered in the next four days. For now, Sandy is proving to be a windfall for surfers familiar with tamer tides. Even hundreds of miles away, the storm kicked up powerful surf off Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Jason Russo, a visitor from Connecticut, couldn't resist jumping in. ""I went in the water, I did about three somersaults ... strong rip current,"" he told CNN affiliate WSVN. Fort Lauderdale's Ocean Rescue advised beachgoers to stay out of the water, but acknowledged not everyone would heed the warning. ""The expert surfers will be out there, so we just tell them to be careful, and we're there if they need our help,"" Chief Breck Ballou said. ""We're there to go out and get them."" On Friday, more high waves and rip currents are likely along the coastal beaches of Florida's east coast and into southern Georgia, as well as tropical storm force wind gusts up to 50 mph. Saturday, tropical storm force wind gusts reaching 50 mph might be felt as far north as the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Rip currents and high waves will also be an issue along coastal Georgia and the Carolinas, with significant coastal flooding possible, especially during high tides. The five-day forecast from the National Hurricane Center predicts the center of the storm will shadow the East Coast in the coming days, with Sandy potentially making landfall as a tropical storm in New Jersey the day before Halloween. Sandy also claimed two lives before reaching Cuba. A woman in western Haiti's Camp-Perrin died Wednesday when she tried to cross a flooding river in the Ravine du Sud, according to Haitian news agency AHP. And CNN affiliate TVJ reported a man in Jamaica was killed when he was hit by a boulder sent tumbling downhill by the storm's rain. In the Dominican Republic, Misael Rincon, a CNN iReporter, couldn't sleep as Sandy's rain beat down on Santo Domingo because he knew his neighborhood is prone to flooding. He drove to work on Thursday but had to change his route several times, as he encountered roads with water levels too high. Even though he drives an SUV, a blue Ford Explorer, he was not high enough off the ground to avoid having water seep into his vehicle. ""I'd say 70% of the streets in Santo Domingo are flooded,"" he said. Some cars were submerged, and people with trucks were charging motorists $5 to pull their vehicles to higher ground, he said. There were some good Samaritans, too. The government ordered evacuations of high-risk zones and canceled schools.

"(CNN) -- A laptop, some empty fireworks and a jar of Vaseline landed three friends of Boston Marathon bomb suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in jail Wednesday, charged with trying to throw investigators off their buddy's trail. Those are the items federal prosecutors say Azamat Tazhayakov, Dias Kadyrbayev and Robel Phillipos took from Tsarnaev's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth in the hours after the FBI released photos of Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan, the suspects in the marathon bombings. According to FBI affidavits, they quickly recognized their friend from the pictures. When Kadyrbayev texted his friend to tell him ""he looked like the suspect on television,"" Tsarnaev texted back ""lol"" and added, ""come to my room and take whatever you want,"" the affidavit states. Phillipos, Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev went to the room, where Kadyrbayev noticed a backpack containing fireworks that had been ""opened and emptied of powder,"" according to the affidavit. ""Kadyrbayev knew when he saw the empty fireworks that Tsarnaev was involved in the marathon bombing,"" the affidavit states. All three are accused of removing items from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the April 15 bombings, which killed three people and wounded more than 260. According to the affidavit, they left with the backpack, the Vaseline -- which Tazhayakov believed could be used to make bombs -- and Tsarnaev's laptop. Read the criminal complaint . By the time they got back to the apartment in New Bedford that Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev shared, the Tsarnaev brothers had been named as bomb suspects, and the three friends ""started to freak out,"" Phillipos recounted after what the affidavit stated had been four previous interviews. ""According to Kadyrbayev, they collectively decided to throw the backpack and fireworks into the trash because they did not want Tsarnaev to get into trouble,"" the affidavit states. Investigators found the pack, fireworks and Vaseline in a landfill last week after a two-day search. The complaint doesn't state what happened to the laptop. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov, both from Kazakhstan, were already in federal custody on immigration charges. They're charged with obstruction of justice, while Phillipos, a U.S. citizen, is charged with lying to federal agents probing the bombing. FBI details how suspect's friends took, trashed backpack . Probe stretches from Boston to Russia . Wednesday's developments come after more than two weeks of intensive investigation that has stretched from Boston to the restive Russian republic of Dagestan, where the Tsarnaev brothers' parents now live. Federal officials say investigators remain very interested in talking with Tamerlan Tsarnaev's widow, Katherine Russell, about what she may have known about her husband's travel and associations, as well as about any encounters she may have had with the two suspects in the aftermath of the attack. Russell spoke to her husband after his picture appeared on national television as a suspect, two sources familiar with the investigation told CNN on Wednesday. The nature of the conversation remains under investigation, but the sources said there was some concern that Russell spoke with her husband but did not call authorities who were still seeking to identify the men in the photos. Russell's lawyers had no immediate comment on that report. On Tuesday, attorney Amato DeLuca said Russell ""will continue to meet with law enforcement, as she has done for many hours over the past week, and provide as much assistance to the investigation as she can."" Officials say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has told investigators his brother was the mastermind of the attack. Investigators are looking into whether Tamerlan Tsarnaev was influenced toward radical Islam during a six-month visit in 2012 to Dagestan, a region where Russian forces are battling jihadist guerrillas. The elder Tsarnaev's body remained unclaimed in a state medical examiner's morgue Wednesday. His wife wants his family to claim the body, DeLuca said Tuesday. Of the scores of people injured in the blasts, 17 remain in five Boston-area hospitals, though none is in critical condition, according to information the hospitals provided to CNN on Thursday. Three people have been discharged since Tuesday, according to the hospitals' figures. Timeline: The Boston Marathon bombing, manhunt and more . Lawyers say Dzhokhar's friends cooperated . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's friends made their first appearance before a judge Wednesday afternoon, when they were read the charges against them and informed of their rights. All three started at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth in 2011, along with Tsarnaev. Only Tazhayakov is still enrolled, and he's been suspended ""pending the outcome of the case,"" university spokesman Rob Lamontagne said. They waived bail requests until a later court date. At one point, Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler admonished Phillipos, ""I suggest you pay attention to me, rather than looking down."" Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev appear in a photograph with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev taken in New York's Times Square during an earlier visit. They were taken into custody last month on charges that they had violated the terms of their student visas, Kadyrbayev attorney Stahl said last week. All three were questioned at length on April 19, when the manhunt for Tsarnaev was in full swing. Tsarnaev's brother Tamerlan had been killed in a gun battle with police early that morning, while Tsarnaev was captured alive but badly wounded that night. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is being treated for gunshot wounds at a federal Bureau of Prisons medical center in Devens, Massachusetts. About a month before the marathon attack, Tsarnaev had told Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov ""that he knew how to make a bomb,"" according to an FBI affidavit recounting the charges. Kadyrbayev told investigators that Tsarnaev ""appeared to have given himself a short haircut"" two days after the bombings. Carjacking victim recalls experience . Kadyrbayev's lawyer Robert Stahl said his client ""did not have anything to do"" with the bombing and disputed charges that he tried to obstruct the investigation. And Harlan Protass, who represents Tazhayakov, said his client ""has cooperated fully with the authorities and looks forward to the truth coming out in this case."" On Wednesday, he said Kadyrbayev was accused of a ""technical violation"" of a student visa ""for not regularly attending classes."" Federal law enforcement sources said at the time that the Kazakh students were being detained ""in an abundance of caution"" because authorities wanted detailed information on the Tsarnaevs' movements in the weeks and days before the attack. Phillipos faces up to eight years in prison if convicted, along with a $250,000 fine; the charges against Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov carry sentences of up to five years and $250,000 in fines. Alan Dershowitz, a prominent defense attorney and Harvard law professor, called the obstruction charge ""weak,"" suggesting it was meant to pressure the suspects into providing more information on Tsarnaev. ""If that's the best the feds have now, then they're just squeezing,"" Dershowitz told CNN. ""It doesn't sound like they have very much new here."" Early discussion of avoiding the death penalty . One of the reasons Kadyrbayev drew investigators' attention was because of changes to his Facebook page, a source briefed on the Boston probe said. Kadyrbayev and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev changed their profile photos within 15 minutes of each other in the pre-dawn hours of April 19, while the Tsarnaevs were on the run, the source said. Tsarnaev, who appears to have had access to a wireless device at that time, changed his to a black-and-white photo, while Kadyrbayev changed his photo to one of him wearing an Iron Man mask, the source said.

"(CNN) -- An Atlanta-area woman is angry after she says police used a little-known messaging feature on Facebook to contact her after her son was killed. Anna Lamb-Creasey says it took several weeks to find a message from Clayton County police telling her to call them. The news was that her son, 30-year-old Rickie Lamb, had died after being hit by a car January 24. Even after finding the message, she initially ignored it. Lamb-Creasey says the message came from a Facebook account under the name ""Misty Hancock"" that featured an image of Atlanta rapper T.I. as its profile picture. ""I'm like, OK. ... I'm thinking it's just fake,"" Lamb-Creasey told CNN affiliate WSB-TV. On Facebook, users can message other users who are not their friends. But those messages show up not in their inboxes but in an ""Other"" folder that many users don't know to look for. Clayton County police did not immediately return a message Tuesday seeking comment. They told WSB they had tried reaching Lamb's family in more conventional ways, including visiting several physical addresses, but were unsuccessful. Police told the station Monday that they were investigating why the message was sent from what appears to be a personal account instead of an official one. The family finally contacted police on Valentine's Day when Lamb-Creasey's daughter, who received a similar message, called them. A tearful Lamb-Creasey said she's furious at the department. ""They told me that they did the best that they can do. But I'm not sure about that,"" she said. ""If they can track a criminal down, they couldn't track me down? They could have done better. I've been on my job 13 years. They could have found me.""","Woman is angry after police sent Facebook message asking her to call .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Monday rejected separate appeals from two Texas death row inmates, one involving an admission of an illicit affair between the prosecutor and the trial judge. The justices without comment turned aside Charles Hood's challenge of his conviction. A state appeals court earlier this year ordered a new trial on the sentencing phase. Hood was convicted of the 1989 murder of Tracie Lynn Wallace and her boyfriend Ronald Williamson in their home outside Plano, Texas, which is just north of Dallas. The former nightclub bouncer has denied the charges. He was arrested while driving the victim's car and his fingerprints were found at the murder scene. It was only after the trial that Hood's lawyers learned of the romantic relationship between then-Judge Verla Sue Holland and one-time district attorney Tom O'Connell. Various state courts have rejected the assertion the affair cost Hood a fair trial. His lawyers Monday vowed to continue the fight to prove his innocence. ""We are disheartened that the United States Supreme Court ruled not to hear the case of Charles Hood in which the trial judge and district attorney who prosecuted Hood engaged in a secret, long-term, extramarital affair,"" said Andrea Keilen, director of the Texas Defender Service, a legal group representing Hood. ""This is particularly disappointing given that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to date has ignored this obvious and outrageous constitutional violation."" After her stint as a trial judge, Holland joined the state's highest criminal appeals court before resigning in 2001. That is the same court that ruled in February that Hood deserved a new trial on his punishment. The judges did not mention the affair in that decision. But the state high court last year refused Hood a new trial based on the admission of the affair. Neither the judge nor prosecutor were sanctioned for their behavior by the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct or by the state bar. The case is Hood v. Texas (09-8610). In the separate appeal, the high court refused to intervene on behalf of one of the nation's longest serving death row inmates. Delma Banks was convicted of the murder 30-years ago this week of 16-year-old Richard Whitehead in eastern Texas. Banks' original 2003 execution date was postponed over allegations of prosecutorial misconduct at his trial. Various courts have since allowed the execution to go forward. Banks' attorneys claim faulty eyewitness testimony and the exclusion of blacks on the all-white jury prevented him from receiving a fair trial. Banks is African-American, his victim was white. The case is Banks v. Thaler (09-717). The justices also put off a decision on another high-profile capital case from Texas, which executes more prisoners per year than any other state. Henry ""Hank"" Skinner has made an actual innocence claim, demanding DNA testing on other evidence gathered at the crime scene. The justices had issued a stay just before his scheduled March 24 execution, to consider whether capital inmates have a basic right to have forensic evidence reviewed. Skinner, 47, was convicted of the the New Year's Eve 1993 killings of his live-in girlfriend and her two sons. He strongly denies any involvement. Texas Gov. Rick Perry has received more than 8,000 letters from Skinner's advocates urging a new trial, according to the Innocence Project and Change.org, whose members and supporters have sent the letters through their Web sites. Prosecutors maintain forensic evidence gathered at the scene and witness statements point to Skinner. The Supreme Court had scheduled the appeal for decision Monday. The justices are now expected to again take up the Skinner case later this week, and would decide whether to hear oral arguments on the larger constitutional questions presented. They have no deadline on deciding the matter. The case is Skinner v. Switzer (09-9000).","The justices turned aside Charles Hood's challenge of his conviction .

"El Paso County, Colorado (CNN) -- A man who dedicated his career to working in the prison system was gunned down in his Colorado home, and investigators are on a nonstop hunt for his killer. ""Tom Clements was someone who worked in a cold, dark world with a remarkably open and generous heart,"" said an emotional Gov. John Hickenlooper. He appointed Clements in 2011 to lead Colorado's prisons after Clements spent decades working to improve Missouri's corrections system. Clements, 58, answered the door at his Monument home Tuesday night and was shot dead, the El Paso County Sheriff's Office said. Monument is about 50 miles south of Denver. Hickenlooper seemed broken up about Clements' death as he spoke, and said he chose to go ahead with signing landmark gun control legislation the same day, as previously planned. The measures were pushed after 12 ""Batman"" moviegoers were shot to death last summer in Aurora, Colorado. ""And I think it's a coincidence, but an incredibly tragic and sad coincidence, that we have to process this all in a single day,"" the governor told CNN affiliate KUSA. But Hickenlooper said he was ""all about carrying on."" Clements' wife, Lisa, urged the governor not to even think about delaying the signing. ""He would have expected us to sign these bills and go forward today,"" Hickenlooper said. ""That's just the kind of man he was."" The new legislation includes a 15-round limit on magazines, universal background checks for prospective gun buyers and a requirement for gun purchasers to pay for their own background checks. It becomes effective July 1. Asked about a possible motive, Lt. Jeff Kramer of the sheriff's office said that authorities know that Clements' position with the prison system ""opens a dynamic"" in the investigation, meaning that someone related to the prisons may have wanted to harm him. ""Because of the fact that Mr. Clements served in the position that he did ... we're sensitive to the fact that there could be any number of people who may have a motive for wanting to target him for a crime such as this. ""However, we also remain open-minded to all of the other possibilities as well because we don't want to follow one particular trail and find ourselves perhaps missing something along the way,"" Kramer said. Reporters asked the governor whether Clements was ""active"" in his support for the new gun legislation, Hickenlooper replied: ""He was supportive but he wasn't particularly active."" The lieutenant told CNN that Clements had not received any threats that authorities were aware of. As news cameras trained on the governor while he signed each gun measure, investigators combed Clements' neighborhood, talking to neighbors and searching for clues. One of those clues is a car that was seen near Clements' home at about the same time a 911 call was made by a relative in Clements' home telling authorities about the shooting. A resident noticed a late-1990s model boxy vehicle, possibly a Lincoln, in the area, said Kramer of the sheriff's office. The resident told investigators that the car was about 200 yards from Clements' house on Colonial Park drive at about 8:30 p.m. and it was running but empty. The 911 call was made at 8:37 p.m., Kramer said. The resident told investigators that a few minutes after seeing the empty car, the resident saw the car again, but someone was inside and driving away. The car was headed in the direction of a road that leads to an interstate highway, Kramer told CNN. Authorities said they are looking for a woman who may have information concerning that vehicle. She was described as a white female, between 35-50 years of age. She was wearing light pants, a dark windbreaker and a hat, and may have been speed walking on Clements' street Tuesday night. Officials stressed she is not a suspect, but is just someone they want to speak to. They are not releasing the name of the relative who made the 911 call, but said the caller was the only other person home at the time. Kramer added that it's unclear whether that relative was in the same room as Clements or in another part of the house. Wednesday morning, Hickenlooper ordered flags in the state lowered to half-staff between sunrise and sunset until after Clements' funeral. Arrangements are still being made. The governor repeatedly praised Clements Wednesday afternoon, calling him a ""dedicated, committed, funny, caring expert at corrections"" who tried to ensure that prisoners had adequate support before their release. ""In many ways, Clements helped define what a public servant is,"" the governor said. ""He did his job quietly and intently."" In addition to his wife, Clements leaves two daughters, Rachel and Sara, the governor's office said. Clements' family released a statement through that office, thanking everyone for their support and concern. ""Our family has lost a devoted husband and a beloved father,"" it read. ""There are no words at this time to describe our grief and loss. We thank our friends and those praying for us here and across the nation. Your well-wishes and prayers bring us strength. We appreciate your continued respect for our privacy during this terrible loss."" Hickenlooper appointed Clements as chief of the state's prison system in January 2011, according to Clements' online state biography. Before that post, he worked for 31 years in the Missouri Department of Corrections. From October 2007 until January 2011, Clements was the director of adult institutions for the department, the biography says, overseeing 21 adult prisons. CNN's Jim Spellman reported from Colorado. Ashley Fantz wrote this story in Atlanta and Shawn Nottingham contributed.","NEW: Family of Tom Clements says it lost a devoted husband and father .

"(CNN) -- 4,316,233. That's how many babies were born in the United States in 2007, the highest number ever. But after that, the number dropped. Last year, just over 4 million boys and girls were born in the 50 states. The likely reason? The economy, of course. A decline in fertility rates that began in 2008 is closely linked to financial woes that started at the same time, said a new Pew Research Center report issued Wednesday. Changes in personal income, per capita GDP, unemployment rates and claims, and state-level foreclosure rates all had an effect. In 2007, there were 69.7 babies per 1,000 women of childbearing age. Provisional data for 2010 showed that number had dropped to 64.7. The actual number of births from 2008 to 2009 rose only in one state, North Dakota, which also posted one of the nation's lowest unemployment rates at 3.1%. ""This does not conclusively prove that the economic changes led to fertility changes,"" the Pew report said. ""However, the timing is consistent with the time it might take people to act upon fertility decisions."" Historically, there's evidence to back up the Pew analysis. Demographer Carl Haub said baby busts have occurred in other bleak economic eras of U.S. history. During the Great Depression, the fertility rate fell to 76.15. During the oil shock decade of the 1970s, it plunged to 64.99. In that sense, what's happening now is normal. ""It's almost certainly due to a lack of confidence in the economy,"" said Haub of the private Washington-based Population Reference Bureau. Having children, he said, is expensive. You have to feed them, clothe them and send them to day care. And that's hard when you're without a paycheck or booted from your house. The same kinds of trends affect European nations as well. Fertility rates plunged, for instance, in Eastern Europe when the breakup of the Soviet Union destroyed the local economy. And they are down now, amid the current crisis, Haub said. ""Unemployment is rising and the airwaves flood our living rooms and cars with one bit of scary news after another,"" Haub wrote in a 2009 report predicting birth rate declines in the current recession. ""Bad news travels fast and furiously these days, much more so than in the 1970s and 1930s."" But that's not to say that Americans don't want children anymore, Haub said. They are simply waiting for more prosperous times. The Pew report said Hispanics, whose employment levels and household wealth were hit hard by the recession, experienced the largest fertility declines of any racial or ethnic group. From 2008 to 2009, birth rates dropped by 5.9% among Hispanic women. For African-American women, rates dropped 2.4%, and they dropped 1.6% among white women. In 2009, the Hispanic birth rate of 93.3 births per 1000 women was the lowest since 1999. That came after a year when unemployment among Hispanics increased 2.0%. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, Hispanics have also been the biggest losers in terms of wealth in the recession -- Hispanic households have lost 66% of their median wealth from 2005 to 2009. Haub said the drop in American birth rates is not significant enough to be alarming -- there's not going to be a shortage of people anytime soon. But the decline could have a significant impact on markets that cater to children and families and also affect the need for teachers or other providers of children's services. And things don't appear to be changing anytime soon. ""We're probably in for a somewhat longer term depression of the birth rate,"" Haub said. ""The economy has definitely put a damper on it.""","A new Pew report says America's birth rate plunged after 2007 .

"Berlin (CNN) -- U.S. President John F. Kennedy's ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" speech delivered 50 years ago was well received by more than 100,000 Germans hopeful for America's steadfast support as Berlin came to symbolize one of the Cold War's main battlegrounds. As presidential candidate in the summer of 2008, Barack Obama had nearly twice that number of optimistic onlookers at Berlin's Victory Column who eagerly anticipated a new American outlook on questions ranging from climate change to nuclear disarmament. The state visit to Germany this week, with a public appearance in front of the Brandenburg Gate, will most probably offer transatlantic reassurances and deliverables from the United States as echoed by both Democratic and Republican presidents in the past; but instead, the current American president should take this as an opportunity to bring Germany out of its shell and persuade it to act as a legitimate power in world affairs. Although looked on as a traditional ally of the U.S. along with the UK and France, Germany has often taken a backseat within the trio since it struggles to find a comfort zone in the realm of hard security. Reminders of World War II's devastation -- and Germany's role in that -- have shaped the EU's largest country to showcase its economic prowess rather than its military capabilities. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the United Kingdom spends nearly double on military expenditure as a percentage of GDP in comparison to Germany, and France is not far behind Britain. Yet today the cards are reshuffled, the economic crisis has left the UK and France weak and inward looking while Germany for the most part weathered the storm. Germany's new standing in Europe and the world has garnered it respect and scorn, something that comes with the territory for a great power. President Obama recognizes Germany as a leading global player, and has mentioned the country in his last two State of the Union speeches. The U.S. has cultivated its relationship with Chancellor Angela Merkel: she was honored with a state dinner at the White House in 2011 and two years before that she was the first German chancellor in more than 50 years to address the U.S. Congress. Five decades ago, Germany was a trusted partner and a protectorate of the U.S.; today it is Washington that needs Germany's support in taking transatlantic relations to the next level. With the UK dangling threats to opt out of the EU and France struggling to jump start its economy; the U.S. should encourage Germany to reignite the European project in order to show the world that Europe can be an essential partner when it comes to confronting challenges around the world. OPINION: Rehn: No need for UK 'threat' to leave EU . Three areas calling for German leadership are the euro crisis, transatlantic trade and multilateral security. Within Europe, Germany doesn't have to solely spread the mantra of austerity, it could also share its lessons learned in economic reform and commitment to vocational education -- not too long ago it was labeled the Sick Man of Europe while today unemployment is below 7%. On behalf of Europe, Germany should spearhead the current Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the United States and Europe that is on the negotiating table. TTIP will enhance the prosperity gains on both sides of the Atlantic and set the ground rules for trade as a check to China. Finally the U.S. needs NATO-member Germany to play a stronger military role at hot spots around the world. The misdeeds of Germany's past should never be forgotten, and German decision-makers are sensitive to historical responsibility, all the more reason to support their allies when ushering change in despotic countries -- Libya was one such case. Parallels between two young presidents representing a vision of America a half a century apart will certainly be drawn during Obama's state visit to Germany. There might even be a line for the history books after the speech at the Brandenburg Gate, but Obama knows there is no pressure. Germany's expectations for America have dampened since his last visit and Berlin today shows scant scars of 1963. It is the U.S. that hopes Germany will step up and take the leadership mantle in Europe and elsewhere. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sudha David-Wilp.","Barack Obama makes a state visit to Germany this week .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Beijing for talks Tuesday, with competing maritime claims of China and its neighbors expected to dominate the agenda. Tensions over territorial disputes have spiked this year between China and a string of countries around its coastline -- from Vietnam in the southwest to Japan in the northeast -- and the United States has been drawn into the fray. Clinton met with Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi Tuesday. She is scheduled to hold a news conference with Yang Wednesday and meet with several leaders, including President Hu Jintao. Yang welcomed Clinton and stressed ""important progress in some areas"" in their relationship, according to remarks released by the U.S. State Department. ""Maintaining the healthy and steady development of our relationship serves the fundamental interests of our two countries and two peoples and is conducive to stability, peace, and development in the Asia Pacific region and beyond,"" he said. Clinton stressed ""the importance of the practical cooperation that underlies our comprehensive relationship."" ""We are committed to building a cooperative partnership with China; it is a key aspect of our rebalancing in the Asia Pacific. And we have had a lot of in-depth consultations and high-level meetings over the last three and a half years."" In Indonesia Monday, Clinton reiterated that ""the United States does not take a position on competing territorial claims over land."" Instead, the U.S. government is pressing China and other countries in the region to agree to a code of conduct and procedures for resolving disagreements peacefully. Interactive: Asia's disputed islands - who claims what? But Beijing, which prefers to tackle the disputes bilaterally, has reacted angrily to Washington's involvement in the matter, accusing the State Department of ""unfounded accusations"" and showing a ""total disregard of facts."" The Global Times, a Chinese newspaper affiliated with the ruling Communist Party, said in an editorial published Tuesday that Clinton's diplomacy in the region ""has fomented frictions between China and some surrounding countries."" It called on her to ""reflect upon the deep harm she is bringing to the Sino-US relationship."" Clinton will have to negotiate such Chinese hostility to U.S. efforts to address the tangle of tensions across the South China Sea and beyond. More: Islands dispute reopens old wounds . Countries like Vietnam and the Philippines lay claim to some areas of the South China Sea, a 1.3 million square-mile patch of the Pacific Ocean dotted with hundreds of largely uninhabited islands and coral atolls. But China has declared ""indisputable sovereignty"" over large swathes of the area, which is rich in marine life. The stakes are raised further by estimates that potentially huge reserves of natural gas and oil lie underneath the seabed. The scope for conflict was demonstrated in April when a Philippine Navy vessel confronted Chinese fishing boats in a remote rocky outcrop claimed by both countries.

The resulting naval standoff between the two countries lasted for more than three months and aroused fears of an open conflict before the Philippines withdrew its ships in June, citing stormy weather. The issue of who the lagoon belongs to remains unresolved. Analysts have expressed pessimism that the disputes in the South China Sea will be defused soon. ""While the likelihood of major conflict remains low, all of the trends are in the wrong direction, and prospects of resolution are diminishing,"" the International Crisis Group said in a July report. Tensions have also flared recently over a long-running dispute concerning a group of islands in the East China Sea claimed by China, Japan and Taiwan. Furious anti-Japan protests erupted across China last month when a Japanese group sailed to one of the disputed islets and symbolically waved Japanese flags. And on Sunday, the controversial governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, dispatched a team to survey the islands as part of an effort to purchase them from the private owners. Chinese state-run media immediately declared the survey ""illegal."" The uninhabited islands are known in Japan as Senkaku and in China as Diaoyu, and are privately owned by a Japanese family.","NEW: Secretary of State Clinton is visiting Beijing for meetings .

"(CNN) -- ""Multiple people"" were injured after a small plane crashed into an Orlando area Publix supermarket Monday evening, the Volusia County Sheriff's Office said. ""All customers were evacuated safely and all Publix associates are accounted for,"" Publix spokesman Dwaine Stevens said. The store remained closed late Monday. The first calls about the incident in DeLand, Florida, about 35 miles outside of Orlando, came about 7:20 p.m., Officer Brandon Haught with the Volusia County Sheriff's Office said. Authorities were on the scene within minutes, officials added. There was some ""structural damage to the store's roof,"" Stevens said, but little else was affected. Aerial video from local Orlando affiliate WFTV showed nearly a dozen emergency crew vehicles responding to the scene.

"(CNN) -- Here's what we know about Saturday's crash landing of Asiana Flight 214 and some of the key questions raised by those facts: . 1. Based on the debris field, the aircraft appears to have struck the rock sea wall well before the start of the runway. There are some marks on the sea wall, consistent with an impact of some part of the plane. Some aircraft debris ended up in the water. What we don't know: Did the flight crew simply land the aircraft short? 2. Passengers onboard the aircraft describe the engines spooling up and the nose tilting up just before impact, and a preliminary review of the flight data and cockpit voice recorders appear to show the pilots attempted to abort the landing 1.5 seconds before impact. 3. The debris field runs from the water, slightly right of the paved threshold and runway center, all the way to the stopped aircraft fuselage. The Boeing 777 lost its tail section, including vertical and horizontal stabilizers, near the end of the paved threshold, just before the start of the runway. What we don't know: Is this an indication the tail of the aircraft detached after first impact? 4. What appears to be the Boeing 777's right engine is detached from the wing and wedged against the right side of the fuselage. Another engine is a considerable distance from the fuselage in a grassy area to the right of runway 28L. This appears to be the left engine. Girls killed in crash were headed for camp . What we don't know: When did the engines detach? Given the debris on the right side of the runway, could the engine off to the side actually be the right engine? 5. A preliminary reading of the flight data and voice data recorders show the 777 was traveling well below the target approach speed of 137 knots, the National Transportation Safety Board said. 6. Flight tracking records show that the Asiana 214 flight descended from cruising altitude much more steeply and rapidly than previous Asiana flights on the same route. 7. The instrument landing system approach on runway 28L was not working on the day of the crash. It had been down for some time. Flights were landing using visual flight rules. The weather was clear. 8. The runway's precision approach path indicator lights, showing correct flight approach altitudes, were working. 9. Most of the fire damage to the aircraft occurred after the 777 came to a stop on its belly. 10. Passengers described the cabin interior as heavily damaged, with overhead bins dropping and at least one life raft/escape slide inflating inside the aircraft, trapping a flight attendant, who was freed by passengers. 11. Audio recordings of air traffic control conversations show the pilot did not declare an emergency before the crash landing. Emergency vehicles were dispatched afterward. 12. The aircraft was built in 2006 and was purchased new by Asiana. 13. All four pilots on the plane have been interviewed by U.S. and South Korean investigators, the head of South Korea's Aviation Policy Bureau said. What we don't know: What did the pilots say about the speed, altitude and other factors before the landing? Choi Jeong-ho, the head of the aviation bureau, said he could not release details pending the investigation, which he said will continue for at least a week. 14. The San Francisco Fire Department said one of the victims killed may have been struck by an emergency vehicle, San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault said. Asiana has identified the two deceased passengers as Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia of China. Both were 16. What we don't know: Which teen girl may have been struck by an emergency vehicle? And did the girl die from the plane crash or from the vehicle? Foucrault said his office is trying to determine the cause of death. Why so many people survived . CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Richard Quest and Miguel Marquez contributed to this report.","NEW: One of the deceased passengers may have been run over by an emergency vehicle .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Bishop Eddie Long, head of one of the nation's largest mega churches, announced Sunday he will take ""time off"" from the pulpit to work on his family. The announcement came three days after his wife Vanessa filed for divorce. Although her husband's church issued a statement Friday, attributed to Vanessa Long, saying she was withdrawing the divorce petition, her attorney said she was proceeding with it. Last spring, Long, head of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, settled a lawsuit filed by four young men who accused him of pressuring them into sexual relationships while they were teenagers and members of the congregation. He denied the allegations against him. ""I'm going to take a little time off to work with my family,"" Long said Sunday to a packed house at the televised service. ""I do want you to know that this is, for me and my family, especially with me, one of the most difficult times and things I've had to face, and only because my strength, other than God, is in Miss Vanessa,"" he said to huge applause. ""And I want you to rest assured that I love her and she loves me. ... In all the things that I've ever had to deal with and being pastor, my rock has been to be able to come home to a virtuous woman who always had peace in my house,"" he said. ""We're going (to) work it out,"" he said. He insisted that the two of them are not fighting, and that they are not mad at each other. Long said the situation is ""not because of allegations"" of sexual relationships last year and instead blamed the pressures of being a pastor's wife. ""It's been very difficult to her, some of the things that she's had to endure,"" he said. The church issued a statement emphasizing that Long is not stepping down, and ""will continue to be the senior pastor of New Birth."" Eddie Long's wife files for divorce . Her attorney's statement Thursday said Vanessa Long ""continues to hope that this matter may be resolved expeditiously, harmoniously and fairly."" Her divorce documents say the Longs are ""living in a bona fide state of separation."" The 12-page petition adds that Vanessa Long ""is entitled to a divorce upon grounds that the marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken, there being no hope of reconciliation of the parties, and it being in the best interest of all parties concerned that this marriage be terminated by divorce."" The statement attributed to her that was issued by the church had said, ""Upon prayerful reflection, I have reconsidered and plan to withdraw my petition for divorce from my husband, Bishop Eddie L. Long. I love my husband."" ""I believe in him and admire his strength, and courage,"" that statement attributed to her said, adding, ""My filing followed years of attacks in the media that frustrated and overwhelmed me. I love my family and church family, New Birth Missionary Baptist Church. Therefore, my husband and I have mutually agreed to find healing from these attacks. We ask that you respect our privacy during this time."" In announcing that she was still seeking divorce, her attorney Michael W. Tyler said, ""To avoid any undue confusion, Mrs. Long's future statements, if any, will be issued through her attorneys only. At this time, neither she nor we will have any further comment on this matter."" Two Eddie Long accusers break silence . The lawsuit filed against Eddie Long by the four young men alleged that he used ""monetary funds from the accounts of New Birth and other corporate and non-profit corporate accounts to entice the young men with cars, clothes, jewelry, and electronics."" Long has preached passionately against homosexuality for years. In an August interview, two of Long's accusers said they were haunted by what happened between them and the powerful pastor and added they are writing a tell-all book about their experiences. Church member talks about reals estate lawsuit against Long . ""It's just not enough anymore. I thought I could cover the pain up. I thought I could move, start over and everything will go away. I was terribly wrong,"" Jamal Parris, one of the accusers, told CNN affiliate WSB. Parris pointed to a ""JL"" tattoo on his arm, which he said stands for ""Jamal Long."" He said Long was with him when he got the tattoo. He said that he grew up without a father and that Long preyed on that vulnerability. ""To have a man love me for just who I was. I just had to be me and love him back,"" Parris said. CNN's Mia Aquino contributed to this story .","NEW: Church insisted Long is not stepping down .

"(CNN) -- Getting children to take a nap can be hard. Getting them to eat pancakes is not nearly as difficult. Police in Westerville, Ohio, say a 37-year-old mother operating a day care out of her home hit upon a plan -- she allegedly crushed medications that cause drowsiness and put them in the pancakes. Tammy Eppley has been charged with six counts of child endangerment. Her first court date is July 12. Eppley, who runs the Caterpillar Clubhouse, cared for six children -- including one of her own -- between the ages of 2 and 5, police said. ""This is mortifying. I'm a very private person and I'm very protective of my children and the children in my care,"" she said. Investigators believe she used medications such as the allergy medicine Benadryl and supplements like melatonin to get the children to go to sleep, according to a statement from the Westerville Police. She would say something to the effect of ""I just gave them their nappy time medicine,"" Lt. Paul Scowden told CNN affiliate WCMH. None of the children suffered any illness or injury related to the alleged drugging incident. A former friend reported her to child protective services after she received a series of text messages from Eppley joking about sedating the kids. Eppley has denied the charges, claiming she was just venting in the texts. ""It was just any frustrated parent that would say when they were frustrated,"" she said. ""The kids are driving me crazy today, they're off the wall. I wish there was a drug like in sleeping beauty they would all just go to sleep."" She said she had given medications in the past, but only with parental permission.","Tammy Eppley says she is mortified by the charges .

"Santiago de Compostela, Spain (CNN) -- Police in Spain have accused the driver of a train that derailed in northwestern Spain, killing at least 78 people, of ""reckless homicide,"" the country's interior minister said Saturday. The judge has until Sunday evening local time to decide whether to press formal charges against Francisco Jose Garzon, Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz told reporters in Santiago de Compostela. The driver, who spent the past two days under detention in hospital, guarded by police, is now at the police headquarters, he said. The data recorders from the train are still with police, he added. Separately, a spokesman for the Galician regional Supreme Court told CNN Saturday morning that the judge had not yet questioned Garzon. Questions have focused on the speed at which the train was traveling as it entered a curve in the track near Santiago de Compostela on Wednesday evening. The crash on the outskirts of the city, which is popular with tourists and Christian pilgrims and was preparing to celebrate a saint's day Thursday, shocked the Galician region and the nation. Fernandez Diaz told reporters earlier Saturday there are ""rational indications"" that the accident is the fault of the driver. Pressed on what those indications are, he declined to give more details. The driver is not scheduled to appear in court Saturday. But a statement from a regional court said, ""The intention, if it is possible, is that he makes an appearance in the courts."" Galicia regional police chief Jaime Iglesias told reporters Friday that the driver was under police detention because of ""a crime."" Asked what crime, he responded: ""Well ... in connection to the accident, in connection with his recklessness, in connection with causing the accident."" The crumpled wreckage of the eight train cars sent careering onto their sides when the train derailed has now been removed from the tracks, but the grim task of identifying the dead continues. Maria Pardo Rios, a spokeswoman for the Galicia regional supreme court, told CNN late Friday that 75 victims had been identified from at least 78 people killed. At least 63 of the dead are Spanish, she said. Also among them is one U.S. citizen, Ana-Maria Cordoba from Arlington, Virginia, and a number of people from Europe and Latin America. As they are identified, most of the bodies are being returned to their grieving families, a statement from the regional justice department said. DNA testing is to be done on some remains to establish their identity and to how many people they belong, it said. Police forensic experts said at a news conference Saturday that there are 37 body parts that must still be tested to see whether they belong to bodies that have already been identified, or to others not yet known. About 80 people who were injured in the crash remained in hospital Saturday, about a third of them still listed in critical condition. At least five U.S. citizens were injured, said State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf. Local newspaper La Voz de Galicia said that a funeral service for the victims would be held on Monday evening in the cathedral in Santiago de Compostela. Going too fast? Spanish news agency Efe and national daily El Pais cited sources within the investigation as saying that the driver had said the train was traveling about 190 kilometers per hour (120 mph). Elena Garcia, a spokeswoman for national railway Renfe, on Friday did not disclose the speed the train was traveling on an express track, where cars can move as fast as 250 kph. She did say, though, the speed limit for the bend of track where the crash occurred is 80 kph. Rafael Catala, secretary of state for transport and housing, told Spanish radio network Cadena SER that the ""tragedy appears to be linked to the train going too fast,"" but that the reasons it was going so fast are not yet known. The express passenger service was nearing the end of a six-hour trip from Madrid to the town of Ferrol in northwest Spain when the crash occurred, the state railway said. Security footage revealed how, as the train hurtled around a bend, its cars derailed and slammed on their sides into a concrete support structure for a bridge. Flames burst out of one train car as another car was snapped in half in the crash. Rescue crews and fellow passengers pulled bodies through broken windows and pried open doors as stunned survivors looked on. Maria Vigo, whose home is on the bank above the rail tracks, told CNN how she heard a crash, and then the deafening squeal of metal on concrete. ""When I saw the rail car flip into the air, I imagined something just horrible had happened,"" she said. She and husband Suso sought to help the injured, taking bed sheets to wrap round the injured and ropes to haul the survivors off the tracks. Firefighter Miguel Angel Bello said the first four minutes after he arrived on the scene were a desperate race against time. He and fellow firefighters smashed windows and kicked in doors to pull out the passengers trapped inside as rail cars went up in flames. A young girl in the wreckage called out to him. ""She was under wreckage she said she wanted to get out and go home but she died,"" he said. Survivor: We looked like the walking dead . Stephen Ward, an 18-year-old from Bountiful, Utah, who is in Spain serving on a Mormon religious mission, was one of the lucky ones. Still patched up and wearing a neck brace, he told CNN's ""New Day"" show of his ordeal -- and his relief that he made it out alive and without permanent injury. Ward blacked out when the car he was in slammed on to its side, regaining consciousness only as he was being helped out of the train. It took him a couple of minutes to grasp that what he was seeing outside was not a dream -- and that people were dead. ""They were helping out other people -- there were bodies, there was screaming, there was smoke."" The survivors looked like the walking dead, he said. ""I've got staples all over my scalp, I was covered in blood. They've scrubbed most of it off me now but everyone was just covered in their own blood and occasionally the blood of others. It was gruesome to say the least."" Another victim, speaking from a hospital bed with his arm in a sling, told CNN affiliate Atlas that it seemed like the train was going fast. ""But we didn't know what was the maximum speed, so I thought it was normal,"" he said, ""And suddenly there was a curve, the suitcases fell, and everything went dark. And I hit my head a ton of times, and 10 seconds later I was wedged between seats, and I had people's legs on top of me."" As he waited for rescuers to pull him from the wreckage, he heard other passengers yelling. ""I heard little children screaming. ... I also heard two girls that yelled out, one supporting the other,"" he said. The derailment came on the eve of a public holiday to celebrate a saint's day, when more people than usual may have been traveling in the region. Planned festivities in Santiago de Compostela and across Galicia were canceled after the crash. CNN's Karl Penhaul reported from Santiago de Compostela and Laura Perez Maestro from Galicia.

"(CNN) -- At least 1,200 people have given up their jerseys bearing the name of New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez at the team's official shop now that Hernandez has been charged with murder, the team says. About 300 of the shirts that have been turned in as part of a free exchange offer are youth sizes, the Patriots reported Sunday. Hernandez was arrested June 26 and charged with murder in the death of a friend, Odin Lloyd. Prosecutors say Hernandez had a falling-out with Lloyd at a nightclub and planned his execution-style killing in the following days. After prosecutors brought charges against Hernandez, the Patriots offered fans who had purchased Hernandez jerseys the chance to trade them in. Legal woes mount for former Patriots tight end . ""We know that children love wearing their Patriots jerseys, but may not understand why parents don't want them wearing their Hernandez jerseys anymore,"" spokesman Stacey James said in announcing the offer last week. ""We hope this opportunity to exchange those jerseys at the Patriots ProShop for another player's jersey will be well received by parents."" The exchange applied only to Hernandez jerseys purchased from the Patriots' ProShop and PatriotsProShop.com. Jersey owners had to go to the ProShop in Foxborough, Massachusetts, during store hours to exchange. While the team did not release a figure of how much the exchange program is costing, a regular male jersey costs $99.95, women's jerseys cost $94.95 and youth jerseys cost $69.95, on the ProShop website. Court records: Apartment search reveals new evidence . It's a different story on eBay, where Hernandez merchandise is fetching big bucks. Official Hernandez jerseys are selling for as much as $1,500 online as former fans try to cash in on the athlete's fall from grace and others try to snatch a bizarre collectible. Authorities have said Hernandez and two other men picked up Lloyd from his Boston apartment on June 17. Surveillance cameras captured their car at an industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. Lloyd's body was found in the industrial park later that day, authorities say. Hernandez, 23, is being held without bail at the Dartmouth House of Corrections in a 7-by-10-foot jail cell. He is allowed outside of his cell for three hours a day, but has no access to television, the Internet or a weight room, Bristol County Sheriff Tom Hodgson said. He also won't be able to marry his fiancee while in jail.","The Patriots offered fans who bought Hernandez jerseys a chance to trade them in .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Prosecutors in Egypt have ordered the arrest and extradition of ex-prime minister and presidential runner-up Ahmed Shafik, along with other Mubarak-era officials, according to Egypt's state-run Middle East News Agency. The move is tied to an investigation into alleged corrupt real estate dealings involving the illegal sale of state property to the sons of former President Hosni Mubarak. Shafik, a former air force chief and the last prime minister to serve under Mubarak, lost a June presidential runoff to Mohammed Morsy. He left Egypt for the United Arab Emirates after the vote, but his attorney told CNN at the time that he was not fleeing the country. And in an interview with Egypt's state-run Al-Ahram newspaper on Tuesday, Shafik said he expected the charges and would await the results of an investigation. The judge ordered Shafik held in connection with the sale of 40,000 square meters (9.9 acres) of land in the lakeside city of Ismailia to Mubarak's sons, Gamal and Alaa. The judge also referred allegations against Gamal Mubarak, two Egyptian generals and a member of the country's pilot officer's association to a criminal court for investigation. The allegations against them include profiteering, facilitating the seizure of public property, forging official documents and deliberately damaging public property, MENA reported. Four of the counts involve Shafik alone. Legal petitions accusing Shafik of corruption were submitted in April, but prosecutors had taken no action against him when he left for the UAE, his attorney, Showee Elsayed, told CNN at the time. CNN's Aroub Abdelhaq and John Defterios contributed to this report.","NEW: Shafik tells Egyptian newspaper he expected charges .

"(CNN) -- Syrian security forces have committed ""gross violations of human rights"" since anti-government protests began in March, a United Nations report released Monday said. The U.N. independent international commission on Syria's assessment was based on interviews with 223 victims and witnesses, but observers were not allowed access to the country, the report said. According to the report, evidence ""documents patterns of summary execution, arbitrary arrest, enforced disappearance, torture, including sexual violence, as well as violations of children's rights."" Military deserters told the commission that they had been ordered to shoot at unarmed protesters without warning, the report said. ""The commission reiterates its call for immediate and unhindered access to the Syrian Arab Republic,"" the report said. Earlier this month, the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights estimated that government forces had killed at least 3,500 civilians. Syria's government has consistently blamed armed gangs for the violence and said security forces are protecting the people.

"Washington (CNN) -- Using the most unlikely of clues -- a pretzel bag -- authorities in Denmark and the United States are zeroing in on a suspected child abuser, and they are asking for the public's help in ending the exploitation of a small girl. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday released five photographs of a man carefully edited from four videos in which the man sexually assaults a young girl, believed to be 7 to 9 years old. Three of the videos, which contain a clear image of the man, are date-stamped April 14, a fourth is dated April 27, and all four appear to have been posted on the Internet several days later, on May 2. Danish National Police discovered the videos soon thereafter and notified U.S. authorities on May 3. Three factors led Danish investigators to believe the crime occurred in the U.S.: the background, some products visible in the video, and the man's appearance. In the United States, investigators with Homeland Security Investigations, the law enforcement arm of ICE, saw a Frito-Lay Rold Gold bag for thin pretzels in the videos. By studying Frito-Lay web sites, they learned that Rold Gold pretzels are packaged differently within the United States and Canada. ICE investigators believe the bag in the video is exclusively distributed in the United States. With leads coming to an end, the investigators are asking the public for help in identifying the man. ""We kind of hit a wall in this investigation. Without the public's help, we may not be able (to find the man) and more importantly stop the ongoing abuse of this victim,"" said Brian Korzak, a special agent with ICE's Cyber Crimes Center, Child Exploitation Unit. Publication of the man's photo ""will greatly increase our chances of locating this individual,"" said Special Agent Patrick Redling. ""Since the videos were created so recently, we feel there's a child in danger right now."" Korzak and Redling say investigators routinely identify both technical and visual clues in videos for evidence to identify criminals and to rescue victims. HSI is asking anyone with information about this man to contact the agency immediately by calling the ICE Tip Line at 866-347-2423 or completing an online tip form at www.ICE.gov/tips. Tips remain anonymous, ICE said, and individuals should not attempt to apprehend the suspect. ICE filed a criminal complaint in the U.S. District Court of Washington on Friday, charging the man in the photos, identified as a ""John Doe,"" of producing, possessing and distributing child pornography.","A man sexually abuses a girl in four videos posted on the Internet, authorities say .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- A small military cargo plane crashed in the Yemeni capital on Wednesday, killing all 10 passengers, the country's defense ministry said. The plane caught fire shortly after taking off from Sanaa International Airport, airport officials said. The crew tried to head back to the airport, but the plane crashed near a public market in the Hasaba area of Sanaa. The defense ministry said passengers were on a pilot training mission, with the head pilot instructing trainees from the government's armed forces. The cause of the fire -- and subsequent crash -- is under investigation, Sanaa government official Abdul Qader Hilal said.","The plane crashes near a public market in Sanaa, killing all passengers .

"(CNN) -- The most difficult decision a member of Congress will ever have to make is to commit our nation's armed forces to military action against an enemy. Having served with and cared for those brave men and women as a physician in the Army Reserve with three deployments including Iraq, this is not a decision I would arrive at lightly or without careful consideration of all the available facts. There is no question that the horrific atrocities perpetrated by Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria are nothing short of appalling and deserve international condemnation. But there is a glaring lack of international resolve on what the response to such abominable acts should be. A careful examination of the current situation and an understanding of our history in the region advise that the United States must proceed with caution before entering another Middle Eastern conflict. First, I have concerns that a strike in Syria will only further muddle the administration's disjointed foreign policy approach to the region. It is no secret that the president has already used a patchwork strategy in dealing with the turmoil in the Middle East. The United States has implemented three entirely different approaches in Egypt, Libya and Syria. The debate over a military strike in Syria cannot be a knee jerk reaction to the president's failed ""new beginning"" with the Arab worldâ€”including failures of diplomacy in Libya and Egypt. Rather, a strike on Syria must consider the greater strategic implications of military action and should be about one thing: the best strategic interests of the United States. Second, the unintended consequences of even a ""limited"" military strike may outweigh any potential positive results. Some suggest that not acting could destabilize the region and further embolden bad actors such as North Korea or Iran; this ignores the fact that any military strike on Syria could spark a much wider regional conflict that would escalate our own involvement. There could be an additional attack against Syrian civilians, there could be retaliation against Israel, and Syrian refugees flooding into neighboring countries could tip the balance of the fragile political stability there. Right now, no matter how abhorrent the atrocities committed, the conflict is confined within the borders of Syria. Nobody knows for certain what will result from action or inaction. Next, the administration has yet to clearly articulate the goals, objectives and potential costs of a military action in Syria. We know that the president wants to punish al-Assad, but I have never believed our military force should be used to deliver a shot across the bow unless we are willing to then sink the ship if the warning shot is unheeded. I don't believe that our military, or the American people, are ready to sink the ship. All that has been made clear is what we are not going to achieve -- regime change -- and what we could possibly achieve: a shifting of the momentum in the ground war against al-Assad's military. We must be careful and quite clear with the types of actions we take as we use our military force in this fiscally strained environment, and at a time when we are drawing down the end-strength of our forces. Thus far, the specifics of a strike in Syria have not met this standard. Finally, I do not believe the case has been made that there is a clear and imminent threat to our national security interests. Some say that projecting strength and showing a willingness to act against leaders who commit abuses are important enough reasons to strike Syria. A similar argument was used against Saddam Hussein, leading to the Gulf and Iraq Wars; a similar argument was used against the Taliban and al Qaeda forces in Afghanistan; a similar argument was used yet again against Moammar Gadhafi in Libya. While the circumstances that led to these interventions were all very different, the continued unrest that grips the countries involved shows that our ability to influence outcomes is finite and any power vacuum we may leave behind is likely to result in further violence and abuses. I believe it would be unwise to take on a situation that very likely could produce this same result. Throughout history, no matter what action the United States has taken, we have seen that evil people will do evil things. As the situation evolves, we may see evidence that the Syrian armed forces are planning to attack our longstanding allies in the region or that there could be a major threat to global commerce. Such a situation would likely warrant a U.S. military strike. But that is not the situation we find ourselves in today. In the end, if we are going to engage our military, there must be a clear threat to our national security interests at home and a clear strategy of what we are going to achieve. Anything less would disregard the lessons of recent history and further complicate the situation in Syria and the region while risking precious American blood and treasure. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joe Heck.","Rep. Joe Heck: World, so far, lacks resolve to respond to al-Assad regime atrocities .
He says he's not convinced U.S. should strike. Action should only protect U.S. interests .

Moments before the August assault, a man handed the assailant his belt as the cameraman appears to spray the victim, now 21, with a clear liquid. ""Your father owe me money. Take everything off, jeans, everything,"" the male voice said. The video then shows the man being whipped 49 times as others laugh in what appears to be a gang-related attack, according to Newark Police Director Samuel A. DeMaio. Three men were charged for aggravated assault, conspiracy, possession of a weapon, and robbery after they allegedly stole $20 from the victim. A 25-year-old woman who was present during the attack has also been arrested on drug charges, which include alleged ""possession of 20 bricks of heroin."" On Wednesday, Newark Mayor Cory Booker called the incident ""shocking,"" ""disturbing"" and ""a blow to the conscious of our community."" He said it points to a ""subculture of violence we have to address."" ""This is not who we are,"" said Booker, who then admonished those who may have witnessed the attack, but failed to report it. ""We do not tolerate this level of cruelty."" The victim's father apparently owed the assailant $20, according to police and multiple voices heard on the video. Newark Councilman Ronald Rice called the video ""a documentation of our dysfunction."" Talk Back: Should there be penalties for posting violent videos?

"(CNN) -- The wife of a former justice of the peace in Texas is being held on murder charges in connection with the killings of Kaufman County District Attorney Michael McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, county officials announced Wednesday. Kim Lene Williams, 46, is also charged with murder in the death of prosecutor Mark Hasse. She is in jail, with bail set at $10 million. The Kaufman County jail website lists her as being booked about 3 a.m. Wednesday. The McLellands were killed in March, and Hasse was killed in January. The arrest warrant said she confessed in detail to her involvement and her husband, Eric Williams', role in the scheme. The warrant said she ""intentionally and knowingly"" caused the deaths and accused her husband of being the trigger man. McLelland and Hasse prosecuted Eric Williams on a charges of felony burglary and theft by a public servant last year, according to the warrant. He was removed as a justice of the peace, an elected office, after he was convicted in March 2012, it said. Kaufman County Sheriff's Sgt. Matt Woodall wrote in an affidavit filed with the warrant that he ""learned from other officers of the county and county employees that Mr. Hasse and Mr. McLelland both believed that Eric Williams blamed them for his removal from office."" The prosecutors carried handguns for their protection after the Williams trial ""because they believed Eric Williams to be a threat to their personal safety,"" Woodall wrote. Eric Williams was arrested last week on a count of making a terroristic threat. A sheriff's affidavit accused him of using his home computer to threaten police investigating the McLellands' killings. Eric Williams' attorney released a statement Friday saying he ""has cooperated with law enforcement and vigorously denies any and all allegations. He wishes simply to get on with his life and hopes that the perpetrators are brought to justice."" Investigation opens window on 2012 trial .

"ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- The honors were late but still well-received Wednesday for members of the first all-African-American, all-female unit to serve overseas in World War II. Mary Crawford Ragland said when they came home from service, there were no parades for them. During the war, nearly 1,000 women from the ""Six-Triple Eight"" Central Postal Battalion moved mountains  of mail for millions of American service members and civilians that clogged warehouses in England and France. Their service to their country had been overlooked for years, starting with when they returned to the United States from assignments overseas. ""There was no parade,"" said Mary Crawford Ragland. ""We just came home."" The 82-year old was among those gathered Wednesday at the Women's Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery, where a U.S. Army support group called the Freedom Team Salute presented them with certificates of appreciation, timed with Black History Month.  Watch women receive their honors » . The group also gives a letter of appreciation signed by the Army Chief of Staff and the Secretary of the Army, an Army lapel pin and an Army decal. For Alyce Dixon, 101, it was worth the wait. ""They asked me because I'm one of the oldest survivors, and I can still talk,"" she said with a smile. Nearly 800 women that were part of the 6888th were first stationed in Birmingham, England, for three months, moved to Rouen, France, and finally settled in Paris, according to the Army's Web site. They were responsible for redirecting mail to more than seven million people -- all U.S. armed forces in the European Theater of Operations, including Army, Navy, Marine Corps, civilians and Red Cross workers. As Army units quickly moved throughout Western Europe and into Germany, a massive mail snag occurred because of a manpower shortage. Soldiers continued to move, fighting battles across the continent, but weren't getting their mail. Morale began to drop. That's when the Army turned to the ""Six-Triple-Eight"" When Dixon and the other women arrived at a warehouse in early 1945, they found the building had no heat. Inside the warehouse, the windows were painted black to keep the light from coming out at night against bombing raids. Because there was no heat, the women donned long johns and anything else they could layer on. But the temperature was nothing compared with the daunting challenge of sorting the mail. When they walked inside the warehouse, it was stacked to the ceiling with undelivered packages and letters. ""They had 90 billion pieces of mail,"" Dixon told CNN, some of it from hometown friends and family addressed only to ""Junior, U.S. Army or Buster, U.S. Army,"" she said. ""We had to figure it out,"" she said. Even when there were complete names, it wasn't easy. There were 7,500 soldiers named Robert Smith in the European Theater of Operations, according to the Museum of Black WWII History Web site, and the women had to keep them straight. Because all undeliverable mail passed through them, they were charged with keeping information cards on everyone in the European Theater of Operations, according to the Army site. Because frontline soldiers were often moved frequently, the women often had to update information several times a month. While it was an arduous task, the women knew the importance of their job. For soldiers in the field, letters from loved ones brought important personal connections that kept their morale going. So they kept on sorting. Eight hours at a time, three shifts per day, seven days a week, they kept on sorting. And because of them, 65,000 letters went out each shift to soldiers across Europe. On Wednesday, the favor was finally returned.","Women were enlisted to help with backlog of mail that was decreasing morale .

"(CNN) -- Three people are dead, including a gunman who opened fire in a courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware, Monday morning, Delaware State Police said. Two Capitol Police officers were wounded in the gunfight, but their injuries aren't life threatening because they were wearing bulletproof vests, police said. The man entered the lobby of at the New Castle County Courthouse around 8 a.m. and began shooting, said State Police Sgt. Paul Shavack. He acted alone, Shavack said, and the shooting was not an act of terrorism. The two who are dead are women, but Shavack declined to give details about them. News reports said the gunman's estranged wife was among the victims, but Shavack said he could not confirm that a family member was involved. He described the shooter as white and between the ages of 50 and 60. Police said it's unclear how the gunman died. They are investigating whether he killed himself or police killed him. Prosecutor gunned down outside Texas courthouse . Jose Beltran, a Court of Common Pleas worker, told the News Journal in Wilmington that he was walking into the courthouse lobby when he heard shots. ""I saw two shots,"" he said. ""I saw people going on the ground so I just made a U-turn and ran out of the building. After that I don't know what happened."" Thomas Warren told the newspaper that as he approached the courthouse entrance to report for jury duty, he saw what appeared to be the body of a man lying on his stomach. Local and federal authorities, including agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, responded. The courthouse was evacuated and police did a floor-by-floor search of the 12-story building to make sure there was only the single gunman and there were no more threats, Shavack said. The shooting came on the day the police chief of Wilmington was in Philadelphia to attend a roundtable discussion about gun safety. Vice President Joe Biden, law enforcement officials and members of Congress were attending. Biden, who served as a senator from Delaware for many years, acknowledged Monday's shooting. ""Wilmington has been dealing with a murder rate that exceeds any number a city of its size should be dealing with,"" he said. The city's population is 71,305, according to 2011 census figures. There were 23 murders in the city that year, according to FBI statistics. Monday afternoon Joseph R. ""Beau"" Biden, Delaware's Attorney General and the son of the vice president, spoke at a news conference about the shooting. ""This is not a random act of violence,"" he said, but stems for a long custody dispute that ""has lasted in our court system for many years."" Biden and other law enforcement authorities would not publicly name the shooter or the deceased, saying that they wanted to continue with the process of their investigation first. The officers who survived the shooting were treated and released from a hospital, police chief William Jopp said. The New Castle County Courthouse will be closed Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- More than 2,800 people have been killed in Nigeria since the Boko Haram crisis in Nigeria started in 2009, according to Human Rights Watch. The Islamic militant group, which wants to enforce a strict version of Islamic law in northern Nigeria, has successfully hit soft and hard targets in a manner that questions the capacity of the Nigerian state to protect its citizenry. Hard targets have included the police and United Nations headquarters in Abuja. Frustrated by his inability to solve the problem by peaceful means, President Goodluck Jonathan had to fall back on the provisions of Section 305 of the Nigerian Constitution. In May 2013, he declared states of emergency in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa in northeastern Nigeria -- three key flashpoint states that had been wracked by activities of Boko Haram and its offshoot, Ansaru. ""We have taken robust steps to unravel and address the root causes of these crises, but it would appear that there is a systematic effort by insurgents and terrorists to destabilize the Nigerian state and test our collective resolve,"" Jonathan said in a televised speech. Read more: UN bombing suspect tied to al Qaeda, Nigerians say . More troops were deployed to the three states; the country's borders with Cameroun, Niger and Chad were shut down. The Nigerian Air Force provided air cover for the army and police, which raided the hideouts of the insurgents. The crackdown began to produce positive results in terms of a drastic reduction in attacks by the insurgents -- resulting from a blockade of their supply lines of fighters, arms and food. But how sustainable is all this? Can we say that the last of the Boko Haram crisis has been heard? The answer is a categorical no. Read more: Nigerian president declares emergency in 3 states . Last weekend, gunmen stormed a school in Yobe, killing 20 students and a teacher in an attack local media said had been claimed by Boko Haram. Whereas the Nigerian government would say Boko Haram members are being ""flushed out"", an objective observer would say many are simply hibernating in various northern Nigerian communities. Locals know who -- and where -- they are, but share two related grievances against the Nigerian state that is warring against the group. First and foremost, many northern Nigerians are unhappy with the way the military carries out its operations. In its pursuit of Boko Haram, the Nigerian military views everything as a legitimate target -- including mosques, market places, women and children. The people regularly allege the killing of innocent people by the military. They claim to be more afraid of the soldiers than Boko Haram insurgents. The Nigerian military recently told Human Rights Watch that reports of civilian casualties during military raids were ""grossly exaggerated,"" but U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has warned his Nigerian counterpart over alleged atrocities by soldiers. Read more: Gunmen kill 20 students, teacher in Nigerian school shooting . The military cannot claim to be winning under this kind of atmosphere. To get local support for a sustainable war against Boko Haram, the military must invest more in winning the hearts and minds of the people. The alternative is that the people either become bystanders in the war or even supporters of Boko Haram. The second problem is that the north is not happy with the present regime in Nigeria, which has marginalized them politically, socially and economically since the 1999 transition from military to civil rule. The north had previously held the power in Nigeria; it is now in the ""opposition."" Read more: Human Rights Watch report on Nigeria violence . The north took over from the British colonial masters when Nigeria became independent in 1960. These politicians were overthrown by the military in 1966 but once again the military leaders were northern dominated until they transferred power to civilians in 1999. Since then, northerners' grip on the Nigerian political system has been very weak; it is getting weaker by the day. Things are so bad for the north, that the possibility of it reclaiming political power in 2015 is becoming a mirage. If the political situation in Nigeria gets messier, the likes of Boko Haram would fight for the north whether voluntarily or by invitation. For this reason, some northerners might not be too happy with the military suppressing Boko Haram. Such individuals exist within the Nigerian military as well. This is why the Chief of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Azubuike Ihejirika is constantly warning his men and officers not to sabotage the ongoing military operations by providing intelligence to the insurgents. Read more: Nigerian military -- insurgents killed in raid on militant camps . The Boko Haram sect cannot be removed from Nigerian society like pulling a rotten tooth out of the mouth. A group whose bloodied hands were found in the 2000 to 2003 political violence in Borno State; a group that two years later emerged as the ""Nigerian Taliban"" before becoming securitized by the Nigerian state as Boko Haram (meaning ""western education is evil"") cannot be easily sent packing by the Nigerian military. Boko Haram's members have seen many battles in the past and the group is known to be a cat with many lives. Even if it died out, it would germinate in new forms. The needs of Boko Haram are not even known to the Nigerian state not to mention being met by it. More problems should be expected. The group might emerge under new name now that it has been banned by the United Kingdom and its present leadership has been declared wanted by the United States. Read more: Nigerians ask, are we at war? Leader Abubakar Shekau and some of the group's other senior members have nothing to gain from any permanent peace -- especially as the international community has already cast them in the mold of former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. As they await eventual capture, they will not mind causing more trouble. To sustain its recent gains, the military task force in the three states will need to take the character of a near permanent formation on the ground. If the military leave, Boko Haram will quickly come in to fill the space. Occasional sniper attacks on soft targets by the group will provide justification for the military to ask for money to keep the northeast safe. In other words, the Nigerian military is doing its best but the present situation is only a state of negative peace; it is a peace of the graveyard. The committee on dialogue and peaceful resolution of security challenges in the north, set up by the federal government, claimed some days ago it has reached a ceasefire agreement with the Boko Haram sect. Such an agreement must have been reached with a significant faction of the sect. Read more: Why Nigeria's elections matter . If not, where did the group meet the faction led by Shekau and what were the terms of the agreement? What is in the agreement for the Boko Haram most especially on issues relating to strict enforcement of Islamic laws in northern Nigeria? What does it have to say on ""amnesty"" for Shekau and other leaders of the sect? The committee members are only trying to save face. The ongoing military operations against the Boko Haram were launched few days after the committee was set up. The members are confused; the credibility of their mission is questioned and they have to say something to Nigerians before running away. The opinions expressed in this commentary are soley those of Isaac Olawale Albert.","Boko Haram is an Islamic militant group that wants to enforce a slamic law in Nigeria .
Nigeria's president has declared emergencies in three states where the group operates .
Albert says the military's tactics are not working and it is failing to win hearts and minds .
Many northerners share some of the group's grievances against the state, he says ."
"(CNN) -- Seven suspected undocumented immigrants were killed and eight others injured when a truck being chased by police crashed into a security barrier at a Navy facility in Texas, authorities said Thursday. Fifteen people were in the truck, with 10 crammed inside the cab and five under a tarp in the truck's bed, said John Gagne, spokesman for Naval Air Station Kingsville. The crash occurred late Wednesday when the extended-cab pickup sped past an officer at the main gate at the base, south of Corpus Christi, Gagne told CNN. The GMC Sierra was being chased by Kingsville police about 11:15 p.m. when it ran the checkpoint. Earlier, Gagne said that U.S. Border Patrol personnel were involved in the chase, but that was incorrect. It was not immediately clear why the truck was being pursued. Guards deployed a pop-up barrier outside a second security post, and the truck slammed into that obstacle without slowing down. ""That's exactly what the barrier is designed to prevent,"" Gagne said, referring to the driver's behavior. ""It's quite possible this guy didn't even know where he was."" Video from CNN affiliate KIII-TV showed flashing lights and emergency vehicles outside the air station overnight. No one from the military or the law enforcement agencies was among those hurt; names of the victims had not been released as of late Thursday afternoon. The injured were taken via ambulance or flown to hospitals in south Texas. Their conditions were not known, although Gagne said at least some were life-threatening. Greg Palmore, a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said the crash victims are from Guatemala and Honduras and that their respective consulates have been notified. The driver was among those injured, he said. Kingsville Police Chief Ricardo Torres referred all questions to the state Department of Public Safety, which is investigating the incident, along with ICE's Homeland Security Investigations and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service.","The victims, who may be undocumented immigrants, are from Guatemala and Honduras .

"(CNN) -- The day after the deadly bombings at the Boston Marathon's finish line, the city's police commissioner said that spot was probably one of the most photographed in the country in the minutes before it became a crime scene. But it's no Times Square. While the targeted stretch of Boston's Boylston Street is often lively and always in focus on Patriots Day, New York's Times Square is a hub of activity -- including locals and tourists, vendors and performers, not to mention police officers -- most every hour of every day. Its status as one of America's busiest, brightest, most bustling places also makes it a target. That was true in 2010, when Pakistani-American Faisal Shahzad pleaded guilty to plotting to blow up a car bomb there. Times Square bomb plotter sentenced to life in prison . And it was the case again this month. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters Thursday that the surviving suspect in last week's marathon blasts that killed three and wounded scores more told investigators that he and his brother were heading to New York next. From the Boston hospital bed where he's being guarded by federal authorities, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev said he and his brother Tamerlan, 26, ""decided spontaneously"" to target Times Square, New York police Commissioner Ray Kelly said, citing information he received from the FBI. Their plan was to detonate five pipe bombs and a pressure-cooker bomb similar to the ones used days earlier in Boston, Kelly added. But the two brothers never made it out of Massachusetts. They carjacked a Mercedes SUV, then stopped at a gas station, Kelly explained. The car's driver was able then to escape and call police, leading to a chase and shootout, after which Tamerlan Tsarnaev was declared dead. Dzhokhar, 19, was captured Friday. ""We don't know that we would have been able to stop the terrorists, had they arrived here from Boston,"" Bloomberg said. ""We're just thankful we didn't have to find out."" Hub of 'the city that never sleeps' With billboards and neon lights rivaled in America perhaps only by those on the Las Vegas Strip, Times Square is hard to miss. The hectic stretch a stone's throw from Broadway theaters is flush with stores, hotels and other attractions, from a massive Toys ""R'"" Us with a Ferris wheel inside to the tower that every New Year's Eve holds the iconic giant crystal ball. For all these reasons and more, it's frequented by residents passing through and visitors stopping by, one of whom was none other than Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Kelly, the city's police commissioner, said the surviving Boston attack suspect went to New York twice last year. On one of those trips, in April, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was photographed in Times Square. Authorities don't know if those visits had anything to do with the Tsarnaev brothers' alleged plans to attack New York, nor do they have an indication that the city is ""a target of another terrorist attack stemming from the Boston bombings,"" Kelly said. Still, the New York officials acknowledged that had the Boston suspects made it to New York, they could have caused untold death and destruction. That would be true even if the brothers had gone straight to New York from Massachusetts and blown up their bombs right after they got there around 2 or 3 a.m. Friday, as estimated by Kelly. That's because Times Square -- which lies at the intersection of several major thoroughfares with many entertainment venues, clubs and restaurants -- seals New York's reputation as ""the city that never sleeps."" Mayor: 'There are no guarantees' And in New York, the city's police commissioner stressed, police are always on alert as well. Police officers are visible at all hours in Times Square, said Kelly. And they aren't the only ones watching. A host of cameras that surround this area and others in New York serve as law enforcement tools. Some of them capture 360-degree images; others shoot from above. There's also ground-level surveillance footage like that credited with initially pinpointing the Boston suspects, not to mention whatever can be gleaned from photographs taken by the throngs of tourists that come to the city every day. These ""extensive networks of cameras"" and the ""enormous police presence"" are there to catch would-be terrorists who might plant a bomb or otherwise inflict violence, Bloomberg said. The high cost of maintaining such a hefty security presence is worth it, because -- as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's remarks to the FBI showed -- ""New York City remains a prime target for those who hate America and want to kill Americans,"" said the mayor. But all the technology, all the intelligence sharing, all the police boots on the ground won't eliminate the threat to New York, leaders in that city stressed. Nor will they necessarily catch the next person or people who want to stage an attack in Times Square. As Bloomberg said, ""There are no guarantees.""","A Boston bombings suspect said he was heading to New York, officials say .
He told investigators he and his brother planned to bomb Times Square, they add .
New York is a ""prime target"" for terrorists, the city's mayor says .
There's a big police presence and camera network but ""no guarantees,"" he adds ."
"(CNN) -- If you're running for office, it's best not to make incendiary comments about rape. That appears to be as much the case in Indonesia as it is in the United States. Daming Sanusi, a candidate for the Indonesian Supreme Court, has fueled outrage in the predominantly Muslim country by suggesting that rape victims enjoy being violated. Read more: 'Mother Robin' delivers for poor women in Indonesia . He made the comments Monday in front of a parliamentary commission hearing to determine if he was a fit for the top court, according to the official Indonesian news agency Antara. In response to a question about whether the death penalty should be applied in rape cases, Daming reportedly said, ""Consideration needs to be taken thoroughly for the imposition of death penalty for a rapist because in a rape case both the rapist and the victim enjoy it."" News of his comments quickly spread on social media, prompting anger, disgust and calls for Daming's candidature for the Supreme Court to be shot down. CNN iReport: Women of Indonesia . ""We ask legislators not to give the judge position to Daming, as he had offended people`s feeling by uttering inappropriate statement,"" Ridwan Bakar, a spokesman for the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation, said Tuesday. As the furor grew, Daming issued an apology, acknowledging that his words were ""out of control."" In a news conference, he said that he was nervous in the session in front of the lawmakers and made the comment as a joke. ""I made the remark without realizing it can harm people's feeling,"" Antara cited him as saying. Damage is done . But his contrition appeared to be too little too late. ""The damage has been done,"" Primastuti Handayani, the managing editor of the Jakarta Post wrote in a commentary published Wednesday. ""Nothing he said in his apology can heal the wound he caused."" She also noted that Daming is not the first Indonesian official to make controversial comments about rape, highlighting the case last year of Jakarta Governor Fauzi Bowo, who said women should avoid wearing miniskirts on public transport to avoid ""any unwanted consequences."" Indonesian political figures began to distance themselves from Daming amid the outrage this week, and his chances of being selected as a Supreme Court justice seemed to wither. Opinion: Why have men lost touch with reality over rape? The chairman of the parliamentary commission, Gede Pasek Suardika, said that Daming's remarks were inappropriate and that the public outcry against him would be taken into consideration. Members of the commission from the Prosperous Justice Party recommended against selecting him. The controversy that sprung up around Daming mirrors outrage in the United States over remarks about rape made by Republicans Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin. Once leading in the polls, Mourdock and Akin both lost their Senate races to Democrats in November after their comments on pregnancy and rape were widely circulated. Read more: Divorce by text message sparks bizarre legal battle in Indonesia . When asked on a local news show what he thought about abortion in the case of rape, Akin set off the controversy when he said, ""First of all, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down."" Mourdock was participating in a televised debate when he said, ""Life is that gift from God that I think even if life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen."" And Rep. Phil Gingrey, Republican of Georgia, revived the furor last week when he commented on the cases of Mourdock and Akin, and reportedly suggested Akin was ""partly right."" Gingrey later said his words, reported by the Marietta Daily-Journal, had been misconstrued.
