It turns out that Aaron Hernandez, who currently stands accused of murder, isn't the only member of his family with a criminal past. In 2001 Hernandez's mother Terri was arrested on gambling charges for working as a low-level bookie in a local gambling ring. Though Hernandez , who now works as an administrative secretary at a local school, was charged with professional gambling and possession of gambling records, she never went to trial. Terri Hernandez, mother of ex-pro football player Aaron Hernandez accused of murder, was charged with illegal gambling in 2001 . Hernandez was arrested for accepting bets on basketball and football games from her home after police gathered evidence from a wire tape, The Hartford Courant reported. The investigation turned up that Hernandez, mother of two, had been hired by Martin Hovanesian Jr., a local restaurant manger, to accept bets on college and professional basketball and football games, the paper reported. A Statewide Organized Crime Investigative Task Force had been conducting a criminal investigation into Hovanesian's operation since late 2000, eventually executing a wiretap on Hernandez's phone lines. Within two days the wiretap intercepted more than 200 telephone calls that 'constitute material evidence of the offenses . of professional gambling' according to Bristol Superior Court court papers the paper cited. With Hovanesian as the ring leader, investigators identified Hernandez as a low-level ranking player in the state-wide gambling ring in which she accepted wagers over the phone, The Daily News reported. Mother of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez, was charged with professional gambling for taking illegal bets on sports games over the phone . Hernandez, who is now a secretary at a local elementary school, took bets on college and pro basketball and football games for $300 a week in 2001 . 'She wasn’t the brains of the operation. She was collateral, ' William Gerace, attorney for Hovanesian told The Daily News. According to the newspaper Hernandez was paid $300 a week to accept bets over the phone and calculate gamblers wins and losses. Hovanesian, who had been convicted of illegal gambling charges in the past, was charged with corrupted organization racketeering activity, the paper reported. Instead of going to trial he plead guilty to the charges and paid a fine of $10,000. Hernanez was never publicly tried for her crimes, though according to an arrest warrant affidavit cited by the news organization, she did speak to police about the ins and outs of Hovanesian's operation in an interview. Her involvement in illegal sports betting came nine years before her son was signed to a NFL football team. Terri Hernandez's son Aaron stands accused of the murder of Odin Lloyd and is currently being held without bail . Hernandez, now 54, leads a more quiet life as an administrative secretary at the South Side Elementary School in Bristol, Connecticut. However, her life was once again been upended when her son, former New England Patriot's tight end Aaron Hernandez was charged with murder earlier this year. Hernandez, 23, is accused of killing Odin Lloyd, 27, who was found shot at an industrial complex just one mile north of the pro-footballer's mansion home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. After he son was charged with murder Terri Hernandez insisted upon his innocence. 'All I can say is that he will be cleared of all these charges in the end,' she told The Bristol Press. 'Just let it play out until the end.' Since her son's arrest more tragedy has befallen the Hernandez family as his uncle died in a freak road accident just two months after Aaron was arrested. Terri Hernandez's brother Michael J. Valentine was killed after he lost control of his moped in Bristol, Connecticut and crashed into a curb. Valentine was not wearing a helmet at the time of the crash. All of these events seem to have taken their toll on Mrs. Hernandez. 'My brother’s dead and my son’s in jail,' she told The Daily News as she was leaving her home to go to work. 'No comment.'","In 2001 Aaron Hernandez's mother Terri was charged with professional gambling for helping to run a local ring out of her home .

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's crusade to rid the City of all things unhealthy has taken aim at various fattening foods and harmful products like cigarettes and trans fats. He even once tried - and failed - to ban large containers of soda within New York's five boroughs. But Bloomberg's now gone a step further - not only does hizzonor not want you to smoke cigarettes, he doesn't want you smoke fake cigarettes, either. Recently leaked drafts of three tobacco-related bills that are expected to be introduced into the City Council indicate that Bloomberg's planning to regulate e-cigs into extinction. Smoke 'em if you got 'em: New York City is attempting to snuff out electronic cigarettes, like those made famous by actor Stephen Dorff in the Blue e-cig ad campaign . The bills are written to include stricter regulations on all tobacco products by doing things like raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21. The plan also would prohibit the display of cigarette advertising in stores and create a $10.50 price floor for cigarette . packs. It also would prohibit the use of tobacco coupons and increase fines against those selling illegal cigarettes. So e-cigs - which contain absolutely no tobacco - wouldn't be included, right? Wrong - according to the . Consumer Advocates for Smoke-Free Alternatives Association, the bills . would also classify e-cigs as 'tobacco products' so they would be . included with regular tobacco for the sake of the stricter regulations. It's yet to be determined whether e-cigs are safer than cigarettes. They don't contain tar or tobacco, but they aren't simply water vapor and nicotine, as e-cig manufacturers would want you to believe. Health Czar: Mayor Michael Bloomberg is on a crusade to rid New York of all things unhealthy. He recently attempted to ban large sodas . The . Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about e-cigs . in 2009, noting that some samples contained ingredients found in anti-freeze. The agency determined that they could not approved by the FDA, and would not be deemed safe without further testing. Additionally, critics of e-cigs argue that they have no no purpose other than to perpetuate nicotine addiction. However, a study released this month by Drexel University concluded that the chemicals in e-cigs are not harmful to users or those in their proximity. Regardless, for the purposes of the new tobacco bills, they contain precisely zero tobacco. Safe? It's yet to be determined whether e-cigs are safe. They are not FDA approved but studies show they aren't harmful . Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health, is a supporter of e-cigs and believes Bloomberg's proposals 'would be a public health disaster.' 'I have no problems with this ordinance as a whole—raising the age, . banning advertising. But [electronic-cigarettes] are a product that's . literally saving people's lives, people who are literally at risk of . disease and death, and giving them an alternative,' Siegel told Gothamist.

Accused Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro told a judge today 'porn took its toll on me' as he accepted a plea deal under which he will serve a life sentence plus 1,000 years for the kidnap and rape of three women. Castro was said to have agreed to the deal - after initially pleading not guilty to all 977 counts against him - to spare him the death penalty. His previous not guilty pleas were withdrawn. It also means his three victims Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus will not have to testify about their more than ten-year ordeal in front of a jury. Scroll Down for Video . Ariel Castro has pleaded guilty to 937 counts, including kidnapping, rape, assault and aggravated murder and is due to be sentenced on Thursday . Guilty: Under the plea deal, Castro, 53, will spend the rest of his life behind bars plus 1,000 years, without the possibility of parole . Castro said today: 'There . are some things I do not comprehend because of my sexual problems . throughout the years. But I trust my lawyers and I understand my rights . and the sentence' All three victims - Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus - appeared in a video in early July thanking the local community for its support . They . released a statement today saying they were relieved at the news, are . satisfied by the resolution and are looking forward to the end of the . legal side of their ordeal. Speaking in court today, Castro said: 'I said I was willing to work with the FBI and I would tell them everything.' The . judge asked him the 53-year-old if he understood that he would die in prison and there . would never be a possibility he would be released from prison. He replied: 'I do understand that and I said because of the sex crimes I knew I would have the book thrown at me. 'There . are some things I do not comprehend because of my sexual problems . throughout the years. But I trust my lawyers and I understand my rights . and the sentence.' He said he read and signed the plea deal and understood it though 'my addiction to pornography and my sexual problem has taken a toll on my mind' that sometimes caused problems with comprehension. Offering some form of an explanation for his despicable crimes, he said: 'I was a victim as a child and it just kept going.' The judge cut him off and told him to save his story for his sentencing hearing. Castro spoke clearly and intelligibly today in court, answering all the judges questions with clarity. This is in stark contrast to his previous appearances when he has kept his head down, closed his eyes and refused to interact. Plea Deal: Ariel Castro, 53, walks into the court room with his head down for a pre-trial hearing on charges including rape, kidnapping and murder in Cleveland, Ohio July 24, 2013 . Prosecutors said if evidence of additional crimes came to light, Castro could still be indicted on future charges that included the death penalty. Castro's . lawyers have said for weeks that they would consider an agreement under . which the former Cleveland school bus driver would plead guilty to some . charges in return for his life. Castro, . 53, has been charged with 977 counts including kidnapping and repeated . rape. He has also been charged with murder under a fetal homicide law . for allegedly forcing one of the women to miscarry. Gina . DeJesus, 23, Michelle Knight, 32, and Amanda Berry, 27 were freed from . Castro's home in a rundown area of Cleveland in May. The three women disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004, when they were 14, 16 and 20 years old. Each said they had accepted a ride from Castro, who remained friends with the family of one of the women and even attended vigils over the years marking her disappearance.

The 977-count indictment against Castro includes charges of rape and kidnapping and two counts of aggravated murder on accusations that Castro starved and punched one of the women while she was pregnant until she miscarried.

Residents near a swanky midtown Manhattan hotel - where reality TV star Kim Kardashian lived with here husband of 72 days, Brooklyn Nets forward Kris Humphries - are outraged over late-night parties being thrown at the hotel's pool where women are often seen flashing their breasts to fellow partiers. The pool on the roof of the Gansevoort Hotel on Park Avenue near 29th Street has become a summer weekend hot-spot for late-night, booze-infused parties that started off just being too loud for the neighbors but escalated into something that resembles a Girls Gone Wild video. Because of all the noise and alleged indecent exposure, the 29th Street Neighborhood Association have demanded that the hotel's liquor license be revoked. The Gansevoort: Neighbors of the swanky hotel say Girls Gone Wild-style parties are being thrown on the hotel's roof . 'They’re coming to the city to be wild. They don’t care who is living . there,' Neighborhood Association chairman Mario Messina told CBS NY, 'It’s the wrong place and the wrong time to do something like . that.' Neighbors aren't the only people irked by the lewd parties - a British family recently posted a less-than-glowing review of their experience at the hotel, where rooms often start at $400 per night. 'The main problem we had was the swimming pool — pool bar and area — . which was ridiculously over-crowded and pretty much unsuitable for . children after lunchtime,' the family wrote. Girls Gone Wild: female partiers flashing onlookers during a party at the Gansevoort .

Neighbors' feud: Nearby residents have sent photos of the wild parties to the Liquor Authority in the hopes that the hotel's license allowing it to serve alcohol would be revoked .

'Sometimes in the middle of the night you hear a lot of screaming, like maybe drunk people,' said neighbor Josh Baran.

Half the cost of the President's holiday is met by the taxpayer, and the Obamas pay for the remainder, although they have met the full cost of the vacation home, which is owned by private equity expert David Schulte, according to Bloomberg.

The soldier knew she had to decide quickly who she could save, so she grabbed a black marker and wrote a 'D' on the foreheads of the dead. To people lingering over those killed amid the chaos of the 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood, she shouted: 'You need to move on!' Sgt. 1st Class Maria Guerra recalled those moments while testifying Thursday during the trial of Maj. Nidal Hasan. The Army psychiatrist is charged with killing 13 people and wounding more than 30 others during a rampage at the sprawling Texas military base. When prosecutors asked Guerra to describe the scene inside the Soldier Readiness Processing Center, where she worked on the base, her voice began breaking. Defence: In this courtroom sketch, Maj. Nidal Hasan, second from right, sits with his standby defense attorneys Maj. Joseph Marcee, left, and Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, second from left . In this courtroom sketch today, Staff Sgt. Michael Davis, a victim of the Fort Hood shootings, testifies during the trial of Maj. Nidal Hasan . 'I see bodies. I see bodies . everywhere. And I see blood,' the soldier said. 'No one is moving. There . was no movement. There was no sound. So I yelled out, 'Is everybody OK? ... I started hearing, 'Help me. I'm bleeding. I've been shot. Help . me.' Guerra is among dozens . of witnesses giving emotional testimony about the attack to help . prosecutors build a rock-solid case for the death penalty in a court . system known for overturning such sentences. The testimony resumed . Friday morning. Hasan is . acting as his own attorney and has said little during the trial. But he . raised a rare objection when Guerra said she heard the gunman silence a . woman who was crying out, 'My baby! My baby!' Hasan interrupted to ask the judge, 'Would you remind Sgt. 1st Class Guerra that she's under oath?' The judge, Col. Tara Osborn, did so. But Guerra responded by saying she didn't want to change her testimony. It . was the only time Hasan objected as more than a dozen witnesses . testified Thursday, continuing a mostly silent defense strategy that has . caused tension with his standby attorneys. Hasan took responsibility . for the attack during his opening statement, and the lawyers — who have . been ordered to help Hasan during the trial — believe he is trying to . secure himself a death sentence. The . military lawyers had asked the judge to either allow them to take over . Hasan's defense or bar him from asking for their help with a strategy . they oppose, saying his strategy was 'repugnant to defense counsel and . contrary to our professional obligations.' 'We . believe your order is causing us to violate our rules of professional . conduct,' Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, Hasan's lead standby attorney, told the . judge earlier Thursday before witnesses testified. Osborn . refused and ordered the attorneys to resume their advisory role. The . attorneys said they would appeal, though no appeal had been filed by the . standby attorneys as of Thursday evening at the Court of Appeals for . the Armed Forces, according to the court's clerk. A message left with . the Army Court of Criminal Appeals wasn't immediately returned. Jeff . Corn, a law professor at South Texas College of Law, predicted that . such an appeal wouldn't delay the trial and would likely be dismissed. 'As . sympathetic as I am to him (Poppe) and the miserable position he's in, I . think he's stuck. The law is clear: If you are a standby attorney for a . pro-se defendant and the defendant wants to make decisions tactically . disastrous, that's his prerogative,' Corn said. Ulterior motives: A standby lawyer argued Maj. Nidal Hasan (shown here in court on Tuesday) is trying to blow his defense so that he is sentenced to death . Blatant: During his brief opening statements on Monday, Hasan said that all of the evidence would show that he was the shooter, and it is unclear how he plans to defend his actions . Admitted shooter: Major Nidal Hasan, seen here in 2010, is representing himself in his own defense as he faces the death penalty for allegedly killing 13 people on Fort Hood Army base in 2009 . But . it could also be an intended strategy to spare Hasan the death penalty, . said Joe Gutheinz, a Houston-area attorney and former Army intelligence . officer. 'The judge allowed . him to defend himself, you raised a timely objection. That is the basis . for the appeal. And it was brilliant on the part of all the parties . involved. If somebody thought up this idea, it was great,' Gutheinz . said. 'I really believe this is the only way, at end of the day, he will . not be executed.' As during . previous days during the trial, Hasan rarely spoke Thursday as witness . after witness described a chaotic, bloody scene inside the Army post's . processing center where soldiers had been preparing to deploy. Asked to describe the rate of gunfire, Staff Sgt. Michael Davis quickly hit his hand on the ledge of the witness stand. 'I still thought it was a drill, but I heard some screaming that didn't sound like it was fake,' Davis said. Davis . testified that he saw blood spray when someone was shot and quickly . took cover under a desk. When he thought it safe to flee, he stood up . but was quickly shot in the back. 'It was just a cold, calculated, hard stare as he shot everything that moved,' Spc. Megan Martinez testified. She . recalled watching Hasan reload his pistol and the weapon's green and . red laser sights sweeping through the thick, hazy smoke produced by the . gunfire. 'He was walking back and forth, shooting for what felt like an eternity,' she told jurors. Hasan is charged with 13 counts of . premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder. If . convicted, he would face the death penalty. Hasan, . an American-born Muslim said he was as a soldier who switched sides in . what he described as a war between America and his Islamic faith. Hasan wanted to plead guilty to murder and attempted murder, but military rules forbid guilty pleas in death penalty cases. No American soldier has been . executed since 1961, and military prosecutors showed that they would . take no chance of fumbling details that could jeopardize any conviction . down the line.

Cause of death: Grand Valley State University quarterback Cullen Finnerty, 30, died in the Michigan wilderness of pneumonia caused by inhaling his vomit . A former college football star who disappeared in the Michigan wilderness during a fishing trip died of pneumonia caused by inhaling his vomit and had a degenerative brain disease made worse by painkillers, it was revealed Thursday. An updated autopsy report said Cullen Finnerty's anxiety and paranoia in the woods the night of May 26 may have been exacerbated by an ‘elevated’ level of oxycodone and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) - the brain disease that has been found in a number of ex-football players. Finnerty's brain was studied at Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, which said Thursday the severity of CTE was moderate and it's ‘highly unlikely’ the disease alone led to his death. ‘CTE possibly affected his judgment, insight and behavior, but there are other factors, including the use of medications prescribed by his doctor, that most likely contributed to the circumstances surrounding his death,’ the center said in a statement. Kent County Chief Medical Examiner Stephen Cohle said Finnerty, 30, became incapacitated before inhaling his vomit in Lake County 65 miles north of Grand Rapids. Though relatives reported the former Grand Valley State University quarterback had a number of alcoholic drinks the day he died, Cohle said his blood-alcohol level was ‘negligible’ and didn't contribute to Finnerty's incapacitation. The report said it's likely Finnerty had anxiety, disorientation and paranoia from being alone in the woods while waiting for in-laws to pick him up. Cohle said the pain medication was prescribed to Finnerty for back injuries likely sustained during his football career. Mystery: Former Grand Valley State quarter back Cullen Finnerty, center in 2006, was found dead in the woods of northern Michigan Tuesday night, days after disappearing while out fishing near his family's cottage . Concerned: Finnerty (pictured with his wife) last spoke to a family . member May 26 in a phone call in which he said 'he was nervous . about something' Finnerty's father, Tim Finnerty, said . that his son also was taking a thyroid medication at the time of his . death, and the family is concerned high doses could have caused him to . become sick and confused. ‘None . of this [news] is going to bring Cullen back,’ Mr Finnerty said. ‘The . only people that will know what happened will be Cullen and God.’ An . initial autopsy conducted the morning after Finnerty's body was found . determined that he had a ‘slightly enlarged heart and slightly cloudy . lungs’ but ‘no trauma to the body at all.’ The final report includes toxicology results and the determination that he had CTE. Boston . University's center for study of the disease reported in December that . 34 former pro football players and nine who played only college football . suffered from CTE. Personal struggles: Finnerty's wife, Jennifer, told investigators that her husband had had 'paranoid' episodes in the past . Happier times; Finnerty is survived by his wife and two young children (pictured) The . NFL faces lawsuits by thousands of former players who say the league . withheld information on the harmful effects of concussions. The NCAA . also is being sued over its handling of head injuries. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is associated with cognitive and behavioral problems later in life and can eventually cause dementia. Also known as punch drunk syndrome, it has been most common in boxers and is associated with receiving multiple concussions. In recent years, CTE has been shown to exist in other athletes, including professional and college football players and pro hockey players. Sufferers can show symptoms such as memory loss, aggression, confusion and depression which may appear within months of the trauma or many decades later. Tim . Finnerty, who coached football for 35 years, said it's important to . keep researching CTE and possible links to injuries not only in football . but hockey, soccer and others sports. But he said the life lessons and . benefits of playing football are ‘substantial.’ Finnerty's . wife, Jennifer, told investigators that he had a past addiction to . painkillers but had not taken any drugs since spending time in rehab . more than a year earlier, adding that it wasn't the first time he had a . ‘paranoid’ episode. Instead . of driving home from Detroit a year-and-a-half earlier, he took off for . Grand Rapids in western Michigan due to fears the FBI would follow him, . she said. She said her husband remained in a state of panic for four to . five days. Cullen . Finnerty, his brother-in-law Matt Brinks and father-in-law Dan Brinks . went fishing the night of May 26. The Brinks dropped off Finnerty around . 8.30pm and watched as he boarded a small personal inflatable pontoon . boat and floated downstream. The . plan was for the Brinks to pick up Finnerty in about 30 minutes, but as . it turned out, it was the last time they would see him alive. His body . was found May 28 within a mile of where he had disappeared. Growing problem: Boston University's center for study of the disease reported in December that 34 former pro football players and nine who played only college football suffered from CTE - the same disease that Finnerty had . In two brief phone conversations with family members, Mr Finnerty sounded disoriented and complained of being tailed. His body was found May 28 at about 8pm in woods within a mile of where he disappeared, said Lake County Undersheriff Dennis Robinson. He said the body was not in the water and was found in a wooded area in Webber Township, near the family's cottage. The search drew scores of police and volunteers, including staff and players from Grand Valley State. Finnerty last spoke to a family member that night in a phone call in which he said 'he was nervous about something.' Based on that call, the family suspected 'he might be having some kind of a mental episode - that he was either afraid or something and ran off into the woods,' Hilts said. The sheriff said authorities had been tracking Finnerty's cellphone 'until it went dead.' The terrain made the search for the 6-foot-3, 230-pound ex-athlete difficult, Hilts said. Searchers from the sheriff's office, state police and area fire departments fanned out Tuesday across a square-mile area of Webber Township, which is about 65 miles north of Grand Rapids. Champion: Finnerty, 30, who had played at Grand Valley State University, led the team to three Division II national titles and more than 50 wins . In addition, dozens of current and former Grand Valley State players, coaches and staff hopped on a bus and headed north to Lake County to lend a hand in the search effort. Grand Valley coach Matt Mitchell, who was a defensive assistant when Finnerty led the Lakers to national titles in 2005 and 2006, as well as former Grand Valley coach and current Notre Dame offensive coordinator Chuck Martin were among those helping out. Finnerty, who starred at Brighton High School, originally accepted an offer to play at the University of Toledo but transferred to Grand Valley after redshirting in 2001. The dual-threat QB played for Grand Valley teams that won Division II titles in 2003, 2005 and 2006, and he briefly was a member of the Baltimore Ravens. Mitchell said Finnerty was 'held in very high regard. He was the starting quarterback on national championship teams. But he's more than that: He's one of the most loyal teammates we've ever had.' He is survived by his wife and two small children.","Cullen Finnerty, 30, led Grand Valley State University to three Division II national titles and more than 50 wins .

Betty Maxwell remained loyal to her husband until his death in 1991 and had no forewarning of the shameful legacy he would leave his family. It was she and their seven surviving children who were left to face the music after the media mogul’s mysterious death after disappearing off his luxury yacht. Loyal: Betty Maxwell, the widow of disgraced publisher Robert Maxwell, has died in France aged 92. The couple are pictured in 1996 . ‘The fat fraudster’, as his daughter-in-law Pandora later referred to him, left the family’s reputation in tatters – and a £460million black hole in the pension fund of Maxwell’s Mirror Group Newspapers. Two of Maxwell’s sons most closely involved in the family firm, Kevin and Ian, stood trial accused of taking part in the fraud. They were acquitted. Yet during Maxwell’s lifetime, Betty had been the unstintingly supportive wife, acting as hostess and housekeeper at their Oxfordshire mansion, Headington Hill Hall. She would often step in at the last moment and take his place at receptions and dinners, when he petulantly refused to go. Happy: Robert Maxwell and Betty are pictured on their wedding day in Paris on March 15, 1945 . She cushioned their children against his . dictatorial rages and his warped habit of subjecting them to stinging . criticism one minute and affectionate praise the next. Robert Maxwell was born in Czechoslovakia and rose from poverty to build an extensive publishing empire. After spending six years as an MP during the 1960s, he bought Mirror Group Newspapers, among other publishing companies. He led an extremely flamboyant lifestyle and was also often embroiled in controversy. Maxwell was forced to sell some of his successful businesses in 1989 to cover his enormous debts. But it was only after his death two years later - after apparently falling overboard from his yacht - that the full picture of his financial mess was uncovered. With banks calling in huge loans, his publishing empire collapsed. But things became much worse when it emerged Maxwell had stolen hundreds of millions of pounds from his own companies' pension funds to save the firms from bankruptcy. Two of Maxwell’s sons most closely . involved in the family firm, Kevin and Ian, stood trial accused of taking part . in the fraud but were acquitted. Born Elisabeth Jenny Jeanne Meynard at La Grive, near Lyon in France, in 1921, Mrs Maxwell worked tirelessly for good causes. The daughter of a French protestant father and a Roman Catholic mother, who married the Jewish Maxwell, she committed herself to improving relations between faiths. Fiercely intelligent and Sorbonne-educated, she was noted for her contributions to Holocaust studies, and earned the respect of members of the Jewish and Christian communities around the world. She met Czechoslovakian-born Maxwell in Paris after the Liberation in 1944. He was serving in the British army. Years later, when he was Labour MP for Buckingham, she was described as a first-class constituency MP’s wife. She went on to take a degree at Oxford after suffering years of being branded ignorant and stupid by her husband, often in front of strangers. Three years after his death in 1991, she published a memoir about her roller-coaster life with Bob Maxwell, and in her latter years she lectured widely on Holocaust studies around the world. She developed a heart condition and finished her life in France. She died on Wednesday, and is survived by three sons and four daughters.","Betty Maxwell remained loyal to her .

Years of racing around kitchens and slaving over a hot stove have left Heston Blumenthal needing a hip replacement at the age of 47. The celebrity chef is known for ‘molecular’ dishes like snail porridge, meat fruit and bacon and egg ice cream – but he has had his fair share of health problems. Now doctors have told him that a combination of gruelling 120-hour weeks and his dedication to fitness – he is a karate black belt – have taken a toll on his body. Steaming ahead: Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal, pictured out with his girlfriend Suzanne Pirret, is forced to have a hip replacement at the tender age of 47 . He said: ‘My surgeon looked at my X-rays and said all he could see was just bone on bone – there was no fluid at all. 'He told me that if I wanted to keep doing my job there was no choice – I had to have the op. 'It’s quite uncomfortable. It has its moments when it gets worse than others.’ However, the Michelin-starred chef refuses to let the pain get in the way of his daily work-out. ‘I am still exercising. I’d rather put up with the discomfort than stop the exercise. Not so hip: Heston said doctor's told him he had no choice but to have a hip replacement if he wanted to keep cooking . 'I can’t play racket ball, which I used to do every morning, but I can do the exercise bike and the cross trainer. ‘I broke my shoulder last year, but now it’s fixed I’ve started doing weights again. I do that about 8-10 hours a week, sometimes twice a day.’ And with two restaurants to run, endless TV commitments, contracts with Waitrose and Channel 4 and a new glossy coffee table book – Historic Heston Blumenthal  –  out in October, his main problem is finding time for the operation. He explained: ‘I want to put it off as long as possible. Partly because there’s no guarantee how long the new hip will last.’ He is no stranger to  dramas having endured a five-hour operation to have two titanium rods  inserted at the base of his spine to counteract chronic back pain. Blumenthal is also accident-prone. He nearly lost the sight in his right eye during a play fight with ex-Arsenal player Lee Dixon. ‘I rammed a loo roll in his mouth and he retaliated by sticking the toilet brush in my face. 'Unfortunately it still had bleach on which is why I can’t wear contact lenses.’ Four years ago he broke a bone in his hand playing cricket  and at the age of nine, he broke his leg falling off a roof. Blumenthal said: ‘My hip problem is a combination of martial arts, a stretched leg which put my hips out of alignment and my back. 'I’m gradually being rebuilt. It’s funny because I’m feeling pretty good... but it won’t last.’","Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal 'given no choice' by doctors .

During arduous missions, Major Rob Dyer recognized his troops needed something to keep their energy up without any negative side-effects, and an idea was born. The result of his 2008 on-field epiphany was Ruck Pack, a liquid energy shot that contains essential vitamins and minerals to provide energy without caffeine. Dyer developed the product to help weary troops recover quickly from fatigue and dehydration under battlefield conditions with minimal down-time. Small business: Dyer (left) spent three years devising the formula for Ruck Pack two-ounce energy shots . He was frustrated by having to take up to twenty pills and capsules per day to maintain health while in the field when he began thinking about a single-source vitamin and energy shot that would deliver maximum nutrition and energy for performance and endurance. 'Stressful': Dyer spent all the money he'd saved for his family's future investing in Ruck Pack . Dyer, who has served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, says Ruck Pack is a combination of energy drink and dietary supplement. The shot is intended for soldiers dealing with the rigors of war, but Dyer says it's useful to civilians wanting to sustain peak mental and physical performance. 'We knew that whatever nutrition supplements we wanted to create, they needed to fit everybody else’s needs and not just troops,' Dyer told ABC. The two-ounce shot, which is peach flavored and contains vitamins B6 and B12, gingko biloba, St. John’s wort, ginseng, chondroitin, potassium, magnesium, calcium and L-Glutamine, is the first Dyer and his company Noots! Nutrition, have created. Dyer's product, . unlike other energy shots on the market, contains 'No empty energy. No . niacin flush. No shakes. No jolt. No crash. No nasty chemical . aftertaste.' The company focuses on 'attitude, . sharp cognitive skills, strong bones, electrolyte charged bodies, good . circulation, strong muscles, healthy joints, and a responsive immune . system.' 'We didn’t want to . be another ‘energy pouch’ and all we do is fill that void of nutrition that . you’re supposed to be getting in food anyway,' said Dyer. Entrepreneur: Rob Dyer was a decorated Marine when he had the idea for Ruck Pack energy shots . When Dyer left the armed forces, he invested everything he had into Ruck Pack. 'I . did it because I believed in the company and where it was going. 'But . when you come back and you return to your family and you realize that . you have taken all your cash away from all your future planning with . your family, there are definitely some stressful times,' he told ABC. Experienced: Dyer served two tours in Iraq and two in Afghanistan as a Marine . Tank bank: His appearance on ABC's Shark Tank earned Dyer $150,000 in investments from two of the show's panel . Dyer needn't have worried though - Ruck Pack is going from strength to strength. In November last year, the vet appeared on ABC's Shark Tank to try to gain financial support to grow his business. It wasn't his first shot. He'd previously entered the show with Ruck Pack but he never made it past the first round. This time, however, he made it all the way and left the show with $150,000 investment money from Kevin O’Leary and Robert Herjave. Ruck Pack is stocked around the country at various retailers including selected 7/11 stores, health foods stores, cafes and Meijers pharmacies.","Major Rob Dyer created an energy shot to sustain soldiers on the battlefield .

Her shocked mother Amy Brady, 28, from Firbanks in Jarrow, said: 'Sienna was starting to outgrow her baby clothes, so my mum, Lesley Brady, who works at George in Asda, bought her a babygro. 'They have lots of different versions. I took a picture of her on Sunday and then posted it on Facebook and Instagram.

KPRC anchor Bill Balleza has been a familiar face on TV in Houston, Texas, for over 30 years. In that time he has gone from a fresh-faced young presenter straight out of the marines to a 65-year-old seasoned vet carrying some extra pounds – especially around his jowls. Not so familiar face:  Bill Balleza, left, as he appeared last Thursday following his face lift and, right, how he used to look . But when Balleza returned to hosting his nightly news bulletins on KPRC last Thursday, viewers couldn’t help but notice that he had undergone some kind of transformation whereby has flabby lower face now appeared to have significantly reduced. Houston media blogger Mike McGuff was quick to say what Balleza’s loyal viewers were thinking and his speculation prompted the presenter to post a statement on KPRC’s Facebook page. ‘I want to “fess up” about something, dear Facebook Friends,’ he wrote. ‘For reasons that are entirely personal I decided to do something about my appearance.’ Balleza wrote that in recent years he had noticed his face and neck had started sagging. The situation had been exacerbated over the past 18 months, he said, after he lost 25 pounds which had resulted in him looking increasingly saggy around the lower cheeks and jaw area. KPRC anchor Bill Balleza has been a familiar face on TV in Houston, Texas, for over 30 years . As a result Balleza said he decided to have a lower face lift, but that the swelling following his treatment was taking ‘longer than anticipated to abate’. Balleza, who had spent the entire month of July on vacation, was adamant that he hadn’t had any other work done. ‘I did not have any work done on my eyes, but the normal swelling that follows a lower face lift did make the area around my eyes puffy, and the swelling is taking longer than anticipated to abate,’ he wrote. “I could have waited a few more weeks for the swelling to fully resolve but I really wanted to return to the job I love. ‘It is possible that the swelling will be around for a few more weeks and I am hoping that our viewers will indulge me during this period.’ Balleza wrote that in recent years he had noticed his face and neck had started sagging . Balleza’s public seem to have appreciated his honest approach. His Facebook message has received over 100 comments – almost overwhelming positive - and more than 350 likes. The show of support promoted Balleza to posted a message of thanks. ‘I am so heartened by your kind and generous comments, friends! I have to tell you I was very worried about how you would receive this news,’ he wrote. ‘I love you all and always will! Thanks for being my friends. It means more to me than you will ever know.’ San Antonio-born Balleza joined KPRC Local 2 on Aug. 18, 1980. He host bulletins at 5 p.m., 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. Monday through Friday.

The 52 residents of the isolated Pitcairn Island have benefited from millions of pounds in funding from the Department for International Development since 2009. Latest figures show the annual spending . on the British territory has more than doubled in that time, and is now equal to £69,230 for each . of the island’s inhabitants, descendants of sailors who took part in . the famous Mutiny on the Bounty. Spending: The remote Pitcairn Island has received almost £10million in British aid because none of its 52 inhabitants pays tax . The money pays for almost all public services on the island, because the local pay no tax. In 2012-13 DfID set a budget of £3.6million for the 'effective and efficient management of Pitcairn's public services provision'. It is 140 per cent higher than the £1.5million spent in 2009-10 before the coalition was formed. David Cameron has vowed to protect the foreign aid budget from cuts, while the axe has fallen on the police, border forces, social services and councils. UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom caused a storm this week when he argued that Britain should not be sending money to 'Bongo Bongo land' while making cuts at home. Soaring: Funding from the British taxpayer has more than doubled since 2009, and is expected to rise further . The Pitcairn Island is just two miles long and a mile across but has received £9.75million in the last four years. In 2006 it received just £600,000. The Pitcairn aid budget has soared since six men were accused of child sex abuse on the island, and it is believed that some of the money has been spent on constructing a prison for the men after they were found guilty. Apart from state funding, the island's only form of income is international sales of stamps and coins and selling handicrafts to tourists on visiting cruise ships. DfID expects aid funding for the island will continue still further in the future. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The tiny island of Pitcairn receives an incredible amount of taxpayers’ money. ‘It is therefore vital that every effort is taken to reduce the bill for the territory by cutting out waste and supporting measures that make it and similar territories as self-reliant as possible. ‘Sadly, the fact that the amount of taxpayers’ cash earmarked for overseas aid is growing so rapidly in the coming years means that there is little pressure on DfID to make better use of its existing budget.’ In April it emerged thousands of pounds of Britain’s aid budget had been wasted on a project that was supposed to bring green electricity to the island. The £1.7million scheme had to be scrapped because of problems with Australian contractors who were supposed to build the eco scheme. A DFID spokesman said: ‘The UK Government has a responsibility to meet the reasonable assistance needs of the British Overseas Territories, home to British citizens. Pitcairn Island is located in the South Pacific and receives million in British aid . ‘The support we give is negotiated annually with the governments of the overseas territories, based on rigorous analysis of their budgets and regularly reviewed to ensure it represents value for money for UK taxpayers. ‘Where conditions are right, we will invest in aided Overseas Territories to set them on a faster path to independence and economic self-sufficiency.’ The Mutiny on the Bounty took place in 1789, when Captain William Bligh was ousted by his second-in-command, Fletcher Christian. Bligh was cast adrift in a dinghy and later landed on the island of Timor, in the then Dutch East Indies, from where he travelled back to Britain. Christian became a fugitive from British justice and settled on Pitcairn Island, along with other Bounty crewmembers and some Polynesian girls they had kidnapped on Tahiti. Their descendants still live on the island.","Pitcairn Island has received £10million since 2009 but residents pay no tax .

An Irishman wanted in the U.S. for allegedly distributing graphic and violent images of child pornography, has appeared before the High Court in Dublin. Eric Eoin Marques is facing possible extradition to America, accused of being  the 'largest facilitator of child porn on the planet' by the FBI. This week Marques, 28, appeared before the High Court in Ireland, after he was arrested on a Maryland warrant for four charges of distributing and promoting child pornography on the internet. In court: Eric Eoin Marques, aged 28, is pictured as he is being led to the High Court in Dublin, Ireland to face a hearing for a provisional extradition request by the FBI . Mr Marques, from Dublin, appeared before Mr Justice Paul Gilligan yesterday due to an extradition request by the FBI, the Independent reported. He was denied bail until the extradition request has been determined. The images he is accused of distributing and promoting relate to distressing depictions of youngsters being raped or tortured. Mr Marques, who has no previous convictions, has been identified as a 'flight risk' by gardai and the FBI. The High Court heard that large payments had been transferred to accounts in Romania, and his computer's browsing history revealed that he had inquired about Russian visas. Mr Marques is accused of being the 'largest facilitator of child porn on the planet' by the FBI . After appearing before a High Court judge, Marques was denied bail and is considered a 'flight risk' by gardai and FBI . Refusing bail, Mr Justice Paul Gilligan said he accepted the evidence that Mr Marques was a flight risk. Mr Justice Gilligan remanded Mr Marques in custody, to a sitting of the High Court on next Thursday. His arrest coincides with the disappearance of a vast number of 'hidden services' hosted on anonymizing encrypted network Tor. Tor is a popular internet anonymising tool which can be downloaded for free from the web. It enables all members to remain anonymous online and uses an 'onion' system to make sure IP addresses - each computer has its own one - are always hidden from police. It makes identifying the physical location of the computers using the software all but impossible. Tor only protects users from being monitored on applications that are properly configured to send their Internet traffic through the programme unless individuals also use it as a browser instead of Google or Internet Explorer. As well as protecting users from being tracked by police, it also means they are protected from network surveillance and state security known as traffic analysis. This makes interference with the website difficult on morality grounds as it is used by activists trapped in countries with oppressive regimes to communicate without being tracked by governments. Prime examples are human rights groups in China and Iran which would otherwise be censored or even persecuted for expressing their views. A large proportion of Tor's funding comes indirectly from the U.S. state department's internet freedom budget. The website is accessed via a programme called Tor which enables all members to remain anonymous online and uses an 'onion' system to make sure their IP address is always hidden from police. Tor is free software and an open network that makes identifying the physical location of the computers operating the marketplace – or anyone visiting it – all but impossible. It protects internet users against a form of network surveillance and state security known as traffic analysis. They can be used for good - such as activists trapped in oppressive regimes - or bad, with drug dealers selling illegal substances without risk of getting caught. Marques is alleged to be behind Freedom Hosting, a major hidden services hosting provider, Arstechnica reported. Freedom Hosting was one of a number of hosting providers specializing in hidden services. The business — which is in no way connected to the Tor Project — allegedly hosts child pornography sites, as well as sites that allowed pornography traffickers to post their links for distribution, Arstechnica reported. Freedom Hosting was brought to the public's attention in October 2011 after the hacking collective Anonymous shut down the largest host of such illegal material on the Web. In a statement issued on the internet, Anonymous said that it had warned Freedom Hosting to take the sites down but the company failed to do so. Anonymous hackers then disabled its servers and would continue to do so until the material was removed. Its operation began on October 14 and targeted child porn on the ‘darknet’ - anonymised sites designed to protect users' identities, which are invisible to normal web users. Anonymous hackers detected the links to the pornography and removed them but they were up again within five minutes. They then discovered that 95 per cent of the links were being hosted by Freedom Hosting and so shut down the firm’s servers. Freedom Hosting switched to their backups but Anonymous closed them down again.

The royal revealed that he wants his new grandson to call him 'grandpa' as he visited the 132nd Sandringham Flower Show at Sandringham House in Norfolk . Prince Charles has revealed he will insist on being called 'Grandpa' by Prince George. The Prince of Wales announced his preference to an elderly well-wisher at the Sandringham Flower Show. Charles, who was accompanied by his wife Camilla, told Keith Dixon, 70, from Oundle, Northants he wanted to be known as 'grandpa' and not 'granddad'. He then told another member of the crowd he plans to be hands-on with his first grandson.But he added he may take some babysitting lessons first as it was so long since he helped with his own children. Freda Aspinall, 73, of Chatteris, Cambs., said: 'He told me ‘I think I’m going to have to go on a babysitting course as it’s a while since I have done this sort of thing’. 'I then said to Camilla: ‘What does the baby look like?’ 'She said that he looks absolutely gorgeous - that he doesn’t really look like anyone else at the moment but that he’s a really beautiful baby.' During the visit Prince Charles hinted at his excitement at George’s arrival by telling 10-year-old Rebecca Haime from Brundall, Norfolk, he hopes she has nice grandparents. He also joked with fellow grandparent Anne Lee, 62, from Dereham, Norfolk that she had beaten him to it by two years. The couple were given a large numbers of gifts for Prince George including a hand-made shawl and an array of teddy bears and flowers. Charles was pictured face to face with Zephyr, a huge bald eagle which will become the mascot of the Army Air Corps. When asked what she would like to be called by baby George the Duchess of Cornwall said the family 'haven’t decided' for certain. But she revealed to the Daily Mail that ‘GaGa’ is what her own grandchildren call her. ‘I don’t know if it’s because they think I am,’ she joked, ‘but it is still very sweet.’ Charles also told the crowd that he plans to be hands-on with his first grandson but added that he may take some babysitting lessons first as it was so long since he helped with his own children . Camilla disclosed her quirky nickname as she and Prince Charles visited the Sandringham Flower Show in Norfolk, which is held on the Queen’s private estate. Seeking shelter from the rain in the Sandringham Women’s Institute tent, Camilla chatted proudly about Prince William and Kate’s ‘lovely’ new addition to the family as she stocked up on £1.20 packets of chocolate buns. For many families in which parents are divorced or separated, the issue of what to call a step-grandparent can become a social minefield, sometimes causing bitter rifts – although clearly not here. The Duchess of Cornwall made the revelation at the 132nd Sandringham Flower Show at Sandringham House in Norfolk . Ga Ga: The Duchess of Cornwall quipped, 'I don't know if it's because they think I am!' Family: The Duchess has forged an affectionate relationship with her two stepsons, William and Harry . Camilla spoke fondly about her brood of grandchildren: ‘We are all just about to go off on holiday together, there will be seven children in all. Can you imagine? It can be quite chaotic, but I just love having them around.’ Camilla has five grandchildren under the age of five from the two children she had during her first marriage to Brigadier Andrew Parker Bowles. Her son, Tom Parker Bowles, has two children with his wife, Sara: Lola, five, and Freddy, three. Her daughter, Laura Lopes, and her husband Harry also have Eliza, five, and twins Gus and Louis, three. Although she was described as  ‘the Rottweiler’ by William’s late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, friends say Camilla is a warm and generous woman, who adores her growing family. She frequently chats happily about how the ‘entire brood’ regularly take over her private home in Wiltshire at weekends. She has also managed to forge an affectionate relationship with her two stepsons, William and Harry, and was seen offering Kate some wifely advice over lunch shortly before her wedding. As his wife chatted about pet names, Prince Charles was busy collecting gifts from well-wishers to be passed on to baby Prince George, including teddy bears, babygros and books. Charles said: ‘It’s a wonderful feeling [to be a grandfather]. It’s a very nice feeling, isn’t it?’ Cute: The Duchess is presented with some seeds by 22-month-old Evelyn Holt . Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, carries her new born son, the Prince of Cambridge, who may soon be calling his step-grandmother 'Ga Ga' Long to reign over us: Kate and William pose for pictures with their new baby son, George Alexander Louis . He was clearly delighted to receive a teddy bear embroidered with George’s name from 55-year-old Sheila Clark, of Glasgow, asking: ‘You didn’t put a bet on it did you?’ Unfortunately not, she said. He also told Freda Aspinall, 73, herself a great-grandmother, that baby George was ‘very sweet’ but it was ‘too early to say’ who he looked like. ‘I think I am going to have to go on a babysitting course as it’s a while since I have done this sort of thing,’ he added.","Charles revealed the preferred address to well-wishers in Sandringham .

After a two and a half year investigation into the stabbing death of Vanessa Pham in Falls Church, Virginia, police were coming up empty-handed in their quest to find the killer and bring closure for family and friends. The 19-year-old college freshman was found dead in the driver's seat of her crashed car on June 27, 2010, slumped over the center console and covered in blood from 13 stab wounds. Despite finding the murder weapon with fingerprints under the driver's seat, the DNA evidence didn't match anyone in the police database. A break in the case came in April 2012 when Julio Miguel Blanco Garcia was arrested for stealing three bottles of Moet & Chandon champagne from a McLean, Virginia grocery store. Scroll down for video . Caught: Julio Miguel Blanco Garcia, left, will now face trial in the 2010 stabbing death of Vanessa Pham, right, after an April 2012 arrest for stealing champagne provided police with matching fingerprints on the murder weapon . It wasn't until last December that investigators matched Blanco Garcia's prints to the DNA found on the murder weapon and arrested the man. Now, Blanco Garcia will stand trial for Pham's murder. Initially, Blanco Garcia's lawyers tried to get the case dismissed, claiming that the media's coverage of the investigation tainted their client's ability to receive a fair trial since nearly all of the evidence in the case was released before a jury was selected. Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Marum Roush dismissed that claim Thursday, saying all of the evidence reported in The Washington Post would come out in trial and that jury members could set aside what they learned in the press. Taken: Pham was home for the summer, looking forward to a new babysitting job and a visit from her boyfriend when she was stabbed to death giving Blanco Garcia a ride . Pham had just returned home for the summer after her first year studying fashion design at the Savannah College of Art and Design. She was living with her mother at their apartment in Falls Church, and had just landed a babysitting gig for the summer the same day she was killed. Pham was also looking forward to a visit from her boyfriend Aaron Apsley who lived in Ohio. Around 2:45 p.m. she decided to go to the Fairfax Plaza Shopping Center to get her eyebrows done at JD Nail Salon. It was while leaving the salon that she first encountered Blanco Garcia, standing outside holding his 1-year-old daughter. Garcia started his day by going into Washington, D.C. with his daughter to buy $400 dollars of PCP. When he got home he smoked three cigarettes dipped in liquid PCP before going to the mall with his daughter. According . to court documents, by the time he approached Pham outside the mall, he . was having a 'severe PCP intoxication' and asked the young woman to . take him and his daughter to the hospital. Surveillance footage subsequently shows Pham's white Scion exiting the parking lot. Taken for a ride: Pham agreed to take Blanco Garcia and his 1-year-old daughter to the hospital, but was found less than a mile away stabbed to death in her crashed car . According to an account given to police by Blanco Garcia, Pham accidentally took a wrong turn and he overreacted. 'Vanessa did nothing wrong,' a detective paraphrased Blanco Garcia in a report made after his arrest. At . this point, Blanco Garcia was hallucinating and believed that Pham was . going to harm his daughter or call the police, so he acted. He . took out a butcher's knife from his backpack and stabbed the girl 13 . times which caused her to lose control of the vehicle and crash into a . ravine on the side of the road. Blanco Garcia ditched the knife and left Pham to die, fleeing from the vehicle with his daughter through the sunroof. A . driver spotted the car at 3:34pm, less than half a mile from the mall . and called police. When police arrived, they found Pham belted into her . seat and covered in blood with one wheel of the car still spinning. But police were stumped when it came to finding the suspect. Severely intoxicated: Blanco Garcia has spent his day traveling into Washington D.C. to buy $400 dollars of PCP with his daughter, and had smoked three cigarettes dipped in the drugs before going to the shopping center . Even though the knife was left in the car, the DNA evidence produced no matches in the police database. Investigators were certain the killer was a stranger since they had no reason to believe Pham had any enemies or was in any trouble. They canvassed the area around the mall and collected DNA from Pham's friends and family, local sex offenders and homeless people around the mall, but again, no matches. Pham's story was even highlighted on TV show 'America's Most Wanted' to no avail. It wasn't until almost two years later that Blanco Garcia was arrested for stealing two bottles of Moet & Chandon champagne at a grocery store in McLean, Virginia. Even then, it took police until last December 10 to make the connection with his prints. '[Blanco Garcia] was arrested in April for larceny of champagne. Imagine that!' wrote Fairfax County police detective Robert Bond in an email that day. A few days later Blanco Garcia was arrested at his job site in Vienna, Virginia. He said he never told anyone about the killing. A search of Blanco Garcia's computer showed that he tracked news of the investigation on his computer. Blanco Garcia has not yet entered a plea. His first day in court is scheduled for August 19.","Vanessa Pham, 19, was discovered in the driver's seat of her crashed car on June 27, 2010 with 13 stab wounds .

Locked up: Roller skating star Nathan Wright, who performed in front of millions at the London Olympics opening ceremony, has been jailed after having sex with a 14-year-old fan in a car park . Edna Leonard, prosecuting, said it was clear from the start of their contact that the girl was only 14. Derby Crown Court was told Wright, 26, of Tooting, London, went on to persuade the teenager to carry out a sex act on a webcam before he filmed himself performing a sex act and sent a recording to her. Miss Leonard told the hearing they went on to meet at a rolling skating event, where Wright was approached by a number of fans wanting to be photographed with him. She said the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was among them and the pair slipped away to perform sex acts on each other. The court heard they met again at an event at Rollerworld in Derby on October 21 last year. Wright had told the teenager to wear clothes that could easily be removed. Wright persuaded the schoolgirl to slip away from a group of adults and they had sex in a car park. Abuse: Wright had sex with the girl in a car park at Rollerworld in Derby . Jailed: Wright is pictured performing a trick inside the Olympic stadium. He began messaging the teenage girl after she had made contact with him through YouTube . Recorder Paul Mann QC, sentencing, told Wright, who also took part in the Paralympic Games opening ceremony: 'You are known as an accomplished roller-skater and have your profile on the internet. 'You have, through your skating, the opportunity to become a role model for young people. 'There must be young people who have followed you who feel let down by the offences you have committed.' Wright, who admitted sexual grooming and two counts of sexual activity with a child, was jailed for five years. He was also told he could not use the internet to contact anyone under 16 and was put on the sex offenders' register. Roller skater: Wright performed in front of a TV audience of millions at the Olympics Opening Ceremony . The court heard that he had previously been jailed for four-and-a-half years for a rape he committed when he was 18. Jonathan Straw, defending, said the girl was a willing partner in their meetings and had sexual experience before meeting him. He added: 'Before the text friendship developed, however inappropriately, there was genuine feeling on both sides. This is not a case where she was pressured. 'Unfortunately, the very rapid, almost explosive use of social networking among young people can give rise to this sort of difficulties.'","Nathan Wright, 26, was contacted by the schoolgirl through YouTube .

On his birthday the Prince of Wales will meet the blockbuster's director Peter Jackson as he puts his finishing touches to the first movie 'An Unexpected Journey' during the Royal's Diamond Jubilee tour of Australasia. Charles will visit a leading workshop that created special effects for the much anticipated fantasy film - one of the highlights of the Prince's two-week tour with the Duchess of Cornwall to Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand in honour of the Queen's 60-year reign. Royally excited: Prince Charles is a huge Tolkien fan and will be heading to the workshop of The Hobbit on his birthday to meet director Peter Jackson (right) and his team in New Zealand . The heir to the throne will meet the filmmaker on the day of his 64th birthday - November 14 - and be shown make-up props worn by actors including The Office star Martin Freeman, who plays Bilbo Baggins - the lead role in The Hobbit. A royal aide said that in the workshop, based in the New Zealand capital Wellington, Charles would 'come face to face with rather extraordinary, rather terrifyingly in some cases, life-like prosthetics including the feet and hands of the Baggins family...' 'The Prince is a great fan of children’s literature and Tolkien is one of the great icons of children’s literature,' a royal source said, adding: 'He and the Duchess have seen Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings films and the Prince has said he is very much looking forward to seeing Bilbo Baggins’s foot.' Anticipated: The Hobbit, starring Britain's own Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins is being released as a trilogy with the first installment out in the UK in December - pictured is an upcoming scene . Camilla will be making her first trip to the three countries, in a private or public capacity, while Charles, a seasoned traveller, has visited the southern hemisphere nations many times . The film receives its world premiere next month in New Zealand and the Prince will get a sneak preview of the movie - the first of a three-part instalment based on JRR Tolkien's much loved children's book. The themes of the Jubilee visit include service to the community, encouragement of economic growth and innovation, promotion of youth enterprise, celebration of sport in the community and support for the Armed Forces. Speaking about the first leg of the tour to Papua New Guinea which begins on November 3 the aide added: 'The visit is centred on the capital Port Moresby but also includes a visit to a nearby fishing village called Boera where a traditional and probably rather dramatic welcome is planned by the local inhabitants.' Thrilling: The film will see the return of Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Prince Charles will learn all about how costumes, sets and prosthetics for the movie have been made . Story: The Hobbit, published in 1937, tells the journey of Bilbo, who goes on a quest to steal treasure guarded by a dragon - shown considering the task before him . Domestic violence is a serious issue in the country and Camilla will visit a women's refuge to highlight the topic during their three-day visit to the nation. In Australia the royal couple have set themselves the task of visiting four major cities - Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney and the capital Canberra - the outback town of Longreach in Queensland and the island state of Tasmania in just six days from November 5-10. The final leg to New Zealand, from November 10-16, will see the royal . couple meet popular children's author Lynley Dodd, writer of the Hairy . Maclary stories about the adventures of a hairy dog. Trip: The Royal couple will visit Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand and will be Camilla's first official journey to the region . Charles shares his birthday with the Governor General Sir Jerry . Mateparae, and Bronagh Key, wife of the Prime Minister John Key, and the . trio will celebrate their anniversaries with 64 specially chosen New . Zealanders also born on the same day. The final day takes the royal travellers to Christchurch to see how . residents have rebuilt their lives after last year's devastating . earthquake. A royal aide said: 'The theme of the Jubilee, as you'll know, is service to others and their royal highnesses are determined to meet as many people possible in the time available which is why we're trying to get around so many states and territories as we possibly can.'","Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall will visit during his Diamond Jubilee tour of Australasia next month .

Titus Bramble, 30, was held by officers in the early hours after the cab driver became concerned by the player's behaviour towards his fellow passenger . A Premier League footballer was suspended from his club today after he was arrested over an alleged sex attack on a woman in the back of a taxi. Titus Bramble, 30, was held by officers in the early hours after the cab driver became concerned by the player’s behaviour towards his fellow passenger. Instead of driving Bramble home, he took the pair straight to a nearby police station and alerted officers. They then arrested the defender, who earns £40,000 a week playing for Sunderland, on suspicion of sexual assault and possession of a Class A drug. Today Bramble was suspended by his club which said in a statement: 'Sunderland AFC has confirmed that Titus Bramble has been suspended . from duties, pending the outcome of a club investigation. 'The player will not attend team training or be available for selection for matches during this period.' Bramble was last night released on police bail over the alleged attack in Yarm, North Yorkshire, and left the police station in a black Mercedes. A source said: ‘He was in a nightclub on the high street until about 2.30am. He then left the club and got into a taxi with a girl. ‘The taxi driver was heading towards Bramble’s home 15 miles away in Wynyard when he became concerned about what was happening in the back of his taxi. ‘He instead drove Bramble and the girl five miles to a nearby police station where he alerted officers to what was going on. ‘They came out and then arrested him on suspicion of sexual assault. Bramble is said to have travelled to Yarm on Tuesday evening for what is known locally as 'grab a granny night' before entering the Cross Keys nightclub (pictured) Footballer Titus Bramble, seen here playing for England, was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and possession of a class A drug . ‘They also allegedly discovered a white powder and arrested him on suspicion of possessing a Class A drug. Tests are continuing to determine what the substance is.’ Bramble was later transferred from Stockton to Middlesbrough police station where he was held in the cells overnight and questioned yesterday. His alleged victim was taken to a specialist unit where she was interviewed in a video suite by trained officers. Bramble, a former England Under-21 international, had been playing for his club side just 24 hours earlier in a 2-1 defeat to Norwich. He is said to have travelled to Yarm on Tuesday evening for what is known locally as ‘grab a granny night’ before entering the Cross Keys nightclub. Bramble left the club in the early hours. Last night, a spokesman for Sunderland FC said: ‘The club is looking into this matter but due to ongoing police investigations is unable to comment further at this stage.’ A Cleveland Police spokesman said: ‘A 30-year-old man from Wynyard has been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and possession of a class A drug. ‘He is currently being questioned by police and inquiries are ongoing.’ Bramble’s career started at his hometown club, Ipswich, before he was signed by Newcastle United under Sir Bobby Robson for £6million in 2002. After a largely unsuccessful period that saw him mocked by fans for a series of defensive errors, he later joined Wigan Athletic, where his career recovered, before securing a transfer back to the North East with Sunderland last year.

Russia is said to be working on a manned mission to Mars, and is planning to use the results from this flight to help with this. They plan to create a base on the Moon for flights to the Red Planet by 2030. Vladimir Sychov from the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medical and Biological research said the Bion-M flight was the first time animals had been put in space for such a long period of time. Russian scientists involved in the mission said it was not possible to carry out the tests on astronauts who are currently working on the International Space Station (ISS) because of logistical and health reasons. Additionally, the animals couldn't be put on board the ISS with the astronauts because they may have posed a serious health risk. Last month a group of 12 'pillownauts' took part in a scientific bed study in France, during which they spent a total of nine weeks lying at a six-degree angle below the horizontal. Lying at this precise angle has the same affect on the human body as flying in weightlessness. Scientists at the Medes Institute in Toulouse, France, in collaboration with France’s CNES space agency, were testing the physical effects weightlessness can have on astronauts during long spaceflights. During the study, tissue samples were taken from the pillownauts and their diet was strictly controlled.","The plants and animals, which also included gerbils and newts, had been orbiting the Earth in a Bion-M capsule for 30 days .

Former Navy chaplain Gordon Klingenschmitt has voiced his outrage at the overturning of Proposition 8 in California, saying there's a 'demonic spirit of lawlessness' among government officials. Klingenschmitt, who was discharged from the Navy for insubordination, made the comments on yesterday's episode of his YouTube program, Pray in Jesus Name. The chaplain labeled various things 'lawless' during the show, including gay people, sodomy, the government officials who 'refuse to enforce the law' and lust. Scroll down for video . Above the law: Klingenshmitt has labeled government officials who 'refuse' to enforce Proposition 8 'lawless' 'Lust is not love, and and whatever they're doing behind closed doors is not love in the homosexual community. It is lawlessness,' said Klingenschmitt, 'and it is causing the love of many to grow cold.' Following his diatribe against homosexuality and the Californian lawmakers who 'refuse' to institute Proposition 8, Klingenschmitt led his viewers in prayer. 'Father in heaven, we pray that you would enforce your law... The law of love that prohibits lust, the law that prohibits sin, prohibits lawlessness. That God's highest law of true, selfless love will be established and will ban sodomy, which is a perversion and it's not love at all.' The right-wing pundit spoke out in favor of discrimination in another installment of Pray in Jesus Name earlier this week. Let us pray: Klingenschmitt asked God to enforce 'the law of love that prohibits lawlessness' 'If . your heart is full of corruption or sin or immorality - in this case, . homosexuality - then you should be discriminated against,' Klingenschmitt argued. He then tried to prove that Martin Luther King Jr had advocated discrimination - just not on skin color. 'When these confusing statutes now try to redefine discrimination and say that you can no longer discriminate against character... they're actually saying Martin Luther King himself ought to be punished for his views, and that's not right,' he concluded, somewhat nonsensically. Klingenschmitt is no stranger to controversy. He was court-martialled for disobeying orders and was eventually discharged from the Navy for turning up at anti-Navy protests in full uniform. Publicity: Klingenschmitt publically protested at not being able to pray in Jesus name after Navy chaplains were asked to be 'inclusive' at command event settings that aren't specifically religious . Since then, he's made discrimination against the LBGT community his quest. He has claimed that gay marriage will destroy straight marriage, but when questioned by David Pakeman last month about how his marriage to his wife had been affected by gay people marrying each other, he was unable to come up with a single reason. Later, he published a list of seven ways in which his marriage was affected by gay marriage, including that it had increased his taxes and increased the national debt due to 'tax benefits' given to gay couples.","Gordon Klingenschmitt said there is a 'demonic spirit of lawlessness' among government officials .

A distraught Tennessee couple have denied they neglected their parental duties after their 407lbs 15-year-old son died and his chronically ill sister passed away just four months later. Despite losing their remaining 12-year-old daughter to a care home, Derek and Sherry Head are adamant that they are good parents - reminding authorities they have buried two of their children after doing everything they could for them. 'Nobody knows what it is like to have to do CPR on your own child,' said an emotional Sherry as she spoke about her daughter Tamara. 'I wouldn’t go through it again, not in a million years. I done everything I could … to bring her back' Derek and Sherry Head at their home in Red Boiling Springs, Tennessee - they deny any neglect of their disabled children who died within four months of each other last year . However, after the consecutive deaths of morbidly obese Adam, 15, who weighed 407 pounds in April and his sister from cystic fibrosis in July, concerns across child welfare in Red Boiling Springs have grown. Both Derek and Sherry were unable to work due to illness and the Tennessean newspaper, which conducted an investigation into the teenagers deaths, raising the point that child welfare services might have neglected the children along with the parents. 'If you’re looking to lay blame on somebody, a lot of people could be blamed,' said Gerald Papica, state ombudsman for children and families to the Tennessean. 'There could be a dozen people who knew about it. Probably, some of these people were helping these parents. 'The community, somehow,' he said, 'becomes desensitized.' Diagnosed with the chronic lung condition cystic fibrosis in 2002, Tamara was investigated by the Division of Child Support (DCS) after she was found wondering alone at a trailer park when she was aged five. The Head's second child, Adam suffered from developmental issues and struggled with learning and speech - growing to 450 pounds. 'He was like a teddy bear,' said Sherry. Adam Head (left) ballooned to 405 pounds before his death following seizure in March 2012 - while Tamara Head (right) died in July 2012 after also suffering a seizure and apparent stimulant overdose . Both parents did not work and relied on food stamps and the disability checks Adam and Tamara were issued by the government. They supplemented that income by scrapping metal and mowing lawns. Neither parent qualified for state disability payments. 'It was kinda hard for me and Derek to shop because we had to get foods for Adam that wasn’t fattening and foods for Tamara that had a whole lot of fattening in it to help her gain weight,' said Sherry. In 2009, someone told DCS that the children were not being looked after properly - so someone came to investigate. 'She said she didn’t see no problem, that we had done all we could for our children,' explained Sherry. 'She said, ‘Instead of people picking on you all,’ she said, ‘I think they should help you.’ That was her words.' However, the descent of Adam caused his health needs to go unanswered. He had a history of mild mental retardation, sleep apnea, an unknown thyroid problem and morbid obesity, records show. By November 2011, his appetite had become such an issue that doctors told the Heads to nail down every cupboard and chain the refrigerator. Derek and Sherry Head were investigated by police - however, no charges were pressed - but child welfare services took away their remaining 12-year-old child after the deaths of their elder children last year . By March 2012 his health had deteriorated to such an extent that as the family traveled to the Clay County Library Sherry noticed Adam turning pale and struggling to breathe. On the way to hospital he suffered a seizure, and his last words were, 'Am I going to remember you and Daddy?' Tragically, Adam died from a pulmonary embolism and the medical examiner ruled his death to be of natural causes and listed morbid obesity as a contributing factor. However, tragedy struck again just four months later in July when at 3.29 a,m. on the morning of July 19th, paramedics arrived at the Head's home to find Tamara unresponsive - with blood pouring from her nose. Again, the Heads had phone for help when their child began seizing and when the first attempt to revive her was unsuccessful they attempted to revive the girl by throwing water on her. The Heads told paramedics they did not know what had caused the attack, according to the DCS case file. However, the Head's youngest sister told the DCS that Tamara had overdosed on Adderall - a drug used to control attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The possibility of a drug overdose was not mentioned by police or paramedics in their reports, according to the medical examiner who performed an autopsy - but a paramedic did note that the home was in a foul condition with food and cockroaches lying everywhere. Tennessee Division of Child Support (DCS) In addition, the surviving 12-year-old child told investigators that Tamara became sick at 11 p.m. - four hours before the 911 call was made. And the girl said it was she, not a parent, who called. 'Nobody knows what it is like to have to do CPR on your own child,' Sherry said to the Tennessean, as she began to cry. “ . 'I wouldn’t go through it again, not in a million years. I done everything I could … to bring her back.' The Child Protective Investigative Team in Tennessee concluded that the Heads were responsible for neglect in Tamara's case, but not Adama's and their 12-year-old girl was taken away from them. They have not been charged. According to the Tennessean the Heads said they are trying to abide by the court orders and DCS demands that could return the child. 'They’ve been under pressure to pay child support and have had to complete IQ tests and undergo a home inspection. “They twist around what the truth is and don’t take time to talk to the parents to know what’s going on,” Derek said. “They didn’t live with us. They didn’t know what we were doing. 'It’s strange that two kids died within five months, but Adam was natural causes and Tamara was accidental,' he added. 'It’s very difficult when you lose your oldest daughter and oldest son.'","Derek and Sherry Head lost two of their three children last year in the space of four months .

The 45-year-old Brazilian, whose mother died two days after giving birth to him, was struck down by infantile paralysis brought on by polio, leaving him incapable of fending for himself. He needs constant help with his breathing from an artificial respirator, cannot walk unaided and has left his hospital 'universe' barely more than 50 times. But despite his debilitating condition, Paulo has trained as a computer animator and is making a film about his life, based on a story by his best friend, confidante and roommate, Eliana Zagui, who also suffered polio as a child and has lived in the Sao Paulo's Clinicas ever since. Survivor: Paulo Henrique Machado needs constant help with his breathing from an artificial respirator, cannot walk unaided and has left his hospital 'universe' barely more than 50 times . 'Some people think we are like husband and wife, but we are more like brother and sister,' Paolo told the BBC. 'Every day, when I wake up I have the . certainty that my strength is over there - Eliana. And it's . reciprocated. I trust her and she trusts me.' The pair were among 11 children admitted to the hospital with polio - an all-but-wiped-out but highly-infectious viral disease that affects under fives - in the 1970s. Computer whiz: But despite his debilitating condition, Paulo has trained as a computer animator and is making a film about his life . Best friend: The film is based on a story by his best friend, confidante and roommate, Eliana Zagui, who also suffered polio as a child and has lived in the Sao Paulo's Clinicas ever since . Happy together: Doctors never understood why Paulo and . Eliana outlived the others, but they say the experience, while very sad, . has brought them closer together . Forced to live in what was called a . 'torpedo' - effectively a body-encasing iron lung - during his early . years, he was forced to create his own 'universe' inside the confines of his hospital prison. His earliest memories are of 'exploring' the corridors of each ward in his wheelchair, wandering into the rooms of other children, his only toy being his imagination. Polio is a crippling . and sometimes fatal virus that has been all but wiped out in the developed world. A highly-infectious disease, polio attacks the nervous system and can lead to paralysis, disability and even death. But thanks to a vaccine programme in the Sixties, polio has been eradicated, though it remains a problem in Nigeria, Afghanistan and Pakistan. But 80 per cent of survivors later experience post-polio syndrome, though doctors don't know why. The symptoms - pain and weakness, fatigue and muscle loss - can strike any time from 15 to 50 years after the initial disease. One of the major breakthroughs was the invention of the iron lung, a body-encasing machine that fills lungs with . air by making the chest rise (pictured). Before its invention, children with polio died frequently. But, with an average life expectancy of just ten years, Paulo and Eliana watched all their friends die, one by one. Doctors never understood why Paulo and Eliana outlived the others, but they say the experience, while sad, has brought them closer together. 'It was difficult,' says Machado. 'Each loss was like a dismembering, . you know, physical… like a mutilation. Now, there's just two . of us left - me and Eliana.' The risk of infection is high for Paulo and Eliana, so they rarely travel outside of the hospital. But advancing technology has allows them increasing freedom to see parts of the world that ordinary people may take for granted. They have, however, made the odd trip outside; their most memorable outing was to the beach in the 1990s. 'There are some [trips] which stand out, like seeing the beach for . the first time when I was 32,' he says. 'I opened the car door and saw the sea and . thought 'Wow! What is this?' Eliana, . who says she had built an image of the sea based on films, pictures and . postcards that she had seen, adds: 'They took us out of the vehicles, Paulo was in a . wheelchair and they pushed my bed onto the sand. 'You enjoy these little moments, that many people take for granted. They don't stop to marvel like we do.' Because they have lived at the hospital for so long, they are allowed to decorate their room in whatever way they chose. While they say it often brings out a friendly argument, they have agreed to split the room down the middle. Paulo's side is filled with film memorabilia, while Eliana's side is full of books and dolls. Neither have attended 'school' in the way other children do. But that hasn't stopped them gaining an education. The iron lung: Forced to live in what was called a .

Sunbathers headed to the beach this summer will find new sunscreen labels on store shelves that are designed to make the products more effective and easier to use. But despite those long-awaited changes, many sunscreens continue to carry SPF ratings that some experts consider misleading and potentially dangerous, according to a consumer watchdog group. A survey of 1,400 sunscreen products by the Environmental Working Group finds that most products meet new federal requirements put in place last December. Warning: Many sunscreens continue to carry SPF ratings that some experts consider misleading and potentially dangerous, a consumer watchdog group said today . The rules from the Food and Drug Administration ban terms like 'waterproof,' which regulators consider misleading, and require that sunscreens filter out both ultraviolet A and B rays. Previously some products only blocked UVB rays, which cause most sunburn, while providing little protection against UVA rays that pose the greatest risk of skin cancer and wrinkles. Despite that broader protection, one in . seven products reviewed by the watchdog group boasted sun protection . factor, or SPF, ratings above 50, which have long been viewed with . skepticism by experts. In part, that's because SPF numbers like 100 or 150 can give users a false sense of security, leading them to stay in the sun long after the lotion has stopped protecting their skin. Many consumers assume that SPF 100 is twice as effective as SPF 50, but dermatologists say the difference between the two is actually negligible. Where an SPF 50 product might protect against 97per cent of sunburn-causing rays, an SPF 100 product might block 98.5per cent of those rays. 'The high SPF numbers are just a gimmick,' says Marianne Berwick, professor of epidemiology at the University of New Mexico. 'Most people really don't need more than an SPF 30 and they should reapply it every couple of hours.' Berwick says sunscreen should be used . in combination with hats, clothing and shade, which provide better . protection against ultraviolet radiation. Some . dermatologists say there may be some rationale for using higher SPF . sunscreens, since users often don't apply enough of the lotion to get . its full effect. 'High SPF numbers are just a gimmick. Most people don't need more than SPF 30 and should reapply every couple of hours' 'The challenge is that beyond 50 the increase in UV protection is relatively small,' says Dr. Henry Lim, chair of dermatology at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. The SPF number indicates the amount of sun exposure needed to cause sunburn on sunscreen-protected skin compared with unprotected skin. For example, a SPF rating of 30 means it would take the person 30 times longer to burn wearing sunscreen than with exposed skin. There is a popular misconception that the SPF figure relates to a certain number of hours spent in the sun. However this is incorrect, since the level of exposure varies by geography, time of day and skin complexion. The FDA itself said in 2011 that 'labeling a product with a specific SPF value higher than 50 would be misleading to the consumer.' At the time the agency proposed capping all SPF values at 50 because 'there is not sufficient data to show that products with SPF values higher than 50 provide greater protection for users.' But regulators have faced pushback from companies, including Johnson & Johnson, which argue that higher SPF products provide measurable benefits. As a result, the FDA says it is still reviewing studies and comments submitted by outside parties, and there is no deadline for the agency to finalize an SPF cap. It took the agency decades to put in place last year's sunscreen changes. FDA first announced its intent to draft sunscreen rules in 1978 and published them in 1999. The agency then delayed finalizing the regulations for years until it could address concerns from both industry and consumers. The FDA is also reviewing the safety of effectiveness of spray-on products, which use different formulations from other sun-protection solutions. Among other concerns, the agency is looking at whether the sprays can be harmful when inhaled. The survey by the Environmental Working Group found that one in four sunscreens sold in the U.S. is a spray product. 'People like the sprays because they are quick to put on and cover a lot of area,' said Dr. Darrell Rigel, a dermatologist in New York. 'The downside is that you usually have to apply two coats.' More than 76,000 men and women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with melanoma this year and 9,480 are expected to die from the aggressive form of skin cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute. The disease, which is often linked to ultraviolet exposure, is usually curable when detected early.","A survey of 1,400 sunscreen products by the Environmental Working Group found that one in seven boasted sun protection factor above 50."

A rare, antique torpedo that was last fired almost 120 years ago has been uncovered at the bottom of the ocean - by a dolphin working for the US Navy. The bottlenose, named Ten, found the brass relic, known as the Howell torpedo, during a routine patrol and reconnaissance training mission off the coast of California. The US Navy employs dolphins - and some sea lions - to scour the depths for mines, shipwrecks and enemy divers. But 19th century naval weaponry is a particularly rare find, especially one that has lain undisturbed on the ocean bed since 1895. Military marvel: In its heyday, the 11-foot Howell torpedo was considered a masterpiece of innovation and one of the most technologically-advanced pieces of military hardware in the US Navy's arsenal . 'We've never found anything like this,' Mike Rothe, who heads the dolphin search programme, told the Los Angeles Times. 'Never.' In its heyday, the 11-foot Howell torpedo was considered a masterpiece of innovation and one of the most technologically-advanced pieces of military hardware in the US Navy's arsenal. Fired from above water or through submerged torpedo tubes, it could cut silently through the water at speeds of 25 knots and sink an unsuspecting enemy warship from up to 700 yards away.

Only fifty were ever built by a Rhode Island company between 1870 and 1899, before it was outdated by another prototype made by a rival firm. 'Considering it was made before electricity was provided to US households, it was pretty sophisticated for its time,' Christian Harris, operations supervisor for the biosciences division at the Systems Center Pacific, told the LA Times.

Made of brass, the projectile was driven by a 132-pound flywheel spun to 10,000 rpm before launch. After years of development, three prototypes were tested in 1885 in Newport Harbour. Despite watching the first two grind to a halt and sink shortly after deployment, its makers returned to the drawing board and tweaked its mechanism. Soon they were issued to the US Navy, becoming the first automobile torpedo issued to the fleet. Until now, it was believed there was just one left in existence - on display at the Naval Undersea Museum in Keyport, Washington. It is perhaps ironic that something seen at the time as an embodiment of technological advancement was discovered more than a century later by trained mammals and not state-of-the-art computers. But the US Navy is increasingly turning to dolphins to search the ocean beds, because their on-board scanning systems remain unmatched by any man-made sonar. Currently there are 80 bottlenosed dolphins and 50 sealions being trained at Point Loma facility for mine detection, mine clearing and swimmer protection. Indeed, during the 2003 Iraq invasion, dolphins were dispatched to the Persian Gulf to hunt for mines and enemy divers. They are also used to guard submarines in Georgia and Washington State. Experts say they are swifter and more accurate at detecting undersea objects than even the most sophisticated technology thanks to a keen eyesight and mysteriously-complex bio-sonar system. 'Dolphins naturally possess the most sophisticated sonar known to man,' Braden Duryee, an official at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific, told the LA Times. To train them, sea wildlife experts drop objects of different shapes and sizes into the sea in areas of poor visibility. If they find something they return to the surface and tap their snout on the front of the boat. If they find nothing they tap their snout on the stern. Their first clue was when Ten the dolphin returned from a shallow dive and tapped the boat's bow. His handlers thought nothing of it. But when Ten's colleague Spetz did the exact same thing suspicions were aroused. Navy divers dove to investigate the mysterious object, broken in two pieces, and found a stamp on one section that read: 'USN No. 24'. It was carefully hauled to the surface and taken to the  Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington to be cleaned up.","The relic was uncovered by Ten the bottlenose dolphin off California coast .

Alex Rodriguez should have taken the advice given to him earlier this season by Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman. The controversial Yankees' rant against his team and Major League Baseball has caused the league to reject Rodriguez's request to negotiate and will cost the mouthy third baseman at least 214 games, according to a report. A lifetime ban is also still being considered. His ranting came only weeks after Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman infamously told ESPN that 'Alex should just shut the f--k up.' Rodriguez is reported to have been rebuffed when he reached out to the league to negotiate a settlement only hours after declaring he is 'mentally prepared to play for five more years' and boasting that he 'will keep fighting.’ Scroll down for video . Five more years: New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez believes he can play five more years - despite the threat of a lifetime ban . Perhaps emboldened by a third inning home run, Rodriguez shot himself in the foot with Friday's ranting, even being rejected by Yankees officials he contacted Saturday to try to reach a settlement on the remainder of his contract, the New York Daily News reported Saturday afternoon. League officials are said to have been angered by Rodriguez insinuating his team and the league were conspiring against him, according to the Daily News, which explained the aging player will be suspended for violating the drug agreement collectively bargained between MLB and the player's union, as well as for violating the 'just cause' provision of the agreement by interfering with and lying to investigators regarding both his involvement in Biogenesis and his use of PEDs. Rodriguez is widely expected to appeal any suspension - which would allow him to play until the case is heard by an arbitrator. Rodriguez next takes the field Saturday night in what should be his final rehab game in Trenton. The only way to stop Rodriguez from joining the Yankees in Chicago on Monday would be if Selig issues a lifetime ban, which 'still appears to be in play,' according to Yankees beat reporter Mark Feinsand. Perhaps Rodriguez should have taken Cashman's advice, or at least considered it before accusing the league and the Yankees of a conspiracy and boasting that he'd play for five more years. Cashman's comments came in June after A-Rod declared himself medically cleared and ready to play on Twitter. Alluding to the belief that he is being . singled out by Major League Baseball, Rodriguez said ‘I think it’s . pretty self-explanatory. I think that’s the pink elephant in the room,’ before adding that he agrees the game needs to be rid of PEDs. Rodriguez . admitted to using steroids while with the Texas Rangers, but has denied . using PEDs since joining the Yankees in 2004. ‘I will say this, there’s more than one party that benefits from me never stepping back on the field. That’s not my teammates and not the Yankee fans,’ said Rodriguez. The latest allegations claim the 14-time all-star used PEDs as far back as at least 2010. But Rodriguez didn’t stop there, with his next comments aimed squarely at the Yankees, the team that owes him more than $100million over the next four years. Out with a bang!: A-Rod admires what may be the last home run he hits as a professional ball player Friday night during a rehab game with the minor league Trenton Thunder . ‘But when all this stuff is going on in the background, and people are finding creative ways to cancel your contract, that’s concerning for me, concerning for present and I think it should be concerning for future players, as well,’ said Rodriguez. His comments came after his first minor league rehab game as he races to come back from both off-season hip surgery and a strained quad before MLB Commissioner Bud Selig suspends him, which reports indicate will happen no later than next week. Stepping onto the field, there was an even mixture of boos and cheers from the 8,000-plus crowd on hand against the Reading Fightin Phils, a minor league affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies. Rodriguez attributed the Bronx cheer to his role in helping the Yankees beat the Phillies in the 2009 World Series. ‘I think there were a lot of Phillies fans out there, and they don't have good memories from me,’ said Rodriguez, perhaps half-jokingly. Soaking it up: A-Rod gestures to the crowd as rounds the bases after his monster home run . The suspension hanging over Rodriguez is a result of his alleged involvement with Biogenesis, a South Florida anti-aging clinic MLB investigators have accused of selling PEDs such as steroids and human growth hormone to a list of athletes long enough field an all-star team on its own. Varying reports say anywhere from eight to 14 other players are expected to be suspended in connection with Biogenesis. The suspensions were due to be announced by the end of this week, but the latest reports say the axe will fall in the next two or three days. At the same time, the Yankees have publicly stated their plan is to have the 19-year veteran Rodriguez in their lineup Monday against the Chicago White Sox. ‘I think it’s possible, yeah,’ manager Joe Girardi said in San Diego when asked if the embattled slugger would return to the lineup. Rodriguez was a bit more jovial in his answer to the same question, saying he’d be in the lineup ‘unless I get hit by lightning, and these days you never know.’ You lie!: Fans let the alleged steroid cheat know how they really felt, both with boos and signs held before, during and after the game . A-Rod was set to join the Yankees in July when his strained quad delayed his return to the Bronx, an injury he openly contested in the media. The move backfired when the doctor his handlers picked turned out to have been in trouble with New Jersey officials earlier this year. Rodriguez, in the end, accepted the rehabilitation assignment, Friday’s game in Trenton was the first game of his assigned rehab. The league’s highest-paid player, at $28million per season, it has been widely reported since at least last season that the Yankees were trying to figure out how to get out from under the ill-advised contract owing him more than $100 million over the next four seasons. On his way: Rodriguez said he will be back with the Yankees for Monday's game against the White Sox in Chicago, unless he's 'struck by lightning' Current Baltimore Orioles Manager Buck Showalter – himself a former Yankees manager – went so far as to say the league is perhaps even conspiring with the team to deal with A-Rod, saying that if the Yankees are allowed to ‘get away with that,’ they will go on another spending spree snagging big name free agents as they have in the past. There are two schools of thought on what Selig may do with A-Rod. One has him using the ‘best interest of the game’ power afforded him as commissioner to ban the suspected cheater for life. The other has Selig and Rodriguez agreeing to a settlement that would see the beleaguered player sit out the rest of this season and all of 2014, which at 38 years old, would effectively end A-Rod’s career. Selig’s endgame is to have Rodriguez never step on the field again, Rodriguez sees a different outcome. ‘I’m ready to go. I feel 100%,’ Rodriguez said. ‘A night like tonight illustrates to me that I can play now and I can play for a long time.’","Alleged steroid cheat Alex Rodriguez teed off on both Major League Baseball and the Yankees after playing in a minor league rehabilitation game Friday night .

It was a film that came to symbolise the second intifada as Palestinian-Israeli tensions exploded into war. But iconic footage of a 12-year-old Palestinian boy being shot dead during a gunfight between Israeli and Palestinian soldiers has been branded a fake and a 'blood libel' - 13 years after it shocked the world. A new Israeli report into Muhammad al Dura's death in the Gaza Strip claims the images may . have been staged by France 2, the French television station that broke the story in 2000. The claims, which will reignite tensions in an already highly-volatile region, have caused such outrage in Gaza that al Dura's father himself has offered to exhume his son's body so an international inspection can be carried out. Scroll down for video . The pictures of Mohammed and Jamal al-Dura under fire in Gaza were shown around the world in 2000 . The 55-second clip, that was seen by millions of television viewers across the world when it aired on September 30, 2000, showed al Dura clinging to his father, Jamal, behind a barrel as bullets flew around them. The father is seen gesturing frantically to try to stop the shooting as the boy screams in terror. The . camera then cuts to a shot of the motionless boy slumped in his . father's lap. A French TV report blamed Israeli troops for killing the . boy which Israel has long disputed. Images . of al Dura taken from the film were reproduced on stamps, and on murals . painted across the Middle East; schools and streets were named . after him; and he became viewed as a martyr in Gaza. The France 2 television network report, . which aired days after the Palestinian uprising . erupted, directly blamed al-Dura's death on Israeli forces. But presenting the report yesterday, Israel's minister for strategic affairs Yuval Steinitz branded the programme 'utterly baseless' and a 'modern-day blood libel against the state of Israel.' Bizarrely, the Israeli Defence Forces . (IDF) even admitted killing the boy by accident at first, but quickly backtracked claiming he was in fact slain by Palestinian friendly . fire. Israel later blamed the 'mistake' on the 'fog of war', claiming it was made before all the evidence was gathered. The father is seen gesturing frantically to try to stop the shooting as the boy screams in terror . Unforgettable: The camera cuts to a shot of the motionless child slumped in his father's lap . Israel now says France 2's claim that Israeli forces killed the . boy is misleading, provides no evidence and is part of a smear campaign . against the Jewish state. The 44-page report of . its investigation, ordered last year by Israel's current Defence . Minister Moshe Yaalon, says it also 'served as an inspiration and . justification for terrorism, antisemitism and the delegitimising of . Israel'. It said France 2 failed to broadcast . peripheral footage, not aired in the original programme, in which the . boy 'is seen to be alive' and 'moved his arm and turned his head', adding that there was no evidence the boy . was shot by Israeli troops or that he was even killed at all. Proof of this, it said, was that there were no blood marks on the scene or bullet wounds in the alleged . victims. Remembering: Baraa al-Dura, sister of Mohammed al-Dura poses with a picture of her sibling in Bureij Refugee Camp in the Gaza Strip . 'It is important to focus on this . incident, which has slandered Israel's reputation,' Israeli Prime . Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a ceremony where the report was . delivered to him, branding it a 'manifestation of of the ongoing, mendacious campaign to deligitimise Israel'. The second Palestinian intifada or uprising broke out at the end of September 2000 and is named after the Jerusalem mosque complex where the violence began.Frustrations that years of the negotiation had failed to deliver a Palestinian state were intensified by the collapse of the Camp David summit in July 2000.Ariel Sharon, then the leader of Israel's opposition, paid a visit to the site in East Jerusalem known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif, and to Jews as Temple Mount, which houses the al-Aqsa mosque - and frustration boiled over into violence. In one of the enduring images of the conflict 12-year-old Muhammad Durrah is killed during a gunbattle between Israeli troops and Palestinians in the Gaza strip, kindling Palestinian anger about the growing number of children killed by Israeli forces. The army initially apologises, but later casts doubt on whether its forces killed the boy. The Sharm al-Sheikh agreement, brokered by President Clinton, aims to end the upsurge in violence. It breaks down almost immediately. 'This . is a manifestation of the ongoing mendacious campaign to delegitimize . Israel. There is only one way to counter lies, and that is through the . truth.' No autopsy was conducted, and the Israeli investigation was based primarily on expert interviews and analysis of the raw film. However, Israel have at no point been able to offer a suggestion as to Muhammad's current whereabouts. The boy's father, Jamal al-Dura, on . Monday said he is willing to have his son's body exhumed so a pathological examination can be carried out, including DNA testing to understand the true details of the boy's death. 'If . he is still alive, who was the one who was shot in my arms and killed?' he asked. 'The entire world saw how my beloved son was killed.' Upon the report's release, France 2 immediately rejected its claims, calling for an independent inquiry. The programme's reporter Charles Enderline said he was happy to take a polygraph test and would even be willing to help Muhammad's father exhume the body to 'clarify the circumstances of the incident.' Enderline added that Israeli investigators had at no point attempted to contact him or Mr al-Dura. Israeli commentators who believe . their country has been unfairly punished for the case nonetheless . questioned the decision to conduct a new investigation, saying it was . unlikely to sway already hardened opinions around the world. 'On one hand, it's better late than . never. On the other, the damage has already been done,' wrote Ben-Dror . Yemini, a columnist for the Maariv daily. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the incident had 'slandered Israel's reputation' 'No report, and certainly not a report commissioned by the Israeli government, is going to decrease the damage. 'We have already been defeated in the battle between lies and the truth. The lies won.' Yossi Kuperwasser, the Israeli official who led the investigation, said it was imperative to set the record straight. 'The . entire idea that Israel is a child killer ... is first and foremost . based on the Mohammad al-Dura story,' he told The Associated Press. Jamal al-Dura and his family clean the grave of their son Mohammed, at the Bureij cemetery in the central of Gaza Strip . It was said Mohammed died in the arms of his father after being caught in crossfire between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians. But Israel Israel has produced a new report to suggest there is no proof the boy died or even injured . Israel has long disputed the accusation the Mohammed al-Dura was killed by Israeli forces . 'This case ... is still being used by people who are committing terror attacks against Israel. It still feeds the hatred.' Despite claiming Muhammad was not . killed and may not have even been injured, the report offers no . suggestion of his whereabouts 13 years on.

She's made no secret of her desire to be a film star and it seems that Cara Delevingne may have struck gold - or grey- with her latest move. The 20-year-old model has reportedly auditioned for a highly coveted role in the hotly anticipated Fifty Shades Of Grey movie. Cara, who has seen her star rapidly rise this year, apparently impressed producers in her audition  for the movie adaptation of E.L. James' erotic trilogy. There really is no stopping her! Model Cara Delevingne is said to have auditioned for a secondary character role in the film adaption of E.L. James' Fifty Shades Of Grey . A source told The Sun: 'Cara is a front-runner for a part. She's desperate to get the gig and . has always said that she wanted to be taken seriously as an actress.' Insiders have revealed that Cara became close friends with actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson during her film debut in the 2012 Hollywood remake of Anna Karenina, alongside Keira Knightley and Jude Law. And it just so happens that Aaron's wife Sam Taylor Wood is directing the upcoming Fifty Shades movie. The source added: '[Cara] is a . global icon now and a good actress as well and Sam wants her in the . movie – though which part exactly hasn't been established. Big break? A source told The Sun that the 20-year-old really impressed the upcoming film's producers . '[Cara's] agent has also been talking to . Kelly Marcel, the screenplay writer. And, if needs be, a strong role . will be written in for her.' Anyone who has been following the model of the year, they will know that ambitious Cara doesn't just settle for one job at a time. The supermodel, who walked in over 30 shows in fashion week last season, will also appear in Kids In Love, a drama about hard-partying young Londoners. Speaking about the film, a source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The film is all about rich kids who live a wild lifestyle filled with parties and drugs. Good contacts: Cara is said to have become good . friends with Aaron Taylor-Johnson whilst starring in Hollywood hit Anna . Karenina, and now his wife Sam is producing the Fifty Shades Of Grey . movie . ‘So some aspects of the storyline will not be a particularly big stretch for Cara,’ said a friend of the model, who is regularly out at the capital’s hotspots with the likes of Rihanna. ‘It will be Cara’s first big screen role, so she’s really excited about it and is eager to make sure that she does a good job. Her name in itself will obviously be a big draw for the film too.’ And film work is not the end of Cara’s ambition. The blonde starlet, who heads to Ibiza next week to celebrate her 21st birthday, is also keen to break into the music industry. She recently begged rapper Pharrell Williams, who performed on summertime hit Get Lucky, to team up for some recording studio sessions after starring in a shoot with him in Vogue's September Issue.

The Obamas are in vacation-mode today, starting their annual eight-day vacation on Martha's Vineyard, where they are staying at a $7.6 million vacation home with views of the Atlantic. The First Family have been vacationing on the Vineyard for years, but this is the first time they will stay at the luxury four-bedroom Chilmark House designed by architect Rick Sundberg. With wall-to-ceiling windows, the 5,000sq ft home has stunning views over the ocean, as well as an infinity pool, tennis courts and a half basketball court.

Family time: The Obamas have vacationed in Martha's Vineyard with their daughters for several years . Half the cost of the President's holiday is met by the taxpayer, and the Obamas pay for the remainder, although they have met the full cost of the vacation home, which is owned by private equity expert David Schulte, according to Bloomberg. Mr Schulte contributed to both of the President's election campaigns and his run for the Senate. It is not known how much the Obamas paid to stay at the house, which was found for them by their broker who specializes in finding vacation homes for prominent politicians and royalty who have specific security needs. He has previously found rentals for the Clintons and also found the Blue Heron Farm where the Obamas previously stayed for years, until it was sold to a British architect for $22.4 million. A property expert in the town of Vineyard Haven told MailOnline that Chilmark House would 'likely run in the $40,000 to $60,000 range for the eight-day stay.' It is estimated the cost of the entire vacation, including the 75 rooms booked at a nearby hotel for staff and security, could reach $2 million. Private: The home is set in nine and a half acres and has a guest house that could house secret service agents .

A guest house set in its nine and a half acres of gardens could be used by secret service agents, who will accompany the family. With the President's approval rating at 46 per cent, according to Gallup, there has been criticism that his decision to vacation in such an elite spot is insensitive, according to the Huffington Post.

Jacob Dismont, 18, and Michael Solid, 21, were booked Saturday into the Clark County jail on charges of open murder, robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery. According to investigators, Marcos Arenas, 15, was walking down a street with the iPad on Thursday when a passenger got out of a vehicle and tried to steal the device from him. Jacob Dismont (left), 18, and 21-year-old Michael Solid (right) were booked on charges of open murder, robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery for the killing of a teenage boy over an iPad in Las Vegas . Dismont is accused of trying to wrest . the tablet away and dragging Arenas toward the SUV when the youth . wouldn't let go of the device. After Dismont re-entered the vehicle and Solid sped away, the teen was dragged until he fell. The vehicle ran over Arenas and he died at a hospital. 'I think both the public and police department share the same sentiment that this was a senseless act of violence,' police spokesman Bill Cassell said. The suspects succeeded in making off with the device, officers said, but it was not immediately recovered. Thefts of iPods, iPads and iPhones have become so common the crime has its own name - 'Apple picking'. Picture posed by model . Ivan Arenas said he bought the iPad for his son less than two months ago. The family has never had a lot, the father said, and his son valued everything he had. 'For him to lose his life over an iPad, it's just not fair,' Ivan Arenas told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. 'Never in my life would I imagine that me buying my kid an iPad for his birthday would end up with him getting run over.' Similar thefts of iPads, IPhones and other Apple devices have become so widespread nationwide that the crime has earned the nickname 'Apple picking', Cassell said. 'This is a nationwide phenomenon where thieves are targeting individuals who are carrying them,' he added. Police urge victims of such crimes to always let go of the devices. According to investigators, Solid has an arrest record of possession of a stolen vehicle, petty larceny, robbery and assault. Dismont does not have any prior adult arrests. Arenas family spokeswoman Tabitha Guertler said family members are relieved by the arrests and grateful for the quick response by police and the public. She said: 'We're traumatised.

Now experts predict the paper receipt has almost reached the end of the roll – and will soon be replaced by emails. Major retailers including Tesco are looking into setting up a paperless receipts system, similar to one already used by technology giant Apple in its stores. The end? Experts predict the paper receipt will soon be replaced by emails . Under the proposals, shoppers would have their purchase confirmations emailed to them instead of printed. Former Tesco chief executive Lord MacLaurin, who has invested in a firm called Paperless Receipts, said: ‘Why, when most transactions are recorded digitally, are retailers still printing on paper? ‘They are environmentally damaging and onerous for the consumer to store safely.’ The company has raised £500,000 from private investors, is backed by computing firm IBM and is in talks with major retailers including Tesco. Managing director Andrew Carroll said: ‘Within five years, 60 to 70 per cent of retailers will offer e-receipts in the UK.’ He added: 'Our solution is OPTIONAL and retailers will still print paper receipts for those that prefer.  We also do not email receipts - we use identifiers as chosen by you to attribute digital receipts to your personal web account. 'You can give as much or as little information as you like and can remain anonymous if so desired. Equally promotions will only be offered to those that want them, they are again optional, and these will NOT be emailed to your email inboxes. They will be viewable on your eReceipts web account or smart phone. 'eReceipts are automatically viewable on your smart phone to be able to check them in store and our system helps reduce fraud by creating an anonymous transaction trail between the retailer and the consumer. This is a consumer focused solution that solves a real problem and means that all your transactions can be viewed using one log in in one central area.' The system designed by Paperless Receipts differs from  the one used by Apple in that the electronic receipt is emailed to a dedicated web address – which the customer can access – rather than the shopper’s general email inbox. Mr Carroll said: ‘When receipts are emailed to you, your email inbox gets cluttered up with receipts instead of your pockets. What we offer is a centralised repository for all receipts.’ He added that he believed younger consumers, who are already comfortable with making payments using electronic devices such as mobile phones, will be first to adopt the trend.",Major retailers looking into setting up paperless system already used by technology giant Apple .

Meanwhile, senior officers from each force in the country have also held a private meeting to address such issues, The Guardian has reported. The newspaper obtained figures from 38 of the 43 forces in England and Wales which revealed 169 officers, police community support officers and support staff were under criminal and disciplinary investigations. The Met is currently carrying out 42 Directorate of Professional Standards investigations, involving 47 allegations, which includes 36 allegations of sexual assault and 11 of inappropriate sexual conduct. Of those 42 cases, 16 are awaiting trial, 12 are on-going investigations, eight are awaiting misconduct hearings, five are awaiting formal action and one has gone to a police appeal tribunal. The force has said it is working with Nottinghamshire police, which has already developed a strategy to tackle sexual offences within the force. Commander Allan Gibson, the Met's directorate of Professional Standards, who is in charge of the working group, said: 'This is a complex subject, which not only impacts on the police but others such as the teaching and medical professions. The Metropolitan Police has set up a working group to 'deter inappropiate relationships and the abuse of police powers to perpetrate sexual offending' 'There are some important lessons that can be learned from others, we want to support our staff and stop them falling unwittingly into inappropriate relationships and to develop our own strategies to ensure that would be offenders are identified quickly and held to account.' Nottinghamshire Police have also released a film to all the other forces which includes the comments of the former partner of a police officer jailed last year for having inappropriate relationships with vulnerable women. Metropolitan Police: 42 investigations . Greater Manchester: 17 investigations . Nottinghamshire: 15 investigations . Devon and Cornwall: 14 investigations . Humberside: 7 investigations . West Midlands: 7 investigations . Essex: 6 investigations . Kent: 6 investigations . Avon and Somerset: 5 investigations . Hampshire: 5 investigations . South Yorkshire: 5 investigations . A Nottinghamshire Police spokesman . said: 'We are leading the way in ensuring our police officers and staff . operate with the utmost integrity, not just in terms of their own . behaviour but also in reporting any questionable actions of others. 'As a result we are currently looking into a number of cases, many of which are historic. 'Our zero-tolerance attitude, . reflected by the film and supported by our integrity hotline, . demonstrates our dedication to proactively seeking out anyone who has . abused their position of authority, and allows us to deal with them . quickly and appropriately.' Debaleena Dasgupta, a lawyer who . represents the victims of rape or sexual assault by officers, told The Guardian: 'If a woman reports rape or sexual assault by a police . officer it is not just that the investigation has to be properly carried . out, it has to be seen to be done properly in order for victims to have . confidence in the system.' The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is currently involved in 31 investigations into abuse of powers. But its chairman Dame Anne Owers has said it would look to investigate more cases if more resources became available. She said: 'Police who abuse their position and exploit individuals for sexual gratification have no place in the police service. While these cases are rare, each of them is a fundamental abuse of power, and therefore seriously undermines public trust. IPCC chairman Dame Anne Owers has said it would look to investigate more cases if more resources became available . 'It is clear that a small number of . officers and staff continue to target vulnerable individuals, often . women. The IPCC has 31 on-going investigations into abuse of powers . cases, the majority of which are being supervised by our corruption . team. 'We are encouraged by . the positive responses of police forces to this issue and the fact that . more referrals are coming to the IPCC demonstrates a willingness to . root out this type of behaviour. 'We . are currently awaiting the Home Secretary's proposals on the expansion . of the IPCC and welcome the opportunity to extend and strengthen our . work. 'As more resources . become available the IPCC will aim to investigate more abuse of powers . cases independently of the police service.'","The figures were obtained from 38 of 43 forces in England and Wales .

Dream role: Charlotte Wakefield as the governess in this summer's production of The Sound of Music . Charlotte Wakefield – otherwise known as . ‘the new Julie Andrews’ – is fizzing with excitement. At only 22, she . is receiving the sort of rave reviews that actors dream of all their . lives. Her current performance as Maria in The Sound of Music at Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre in London has been described as ‘superb’. Georgina Brown, The Mail on Sunday’s theatre critic, whose review can be found in Event magazine, gives the musical five stars and advises readers to ‘climb every mountain, ford every stream, follow every rainbow, do whatever you need to get a ticket’. Even Bert Fink, European senior vice-president of the Rodgers and Hammerstein organisation, who has seen more versions of the musical than he can count, thinks she’s ‘wonderful, wonderful’. The production is the summer’s hottest ticket, and Charlotte is clearly on the verge of stardom. Yet it’s not only her youth that makes her talent so remarkable. She owes the drive that has made her success possible to climbing a substantial mountain of her own. She suffered years of bullying at school and went through a period  of unemployment in which she so despaired of ever working again that she put on almost two stone by  comfort eating. But the real source of her determination to achieve her dream is her sister, Ellie, who had a devastating stroke soon after birth and suffers from learning difficulties. Ellie, now 16, is Charlotte’s inspiration. ‘She is a lot like me – opinionated, strong-willed and passionate,’ says Charlotte. ‘She has taught me patience and understanding and when I think of the amazing things she could do if she was fine it makes me feel I don’t want to waste any of my own talent.’ Taking on an iconic and demanding role in a musical that has been seen  by virtually everyone is no easy task. Charlotte flicks back her specially dyed and dramatically cropped blonde hair as she discusses the daunting prospect of donning the famous Julie Andrews wimple. ‘My gran had the video and I used to watch it all the time as a child. It was nerve-racking to take over from Julie Andrews and initially I felt I wouldn’t be able to do it. ‘But when I read the stage script, which is slightly different to the film version, I saw a naivety and youthful energy in Maria that I felt nobody had really seen before. Youthful energy: Charlotte dances with two of the von Trapp children in the new production . Mary Poppins creator Pamela Travers so disliked the 1964 Walt Disney film version of her stories about the magical nanny that she tried to stop the company adapting them for the West End stage. Sir Cameron Mackintosh, who eventually co-produced the stage adaptation, has revealed how the Australian-born author repeatedly turned down requests from Disney to produce a theatrical version. ‘For 30 years she wouldn’t even agree to meet them,’ he said. Sir Cameron has spoken out as a new Hollywood film called Saving Mr Banks promises to shed fresh light on the making of the 1964 film. Emma Thompson plays the role of Travers while Tom Hanks portrays Disney. In one scene Travers tells Disney: ‘Mary Poppins is not for sale. I won’t have her turned into one of your silly cartoons.’ Sir Cameron – who negotiated with Travers about a stage production in 1993, three years before she died – insisted that any stage version would need to combine elements of her books and the Walt Disney film. He said: ‘I think she realised  it was the best chance of getting a musical nearer to what she wanted.’ No one from Walt Disney was available for comment last night. ‘She was supposed to be 22, the age I am now, and Julie Andrews was 30 when she played her. So it’s not surprising that her performance was quite staid and controlled. I felt I could give the role a younger, sexier, more modern edge. It also helped that I could see a lot of myself in Maria. We are both enthusiastic and driven and throw ourselves wholeheartedly into everything we do.’ Charlotte’s talents were obvious early on. She went to ballet and tap lessons and starred in theatre productions. Although her school, Knutsford High in Cheshire, was proud of her success, other students began verbally bullying her. ‘I think it was based on jealousy,’ she says carefully. ‘Looking back, I can see it helped me build a thick skin. It’s something you need to have in this industry. Luckily, I am still very sensitive underneath.’ This is partly due to Ellie, whom Charlotte adores. ‘I was six when Ellie was born,’ she recalls. ‘She could have been very disabled but fortunately she only has mild special needs. She manages at Knutsford High School with some extra help. I think of her as my baby sister and am very protective of her. ‘She has recently won an award at school for being the most inspiring student. I’m particularly proud as she was nominated by the other pupils, which for a child who struggles with her speech is amazing and really choked me up.’ Inspiration: Charlotte, left, said it was 'nerve-wracking' to be following in the footsteps of Julie Andrews, right, taking on the famous role of Maria in The Sound of Music . Original: The iconic actress with the Von Trapp children in the beloved film released in 1965 . Charlotte left school after GCSEs, making the difficult decision not to go on to A-levels and drama training when she was offered the part of Wendla in the rock musical Spring Awakening in the West End. ‘I had a blast but then suddenly, when I was 19, everything came to an abrupt stop. I kept going to auditions but didn’t get anything. I didn’t know how to deal with the inactivity and not earning. ‘I was living alone in London and I was really sad. I put on about two stone eating chocolate and other comfort food. I was out of work for six months and thought I’d never work again, but I auditioned for the part of Sophie in the touring version of Mamma Mia! I got it and spent a year going around the world.’ She later joined the West End cast and, while performing at night, auditioned for The Sound Of Music during the day. ‘I did six auditions and thought I might get the part of Liesl, the eldest of von Trapp’s seven  children. Instead they offered  me Maria, which was really scary.  It made me work hard on my voice because singing in The Sound Of Music is very different from singing Abba pop songs.’ It obviously paid off. Her voice is sweet, emotional and powerful – the equal of Julie Andrews. ‘Being in The Sound Of Music is a brilliant experience,’ she says. ‘I particularly love doing it in the open air. It’s funny to think I’m at the age when I thought I would be graduating from drama school. Instead, I’m astounded by the reviews and having the most amazing time.’ Judging by the rapturous cheers and applause that echo through Regent’s Park every evening, so is the audience.

Waiting lists for designer handbags, clothes or even the latest must-have children's toy have become the norm. And now beauty companies have joined their ranks by garnering huge waiting lists before their products have even hit the shops. Lancome's DreamTone serum promising 'ground-breaking results' is the latest product to be in such high demand that it has accumulated a waiting list of 1,400 people before it is even released next week. In high demand: Lancome's Dreamtone serum has a waiting list of more than 1,400 people before it is even released next week . The cream is said to 'revolutionise' skin tone by reducing dark age spots by 66 per cent in just four weeks. The £69 serum isn't officially released until August 15, but stars Sarah Jessica Parker and Naomi Campbell are believed to already have a bottle of the coveted beauty product, The Times reports. The product is the result of seven years of research into the causes of hyperpigmentation. The Forever Light Creator anti-aging serum by Yves Saint Laurent accumulated a huge online waiting list of 3,000 ahead of its release last month . It is not the first time that a beauty product has become a success before its even been released. The £125 anti-ageing cream Cult 51, which is said to contain the most expensive ingredients ever, had more than 5,000 people on the waiting list when it was released last month. Model Kelly Brook and singer Myleene Klass are believed to be fans of the night cream made by British chemist Richard Mears after being given pre-release samples. In trials so far, Cult 51 has been found to reverse the signs of ageing by up to five years in just six weeks. It is clinically proven to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines by up to 52 per cent in 28 days. It increases the skin’s absorption of oxygen by up to 45 per cent and in trials reduced the appearance of age spots by up a quarter in 12 weeks. Mr Mears said it is the first skincare product on the market that can claim to have ‘3D effects’ as it stimulates the skin to produce its own collagen while increasing cell production and oxygen flow in the skin. He said: 'Most anti-ageing creams do only one or two things, so consumers end up buying several products, such as those aimed at day time use, nights, the eyes and skin brightening, to get the full benefits. 'Brands want to sell many products to their customers and maximise sales. However, there is an accepted wisdom within skin care that the skin can only absorb so much active and that too many products actually smother it, preventing it from functioning naturally.' Yves Saint Laurent's Forever Light Creator range also totted up a huge online waiting list of 3,000 ahead of its release last month. A record-breaking 15,000 free sample vouchers for the £61 serum were also downloaded before it even hit the shops. The company even set up a dedicated hotline for customers wanting to order the product as makers YSL attempted to keep up with demand. Shoppers wanting to buy Max Factor's Lashfinity 72-hour mascara were subject to a three-week waiting list earlier this year.

Gas and electricity bills could rise by 10 per cent before winter, households have been warned, despite energy companies enjoying £3.3bn profits since the last election (file picture) Energy bills could soar by up to 10 per cent in the next couple of months, households have been warned. The announcement came in the same week it was revealed Britain's big six energy companies have enjoyed a £3.3billion windfall in profits since the election. Price comparison website energyhelpline.com has warned energy companies could be looking at increasing rates between five and 10 per cent before the winter months, which means the average household bill could rise by up to £142. The website's director Mark Todd said: 'There are clear indications that energy price rises are close. 'I would not be surprised if they are announced within the next two months. In fact you could describe the energy market as a volcano about to erupt. 'The lava may soon descend on consumers across the country wiping out their household budgets.' The Daily Express has reported the news comes after British Gas warned increases were 'inevitable' and nPower said it was 'indisputable' that energy costs were rising. Mr Todd said: 'We know from experience, when one supplier announces price rises, others follow and in the last three years these have come in the summer and autumn. 'It may be mere coincidence, but there are distinct advantages of introducing a price rise before the cold weather hits as the increased rates kick in as gas and electricity usage rises.' On Friday the Daily Mail reported how . Britain’s big six energy companies have enjoyed a £3.3billion windfall . in profits since the election - while consumers’ bills have soared by . £300 a year. Labour said the figures show that David Cameron has not done enough to crack down on profiteering by gas and electric firms.

The mother of the owners of the controversial Latvian website linked to the recent suicide of British teenager Hannah Smith has hit out at her grieving parents, blaming them for the tragic death of their daughter. The 14-year-old schoolgirl hanged herself in her Leicestershire bedroom nine days ago, after being bullied relentlessly by internet trolls via her page on the popular website ask.fm. She is the latest of five similar deaths which have all been linked to the social network. Ludmilla Terebin (centre) - whose sons Mark (l) and Iilja (r) own the controversial Latvian website linked to the recent suicide of British teenager Hannah Smith - has hit out at her grieving parents, blaming them for the tragic death of their daughter . Ludmilla with her boys in 1986. She said: 'Of course, I sympathise with them. It is awful to lose your child like this but, I'm sorry, it is all to do with how you raise them' Hannah Smith, 14, hanged herself in her Leicestershire bedroom nine days ago, after being bullied relentlessly by internet trolls via her page on the popular website ask.fm . Last week, the website’s founders, wealthy Latvian start-up entrepreneurs Ilja and Mark Terebin, aged 34 and 29, came under fire from relatives of Hannah and the other dead teenage users, provoking advertisers to boycott ask.fm and Prime Minister David Cameron to urge parents to stop their teenagers from using the site, which attracts 60 million users. But now the mother and father of the Soviet-born brothers have hit back, denying that their sons are in any way culpable and instead blaming the parents of suicide victims for failing to police their use  of the internet. Ludmila Terebin,  a cosmetologist whose sons have become web millionaires from the site launched in 2010, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I heard about this suicide case in the UK but I do not understand why my sons are to blame. ‘What are they guilty of? I think we'd better look instead at the parents of these teenagers and at the way they brought them up,’ she added defiantly in her first comment on Hannah’s death and the string of teenage suicides linked to ask.fm. ‘Of course, I sympathise with them. It is awful to lose your child like  this but, I’m sorry, it is all to do with how you raise them. ‘I am a mother and I would be worried if my child stayed online a lot. But I do not understand why my sons are being blamed for this.’ Told that a key feature of ask.fm  is the alleged anonymity it gives  web bullies, which critics claim her sons failed to address, despite earlier suicides, she said: ‘Sorry, but I understand very little about how these social networks work. I don’t like using social networks. The mother and father of the Soviet-born brothers deny that their sons are in any way culpable over the death of Hannah . Row: Ask.fm has said previously it does not take responsibility for what is on its site and does not monitor posts . ‘I do not know who is anonymous there and who is not, you better  ask my sons.’ She insisted: ‘I believe they do worry about this, too.’ Though her close-knit family has become wealthy – with several homes in the country’s upscale white-sand Baltic resort of Jurmala, where prices are on a par with southern England, while her sons own penthouses in the capital Riga – she  said: ‘This ask.fm project belongs to my sons but I don’t use it. I prefer face-to-face communication, as we had before.’ Meanwhile, her husband, former Red Army soldier Oleg Terebin, 57, when asked about Hannah’s suicide, replied: ‘You know what people say – 99 per cent of people who eat cucumbers eventually die.’ His attempt at a joke, along with his wife’s remarks, are certain to cause hurt for relatives of teenagers who took their lives after using ask.fm. They will also be a setback to the ask.fm crisis management exercise launched by the brothers, involving top-end public relations specialists in Britain and the US. Last week this led to an ‘open letter’ in which the owners called Hannah’s death a ‘true tragedy’, and a vow that ask.fm is co-operating with police over her death and has the technical ability to unmask her cyber bullies  to the police, plus a commitment ‘to improve our site and its safety features’ to ‘ensure our users and their parents do not lose confidence in our social network’. Hannah Smith and her father Dave when she was a baby and and as a teenager . They also appointed top London legal firm Mishcon de Reya to conduct ‘a full and independent audit  of our site and its safety features’ amid claims the site has been ‘maligned’ by unfair criticism. The brothers – who refuse to give interviews and remained hidden from view last week – said they  were ‘committed to safeguarding against bullying and harassment in all forms’. However, there will be fears the family’s true views are expressed  by their parents. Mr Terebin refused to say if he would advise his sons to alter the controls to protect young people.  ‘I haven’t talked to them yet. I’m  out of the country and have a lot of work on. I am solving some problems,’ he said. Asked if his sons’ failure to tighten controls after earlier suicides was because of the profits they raked in, he said: ‘No, this is not true. I know my boys. Look, there are a lot of other social networks. What guarantees do they give?’ Mr Terebin echoed his wife, declaring: ‘My children did what they wanted when they were young. But you can always stop using the social network if you feel uncomfortable.’ As the Terebin parents’ spoke, details emerged of the real views  of the brothers – who boast glamorous girlfriends and drive expensive cars – which may shock many ask.fm users. Mark has dismissed gays as ‘these fools’ on his ask.fm page, while Ilja has stated: ‘I would not lie next to a homosexual even in the morgue.’ He is also on record as wanting to bring back a Stalinist law banning homosexuality and has shockingly written: ‘I feel good about cannibals. I do not see a big difference between eating pig, cow or human flesh.’ The family of patriarch Mr Terebin came to Latvia after Stalin subjugated the country following the Second World War. Expressing loyalty to the USSR,  Mr Terebin said he can never forget ‘to whom I gave the oath’, slamming ‘narrow-minded’ Mikhail Gorbachev and ‘drunkard’ Boris Yeltsin for destroying Soviet might. He and his wife were pushy parents who demanded academic excellence from their sons. Both boys shone at school before graduating from the International Business University in Riga.","Hannah Smith, 14, hanged herself nine days ago after being bullied by internet trolls via her page on popular website ask.fm .

An ivory trafficker whose work is suspected to have fuelled the slaughter of more than 10,000 elephants over 40 years has been arrested. Emile N'bouke, 58, known as 'The Boss', was detained in the Togo capital Lome where police found 1,500lbs (700kgs) of ivory at his shop. Activists say N'bouke is not only a buyer of illegal ivory but helped finance poaching targeting elephants throughout Central Africa. Suspected ivory trafficker Emile N'Bouke stands with seized ivory carvings and tusks after his arrest in Togo . At least five elephant tusks and ivory carvings (pictured) were found at N'Bouke's shop on Tuesday . Ofir Drori, founder of the Last Great Ape Organization that began investigating N'Bouke late last year, said N'bouke had been operating since 1976. He said N'bouke's activities likely led to the killing of 'dozens of thousands'. N'Bouke's arrest is the first of its kind in the small West African nation, which has emerged in recent years as a main transit point for ivory bound for Asia and other markets, Mr Drori said. Speaking to journalists after his arrest, N'bouke said he had been trading ivory since 1983 and had managed to obtain and renew a 'special permit' despite the global ban in 1989. Activists accuse N'bouke of fuelling the poaching of 10,000 elephants in his alleged involvement in the ivory trade . Togo environment minister Dede Ekoue said this was not true and vowed the country would crack down on the ivory trade more aggressively from now on. She said: 'This activity can no longer prosper because the Togolese government is committed to discouraging further action from criminals who use our territory as a platform.' Col Yao Kondi, head of the anti-trafficking squad, told the BBC that five tusks were seized and described N'bouke as a 'kingpin' in the ivory trade. Only 60 elephants live in protected parks in Togo. The . country is home to West Africa's only natural deep water port, and Mr . Drori said the high volume of shipping makes it easier to transport . illicit goods such as ivory. Last month, more than two tons of ivory hidden in a cargo container at the port was seized in Hong Kong. Last December, some 24 tons of ivory sent from Togo was seized in Malaysia. Mr Drori said he suspects N'bouke had clients in the United States. Under the current law, N'bouke faces a maximum of one year in prison for his involvement in the ivory trade, Mr Drori said. But . he added that he would push authorities to prosecute N'bouke for other . crimes such as money laundering that could lead to a longer sentence.","Emile N'bouke, 58, arrested by anti-trafficking officials in the capital Lome .

In the morning, many will attend mass prayer gatherings called Zakat ul Fitr - with those taking place outside Dhaka reputed to be the biggest anywhere in Asia - before visiting friends and family to enjoy private celebrations. They will greet each other with the traditional Muslim greeting of Eid Mubarak, which translates roughly as 'Eid blessings' and is more or less equivalent to 'Merry Christmas'. As well as the special prayers and celebrations, customs of Eid include dressing up in new clothes, eating special delicacies, giving presents and, for women, decoration of the hands with henna.

Robert Durand says he expects most of the 166 prisoners at the U.S. base in Cuba will take part in the prayers and meals for the holiday known as Eid al Fitr. It's not known whether a long-running hunger strike will surge again. The U.S. says 55 prisoners still met the criteria to be classified as hunger strikers as of Wednesday even though most have been eating at least once a day. The number dropped by half since the start of Ramadan in July. Lawyers for prisoners say some likely gave up the strike because of Ramadan or were just worn out by the protest. Jack Khan, a British-Bangladeshi Muslim, told MailOnline that some of the special dishes being passed round Eid tables may include shemai, a sweet made with vermicelli and milk, and fita, fried dough balls made with rice flour and drizzled with ghee - which he described as 'delicious'. For those who can afford it in Bangladesh, there would also be lots of different types of roasted meat on offer, served with that perennial favourite, pilau rice. Many will be feeling a sense of relief at the end of Ramadan, a month of fasting during which observant Muslims are encouraged not to eat or drink anything - even water - during the hours of daylight. A time of spiritual reflection and increased worship, during the period Muslims are expected to pay more attention to the teachings of their religion, also refraining from sexual relations with their spouses as well as generally sinful behaviour. It is believed to help teach devotees how to better practice self-discipline and sacrifice, but also inculcate empathy for those less fortunate than themselves and encourage generosity and charity.

Bangladeshis sit on blankets laid out on the packed ferry as they rush home to be with their families . Charity is also an important part of Eid.

'This time of year, because it's the New Year, a lot of people also give their Zakāt, which is 2.5 per cent of your wealth, irrelevant of much you earn.

This autumn we're all about going bigger, bushier and bolder than ever before in the facial hair department. And it's all down to the Duchess of Cambridge. The full, healthy eyebrows of the Duchess of Cambridge have sparked a trend for thicker brows, with women desperate to emulate Kate's look paying up to £5,000 for eyebrow transplants . The British woman's lust for the fuller brow is yet another Duchess-driven craze, this time brought about by the former Kate Middleton's predilection for hearty, well-conditioned eyebrows. And not only has a Harley Street clinic spoken of a spike in numbers of patients wishing to undergo their non-invasive eyebrow hair implant surgery since the Royal Wedding last April, but now an eye make-up brand has developed a brow-plumping product promising to give your eyebrows a make-over fit for a duchess. Dr Raghu Reddy, one of the UK's leading hair restoration experts, performs eyebrow transplants at The Private Clinic on Harley Street, using hair from behind the patient's ears. LashXLR8 . The procedure - which costs between £4,000 and £5,000 - is used as a solution for those who have over-plucked their eyebrows, or those who are simply looking for a fuller brow. Dr Reddy said: 'We have witnessed interest in the eyebrow transplant procedure grow since around the time of the Royal Wedding and it has steadily risen. 'Now we have a healthy stream of women who come into the clinic and undergo the treatment. There is also greater awareness now of the procedure and the results it can achieve. 'While I do have patients who come to me who have over-plucked their brows, I also have women who come in with perfectly normal eyebrows, who are looking for a thicker, fuller brow to rival the likes of Kate Middleton. 'Today, women are more aware of the treatments available to them and more willing to consider treatment to achieve the look they desire.' Meanwhile, Eye Candy have released a new product which claims to enhance the appearance and length of eyebrows. The new LashXLR8R is aimed at those who want to give their brows a natural boost, without the use of eyebrow pencils. The serum is already being hailed by make-up artists and has been proven strengthen and thicken lashes and eyebrows in just four weeks. Prior to its launch, the product had a waiting list of 8,000, but it is now available in Boots for £19.99. Developed in the UK, the brow-booster has been formulated with a unique liposome-based delivery . system, containing natural seaweed extracts Laminaria Digitata and Pelvetia Canaliculata. These naturally occuring minerals are known to stimulate growth and increase brow density and lash length. The serum, which is paraben-free, also . contains D-Panthenol (Vitamin B5) which helps to improve lash . flexibility, the condition and moisturisation of both lashes and brows. Thick eyebrows are making a comeback . Performed by Dr Raghu Reddy, one of the UK's leading hair restoration experts, at The Private Clinic on Harley Street,  the eyebrow transplant uses 'third generation follicular unit extraction' (3G FUE) to provide a solution for patients who have over-plucked their eyebrows beyond repair, or to those who are looking for a fuller brow. The eyebrow transplant enables those patients who would like a fuller, thicker brow to achieve that result. The treatment itself lasts around 4-5 hours and it is virtually pain free. It involves using a special punch, less than 1mm in diameter, to remove hair follicles from behind the patient’s ear. The hair is then transplanted into the brow area . The hair will then grow gradually in its new location and you will start to see growth within 3-4 months. The treatment is minimally invasive . Requires no scalpels, stitches or linear scarring . Lifelong guarantee for the number of hairs displaced . It costs between £4,000-£5,000, depending on the patient, the desired result and the number of hairs required. The treatment is walk-in, walk-out so no down time is required. After they have undergone the treatment, they can get immediately back to their day to day routine .

Sentenced: Glamour model and escort Lady Jet Black British Barbie was spared jail today after admitting to racially abusing and spitting at an Asian taxi driver . A glamour model and escort called Lady Jet Black British Barbie was spared jail today after admitting to racially abusing and spitting at an Asian taxi driver. The 32-year-old, who appeared in court with a totally shaven head, assaulted Ramin Sasani, 25, outside David Lloyd Leisure Centre in Chigwell. During an earlier hearing , the court heard that Barbie had called the cab driver rude when . he didn’t thank her after she paid the £4 fare. She then become hysterical and leant in through the door of the cab . and attacked him. She had to be pulled back by a passer-by. Mr Sasani said the model had shouted: 'You are a f*****g immigrant, go back to your own country you f*****g Paki.' He added: 'She shouted ""If you call the police I’m going to tell them you tried to rape me."" She then spat at him in the face. The . model, from Woodford Green, whose name was Natalie Springer until she . changed it six years ago, was prosecuted under the name Jet Black . British Barbie. After pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to racially aggravated common assault, she was sentenced today at Chelmsford Magistrates court. She was given a one year community order, which includes a requirement that she must carry out 200 hours unpaid work. After passing sentence, chair of the bench, Paul Jee, said: 'This was a nasty offence with a number of aggravating features. People were present, the victim was operating a public service, it had an on-going effect on him and spitting is a nasty thing to do. 'It is humiliating and there is a risk from disease being transmitted. 'However, this was an isolated incident and you wish to apologise to the cab company.' Representing her, Stuart Cowan, said : 'You would have read how she makes her living and may not agree with it, but she pays her taxes. 'She has lived at the bottom of society and does not want to return there. She has a nice place to live, possessions, and a life style which agrees with her.' He said that the taxi driver had . refused to deliver her to the doors of the leisure centre instead, . stopping at the gates and 'snatched the money out of her hand.' But he said that she accepted that what she did was 'wholly inappropriate'. She had claimed at an earlier hearing that she was provoked by . the cabbie calling her 'a n****r'. And she claimed that at the time she . was tired after working all night, and was annoyed at the way he didn’t . thank her when she handed over a £10 note. But Chelmsford Magistrates had ruled that she . was not provoked and that Mr Sasani had not called her a “n****r.” He denied he snatched the £10 note from her hand or said 'No-one likes you anyway, n****r'. In the dock: The model was today given a one year community order, which includes a requirement that she must carry out 200 hours unpaid work, at Chelmsford Magistrates Court, pictured . Barbie admitted grabbing and shaking him, spitting, and shouting that she would claim he had raped her. She also told magistrates she had nothing to hide about her work as a glamour model in the adult industry and in escorting. She said she was regarded as 'a bit of a celebrity' and she shaved her head as a personal campaign against slavery and racism. A regular church-goer, she denied she was a violent person and said she lived a quiet life in her village adding : 'I don’t class myself as a racist person.' She said she had not felt comfortable with Mr Sasani because he had stared at her in the rear view mirror and asked questions about what she did. 'I obviously get naked for a living and do have guys who fancy me but if I am paying someone I just want a job done. I’m professional and I expect people to be professional,' she had told the court. She had added : 'I have had racism in the past. I have been called an orangutan, a c**n, a spade, but that particular day when I was called a n****r that was the cherry on the cake. I was very tired from the night before. I was pre-menstrual. That’s why I reacted that way.' Following the hearing, the model was told she must also pay £620 legal costs, £60 victim surcharge, and £250 compensation.","32-year-old assaulted Ramin Sasani outside a David .

A Nashville mother has traced her teenage son who disappeared in 1998 to an unmarked pauper's grave and learned he was brutally murdered the day after she reported him missing but police didn't connect the two cases. Sylvia Nolan's heartbreaking search for 18-year-old LeRyan Nicholson ended in March when DNA tests linked the teen to remains buried in a plot in a public Nashville cemetery just three miles from her home. 'They told me they already buried my baby, my son, without me,' said Nolan, who previously had no idea her son had even been killed. The plot's gravestone read simply 'John (19) Doe,' signifying that he was the 19th unidentified man buried in the Bordeaux cemetery. Around him lie 1,001 others who died penniless and often unmourned. Nicholson was once a promising student and athlete but in his late teens his behavior drastically changed. He quit school, began to show signs of having a mental illness and later moved out of his mother’s house, Nolan told The Tennessean. His step-sister, Candace Williams, added: 'It was like he was confused as he was talking. It didn't make a lot of sense. Jumping from one thing to another, not completing a thought.'

His mother filed a missing . person's report, but she was told he probably left of his own accord. The following day, April 13, an unidentified man was discovered rolled up in a carpet, dumped against a fence and set on fire. He was burned beyond recognition and it never occurred to police that it could be the missing Nicholson, despite the body turning up just one day after Nicholson vanished. Found: Nolan and her family traces Nicholson to the unmarked grave using the government's Missing persons website, NamUs, pictured . He was unceremoniously buried in a paupers' grave. Sgt. Gary Kemper, who now heads Metro's Cold Case Unit, told The Tennessean detectives worked feverishly on the case and located persons of interest but the lead dried up in 2001. 'They just didn't follow up correctly. A mistake was made,' Kemper said. 'When you look at it now, it's hard to understand why.' Nicholson's family on the other hand never gave up searching for their loved one. They checked hospitals and homeless shelters but found no trace. Body: Nicholson's body was discovered the day after he went missing in April 1998 wrapped in a carpet and burned in a Nashville lane, pictured .

She searched for her brother and the John Doe that had been rolled up in a carpet appeared. The family called the police straight away and they obtained a DNA sample of Nicholson and matched it to one that was taken from John Doe in 1998.

The Hubble Space Telescope has determined the true colour of an alien planet for the first time - a dazzling blue. Astronomers using the NASA/ESA telescope said that the planet, known as HD 189733b, is a deep cobalt blue, much like Earth. But that's where the similarities end. The planet is a huge gas giant orbiting very close to its host star and its atmosphere is scorching, with a temperature of over 1,000 degrees Celsius. Scroll down for video . This illustration shows HD 189733b, a huge gas giant that orbits very close to its host star HD 189733. The planet's atmosphere is scorching with a temperature of over 1000 degrees Celsius, and it rains glass, sideways, in howling 7000 kilometer-per-hour winds . It also rains glass - sideways - in howling 7,000 kilometre-per-hour winds. At a distance of 63 light-years from us, this turbulent alien world is one of the nearest exoplanets to Earth that can be seen crossing the face of its star. It has been intensively studied by Hubble and other telescopes and its atmosphere has been found to be dramatically changeable and exotic, with hazes and violent flares. Now, it is the subject of an important first -  the first measurement of an alien planet's visible colour. The planet's azure blue colour does . not come from the reflection of a tropical ocean, but is due to a hazy, . turbulent atmosphere thought to be laced with silicate particles, which . scatter blue light. Earlier . observations using different methods have reported evidence for . scattering of blue light on the planet, but these most recent Hubble . observations give robust confirming evidence, according to the . scientists. The planet's colour will be discussed in detail in a paper in Astrophysical Journal Letters. Frederic Pont, of the University of Exeter, and leader of the Hubble observing programme and paper author, said: 'This planet has been studied well in the past, both by ourselves and other teams.' A labelled artist's illustration showing the blue planet HD 189733b orbiting its star, HD 189733. A group of scientists have become the first to determine the colour of a planet outside the solar system - and it has an identical haze to Earth . 'But measuring its colour is a real . first. We can actually imagine what this planet would look like if we . were able to look at it directly.' In . order to measure what this planet would look like to our eyes, the . astronomers measured how much light was reflected off the surface of HD . 189733b, a property known as albedo. To isolate the planet's light from starlight, the team used Hubble's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) to peer at the system before, during, and after the planet passed behind its host star as it orbited. As it slipped behind its star, the light reflected from the planet was temporarily blocked from view and the amount of light observed from the system dropped. This technique also shows how the light changes in other ways and crucially its true colour. Tom Evans, of the University of Oxford, and another of the paper's authors, said: 'We saw the brightness of the whole system drop in the blue part of the spectrum when the planet passed behind its star. 'From this, we can gather that the planet is blue, because the signal remained constant at the other colours we measured.' A star field image showing the blue planet HD 189733's star (centre). In order to measure what the planet would look like to our eyes, the astronomers measured how much light was reflected off its surface . HD 189733b belongs to a class of planets known as 'hot Jupiters'. These massive planets are similar in size to the gas giants in the Solar System, but instead lie very close to their parent star. It is this size and proximity to their star make them perfect subjects for exoplanet hunting. Scientists know that hot Jupiters are numerous throughout the universe and as we do not have one close to home in our own Solar System, studies of planets like HD 189733b are important to help them understand these dramatic objects. Professor Pont said: 'It's difficult to know exactly what causes the colour of a planet's atmosphere, even for planets in the Solar System. 'But these new observations add another piece to the puzzle over the nature and atmosphere of HD 189733b. We are slowly painting a more complete picture of this exotic planet.'","The Hubble Space Telescope has determined the true colour of an alien planet for the first time .

An inquest heard that her boyfriend committed suicide days after her funeral . Alan Hutchinson, 30, a kitchen porter, was found with a copy of the order of service from Miss Haw's funeral, the inquest heard. The book on 'self-deliverance', which was published independently, purported to contain 'methods to accomplish one’s own easy, peaceful and dignified death'. It claimed to be intended for 'rational suicide' in the face of 'unbearable and unbelievable suffering', specifically for people with terminal illnesses. But Mr Coverdale said: 'It seems to me that it can act as a clear encouragement for people who may be at a low ebb actually to end it all and take their lives. 'It is a very, very disturbing book and I am deeply shocked that it is possible to acquire a book like this. 'It has to be said that if Toni Haw had not had access to this publication, she may not have taken the overdose which ended her life.' He said the book had been explicit in its descriptions of various methods of committing suicide, and that the method used by Miss Haw had been mentioned specifically and graphically in it. Criticism: York Coroner Donald Coverdale slammed the 'suicide book' saying it was 'very disturbing and deeply shocking' Mr Coverdale added: 'I find it very sad that people who are in distress, possibly as a result of mental illness, are able to find comfort from a book that may encourage them to take their own lives. 'I find it alarming that the book is, presumably, freely available for purchase.' Miss Haw's mother Hilary Haw, 51, echoed the coroner's remarks. 'I think this book did have a significant effect on my daughter's actions and am shocked that these kinds of publications can be so easily obtained. 'I feel the information contained in the book could possibly influence other vulnerable people to make bad choices,' she said. The inquest heard Miss Haw, who had been learning sign language, had a history of stress and social anxiety and had been prescribed a variety of anti-depressants. Her . mother called an ambulance after checking on Miss Haw before bed on . February 27 and noticing her daughter's speech was slurred. The teenager was rushed to York Hospital but died in the early hours of February 28. Mr Coverdale returned an open verdict, saying he could not be certain Toni intended to end her life. Miss Haw's boyfriend Alan, a kitchen porter, was found at his home on March 23 with a note which emphasised the distress he had suffered since his girlfriend's death. A copy of the order of service at her funeral and a picture of her were found with his body. Mr Coverdale said: 'Her death hit Alan Hutchinson very hard and he found it very difficult to cope with the loss.' The inquest heard he had overdosed on medication and alcohol. 'He was aware of the means by which Miss Haw ended her life and he had chosen to take the same substance to excess to end his life,' Mr Coverdale said after recording a suicide verdict. Chris Docker, director of Exit, an organisation founded in 1980 to provide information on how to end one’s life, spoke on behalf of the author after the hearings on Thursday. He said: 'People can be irrationally overcome at any age and I think all we can do is slow them down a bit, have them take a deep breath and think about it. 'I don’t think the book precipitates someone’s suicide or not having the book prevents someone’s suicide, and some letters we have had say it gives people the courage to live longer.'Mr Docker said the book found in Miss Haw's bedroom was one of many available through several publishers around the world. He said that, along with methods to effectively and painlessly end a life, it also contained information on groups and organisations she could have contacted while feeling suicidal. 'Sometimes suicide can be prevented and sometimes it can’t,' he said. 'This is something very sad, that a small proportion of teenagers go through and decide, sadly, to end their life. It is very, very hard to accept, but it happens. 'There are other books that a person might get hold of, but if they do get one of ours we only hope they get through a reasonable amount of material that shows their depression, even if it’s the most terrible thing in the world for them, will pass.' A spokesperson for Samaritans said books like this contained 'harmful information'. She said: 'We know it’s a criminal offence to encourage or assist suicide in the UK. 'Publishing detailed information about methods of suicide, be it online, in print or in the mainstream media, can be extremely dangerous for vulnerable people as there is extensive research to show that ""copycat"" suicide attempts are often made based on information people have been exposed to.' The book has not been named at the request of The Samaritans.","'Wicked' book discovered in Toni Haw's room after she died of overdose .

Former England footballer: Paul Gascoigne (centre, pictured today) was fined £1,000 after pleading guilty to attacking a train guard in Stevenage last month . Paul Gascoigne’s teenage son was left distressed after seeing his father arrested for drunkenly assaulting a railway security guard, a court heard yesterday. The boy became ‘extremely upset’ as the former England footballer was detained after grabbing the guard by the throat as he tried to help him on a station platform. Gascoigne’s family had hoped he was on the mend from his alcoholism after he was discharged from a rehab clinic in the US in March. But last month he was found drunk on a train. Yesterday, appearing before magistrates in Stevenage, he admitted attacking the guard on July 4. The court heard how he had been visiting his ill father, when a ticket inspector on the train from Newcastle to London found him drunk. Gascoigne, 46, got off at Stevenage, where station guard Jack Sherrington, 23, tried to help him into a wheelchair as he was struggling to walk. Elaine McMillan, prosecuting, said: ‘The defendant was abusive towards Mr Sherrington, using the c-word repeatedly and he ended up grabbing hold of Mr Sherrington effectively in the neck area.’ Gascoigne’s ex-wife Sheryl, his stepdaughter Bianca and son Regan were called to the station, where he was arrested for drunk and disorderly and assault at around 10.30pm. Miss McMillan said that Regan, 17, who works as a model, became upset as he watched his father get arrested. Scroll down for videos . After sentencing: Gascoigne started drinking again because he was worried about his sick father, who is seriously ill with a heart condition, the court was told . Arrived: Gascoigne was in such a state after falling off the wagon again that station staff were forced to call his ex-wife Sheryl (pictured), 47, to try and calm him down, Stevenage Magistrates' Court heard . Gavin Harris, defending, said that . Gascoigne had been drinking due to stress caused by worry for his father . and ‘acute physical pain’ resulting from a recent hip operation. He said he had not actually had much . to drink, but the effect was worse as he had not drunk in a long time. ‘Mr Gascoigne is remorseful and apologises for his actions,’ he added. Magistrate Carolyn Marsh said that it . was a ‘serious matter’, and fined Gascoigne a total of £1,245 including . £100 in compensation to Mr Sherrington, who said: ‘I sincerely hope he . gets the help that he needs in the future.’ The court also heard that Gascoigne was receiving 'one to one' treatment for his alcoholism, which was continuing. After sentencing, Gascoigne left the court and was driven away in a grey Porsche. In a statement released through British Transport Police, Mr Sherrington, from Peterborough, said: 'I am grateful for and welcome Mr Gascoigne's decision to plead guilty today. Incident: The ex-footballer was arrested after officers were called to Stevenage station (pictured) on July 4 . Fined: Gascoigne was later pictured leaving Stevenage Magistrates' Court in Hertfordshire in a grey Porsche . 'I am told that since the incident he has offered his apologies for his behaviour, and I fully accept them. 'In differing ways this has not been easy for either of us and I sincerely hope he gets the help that he needs in the future. 'With the conclusion of the case, and . Mr Gascoigne's sentencing, I now consider this matter closed. I will . not be conducting any interviews at this time and ask for my privacy in . this regard to be respected.'

Tears: Gascoigne is remembered for crying during the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup against West Germany . By TOM WHITE, PRESS ASSOCIATION . Widely regarded as one of the most gifted English footballers of his generation, Paul Gascoigne has long fought an all-consuming battle with alcoholism. Known for his genius on the pitch, his chaotic life has been dogged by a constant tendency to self destruct. While he enjoyed many highs on the pitch, there have also been many lows, including struggling with mental illness, bulimia, panic attacks, addictions and domestic violence. This came to a head when earlier this year he was placed in intensive care in a hospital in the US while he was being treated for alcoholism during a rehabilitation programme. At the time he was said to be close to death and it was reported that he was revived a number of times. At first, his antics in bars and clubs across Europe had looked like the result of the overblown enthusiasm and thirst for the high life which rapidly became his off-the-pitch trademark. But the excesses that have marred his life for so long eventually led to his exclusion from the England World Cup squad in 1998. Other high profile alcoholism incidents included being sacked from managing Kettering Town FC in 2005 after he was accused of being drunk at games and appearing at the scene of the stand-off between the police and gunman Raoul Moat in 2010. Arriving at the scene in Rothbury, Northumberland, Gazza claimed he was a friend of Moat and said he had brought him 'a can of lager, some chicken, fishing rod, a Newcastle shirt and a dressing gown'. He was also sectioned under the Mental Health Act twice in the space of six months in 2008 and admitted in his autobiography to headbutting his wife Sheryl and throwing her to the floor. Known for his genius on the pitch, his chaotic life has been dogged by a constant tendency to self destruct . First thrust into the national consciousness after a number of brilliant performances at the 1990 World Cup in Italy, he quickly became a household name. From there he would play for such teams as Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, Lazio, and Rangers and became loved by fans as a talented joker. Born in Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, on May 27 1967, he also starred in midfield for Terry Venables' England side during Euro 96, the highlight being his magical goal against Scotland. He is also remembered for crying after being booked in the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup against West Germany, as he knew the booking meant he would be suspended for the final if England got there.","Gascoigne, 46, called guard a 'c***' before grabbing him around throat .

Fraud: David Hodges could soon be practising as a doctor again after a panel ruled his fitness to practise was no longer impaired by his conviction . A millionaire doctor, who pretended he was deaf to get signed off sick by the NHS so he could concentrate on his private work, could be allowed back to work today eight years after he was struck off. Dr Michael Hodges, 56, pocked a fortune from his private clients and used the cash to fund a life of luxury, with a convertible Jaguar and an Audi TT parked on the drive of his £1.5million Essex home. The ‘greedy’ medic, who was also paid paid £250,000 a year by the NHS, also employed his wife as a receptionist at his surgery, despite the fact she barely ever set foot in it. Hodges worked at Clayhall Clinic in Ilford, Essex, but had claimed mild deafness and tinnitus made him unfit to work. He convinced bosses at the NHS he was unable to work at the surgery because of it, using medical evidence from an ear specialist. The surgery was left in the hands of locums who were paid £17,000 by the NHS to cover him and keep the 5,000-patient practice afloat. But the dodgy doctor was carrying out up to 16 lucrative medical examinations a day and made more than £100,000, despite a claim he could barely communicate with patients. The fraud was uncovered when an NHS colleague spotted his name on the door at Roding Bupa Hospital in Ilford when he was signed off sick. Hodges was jailed for 12 months at Southwark Crown Court in July 2004 after being convicted of 12 counts of false accounting. The shamed doctor served just three months of the term behind bars before he was granted early release. At a GMC hearing in 2005 the panel found that his fitness to practise was impaired and struck him off the medical register. The panel ruled it was in the public interest to erase Hodges’ name from the register for the ‘serious abuse’ of his position of trust. But the former medic could now be allowed to return to work after he applied to be restored to the medical register. The panel at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester has already decided that his fitness to practise is no longer impaired by reason of his conviction. They will now assess whether he still has the skills to work as a doctor after eight years out of the profession. Clayhall Medical Centre: Hodges convinced his bosses that he was deaf and unable to see NHS patients at his place of work in Essex . Speaking on behalf of the GMC, Charles Garside QC said: ‘The major issue, as the GMC saw it, as to whether the conviction were to lead to a finding of impairment is decided already and decided against the GMC’s position. ‘I have no submissions to make at this stage of proceedings.’ The panel was presented with evidence that Hodges passed all areas of a professional assessment carried out on the recommendation of the GMC. Mr Hodges urged the panel to ‘accept my competence and restore my name back to the medical register.’ He said: ‘I think my hearing has been very fair and detailed.' ‘I feel I have proven my competence in a thorough professional assessment recorded by the GMC.' If the panel decide he is now fit to practise he can return to practicing medicine in the UK without restrictions. He indicated to the panel that he intends to undergo re-training at the Kent, Surrey and Sussex deanery. At the time of his conviction, Hodges had a £1.8 million mortgage on five properties. In 2001 he had sold his share in Mobile Doctors - which provide medical reports for ‘no win, no fee’ claim companies - for £3million. His wife Sue was paid £29,500 by the trust for her work as a receptionist using her maiden name of Archer. Hodges had claimed she was working 21 hours a week but she hardly set foot in the surgery. Detectives found that he had also faked a contract of employment for his wife. During the time Hodges claimed to be too ill to work he provided medical services to a range of firms including British Aerospace and the MOD. Hodges also provided an occupational health service for Tesco’s head office in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, and saw private patients at his fully equipped surgery at home in Manor Road, Woodford Green, Essex. During his trial Hodges had insisted his deafness made NHS consultations impossible but he could still carry out private work. The hearing continues.","Doctor struck off after lying about his health could soon be practising again .

It was very hot, so the paddling pool was filled and they were soon joined by the children who live next door. Soon James, still a gloriously uninhibited three-year-old, was running about in his birthday suit, as his sister, with all the sophistication of a five-year-old, pretended to be appalled and felt it her duty to tell on him. The following day was just as warm – but the children were taken to the cinema and, in the afternoon, watched TV, when normally they would be told to go outside and get some fresh air, instead of sitting in front of the box. Troubling: Parents with young children face difficult questions when they find out that a neighbour is a paedophile This picture is posed by models . The reason was simple – adult fear. Much to their bewilderment we just didn’t want to let them out of our sight, didn’t want them to go beyond their own driveway – and even then they had to be fully clothed. You see, that morning we found out that a very near neighbour had appeared in court, where he admitted making and distributing indecent images and videos of children. He had also engaged in sexual activity with underage girls and sent indecent communications to other children over the internet. At the age of 26, this man that  we waved to and greeted cheerily as we passed, has been placed on the Sex Offender’s Register and awaits sentencing after the usual reports. Cliches were all we could think  of at first. That we were shocked, that we couldn’t believe it was true, that it couldn’t happen in a place like this – all the usual responses of the bewildered parent. Everyone knows paedophiles exist across society but for some reason you don’t expect to meet one on your own doorstep. Then instinct kicked in, in the form of an almost overwhelming urge to be sick – followed by another to wrap the children in three layers of clothing from head to foot and to only pass this man’s house with a very wide body swerve. Close to home: Paedophiles exist across society but people do not expect to meet one on their own doorstep. This picture is posed by models . Ruth and James live in a small street of about eight large upmarket houses, a quiet place with no through traffic so they are safe to run around – the kind of place where everyone really does know everyone else. They scamper in and out of each other’s gardens as well as their own and all the children are welcome to play together in any of them without any qualms. Directly in front is the sea, a great attraction not just for them but for the holidaymakers who flock to the beach every summer. To the left is a very good play park and, down in the bay, a mixed bird population where the children visit to throw bread and count the new chicks. There is, then, a good population of children at the best of times and even more so in the hot weather – and from this man’s home he has clear views of our gardens, plus all the attractions that bring people here. He has the capacity and twisted interest to take pictures and videos of innocent children too, and one of the stomach-churning questions on every mind today is whether he has already filmed our own youngsters. At the moment, it is possible for women to check with the police in case a new partner is a paedophile, but not for parents in the community to know if one – or more – is living nearby, or even next door. To allow parents this knowledge could lead to possible vigilante action – so says the official view.It is enough that the police know, though everyone is aware that they cannot monitor these people round the clock. And it is true that in the past, when communities have found out for themselves, they have forced paedophiles out of their areas. Mob rule, say the authorities, but you have to wonder why the safety of vulnerable children comes second to those who have committed offences against children. There has to be a better system that puts protection of children before that of convicted paedophiles – but if there is one, there is clearly a reluctance to put it in place. But this man has been caught and convicted and we do know where he lives, a right most parents believe they should have, and one I have always supported. Until today, I thought it was enough to be forearmed with that knowledge. But when I look out of my window I can see directly into this man’s home. He is that close, and with a sickening suddenness I realised it is not enough just to know. Knowing gives no security. In fact, all it does is throw up yet more questions and more anxieties. For the first time I now appreciate fully the way these offences spread out, the ripples gathering everyone in. For instance, what do we tell very young children like Ruth and James? Concerns: Parents would not want to let children out of their sight if they found out a paedophile was a neighbour. This is a file picture of children playing outside . We will want them to stay away from his house, that is obvious. But how do we explain this to them when they have always had the freedom to roam about what was once a safe area? Ruth, at only five, would have no understanding of the issues involved and for the life of me I can think of no simple way of telling her. If we simply warn her to keep away from that house because a bad man lives there, we will plant not just fear, but possibly terror in her young mind that James would soon pick up on too. This is how childhood innocence is destroyed. Clearly we cannot let them be as free as they were just the other day. Yet we know that withdrawing their usual freedom will unfairly restrict them and they are completely innocent – they have committed no crime. The house that I can see from my window is this man’s family home, where he lives with his elderly parents, and to where he will eventually return. Even if he does soon get a custodial sentence, I would bet anything it will be short. His parents have committed no crime either and cannot be compelled to leave their home, something that could be considered if they lived in council housing. And how are we to treat them now that we are aware of their son’s sick interests? God alone knows what hell they must already be going through but, however much sympathy it is possible to have for their situation, expressing this and befriending them is out of the question – keeping our distance is our only realistic option. And if any one of us decides to sell our home, do we tell prospective buyers of this man’s existence and crimes? I wouldn’t consider living in a house near him – and if I unsuspectingly bought one then found out how close he was, I would pull out of the sale, regardless of the legal situation. So here we all sit, paralysed in a way, stunned by what we have just found out, the anger only now beginning to surface. It is not an exaggeration to say entire lives, existences and outlooks have been changed by the crimes of someone in our midst, whose perversion we never had any reason to suspect for even one minute. You don’t, do you? For this kind of thing always happens on someone else’s doorstep, a horror story far away that we tut-tut over in the newspapers. But we are now asking questions for which I suspect no answers exist: What do we do, what happens now? We are constantly told by those who profess to know that modern parents are over-protective of their children, that our entirely unjustified anxieties stifle them and deny them the kind of freedoms every child should have. There has been yet another report saying exactly that this week. Not an argument that would be entertained in our quiet little backwater today I have to say – and, possibly, not one that ever will be again.","Meg Henderson found out that a neighbour was a paedophile .

Matt Damon’s new sci-fi blockbuster 'Elysium' has received a deluge of criticism that it is pushing a socialist agenda - inspired by the Occupy movement - down moviegoers’ throats. Set in the year 2154, ‘Elysium’ imagines a world where the wealthy elite have abandoned an overcrowded Earth for a better life aboard a luxury space station. While Earth is characterized by crime-riddled and poverty-stricken slums, the super-rich live in Elysium, an exclusive gated community in space complete with a cure for all illnesses and robots that enforce strict anti-immigration laws. Scroll down for video . Matt Damon denies his new movie is an attempt to promote a socialist agency with its storyline about the wealthy elite leaving earth to live on an exclusive space station . Elysium is an exclusive gated community in space for the rich elite complete with a cure for all illnesses and robots that enforce strict anti-immigration laws . The extreme disparity between the haves and have nots in the movie bears strong parallels with the Occupy movement’s fight against social and economic inequality and the vilification of the one per cent. The Hollywood Reporter has called it a ‘politically charged flight of speculative fiction’, while Newsmax has escribed it as ‘political propaganda’ and 'sci-fi socialism.' Variety said it is one of the ‘more openly socialist political agendas of any Hollywood movie in memory, beating the drum loudly not just for universal healthcare, but for open borders, unconditional amnesty and the abolition of class distinctions as well.’ The film’s star – and renowned Hollywood liberal - Matt Damon has denied that it has an overtly political message. L.A. in 2154 is depicted as an overcrowded, crime-riddled and poverty-stricken slums . Jodie Foster stars as Elysium’s Secretary of Defense and violent robots enforce strict anti-immigration laws . Variety has described 'Elysium' as having one of the 'more openly socialist political agendas of any Hollywood movie in memory' ‘I don’t think it is trying to say anything. It just presents the issue – the distinct difference between the haves and the have nots,’ he told Fox. The movie’s director Neill Blomkamp has also denied that he wanted to be a political statement and said it is unfortunate that parallels had been drawn with the Occupy movement. But critics have rubbished their denials. ‘It’s not just hypocritical to say this movie isn’t political, it’s hilarious. This is just the latest of several Hollywood movies this year to try and co-opt Occupy Wall Street plotlines into their films,” Dan Gainor, VP of Business and Culture at the Media Research Center, told FOX. The scenes on earth and supposedly set in Los Angeles a century and a half from now were filmed in Mexico, while luxury space station was based on real designs for how habitable space station might look. Future life? The concept of people living in space stations is something that NASA has been working on since the 1970s . NASA estimates that it would cost about $828.11 billion to build a space station capable of sustaining life . This premise of people living in space might seem far-fetched considering how man's interest in space exploration has waned in the 30 years, but it could soon be within our reach. NASA has been working on designs since the 1970s. In 1975, a report titled 'Space Settlements: A Design Study' was created in an attempt to detail the costs and needs of life in space. The estimated price tag of a space station was about $190.8 billion, in 1975 dollars. Adjusting for inflation, the cost jumps to about $828.11 billion. 'The future takes imagination, you have to extrapolate for the technology we have today. Within the next 1000 years, the type of technology used to support a space station like Elysium could be developed,' Mark Uhran, former director of the International Space Station Division at NASA headquarters, told ABC News. 'We’re already demonstrating some of this technology on the international space station today.'

A little girl has been banned from running around with her friends because a bang to her body could kill her. Simply by tripping and falling to the floor, Lauren Cooper could trigger a huge cyst around her neck to balloon, putting pressure on her internal organs and blocking her airway. The eight-year-old was born with a cystic hygroma - a huge cyst on the side of her face, neck and chest. Lauren Cooper, eight, was born with a cystic hygroma - a huge cyst on the side of her face, neck and chest. It was so big that it forced her tongue out of her mouth . The cyst was so big that it took up the space where her tongue should be, meaning that it could not fit inside her mouth. Although the growth was removed when Lauren was a baby, part of the cyst remains and can balloon and become infected if it is aggravated. Lauren’s mother, Sara Cooper, 40, said: ‘If Lauren has a knock or bang, it can cause swelling which may block her airway. ‘Anything where she might get hit or fall over she can’t do so she cannot play sports and has to constantly be aware of things around her. ‘Even eating peppers or chillies can trigger an attack and it causes her immense pain.’ A cystic hygroma is a collection of fluid-filled sacs, known as cysts, that result from a malformation in the lymphatic system.

There's nothing quite like cooling showers after scorching sunshine... which is handy, because a lot more of them are on the way. The seemingly endless run of clear blue skies that left Britain basking in tropical sunshine is over, according to forecasters, to be replaced by a mixture of scattered rain and sunny spells. While the mercury may not top this year’s high of 34.1C (93.4F) or match the baking conditions in mainland Europe, it will still be pleasant for millions choosing a staycation. The recent heatwave weather has brought on an early crop of Brussel sprouts, which have arrived a month ahead of time, to farmers' delight . Farmers are optimistic that this year's yield could be up to a third larger than average. Jane Bentley, sprout technical advisor. harvested sprouts which have had the 'perfect growing conditions' Much of Britain will see long sunny spells, with the warmest weather at up to 25C (77F) during the next few days in London and the South. It will be cooler in the North, with temperatures hovering around 19C (66F). But forecasters warn we should keep our umbrellas close at hand, as showers are also expected next week. Laura Young, of the Met Office, said: ‘Throughout the week the temperatures are going to be around normal for this time of year, with some scattered showers. ‘There are going to be temperatures on the Continent that could reach 104F, but the way the winds are blowing at the moment none of that will reach us. ‘There is no sign of another heatwave, but we are expecting decent, sunny weather over the next ten days. ‘That is going to be mixed with more unsettled weather, but that is normal for August. It is traditionally the wettest summer month.’ The worst of the wet conditions will be in the West, while the best of the warmth will be in South. Miss Young added: ‘We are going to see temperatures hovering in the early 20s in the South, and in London we might see them hit the mid 20s. With the turn in the weather, the heather turns purple on the Moors above Leyburn. Forecasters predict heavy showers for Sunday . The wet weather to come is predicted to be much milder than the flash floods that plagued commuters in Newcastle earlier this week . ‘But don’t put away the brollies – enjoy the sunny weather when it comes. ‘For the next couple of weeks at least, it looks like the hottest and driest weather is behind us.’ Heavier spells of rain are expected in the middle of the week, but more settled, drier conditions may return at the end of August. It emerged yesterday that the hot weather this summer had some unexpected side-effects, having boosted the Brussels sprout crop and given an extra lease of life to Britain’s flying ant population. After a poor 2012, Brussels sprout growers have experienced their earliest crop, which arrived a month earlier than usual. Farmers are optimistic that this year’s yield could be up to a third larger than average. And the sweltering weather also brought out unusually large numbers of flying ants. Experts are astonished that the ants have been so active for so long. Rebecca Nesbit, co-ordinator of the annual Flying Ant Survey, said: ‘There is a rush of activity at the same time every year. ‘Our findings from last year showed high numbers around August 8 for a few days. This year, the high numbers have been recorded from July 16. 'There are still very high numbers around the UK.

The mother-of-one has since gone from a size 22 to a size 12 in just 12 months and now weighs just 11st 5lbs. Emma, from Garrowhill in Glasgow, said: 'I was going to an Asian wedding and I had to get measured for an outfit which was basically a long dress and trousers. 'The women were measuring me and they said ""that can't be right"". They couldn't believe I was that size. I was mortified.' Emma had previously lost three stone in three months with Slimming World before she fell pregnant with daughter Faith, who is now two, and decided to quit. Emma then started to binge on a diet of sugary cereals, crisps, biscuits and ate up to five takeaways every week. She never did any exercise and admits that she refused to walk even the shortest distances, choosing to take the car instead.

After her embarrassing dress-fitting experience, Emma was shocked into action and she returned to the group in a bid to get rid of her excess weight once and for all. She swapped crisps and chocolate for fruit and yoghurt and quickly began to reap the benefits. For the first six months, Emma lost weight simply by following her eating plan but now attends boot camp and the gym three times a week. She added: 'Now I'll walk to the shops with the buggy rather than take the car. She decided to go on a diet for her daughter's sake; she wanted to be healthier and to be a positive role model .

A fisherman survived a night adrift in the Alaskan sea after his boat sank by floating in a small plastic crate. Ryan Harris, 19, was thrown into the Pacific Ocean near Sitka when his two-man boat overturned in choppy waters. He was rescued from the 4ft-by-4ft fish bin more than 24 hours after the vessel sank, by a coastguard helicopter. Lost at sea: Ryan Harris, 19, was left bobbing alone on the choppy water for 26 hours before a coastguard helicopter came to his rescue . Life-savers: The teenage fisherman was eventually plucked from the cold sea by a Jayhawk helicopter and taken back to dry land to join his rescued fellow crew-member . Mr Harris said he kept his spirits up after being cast adrift on Friday by talking to himself and singing. His fellow crew-member, Stonie 'Mac' Huffman, was separately rescued the next morning, from a beach about 25 miles north-west of Alaskan city Sitka. Harris told the Daily Sitka Sentinel he . was delighted he and his companion had both survived after risking either drowning or catching hypothermia when they were flung . from the 28-foot aluminum boat in temperatures of just 46f (8C). 'It's truly a miracle they survived,' said Sitka Mountain Rescue Director Don Kluting, who helped in the search. 'I never thought I was going to die, but I was worried about Mac,' said Mr Harris. 'I'm glad to be here.' They were dumped into the water before they could send a mayday. The search for them started after friends reported them late back on Friday night. The men had been fishing for coho salmon about two miles off Cape Edgecumbe when the hydraulics failed on their boat. They fixed that problem but decided to head back to port when a huge wave tipped the boat on to its side. Great bravery: Mr Harris shows the blisters and cuts he suffered while trying to stay in the plastic crate during the long, dark night . Two survival suits were on board, but neither man was wearing one when the boat went down. After the boat capsized, they climbed on to the upturned hull. 'We had no radio, no cell phones,' said Mr Harris. Mr Huffman later found a survival suit that had floated from the wreckage and grabbed a plastic bin lid for flotation. The two managed to grab some empty fish totes that had washed loose and Mr Huffman stabilised one while Mr Harris climbed inside. Eight-foot waves soon separated the men. Mr Huffman drifted away with the lid while he struggled to get into the survival suit for two hours. At one point, Mr Harris said, his slipped out of the bin and he struck his head. But he was able to get back in and keep it balanced for the remainder of the 26 hours until his rescue. The toughest part was not knowing the fate of his friend, Mr Harris said. Cold climes: The two fishermen were cast adrift just off the coast of Alaska near the city of Sitka . 'I gave myself a pep talk,' he said. He kept repeating for four hours: 'I'm Ryan Hunter Harris and I'm not going to die here.' During his sleepless night, he sang songs including Row, Row, Row Your Boat and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer to keep up his spirits. The coastguard dispatched a helicopter early Saturday and three others later that day. Alaska State Troopers and Sitka Mountain Rescue sent four boats out searching, said Mr Kluting. The troopers found Huffman, an experienced fisherman in his mid-40s, who had reached the beach at Point Amelia about an hour before troopers spotted him waving on the shore. Mr Harris suffered blistered hands from clutching the bin and a cut above his eye from where his 'lifeboat' struck him, but he declared Monday that he was 'almost 100 per cent.'","The 19-year-old kept his spirits up by singing Row, Row, Row Your Boat .

Mothers who breastfeed have a two-thirds lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s in later life, compared with women who never breastfeed their children, according to a study. The longer the duration of breastfeeding, the more protection is gained by the mother, say researchers at Cambridge University. They interviewed 81 British mothers aged between 70 and 100, who included women with and without Alzheimer’s. The team also spoke to relatives, spouses and carers. Cambridge University researchers found women who breastfed had a 64 per cent reduced Alzheimer's Disease risk compared with women who did not. Longer breastfeeding cut the risk still further . Through these interviews, the . researchers collected information about the women’s reproductive . history, their breastfeeding history and their dementia status. All of this information was then . compared with the participants’ breastfeeding history. Despite the small . number of participants, the study revealed a number of clear links . between breastfeeding and Alzheimer’s. These were not affected when the . researchers took into account potential variables such as age, education . history, the age when the woman  first gave birth, her age at . menopause, and smoking  and drinking history, says a report in the . Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease. The researchers found women who . breastfed had a 64 per cent reduced Alzheimer’s  risk compared with . women who did not.Longer breastfeeding cut the risk further. The study found women who breastfed . for a year had 78 per cent of the risk of Alzheimer’s of a woman who . breastfed for four months. One theory is that breastfeeding restores hormone levels, including insulin tolerance which dips during pregnancy, which may make the brain more vulnerable to Alzheimer's . And doing more breastfeeding offset the higher risk of Alzheimer’s linked to more months of pregnancy. However, the protective benefits were far less for women who had a parent or sibling with dementia. One theory is breastfeeding deprives the body of the hormone . progesterone, which is known to desensitise the brain’s oestrogen . receptors, making it more difficult for oestrogen to protect the brain . against Alzheimer’s. Another possibility is that . breastfeeding increases a woman’s glucose tolerance by restoring her . insulin sensitivity after pregnancy. Dr Molly Fox, of the Department of . Biological Anthropology at the University of Cambridge, who led the . study, said: ‘Alzheimer’s is the world’s most common cognitive disorder . and it already affects 35.6million people. ‘In the future, we expect it to . spread most in low and middle-income countries. So it is vital that we . develop low-cost, large-scale strategies to protect people against this . devastating disease.’ 'The worrying thing is that this older generation spent more time breastfeeding - only one per cent of mothers in Britain today breastfeed exclusively for six months,' said Dr Simon Ridley of Alzheimer's Research UK . She said the study was not able to . compare the Alzheimer’s risk in mothers, whether they breastfed or not, . and women who remained childless. But previous research suggested not . having children might be linked with poorer cognitive function in old . age, she added. Dr Fox went on: ‘The worrying thing . is that this older generation spent more time breastfeeding. Only one . per cent of mothers in Britain today breastfeed exclusively for six . months.’ Dr Simon Ridley, the head of research . at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said ‘Preliminary studies like this one are . important for highlighting associations worthy of further study, but we . shouldn’t be quick to jump to conclusions quite yet.’","A Cambridge University study of 81 British women has found a 'highly significant link' between breastfeeding and dementia .

A neighbour of Tia Sharp's grandmother  was today jailed for five months after being convicted of wasting police time by giving a false statement that he had seen her alive. Paul Meehan, 40, who lived next door to Christine Bicknell and her murderer boyfriend Stuart Hazell, had told detectives investigating the schoolgirl's disappearance that he saw her walk past his home. The bus driver told officers he was ‘100 per cent sure’ he saw her walk past the house in New Addington, south London, on August 3 last year - but the 12-year-old was already dead. In court: Paul Meehan (left), 40, who lived next door to Christine Bicknell and her murderer boyfriend Stuart Hazell (right), had told detectives investigating Tia Sharp's disappearance that he saw her walk past his home . At Croydon Magistrates' Court, Meehan was convicted of ‘causing wasteful employment of the police by making a false report’. Hazell was jailed in May for a minimum of 38 years for killing Tia, but the court heard there was no suggestion Meehan was in league with the murderer. Meehan remained impassive as the verdict was delivered. However, as the hearing adjourned he sat down and buried his head in his hands. The last confirmed sighting of Tia was on Thursday August 2 last year at 4.30pm. She was murdered at some point that night going into the following morning. On Monday August 6 as the missing 12-year-old's family were frantic with worry, Meehan told police he had seen her walk past him the previous Friday while he was in his garden. Emotional: David Niles (left), Natalie Sharp (centre) and Christine Bicknell (right), the mother and grandmother of Tia Sharp, weep at Croydon Magistrates Court where Paul Meehan was convicted of wasting police time . He gave a detailed and ‘vivid’ description of what she was wearing, the court heard, which delayed . police from interviewing Hazell earlier. 'He wouldn’t be the first or last person to derive some . satisfaction, however subconsciously, of playing the role of the last person to . see the victim of a homicide alive' Jocelyn . Ledward, prosecuting . But . police had spoken to Meehan about the case three times before he . finally said he saw her. He claimed that he ‘confabulated’ seeing her - . his brain mistakenly filled in the blanks in good faith. Jocelyn . Ledward, prosecuting, said Meehan had ‘deliberately lied’ possibly to . put himself in an important position in what was then a missing persons . inquiry. She said: ‘He wouldn’t be the first or last person to derive some . satisfaction, however subconsciously, of playing the role of the last person to . see the victim of a homicide alive.’ Tragic case: The last confirmed sighting of Tia Sharp was on Thursday August 2 last year at 4.30pm. She was murdered at some point that night going into the following morning . She added that Meehan had texted his wife about his police . dealings and that there was a ‘hint of him being puffed up’ by . the focus being on him. 'You basked to some degree in the attention your disclosure brought you' District Judge Karen Hammond . Meehan’s solicitor, David Healey, said his client - who has . one previous conviction for theft - has been suffering from depression since . his arrest. He said there was no medical or psychological evidence of . him wanting the attention. District Judge Karen Hammond said Meehan was unreliable. She said: ‘I am satisfied so that I am sure, that is to say, beyond reasonable doubt. The offence is made out. The verdict therefore can only be one of guilty.’ Jailing him for five months, she said: 'You basked to some degree in the attention your disclosure brought you.'","Paul Meehan, 40, lived next door to Christine Bicknell and Stuart Hazell .

Lycra-wearing Bob Carter was likened to Lord of the Rings creature Gollum by Mr Johnson after their two-wheeled war of words during the 100-mile RideLondon event.

Mr Johnson revealed the moment he was hit by a volley of abuse while battling to the top of Leith Hill in Surrey, the highest point in South East England. ‘Out of the corner of my eye I saw someone imitating me – pedalling alongside and puffing with satirical glee. ‘He was one of those Gollum-like creatures whose Lycra appeared to be shrink-wrapped about his spindly form,’ he wrote in his Daily Telegraph column. ‘His legs were as brown and thin as Victorian dining room chairs, and he seemed to be so totally hairless that one could imagine he applied Veet to every portion of his anatomy in order to minimise wind resistance.’ And they're off!

I’ve waited years for the chance to torture you, and I’m not going to miss it this time!’ The London Mayor pedalled his road bike for eight hours through the capital and the Surrey Hills before rewarding himself with a bacon roll at the finish on The Mall near Buckingham Palace. But today his persecutor was unmasked as Mr Carter, who claimed he was only rude to the politician because he ‘was really in trouble and looked very sickly’. Nearly there: Cyclists peddle past Buckingham Palace as they near the finish line at The Mall . He added: ‘Hell would have to freeze over before I voted for him but fair play to him he completed the ride, which was very tough. ‘I was giving him a bit of abuse and I think he thought I called him ‘a fat b******’ but I didn’t.

He went on: ‘As for Gollum, he is a cheeky so and so saying that, I have never heard that one before. ‘I am glad he finished and if he wants to get fitter he is welcome to join us in Norwich on Sunday for our club ride.’ The race saw cyclists ride east through London before tackling the Surrey Hills and looping back around into the city along a similar route to the one tackled last year during the Olympic road races.","Top Tory Boris Johnson started the race by waving a Union flag .

Gina DeJesus, one of the three women who was snatched from the streets and held captive in a Cleveland house for a decade, has made her first public appearance since her dramatic escape. The 23-year-old looked relaxed as she waved a flag and threw treats to the crowd during the annual Puerto Rican Parade and Latino Fest on Sunday. Although Gina thanked her supporters in a video released by the three survivors a month ago, it is the first time she has been seen in public since just her escape from the house on May 6. Her smiling, relaxed appearance came in stark contrast with the gaunt, shaky figure that appeared in police interview footage shortly after her escape three months ago. Scroll down for video . Free: Gina DeJesus laughed and waved as she took part in a parade on Sunday - in her first public appearance since she escaped the house of horrors where she was held captive for a decade . Support: Gina, right, took part in the Puerto Rican Parade and Latino Fest for a city council candidate . The other survivors, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight, have also stepped out in public in remarkable shows of courage. Berry, 27, was pictured dancing at a Nelly concert last . month, while 32-year-old Knight faced her captor, Ariel . Castro, at his sentencing in court last week before returning to the . home on Seymour Avenue on Friday to thank neighbors for their support. Members of the community who attended the parade on Sunday said they became emotional when they saw DeJesus, whose family is Puerto Rican. She was riding with relatives as part of the Janet Garcia for City Council group. 'It was very beautiful. I got chills when I saw her on top of the car,' Vivian Prez, who watched the parade, told Fox8. Happy to be there: Gina seemed at ease as she rode atop the car and waved to the crowds . Joy: DeJesus gave a 'thumbs-up' - an echo of the sign she gave as she arrived home after her escape . Parade: She took part in the annual parade where local groups raised awareness of missing people . Aida Cruz added: 'I got emotional when . I saw her. I got a granddaughter back there, looked like she was about . to cry. It was just very emotional.' The . theme of the parade was 'a celebration of renewed hope and community . healing', and many taking part in the festival held posters bearing the . faces of people missing from the area. DeJesus' father Felix also spoke at the Latino Fest with his wife by his side as he pleaded with the crowd to keep their ears and eyes open to help find other missing children in the state. 'I want to tell you Gina, Amanda and Michelle are doing beautiful,' he said. 'I got to tell you something. Our work is not done. We have more beautiful children out there that need our help.' Fighter: DeJesus was gaunt in a video of her interview with police shortly after her escape on May 6, left, while a video taken a month ago shows her smiling and looking healthy . Home: Gina poses with her mother, Nancy Ruiz, after a company donated a privacy fence last month . Community activist Angel Arroyo added: . 'On Friday, there were still 95 people in this city missing. Fifty . people from the list are children, 45 people are adults and so we still . have a lot right here.' The three survivors released a video last month thanking people for their support and donations. After . their escape from Ariel Castro's house, The Cleveland Courage Fund was . set up to help them rebuild their lives and has so far raised more than . $1.2 million. 'I would like to say thank you for the . support,' DeJesus said in the video, while the other two women spoke . out at greater length. The . three women and a six-year-old girl fathered by Castro were saved from . the house in Cleveland in May after Amanda Berry managed to escape, . alert neighbors and call 911. Having fun: Amanda Berry, second left, made her first public appearance on stage with rapper Nelly on July 27 . Appearance: Michelle Knight, pictured right, stepped out in public on Friday to thank neighbors near the home she had been held captive for a decade with the other girls . They had been kidnapped between 2002 and 2004 and held captive at the home for more than a decade, where they were subjected to sexual, physical and emotional violence. Castro pleaded guilty to more than 900 counts and last week and he was sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years for the sick crimes. He has started his prison term in isolation due to the high profile of the case. Graphic and disturbing evidence was heard during the four-and-a-half-hour hearing on Thursday, with Castro himself giving a deluded version of events in which he denied raping his victims. Standing in an orange jumpsuit, Castro . shocked the packed courtroom by stating there was 'a lot of harmony' in . the house where he trapped and abused the three women. Sick: Ariel Castro was given a life sentence plus 1,000 years behind bars for kidnapping and raping the girls . The detective in charge of the case described how Castro abducted the three women, took them to his home and immediately tied them in chains in the basement and raped them. He put a motorbike helmet on each girl and left them in the dark basement overnight, Detective Harasimchuk said. 'Each woman told me they were repeatedly sexually, physically and emotionally abused by Ariel Castro during the entire time they were in captivity,' he said. The women disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004, when they were 14, 16 and 20 years. But at the hearing on Thursday, .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 11:04 EST, 5 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:32 EST, 5 August 2013 . Furious town hall leaders have accused ministers of risking ‘real and permanent damage’ to Britain’s high streets by suggesting empty shops be turned into homes, . Councils said the idea floated by Tory Nick Boles would lead some shopping hubs ‘being shut down forever’. The minister suggested that the high street is dead, and instead of trying to revive boarded up shops planning rules should be eased to allow them to be turned into houses. Empty shop on high streets, such as here in Margate, one of Mary Portas's 12 pilot towns, could be converted into affordable homes (file photo) The radical proposal from planning minister Mr Boles risked contradicting efforts by retail guru Mary Portas, who was hired by David Cameron to find a way of reviving dying town centres. As a result of her report some £1.2million of taxpayer money was shared out between 12 towns for initiatives to inject new life into their traditional shopping high streets. But Mr Boles suggested that internet shopping and changes in lifestyles and working patterns meant the traditional town centre was a thing of the past. 'We want to encourage local councils to . concentrate retail activity into the prime shopping streets in the heart . of their town centres and adopt a more relaxed approach to under-used . retail frontages,’ he said. Planning Minister Nick Boles said councils need to think 'creatively' about how to revive flagging High Streets . Local authorities would be given more freedom to convert shops into housing, with retail concentrated on one or two ‘prime streets’ to end the ‘long straggly shopping streets heading out of town’ But the idea was condemned by the Local Government Association, which accused Mr Boles of acting to kill off the high street altogether. Mike Jones, chairman of the LGA’s environment and housing board, said: ‘Councils are working locally to improve high streets. ‘This national intervention could undermine that and lead to some shopping hubs being shut down forever with residents and businesses left powerless to raise an objection. This could drain the life from our high streets. ‘Instead of risking real and permanent damage by imposing this on the whole country, government should trust local areas to decide for themselves where relaxing planning rules would be beneficial.’ He warned that the stripping away of planning rules will ‘undermine people’s right to have a say on significant changes to their local neighbourhoods and high streets’. Portas's key recommendations, which . included cutting business rates and putting a brake on new shopping . centres, have both been rejected. Mr Boles said that planners most respond 'creatively' to shifts in the way today's consumers shop. Allowing redundant shops to be converted into homes could ease pressure on greenfield sites for residential developments. Retail consultant Mary Portas became a Government advisor on how to rescue the High Street, but many of her key recommendations have been ignored . The planning minister said: 'People' s shopping habits are changing very fast as a result of the rise in internet shopping and changes in lifestyles and working patterns . 'We need to think creatively about how to help town centres thrive in this new era. 'We want to encourage local councils to concentrate retail activity into the prime shopping streets in the heart of their town centres and adopt a more relaxed approach to under-used retail frontages.'Ms Portas expressed concern that councils would choose the 'easy option' of turning units into housing and said that losing the high street would be 'one of the greatest social crimes in our country.' Mr Boles also indicated that councils are to be encouraged to allow farmers to convert old agricultural buildings into homes. 'We want to make the best use of existing buildings in the countryside to meet the desperate need for affordable housing in rural communities,' he said. 'The more redundant barns that can be converted into homes for young families, the more we can protect green fields from development.' Earlier this week, a Chocalatier forced by soaring costs to shut his flagship shop warned that the British high street is almost dead. Simon Dunn, whose store was in Chancellor George Osborne’s constituency, says small businesses are being forced out as their profits are squeezed. He was left with £100 for himself ‘in . a good week’ after paying rent, business rates and wages, leading him . to warn: ‘Before long all that will be left on the British high street . is Tesco, Costa and charity shops – it’s just impossible for people like . me to keep our heads above the water.’ ‘I’m afraid independent traders on the high street just don’t have a chance these days in this tough current economic climate. ‘My . shop was in George Osborne’s constituency [Tatton]. He ought to know . the importance of independent businesses and try to do something to help . us. It’s the rising cost of everything that is affecting business . owners like me. ‘The sad part of it is that we’re not . the only business that’s having to do this. It’s a national problem . that is affecting every high street. 'On . a good week we were left with £100-a-week profit and it was just not . worth it. There seems to be no incentive to operate as an independent on . the high street these days. Chocolatier Simon Dunn warned that the High Street is nearly dead following the closure of his flagship shop in Wilmslow, Cheshire . ‘I have to turn over a certain amount just to keep moving, but if I go over that amount suddenly I find myself in a position where I can be taxed more. It’s as though business owners are punished for being successful.’ He will now concentrate on the business’s online operation. Ms Portas condemned the Government over a decision to allow Tesco to build a vast new supermarket on the seafront at Margate, one of her pilot towns, in June and accused the Government of 'paying lip service' to the idea of regenerating high streets. She has become an outspoken champion of . small retailers and fought to try and revive town centres ravaged by the . impact of large supermarkets. However, she has effectively been . overruled by the equally combative Eric Pickles, the Secretary for . communities and local government, who has approved the Margate scheme. The . new Tesco, which had been fought by local residents and traders, will . be a massive 82,000 square feet and sit on what is a key site on the . seafront. Councils will be urged to concentrate shops into a main retail area and convert empty units into homes (file photo) The news will confirm suspicions that . the original decision to hire Portas was more of a publicity stunt than a . genuine attempt to help struggling high streets. In April, Ms Portas accused the . former Tesco boss, Sir Terry Leahy, of talking ‘crap’ when he described . the rise of supermarkets as progress. She . said: ‘That's absolutely crap. What happens is that 50p of every pound . is spent on food. 'If you take that off the high street and put it into a . 40,000ft out-of-town store and you provide free parking and everything . under one roof, then you start to take away not only the food shops, but . also the chemist, the fashion shops, the butcher… you start to displace . the whole high street.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Small businesses are the backbone of the British economy. ‘We know for many that times have been tough. The Government has focused what help we can give on small businesses.’ Small businesses have been hit by a double whammy of punishing business rates and a persistent reluctance from banks to lend to them, writes Matt Chorley, MailOnline's Political Editor. The economic recovery has continued since the start of the year - growth hit 0.6 per cent the three months to June, double the rate seen in the first quarter. But even with more customers willing to spend, many small firms are struggling to make ends meet. Latest figures show banks cut back lending to small business in 80 per cent of the country's 120 postcodes from 2011 to 2012. Only 22 towns and cities saw lending increase, despite government pressure on the banks to increase funding for struggling companies. Business Secretary Vince Cable said it was 'frustrating'. At the same time business rates charges imposed by councils on company premises wipe out a growing slice of any profits. The Federation of Small Business found one in 14 companies now spend more on business rates than on rent. With another rise in rates due in September, it is feared more companies could go bust.","Nick Boles said council should concentrate shops in 'prime' locations .

From a hunk of roast beef to a piece of sushi and a Nando's chicken, these foodie snaps are enough to make your savoury saliva glands start to drool. But before you get too excited about a slippery piece of salmon or a crispy roast potato, look a bit closer: these savoury foods are actually made of cake. These quirky sweet treats are the handiwork of creative baker Louise Caola, a 23-year old Londoner who has just quit her job in advertising to pursue her fun kitchen hobby as a full time career, naming her business Poppy&Lulu. Incr-edible! Louise Caola, 23, started baking in her free time, creating amazing designs like this uncanny roast beef and potato meal, and has now turned her hobby into a full-time business . Where it all started: Louise made this sausage and mash as a joke for a friend... but on closer inspection it is sponge cake . Louise has been baking since she was a young girl, and fondly remembers sitting on her kitchen surface helping her mother make cakes. After studying fashion marketing at university she landed a job in an advertising firm, and would bake cakes in her free time. She created her first sausage and mash cake as a joke for a friend's birthday, but couldn't believe the positive response she got. Immediately she began creating more and more fake-savoury cakes in her free time, then posting the pictures on her Twitter and Instagram pages. As a result, orders began flooding in from people all over the internet. Uncanny: Louise says this Nando's creation was the hardest she has ever made, and involved her individually rolling out each tiny piece of corn . Not your average meat-feast pizza: Louise quit her full-time job in advertising to pursue dreams of baking cakes that look exactly like savoury food . Speaking to MailOnline, she said: 'I was working really long hours and then would come home and bake. 'I started taking it seriously a few years ago and then I got so much positive feedback that I thought ""there must be something in this"". 'After much umm-ing and ahh-ing I decided to quit my job to pursue this full-time.' Louise is currently in the process of launching a website and fully establishing her brand, which she has named Poppy&Lulu after close childhood friends, but she has already been flooded with requests for fun cakes. Her cakes can take up to four hours to create - and often involve a lot of trial and error. She is planning on baking an eggs Benedict-themed cake this weekend, as well as a cake styled like steak and . chips, and a bunch of bananas. Intricate detail: She describes herself as very determined and is always keen to perfect her cakes to the finest details - like each piece of beef in this burrito . Realistic: Her creations, like this scarily realistic fish, chips and peas meal, take her around four hours to complete and often involve a lot of trial and error . 'I don't know how I am going to get the cake to look like a tomato in my steak and chips dish. but I love a challenge!', she added. She cites her favourite - and most popular - cake as the roast beef one, and says the Nando's one was the hardest to create. 'I rolled out each tiny piece of corn for the sweetcorn in the Nando's dish, which was hard, but I am always determined to complete a cake, even if it takes a few failed attempts.' Master chef: Louise is the creative brains behind the cakes, and hopes to expand her business and deliver nationwide . Sweet sushi: Whilst this sushi roll looks like it would taste fishy, you'd be in for a sweet treat tucking into it . Creative eye: Louise studied elements of graphic design at Nottingham Trent Universitym and credits this for her attention to detail . It tastes sweeter than it looks! Louise has been flooded by requests for cakes on her Twitter and Instagram page, despite only starting a few weeks ago . Louise, who studied fashion marketing at Nottingham Trent University and credits her creative skills to the graphic design she learnt, says she loves creating and making things, and has grand plans for the future. 'I have only been doing this full-time for a few weeks, but you just have to run with these things. 'At the moment I just offer hand-delivery to places in London, but the dream is to expand it nationwide and have a team of bakers helping me create wonderful cakes.' Italian with a twist: Louise loves taking on challenges, and while this spaghetti bolognese creation was one of the more simple, she is hoping to attempt making cake that looks like fruit next . It's not what it looks like! This incredible Cornish pasty looks like a tasty deep-fat treat - but when cut in half it is filled with delicious chocolate sponge .","Louise Caola, 23, from London, is now pursuing baking full time .

Chancellor George Osborne, pictured on a building site, made the house buying scheme a central plank of his Budget . Plans to offer state-backed mortgages were mired in confusion last night over whether they could be used by the wealthy to buy  second homes. The Chancellor said the £130billion scheme was a 'big new step' that would help hundreds of thousands of families buy their own home or move home as their family grows. But it came under fire after it emerged wealthy homeowners may be able to use it to buy second homes costing up to £600,000. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls dubbed it a 'spare homes subsidy' for the rich. And the Campaign to Protect Rural England warned subsidising second homes could push house prices out of the reach of locals in areas like Cornwall and the Lake District. CPRE spokesman Claire Norman said: 'We doubt the Chancellor intends the scheme to be used for second homes, but if it is legal and possible, what would stop people?' Experts also warned the scheme could spark a house price boom, with the taxpayer picking up the bill in the subsequent crash. Mr Osborne and Business Secretary Vince Cable both ducked questions yesterday about whether people would be able to use the scheme to buy second homes. They insisted the aim was to help finance main homes, but said details would only be finalised following talks with the housing industry. Mr Osborne said: 'This is a big new step for the UK, and we are going to consult on the details. The mortgage market is an extremely complex thing. 'The intention of the scheme is absolutely clear – it is for people who want to get their first home, or people who have a home and want to move to a bigger home because they've perhaps got a bigger family.' He added: 'If we were in a housing boom then this is not the kind of intervention you would take. But actually our housing market is not properly functioning at the moment.' Scroll down for video . To promote his plans, Mr Osborne visited a Berkeley Homes Royal Arsenal Riverside development in Woolwich, south east London . Mr Osborne also met Rick Newton and Emily Sandercock who have recently bought an apartment at a development in Woolwich, south east London . Mr Cable said the consultation . 'recognises the fact that in the mortgage market there are many complex . products, for example many parents support their children's housing . acquisition. That kind of transaction has to be properly analysed before . this scheme is launched.' The Treasury yesterday made clear people would not be able to use the Help to Buy scheme to purchase buy-to-let properties. But Treasury sources said banning . existing homeowners from the scheme would penalise many who need help, . such as children who need support from parents to buy a home, divorcing . couples, and families who temporarily rent a home they cannot sell. Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne meets Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls . Dangerous? Critics fear that offering government-back mortgages to people who cannot afford a deposit could fuel a new property crisis . Chancellor George Osborne is expected to unveil more help for homebuyers and extra investment in housebuilding . The mortgage guarantee part of Help to Buy will underwrite £130billion of mortgages on any property worth up to £600,000. It will be available for mortgages of . between 80 and 95 per cent of a home's value. So for someone able to . muster a 5 per cent deposit, the Government would put in 15 per cent, to . enable them to access an 80 per cent loan. If a borrower's property is repossessed, the Government will bear part of the losses. A second, 'shared equity', part of the . scheme will offer loans worth up to 20 per cent of a home's value. The . scheme, worth £3.5billion, will be rolled out next month. Former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling warned there was a danger the larger scheme could fuel another price boom. He said: 'The risk is that you simply . inflate house prices and you could even get into some of the problems . you have seen with sub-prime.' Example: The proposed scheme is split into two separate streams, the first (above) for buyers purchasing new build homes and the second (below) for everyone else .

Gay marriage plans cleared another major parliamentary hurdle tonight when peers overwhelmingly rejected a bid to block the legislation. A rare 'wrecking' amendment declining to give the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill a second reading was defeated on a free vote by 390 to 148, with a majority of 242. The marathon debate, with more than 90 speakers over two days, revealed deep divisions over the controversial measure in the Upper House. Supporters of same sex marriage sing during a vigil outside the Houses of Parliament yesterday . MPs have already backed the Bill, which applies to England and Wales, despite fierce opposition from dozens of Tory backbenchers . It is certain to face further formidable opposition during detailed line-by-line scrutiny in its later stages. MPs . have already backed the Bill, which applies to England and Wales, . despite fierce opposition from dozens of Tory backbenchers. Critics . in both Houses warn the move will undermine the traditional concept of . marriage, while supporters stress the need for equality. The result was greeted with cheers from supporters of gay marriage outside Parliament. The scale of the vote against the wrecking amendment proposed by independent crossbencher Lord Dear will be a major fillip for the Bill's supporters. Lord Dear insisted the change would 'completely alter the concept of marriage as we know it'. The . Bill was 'ill thought through' and had no democratic legitimacy, he . said. It was so 'fatally flawed' as to be incapable of sensible . amendment and should be sent back to 'the drawing board', he said. The Archbishop of Canterbury said in . the debate yesterday that introducing gay marriage would 'abolish' the . existing institution and replace it with a weaker option. The scale of the vote against the wrecking amendment proposed by independent crossbencher Lord Dear will be a major fillip for the Bill's supporters . The Most Rev Justin Welby said the controversial plans would be 'neither equal nor effective'. Tory former lord chancellor Lord Mackay of Clashfern voiced opposition to the legislation, insisting the union of same sex couples amounted to a 'new and different institution' which deserved a 'name of its own' Lord Mackay told a crowded chamber that the natural procreation of children could never be a possibility for same-sex couples. 'And therefore a union between them, however loving, cannot have this purpose.' He said: 'I conclude that the union open to same-sex couples in this Bill is not the institution of marriage but a new and different institution which deserves a name of its own.' As debate on the Bill resumed today . former BBC director general and independent crossbencher Lord Birt said . the 'brave Bill' would help bring about a better world. Lord Birt said that during his years in broadcasting he worked with many people who were gay but would not admit it. Social and cultural attitudes had since changed and the Bill would help hasten the day when homosexuality was accepted as a 'wholly natural state'. He said: 'This brave Bill brings us one historic step closer to a better world and I wholeheartedly support it.' But . Baroness Stowell of Beeston, for the Government, hailed the legislation . as a 'force for good' which would strengthen the institution of . marriage. She said it protected both religious freedom and freedom of speech. In . the closing moments of the long debate, Lady Stowell also held out an . olive branch to religious leaders opposed to conducting same sex . marriages. If further . changes to the legislation were necessary to make protections for . religious organisations clearer, the Government would consider doing so, . she said. Stonewall chief executive Ben Summerskill said: 'We're absolutely delighted. 'We always expected a tough challenge in the House of Lords, and Lord Dear's 'fatal motion' - very rarely used - demonstrates the lengths to which a minority of peers are, sadly, still prepared to go to deny full equality to lesbian, gay and bisexual people. 'In the last 24 hours alone, opponents of equality in the House of Lords have compared loving, committed relationships to incest and polygamy. 'Britain's 3.7 million gay people don't deserve to be second class citizens in their own country. A tough fight lies ahead and we'll continue to work tirelessly every single day to get equal marriage through the Lords.' Peter Tatchell, who co-ordinates the Equal Love campaign and has championed same-sex marriage since 1992, said: 'This is a victory for love, marriage and equality. 'We are another step closer to our goal of equal marriage. It signals that the House of Lords accepts the principle that we should all be equal before the law.'","A  'wrecking' amendment declining to give the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill a second reading was defeated on a free vote by 390 to 148 .

An Illinois father is calling for his daughter's suicide case to be reopened after she was discovered last year in her ex-boyfriend's apartment with a gunshot wound to the head. Larry Young says his then 21-year-old daughter Molly did not commit suicide and that evidence obtained through a freedom of information act request reveals enough evidence to bring up charges against her ex-boyfriend Richie Minton. But the Jackson County State's Attorney Mike Carr disagrees, announcing Monday that he would not be filing charges against Molly's ex-boyfriend due to insufficient evidence. Mystery: Molly Young was discovered with a gun shot wound to the head at her boyfriends home the morning of March 24, 2012. Her death was initially ruled a suicide, but was overturned by a jury of coroners this past January . Unaffected: One of the more suspicious aspects of the case was her ex-boyfriend's stoic 911 call . Molly was discovered the morning of March 24, 2012 with a gunshot wound to her head. The most suspicious aspect of the case is her ex-boyfriend's eerily calm 911 call. Minton was also working at the time as a police dispatcher. His roommate initially called 911 and said: 'We have a person in my living facility, who we believe to be dead.' He . then hands the phone over to Minton who reported: 'I woke up and she . was covered in blood. She overdosed, she bled out through her nose.' Though . Minton says he was sleeping when she overdosed, the official cause of . death was a gunshot wound to the head - something that certainly would . have woken Minton up. 'The . 911 tape tells it all,' Larry Young told WSIL-TV. 'The guy's so calm on . the 911 tape you'd think he was ordering a pizza or something.' Mr . Young also points out that the gun was Minton's  and his daughter was shot in the left side of the head, even though she's right handed. Molly was excited about her new job and had plans to go shopping the weekend she was discovered dead, Mr Young said. Illinois State Police Lt Stan Diggs spoke with the Carbondale Times about some of the other troubling details of the case. That morning, Lt Diggs said Carbondale Police were allowing Minton 'some latitudes' before State Police arrived on the scene. When they arrived, Minton - the son of a longtime Franklin County Sheriff's deputy - already had his attorney present. Police did not conduct a gunshot residue test on either Minton or his roommate's hands. While Minton's roommate spent several hours speaking to the police, Minton was 'not being real accommodating with us' and initially refused to sit for an interview with investigators, Lt Diggs said. Pursuit of the truth: Molly's father Larry Young will continue to investigate his daughter's death after a state's attorney refused to bring up charges against her ex-boyfriend Monday . The girl's death was originally ruled a suicide by a coroner, but a review by a . jury of six coroners in January changed that ruling to 'undetermined' after deliberating for less than 30 minutes. 'It disgusts me that a young woman could lose her life like that and no one seems to care,' Mr Young told ABC News. But he's not letting the announcement Monday get him down. He takes Mr Carr's refusal to bring up charges as a challenge to continue investigating his daughter's death to find more evidence to bring to the state's attorney. Justice for Molly: Molly's father is campaigning heavily to have her case reviewed, and hopefully bring up charges against Minton .","Molly Young, 21, was discovered dead in her ex-boyfriend's apartment on March 24, 2012 .

Currently undefeated as a professional, Nick Newell is defying the odds and finding more believers with each passing fight. He is 10-0 after winning his Saturday fight against Keon Caldwell by submission. Newell has won all but one of his fights by either knockout or submission. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Remarkable: Nick Newell is 10-0 despite fighting with only one hand . Newell, 27, was born missing a left hand. His arm ending just below his elbow, Newell has refused to let it define him. In the Caldwell fight, Newell forced the seasoned pro to tap out only 2:07 into the first round with a choke hold. ‘I had a bunch of ways I thought I would beat him and this was one of them,’ Newell said in a post-fight interview. Seemingly having a great advantage over the one-handed Newell, Caldwell was put a scare into Newell before succumbing to the one-handed fighter’s deft takedowns and gritty determination. Newell dropped him to the mat on multiple occasions before applying the winning choke-hold by using his less-defined left arm as leverage while clenching it with his right hand. Confident: Newell has won all 10 of his professional fights . ‘I came out there to put on a good show,’ Newell said after the match. ‘He was a lot quicker and stronger than I thought he'd be.’ The 155-pound congenital amputee earned a berth in World Series of Fighting’s lightweight tournament. He was the lightweight champion at Xtreme Fighting Championship, which he left for WSOF earlier this year. An all-state high school wrestler in Connecticut, Newell holds the state record with 53 wins, according to his Facebook fan page. Winning move: This choke hold won Newell the fight, earning him a shot at the World Series of Fighting lightweight title later this year . Not content to settle, Newell has his sights set on joining UFC, the most lucrative MMA organization. The inspiring fighter told ESPN earlier this year that he ‘hopes UFC President Dana White sees a fighter who is hard to take down and has a solid chin, precise kicks and a loaded right hand.’ Telling ESPN that ‘the best in the world fight in the UFC, and let me tell you, it's tough with two arms and two legs,’ White didn’t yet sound convinced. Newell's ascendance as a congenital amputee isn't unprecedented. Major League Pitcher Jim Abbot carved out a 10-year MLB career as a starting pitcher, most notably for the California Angels and New York Yankees. Abbott even pitched a no-hitter for the Yankees in 1993 and even more remarkably had two career hits. Not perfect: Jim Abbott pitched 10 season in the Major Leagues, even throwing a no-hitter for the New York Yankees in 1993 -- even more remarkably, he has two career hits . Undeterred, Newell looks forward to his next bout, the second title shot in the two leagues he’s fought in. ‘I know what it’s like to be at the bottom,’ Newell said after the Caldwell fight. ‘Now I’m at the top and I’m not letting anyone take it away from me.’","Nick Newell is a congenital amputee born without a left hand .

Wilkie Collins scandalised Victorian Britain with his ‘sensationalist novels’ about fallen women,  marital bigamy and illegitimacy. But the bestselling author of The Moonstone and The Woman In White had a ‘secret’ private life just as risque as any of his stories. A new biography of the writer reveals an almost ‘industrial’ addiction to opium and how a sexual obsession with two ‘socially inferior’ mistresses had a defining impact on his work. Andrew Lycett, author of Wilkie Collins: A Life Of Sensation, said: ‘Wilkie was a very Victorian conundrum. He specialised in the sensationalist novel which embraced the idea of characters with deep, dark family secrets. 'But he had a very secretive life of his own and a laddish attitude to sex which influenced some of his best-known stories and characters.’ By the 1860s, Collins, who was a close friend of Charles Dickens, had established himself as a highly respected member of the literary establishment. But his public persona hid a sexual obsession with vulnerable women from a lower social scale. Collins, who lost his virginity at 12 and travelled around Europe picking up girls with Dickens, embarked upon long-standing and overlapping relationships with Caroline Graves, then a 25-year-old near-destitute single mother, and Martha Rudd, a 19-year-old semi-educated Norfolk barmaid. Lycett said: ‘The fact they were from very different backgrounds to Collins was part of the attraction. Graves being almost a fallen woman only added to her “declasse allure” and his relationship with Martha, in particular, was a very sexual one.' Scandal: Wilkie Collins had overlapping relationships with single mother Caroline Graves, left, and 19-year-old barmaid Martha Rudd, right . ‘It is not that he wasn’t popular with well-born women, but when it came to intimate relationships this is the type of woman he went for.’ Lycett’s biography, published next month, coincides with a renewed interest in Collins’s life and work. Tom Hollander, star of the BBC comedy Rev, plays the author in new film The Invisible Woman – which highlights his friendship with Dickens – with Michelle Fairley starring as Graves. Collins began his relationship with Graves in 1856 aged 32. He was happy to support both her and her daughter but refused to marry her. Their relationship hit breaking-point in the 1860s when he began his relationship with Rudd. He also refused to marry her, but she went on to bear him three children. Collins’s unorthodox lifestyle gave him an insight into the plight of working-class women for his books and he also tackled themes of prostitution and unjust marriage laws.

More than 100,000 people have applied to be a part of the Mars One project, which aims to colonize the red planet starting in 2022. Out of the thousands, 40 people will be selected. Of the 40, just four will participate in the first passage to Mars, which is scheduled to leave in September 2022 and land seven months later in April 2023. None of the four will ever return to Earth. Mission to Mars: The selected candidates will live in pressurized cabins equipped with 'plant production units' for growing food . More than 30,000 Americans have applied for the chance to be the very first settlers on Mars, paying a $38 application fee. The audacious project is the brainchild of a Dutch company run by CEO and creator Bas Lansdorp. Lansdrop told CNN that the price based is on the gross domestic product per capita of different nations. For example, Mexicans pay a $15 application fee. 'We wanted it to be high enough for people to have to really think about it and low enough for anyone to be able to afford it,' Lansdorp said. The very first mission to Mars will cost $6 billion, according to Lansdorp. Desolate: The first four settlers on Mars will have to contend with a cold, hostile planet and the knowledge that they'll never see their loved ones again . He intends to fund the mission by creating a 'reality TV' series about the mission, documenting everything from the astronauts' training on Earth right through to touch-down on Mars and their daily lives once on the planet. Sponsors and media agencies would pay to broadcast the Mars mission. 'What we want to do is tell the story to the world. When humans go to Mars, when they settle on Mars and build a new Earth, a new planet. This is one of the most exciting things that ever happened, and we want to share the story with the entire world,' Lansdorp said. Another second group of four will leave two years after the first. Wannabe astronauts: View some of the potential space travellers on Mars One's website . The astronauts will complete eight years of training. According to the Mars One website, candidates will be isolated from the world for a few months every two years in groups of four in simulation facilities, to test how they respond to living in close quarter with just three other people. They'll be trained in 'physical and electrical repairs to the settlement structures, cultivating crops in confined spaces, and addressing both routine and serious medical issues such as dental upkeep, muscle tears and bone fractures.' The seven to eight month journey will be 'arduous'. There will be no showers and only canned or freeze-dried food. Astronauts must complete three hours of exercise a day to maintain muscle mass. The atmosphere on Mars is so thin that settlers won't be able to go outside without a space suit. Cabins will need to be pressurized at all times. The point of no return: Once the newest Martians take off in their spacecraft, they'll never touch back down on Earth - no return mission is planned . There is no vegetation on the planet, but the Mars One settlers will begin to grow crops in specially designed 'plant production units'. By the admission of Mars One, 'You could say that most people would rather lose a leg than live the rest of their life on a cold, hostile planet, having said goodbye to friends and family forever, the best possible video call suffering from a seven minute delay - one way.' So just who are these would-be astronauts? Number one: A potential Mars One astronaut shows his support of the mission . Generous: Sean Holt has offered to make tinfoil hats for his fellow Mars astronauts should he be successful . Bailey, 19, from Arizona says she wants to be the first musician on Mars. 'I see this trip as an artistic opportunity, as well as a scientific one,' she says. 'I'm willing to dedicate my life to this mission, but I have a very positive outlook. I'm very light-hearted, and I love to joke around,' she says, before cracking some highly questionable jokes. A love of Star Wars and Star Trek seems to be a common thread with many applicants.

The Prince, 28, is said to have grown 'very fond' of dance student Miss Bonas, 24, who he has been seeing on and off since July last year. Harry arrived in the Angolan capital Luanda yesterday on a visit for the 25th anniversary appeal of a mine clearance charity which was championed by his mother Diana, Princess of Wales.

Idyllic: The couple are expected to spend a week together with friends in Botswana (pictured) It is understood he will the head down to Botswana to join Miss Bonas and a group of friends including the Duke and Duchess of York's youngest daughter Princess Eugenie for a week-long break, the Daily Mirror reports. In October 2010 brother William got down on one knee to the future Duchess of Cambridge on the veranda of an isolated log cabin during a trip to Kenya. Harry is expected to join Miss Bonas and a group of friends including Princess Eugenie for a week-long break . Harry's last serious relationship with Chelsy Davy fizzled out amid rumours that she couldn't handle the pressure of being under the royal spotlight. He is reportedly desperate to keep things relaxed with Miss Bonas and wants their love to grow 'naturally'. A friend of Stowe-educated Miss Bonas said in June: 'She and Harry are very fond of each other and taking things one step at a time to see whether or not there might be something more permanent one day.' Like Miss Davy, Miss Bonas went to study at Leeds University after boarding at £30,000-a-year Stowe School in Buckingham. She is the daughter of 1960s society beauty Lady Mary Gaye Curzon and her third husband, Old Harrovian businessman Jeffrey Bonas, who divorced in 1994. It will be a very welcome break for the Prince whose Army friend Corporal James Dunsby, 31, died recently after collapsing on an SAS selection exercise on the Brecon Beacons on July 13. This week Harry said he was ‘deeply saddened’ by the death of Cpl Dunsby – who had served as his gunner in Afghanistan. The pair were said to have become 'close friends' during the Princes first tour of Helmand province when they were part of a three-man crew of a Spartan armoured car. Harry, a junior officer in the Household Cavalry Regiment, acted as commander and Cpl Dunsby was at the controls of the vehicle’s General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG). The Prince is working on behalf of the . HALO Trust in Angola where his late mother was passionate about its work . in trying to rid mines and unexploded devices from war-torn lands. Miss Bonas (right) pictured with actress Isabella Calthorpe at a . Wimbledon Tennis party in Kensington earlier this year.

His spokesman said: 'Prince Harry, as patron of the HALO Trust’s 25th Anniversary Appeal, is currently on a private visit to Angola to see HALO’s mine clearance and will be touring minefields and meeting beneficiaries of HALO’s work'. The late Princess Diana visited minefields being cleared by HALO in Angola just before her death in 1997 to help draw world attention to the horror of landmines. The HALO Trust works with some of the . world’s most vulnerable people so they can plant their crops, rebuild . their homes and raise their families in safety once the mines have been . cleared. The Prince arrived in Angola yesterday on a visit for the 25th anniversary appeal of a mine clearance charity which was championed by his mother Diana, Princess of Wales . Prince Harry has already visited minefields in Tete province in Mozambique in 2010 as part of his work with the project. He met amputees, seeing for himself the devastating impact that landmines have on some of the poorest people in mine-affected communities. During his trip to Mozambique he spent time with a team of HALO deminers and personally detonated several mines.","Harry, 28, is said to be .

Warning: Lib Dem peer Floella Benjamin will call for lessons in extreme pornography . The dangers of extreme pornography would be taught in schools under Lib Dem plans to tackle children’s ‘distorted view of sex’. Nick Clegg’s party will also call for web users to have to specifically request access to explicit material on electronic devices to curb access to internet filth. Under current government plans, every householder will be asked whether or not they want online porn blocked. Pornography depicting rape will also be outlawed. But in a direct challenge to the coalition’s own plans, a policy expected to adopted at the Lib Dem’s conference next month will call for a default setting where pornography is blocked unless users request access. Former children’s TV presenter Floella Benjamin warns of the ‘long-term effects on young minds of early exposure to often violent and abusive sexual material’. The Lib Dem peer said it is ‘is highly damaging to impressionable young people and may significantly alter their attitudes to sex’. At the conference in Glasgow Baroness Benjamin will argued that the internet has many positive benefits but ‘it is the role of government to protect those too young to make an informed choice from potentially damaging experiences wherever possible’. She will also raise ‘significant concerns’ about other adult material such as suicide and eating disorder sites that often actively target young people. A motion to be debated at the conference calls on the coalition to ‘ensure that teaching about the dangers of the internet and the distorted view of sex provided by pornography forms part of sex education teaching’. It will also urge ministers to work with the software industry to ‘introduce opt-in filters to explicit material on all new internet-enabled electronic devices’. Adults wishing to view pornographic material should be required to opt in to websites containing such material by providing verifiable proof of age, possibly by logging in with a credit or debit card. Opt-in: The Lib Dems want every web user to specifically request access to pornography on every electronic device . Last year education minister Liz Truss suggested pornography could already form part of lessons in schools. She said: ‘The Government wants all young people to have high quality, age appropriate sex and relationships education. ‘The current non-statutory programmes of study for Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education, which include sex and relationship education, can provide opportunities for schools to teach about pornography.’ The NSPCC has recently warned of an increase in the number of cases of children sexually assaulting other children. The motion by Baroness Benjamin also raises fears about the ‘increasing number of cases of children being bullied or coerced into performing pornographic acts by their peers’.","Nick Clegg's party calls to lessons to counter 'distorted view of sex'

'Not only is the adoptive couple asking this child be ripped from her father while he is serving his country, they are also endangering his military career in the process,' a Cherokee Nation spokesperson told the Tulsa World, adding that issuing the arrest warrant was 'morally reprehensible and legally questionable,' saying all parties involved knew Brown was out of state at National Guard training. 'Just because they get Dusten doesn't mean they will get Veronica,' a defiant Mrs Brown told the paper. Brown has 20 days to file a motion in Oklahoma to stop the transfer of custody, according to media reports, though he does plan to abide by court orders. Matt . and Melanie Capobianco, the baby's Charleston, South Carolina, adoptive parents, have said that the want Veronica back, but would like to avoid the process becoming traumatic. Veronica initially grew up with the Capobiancos after her . biological mother Christy Maldonado decided to give her up for adoption to a non-Native American family. Mr Brown, the girl's birth father, objected despite having signed away his rights to Miss . Maldonado, and sued for custody based on his Cherokee Nation ancestry. In 2011 the Capobiancos were forced . to hand Veronica over to Mr Brown, who lives in Oklahoma, due to the . Indian Child Welfare Act - even though she is just two per cent . Cherokee. Earlier this month, the state Supreme . Court ordered him to return the girl to her adoptive parents after the . U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the law did not apply in this case. Documents filed in court last month . and published by Tulsa World provide a detailed proposal on how Veronica . should be reintegrated with the Capobiancos. Native American tribes across the U.S. see the case as a test of tribal sovereignty which could set a precedent for other adoptions . Veronica, her biological father Dusten Brown, feed their geese and ducks at his home in Oklahoma where she has lived for the past 19 months . She should be shown photographs of . her adoptive parents, who have not seen her for 19 months, while Mr . Brown should prepare a scrapbook of pictures and memorabilia to maintain . his link with his daughter after her adoption. 'He can plan a farewell celebration with his community, which should be done prior to the transition period,' the plan says. The section headed 'What to tell the . child' includes: 'She can have a cookie at her adoptive parents' house. Talk about games she can play when she gets there. Tell her she can . watch her favorite video or cartoon when she returns to the adoptive . parents' home. 'In language Veronica can understand, . help her realise she will be returning to the family she lived with . when she was a little girl, to help take care of her, to keep her safe, . to play with her, and to love her.' During the week-long transition, . Veronica was to play with the Capobiancos and gradually see less and less . of Mr Brown, until they take her with them from Oklahoma to South . Carolina, according to the document. Mr Brown was not to be allowed to see . her for two months after the move, although the two should be allowed to . speak on the phone once or twice a week. In the middle: Veronica has been caught in an ongoing tug of war custody battle for most of her young life . 'I'm always going to be her daddy': Dusten Brown and daughter Veronica met for the first time on New Year's Eve 2011 . Lawyers for the father have . criticised the proposal, claiming it was drawn up by social workers who . do not know Veronica personally. However, a lawyer for Miss Maldonado . told Tulsa World that it was much more humane than when she was . originally separated from the Capobiancos. Mr Brown had never met his daughter and, . after the girl's non-Indian mother rebuffed his marriage proposal, . played no role during the pregnancy and paid no child support after the . girl was born. Last month it was revealed that Miss Maldonado is suing the federal government, saying a law governing . the placement of Indian children is unconstitutional. In her lawsuit, filed in . federal court in South Carolina, she asks U.S. Attorney . General Eric Holder for a declaration that parts of the Indian Child . Welfare Act are illegal. Those measures – which include a . preference for 'other Indian families' over prospective non-Indian . adoptive parents – should be abolished because the law uses race in . determining with whom a child should live and therefore violates equal . protection provisions, Miss Maldonado argued. The act was passed in 1978 to reduce . the number of Indian children being removed from their homes by public . and private agencies and placed with non-Indian families.","Veronica's mother was working with non-Indian couple to adopt young girl .

Usher and his ex-wife appeared make peace in court on Friday after a bitter custody war over their two sons. The singer gave tearful Tameka Foster Raymond a consoling hug moments after she lost her bid to get temporary primary custody of Usher V, five, and Naviyd, four, in a hearing in Atlanta. She sought legal action after the pair's older child got caught in a pool drain while in the care of the Grammy winner's aunt on Monday. She alleged the children were in a 'dangerous environment'. Scroll down for video . In tears: Usher's ex wife Tameka Foster Raymond broke down during an emergency hearing in Atlanta on Friday. A judge later dismissed her request for temporary custody of the pair's sons . Extending the olive branch: Usher approached his ex-wife after the ruling to give her a hug . But the judge described the incident as an 'awful accident' and dismissed the case. The . courtroom showdown between the former couple took a surprising turn, . with Usher extending the proverbial olive branch to a distraught Raymond . by embracing her. The 34-year-old RnB star tentatively approached, before placing his hand on her shoulder. Hey, . are you okay? Usher was seen holding his ex-wife by the arms, no doubt . wanting to show some sign of solidarity following the highly emotional . week and hearing . Come here: Usher then pulled her to him, although she didn't appear too eager to reciprocate . Best it's going to get: Raymond acquiesced somewhat as she leaned her head on his shoulder . Raymond . - whose 11-year-old son Kile, from a previous relationship, tragically . died in a jetski accident last year - turned to him as he pulled her in . for an embrace of apparent sympathy after what has been a very stressful . week for the two parents. Usher's aunt, Rena Oden, was looking after the children on the day of the pool accident. Before . dismissing the case, Fulton County Superior Court Judge John Goger said . he wasn't certain anyone really could have done anything to prevent the . accident. But he also advised Usher to keep his ex-wife well advised of . his whereabouts and who's taking care of the children. Tough time: Raymond grew emotional through much . of her testimony, especially after listening to the 911 call made by . Rena after the pool accident . 'Awful accident': The judge said he didn't believe another caregiver could have done a better job under the circumstances. The . pair's boy fell to the bottom of the pool and became stuck in the drain . on Monday, according to an Atlanta police report. A housekeeper tried . unsuccessfully to free him. A contractor doing work at the home pulled . the boy from the pool and performed CPR. The . boy was 'conscious, alert and breathing' when emergency medical workers . arrived, police said. He was still in the hospital Friday. 'They're . just assessing him,' Raymond told reporters outside the courthouse . after the hearing. 'There is a lot we don't know. I mean you can't - . it's only been a few days so we're very thankful that he's obviously . alive but we still have to observe him and make sure that everything is . OK.' Taking . to the stand: Raymond requested the hearing earlier this week after the . former couple's five-year-old got caught in a pool drain while in the . care of the Grammy winner's aunt . Visibly emotional: Raymond said her ex-husband doesn't respond to her calls or emails asking after their children . Shut . out: The caregivers he introduced to me, I didn't know they had quit,' she said, referring to her children's previous caretakers. '[Usher] . doesn't answer the phone, he doesn't answer emails' Usher left the courthouse in downtown Atlanta without speaking to reporters. The . filing had said the boy 'suffered a near-death accident' while left . unsupervised at Usher's home when the singer was out of town. Contrary . to what Raymond claimed, Usher's aunt was poolside watching the . children when the older child became stuck in the drain, and Usher was . at a music studio one highway exit away, said the singer's lawyer John . Mayoue. Breaking down: Raymond started sobbing while listening to the 911 call made by Rena after the pool accident . Overcome with emotion: Raymond wailed 'it's chaos, it's chaos' after hearing the 911 call . Rather than being . grateful that her child had survived, Raymond used the episode to . revisit the custody battle and gain publicity, Mayoue said. Raymond, . who is a hair and wardrobe stylist, was emotional during her testimony, . at one point sobbing so hard that she had to step down from the witness . stand to regain her composure. 'He . doesn't confer with me regarding anything,' Raymond said, explaining . that she never knows where Usher is, where the children are and who's . taking care of them. Refutes claims: Usher claimed he sends her a weekly email detailing the children's plans for the upcoming week . Not impressed: Usher looked exasperated prior to the start of the hearing . Usher . travels frequently and uses caregivers, including his aunt, who aren't . trained and qualified to care for young children, Raymond said. 'I don't know where my children are, and I don't know who they are with,' said Raymond as she took the stand. 'The . caregivers he introduced to me, I didn't know they had quit,' she said. '[Usher] doesn't answer the phone, he doesn't answer emails.' Deep in discussion: Usher was seen going over notes with his lawyer prior to the hearing . Tense moments: The former couple were seen ignoring each other before their lawyers entered the room . Usher . refuted the claims when he took the stand, claiming he sends her a . weekly email detailing the children's plans for the upcoming week. 'Every . Sunday I send her a weekly activities, any doctor's visits... summer . camp, any information that's pertinent to their activities,' he said. 'She can contact the children at any moment and any of the people who will be with them at this time.' Unfit father: Foster's lawyer stated at the start of the hearing that several recent incidents - including the pool accident - prove Usher is an unfit father . Unfounded: Usher's lawyer, meanwhile, asked that the case be dismissed, stating that his sons are 'thriving' under his care . Arriving in court: Usher arriving at an Atlanta court for an emergency custody hearing over the future of his two young sons on Friday . Coger . said he thought Raymond's standards for a caregiver were unusually high . and pointed out that many people leave their children with family . members. Raymond's lawyer . Angela Kinley also attacked Usher for not calling his ex-wife to alert . her of the accident until about 45 minutes after it happened. Usher testified that he wanted to try to get information about how serious it was and his son's injuries before calling her. On . Thursday, Raymond posted a picture of the couple's son in hospital with . the caption, 'My favorite 5 year old. What a blessing!' No talking: The singer looked solemn as he walked out of the court without talking to reporters . Quick exit: Tameka managed to muster a half smile as she emerged from court flanked by her lawyer .

"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 10:06 EST, 10 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:08 EST, 10 August 2013 . Without a trace: Erica Lynn Parsons, 15, was reported missing by her 19-year-old brother last week after she was last seen in Salisbury, North Carolina, in November 2011 . The FBI and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation have joined the search for a 15-year-old girl who was last seen two years ago, but was not reported missing until late last month. Police became aware of Erica Lynn Parsons' disappearance only July 30 when her 19-year-old brother contacted them and said that she was last seen leaving the Salisbury home of her parents in November 2011. An attorney hired by Erica's adoptive parents, Casey and Sandy Parsons, claimed that his clients were under the impression that the 15-year-old went to live with her biological grandmother and wanted to be left alone, the Charlotte Observer reported. The lawyer, Carlyle Sherrill, said that two years ago, a person claiming to be a relative or friend of Erica's birth parents came by Parsonses' home on Miller Chapel Road to pick her up and take her to her family. The adoptive parents said they did not raise an alarm at the time because Erica visited that person in Asheville on several occasions. According to Sherrill, In February 2012, Erica called the Parsonses and informed them in no uncertain terms that she was not coming back because she did not want to live with them anymore, Asheville Citizen-Times reported. ‘They looked at it as being a rebellious teenager. That was an attitude they took,’ Sherrill said. ‘I don't know that at any time it dawned on them she was a missing person.’ According to police investigating the case, when they questioned Casey and Sandy Parsons over a two-day period last week, the parents lied to them and were uncooperative. 'Rebellious teen:' Erica, who was adopted by the Parsons family when she was 2 weeks ago, allegedly informed them by phone that she does not want to return home and plans to stay with her birth parents' relatives . Their attorney, however, insists that his clients did not purposefully fabricate anything, but were rather relying information that they believed to be true. Sherrill added that her clients stopped answering questions when detectives began insinuating that that the Parsonses may have played a role in their adopted daughters' disappearance. On Friday, Erica's adoptive aunt and grandmother were interviewed by investigators. Meanwhile, the Parsonses spoke to local reporters, saying that they believed the 15-year-old was OK, but afraid to contact them due to all the media attention. 1998: Erica Lynn Parsons, age 2 weeks, is taken in by Casey and Sandy Parsons, who have three children of their own. She is the biological child of Sandy Parsons’ brother’s wife. 2000: The Parsonses officially adopt Erica in Cabarrus County . 1999-2011: The couple have two more children, Brooke and Toby. February 2010: William James Parsons, 16, the couple’s biological son, is arrested for biting his younger brother. August 2011: James Parsons is charged with two counts of assault, animal cruelty and assault on a minor. Charges are dismissed when Casey Parsons does not appear in court. Nov. 19, 2011: The Parsonses take Erica to a McDonald’s in Mooresville to catch a ride to the Asheville home of her biological grandmother, Irene 'Nan' Goodman. December 2011: The Parsonses say on her third visit to Asheville, Erica calls home and says she doesn’t want to live with them anymore. 2012: Casey Parsons files a missing persons report for her daughter, Brooke. July 30, 2013: After his parents kick him out, James Parsons contacts the Rowan County Sheriff’s Office and reports that Erica has been missing for two years. August 2013: After undergoing two days of questioning by investigators, the Parsonses hire attorney Carlyle Sherrill. Aug. 5, 2013: The Rowan Sheriff’s Office issues a missing/endangered persons alert for Erica. Aug. 9, 2013: The Parsonses have agreed to appear on the Dr. Phil Show. Source: Salisbury Post . Casey and Sandy Parsons told the press that despite accusations from police, they have done nothing wrong. ‘[Police said] we had killed Erica and buried her in our backyard,’ Casey Parsons said. ‘We told them 'Go do what you want to the house. Look. Go dig the yard up. Erica is not in this yard. Erica is fine.' According to the couple, they believed that their adopted daughter has been living with her biological grandmother, Irene Goodman, since December 2011, when the girl traveled to Asheville to visit her for Christmas. However, police and Erica's birth mother, Carolyn Parsons, said that the teen's paternal grandmother has died. Despite Casey and Sandy Parsons' protestations that they have never hurt Erica, the Department of Social Services has removed their two other children from their home and launched an investigation of its own. According to DSS documents obtained by Channel 9, at least one person had been concerned that Erica was being abused as a child. The report stated that when Erica was 4 years old, she was observed with ‘four marks on her rear end, a long one down the back of her leg and a couple on the side of her face.' According to a woman involved in the case, the little girl was perpetually punished by her adoptive parents. The person who raised the alarm about Erica's treatment told DSS at the time that Casey Parsons even carried ‘a belt’ and used it to whip the girl. However, a DSS investigation into the allegations of abuse has yielded no evidence. According to a report summing up the investigation, ‘no signs of cuts, contusions, or scratches’ have been found,  and Erica showed ‘no signs of fear with either of the parents going up and sitting on each of their laps without being asked.’ The person who reported the abuse, however, insisted that Erica was very submissive and would do whatever she was told out of fear of being punished. The Parsonses' lawyer told ABCNews.com that around November 2011, Case and Sandy Parsons got a call from Erica's birth mother, who said she wanted her daughter to come stay with her and another relative in the Asheville area for a while. Erica has been missing since November 19, 2011. On July 30, nearly two years later, her older brother, James Parsons, reported her missing. He told authorities that when he asked about his sister previously, his parents said she had left and moved in with other relatives, the Salisbury Post said. Last sighting: Erica has been missing since November 19, 2011, when she left her adoptive parents' home on Miller Chapel Road in Salisbury . Claims of innocence: Casey and Sandy Parsons gave an interview to local media in which they insisted that they have done nothing to harm Erica, and that they believed she has been living with her grandmother . The 19-year-old said he fears that something may have happened to Erica and his parents are not telling him. According . to Sherrill, James Parsons called police after being forced to move out . of his parents’ house as punishment for assaulting his mother with a . baseball bat in June. Casey and Sandy Parsons described . their son as an emotionally disturbed young man who is bi-polar, . suicidal and at times violent. In February 2010, James was charged with assaulting his then-3-year-old brother, Toby, by biting the toddler on the arm. That . summer, James was charged with assaulting his mother, who had just . undergone surgery, his sister and brother, and also choking the sister’s . dog. According to the . arrest warrant, the teen pulled his mother’s gastrointestinal bag tube, . causing it to bleed, and kicking the woman while she was on the floor. James also allegedly threated his baby bother with a knife and grabbed . his sister, Brooke, by the throat. The charges against James Parsons were later dropped because his mother failed to appear on court. Vendetta: The parents accused their son, James, of filing the missing persons report just to get back at them for forcing him out of the house after he had attacked his mother . Worst fears: The girl's adoptive grandparents, Janet and Steven Parsons, are afraid that something happened to Erica, and their son, Erica's father, and his wife are not telling them the truth . ‘He . always told me he was going to get me. I never thought he’d do this,’ Casey Parsons said, implying that her son filed the missing person’s . report to get back at her. Last . year, authorities said Casey Parsons reported her daughter Brooke . missing, but the child was later found and returned home. When the Parsonses, who adopted the girl when she was just 2 weeks old, tried to contact Erica's family in Asheville, they could not be found. The parents have agreed to speak out . about their adopted daughter next Monday on the Dr. Phil talk show, . hoping it will help investigators find Erica. Relatives told Channel 9 the girl has had a life filled with pain and fear. According to one family member, Erica could not speak to or look at anyone because she was always being punished and abused. Erica Parsons is described as 4 feet 5 . and weighing between 85 and 90lbs.

One of the store's 14 surveillance cameras captured the man picking up the pug puppy, pacing around with it briefly before lifting his white t-shirt, unzipping his trousers and shoving the tiny dog down his pants.

Federal authorities will arrest two former JPMorgan Chase & Co. employees on suspicion that they tried to conceal losses incurred by the infamous 'London Whale.' Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout are expected to be arrested in London in coming days for their part in trying to conceal the investment bank's $6 billion trading loss last year, the New York Times first reported Friday. Bruno Iksil, the trader known as the London Whale, will not be arrested. Cooperating with investigators and is considered key to any prosecution, Iksil is not likley to be charged over the series of events that led to the scandal. Staggering losses: JP Morgan Chase lost over $6billion from the London Whale scandal . Martin-Artajo oversaw JPMorgan's trading strategy in London, while Grout recorded the value of the soured investments, according to the New York Times, which said a federal grand jury moved to indict both on criminal fraud charges. Federal investigators concluded that Martin-Artajo ordered Grout to falsify records and conceal more than $400 million in losses from their superiors at the bank, the newspaper reported. Likely to be extradited to the US under an agreement with British authorities, it is not clear where the two men are located, they are nationals of other European countries, according to the Times. The charges against Martin-Artajo and Grout hinge on the cooperation of Iksil, the JPMorgan in London who placed the large bets that led to the loss, according to the report. JP Morgan is also close to a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring the bank - by assets, the largest in the country - to admit fault, according to separate Times report. Despite the pending settlement with the SEC, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and federal prosecutors are trying to determine if executives misled investors with their under-representation of the magnitude of the losses, according to a separate Times report. The beleaguered firm is also facing fines from Britain's Financial Services Authority, the Times reported. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon famously referred to the scandal as a 'tempest in a teapot' early on, words that came to haunt him as the firm came to realize the staggering losses incurred by Iksil and co. 'There was no hiding, there was no lying, there was no bullsh---ing, period,' Dimon pleaded during a conference in New York this past June. Initially misled: JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon testified in June about the scandal during a US House Financial Services Committee hearing on Capitol Hill . Iksil incurred a stunning portfolio of derivatives positions as a trader in the firm's chief investment office in London, England. The chief investment office, which has since been dissolved, both took bets and hedged the firm's risk on the open market. It traded only proprietary capital, no client money was lost. Derivatives are contracts tied to assets such as corporate bonds or even common stock, and are used to bet on the expected performance of the underlying company. Designed with varying degrees of complexity, it is possible to earn a profit or insure against potential loss regardless of how a company performs, depending on the type of contract used. Iksil is not likely to be charged because investigators have concluded he was unfairly blamed, according to Reuters. Charges against the firm's top executives are also highly unlikely, the Times noted. Dimon reportedly reviewed the division's profit and loss reports for large positions every day. The alleged actions of both Martin-Artajo and Grout are said by regulators to have led to the surprising disconnect between anticipated and actual losses. The U.S. attorney's office in New York declined to comment late Friday. A call left with the FBI office in New York was not immediately returned. The trading loss disclosed in 2012 was an embarrassment for the biggest U.S. bank and raised concerns about risk-taking at Wall Street banks four years after the financial crisis.","JP Morgan Chase over $6billion from the scandal .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:52 EST, 10 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:06 EST, 10 August 2013 . John F. Kennedy's assassin Lee Harvey Oswald may have been a loner in life, but it seemed in death he at least had Nick Beef next to him . Visitors to Oswald's grave in Fort Worth, Texas have wondered who Beef was since a mysterious gravestone appeared next to the legendary killer's around 1997. The New York Times solved that mystery Friday, tracking down Nick Beef to New York City where he is alive and well. Mystery solved: The man whose headstone sits next to Lee Harvey Oswald's is actually alive and living in New York . Now 56-years-old, Beef is a writer and 'non-performing performing artist.' He was born Patric Abedin, the son of a Air Force navigator. When President Kennedy and Jacqueline landed at Carswell Air Force base in Fort Worth on November 21, 1963, he was there on the side of the road to welcome them to Texas with the many other well-wishers. Beef had lost his father, so a military police officer pulled him up on his shoulders to find his dad. Just then the president and first lady drove past and he had a prime view. It was quite a story, and one that she shared with all of his classmates at Waverly Park Elementary School the next day. The lone gunman: Lee Harvey Oswald was the suspected assassin of President Kennedy, but never got a trial since he was shot himself while en route to county jail . Shot: Oswald shot President Kennedy as he was driving through Dallas, Texas with his first lady Jacqueline on November 22, 1963 . At recess Beef had to stay inside since he was an asthmatic, so he was alone when he heard the principal come on the loudspeaker twice to announce that first the president had been shot, and then that he was dead. When his class returned, he had to break the news to his teacher and friends. Years later, he relocated to Arlington, Texas with his remarried mother and would make a weekly trip back to the air base to get an asthma shot. While in Fort Worth they would often stop at Rose Hill cemetery and look at Oswald's grave. 'Never forget that you got to see Kennedy the night before he died,' his mother would say. Plot purchased: Beef says he has no intention of using the plot and would rather be cremated . In 1975, when he was 18, he read in a newspaper article that the plot next to Oswald's grave had never been purchased and inquired about it at the cemetery. He put $17.50 down on the plot and made 16 monthly payments of $10 to secure it. Eventually Beef would leave the state and move to New York, where he performed in a sketch-comedy troupe, and did some freelance humor writing. Beef married, had two children and divorced. When he went home to bury his mother in 1996, he stopped by the cemetery and asked to get a gravestone put on his plot. When asked what he wanted, he decided on Nick Beef to protect his family name. While he is a comic, he insists that buying the plot and placing the gravestone is not some elaborate joke. 'It meant something to me in life,' he told the Associated Press. Beef has no intention of actually using the plot, saying he would prefer to be cremated.","Nick Beef, born Patric Abedin, was 6-years-old when he witnessed President Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline land in Fort Worth Texas on November 21, 1963 .

The BBC’s National Lottery game show is embroiled in a fakery row after two contestants accused bosses of cheating them out of £22,000 in prize money. The women, who appeared on last night’s episode of ‘Break The Safe’, have revealed that the end of the show was secretly changed to produce different results. Friends Helen Griffiths and Rina Evans say the BBC’s decision to alter the ending has denied them prize-money and betrayed viewers. Scroll down for video . Lost out: Helen Griffiths (left) with friend Rina Evans on last night's Break The Safe Lottery show . The women have revealed that the end of the show was secretly changed to produce different results, denying them a £22,000 prize . Rina, 40, said: ‘The episode is a fake – it’s complete deception for the viewer. It is not something I would ever have expected from the BBC and people need to know the truth.’ The Mail on Sunday can reveal the show, broadcast to millions of viewers, was in fact filmed twice – and the contestants were ordered not to tell anyone. The two versions, with different end results, were then put together and broadcast as a single, continuous episode. Helen, also 40, said: ‘We had no expectations of winning but what we did expect was fair play. 'Instead, they have made it look like the whole thing had been filmed on one day – it is plain trickery. 'We even had to wear the same clothes and have our hair exactly the same. The whole thing was completely staged.’ Last night’s TV audience witnessed Rina, a mother-of three, and Helen dramatically lose out on £44,000 in the final round of the tense game show presented by Nick Knowles. However, the pair, from Ammanford, Wales, have revealed the ending shown on BBC1 last night was ‘switched’ from the original and the rules were changed. If the same rules had applied to both episodes, they would have won £22,000. Last night's TV audience witnessed Rina, a mother-of three, and Helen, both from Ammanford, Wales, dramatically lose out on £44,000 in the final round of the tense game show presented by Nick Knowles (above) Rina  said: ‘We got a call from Stuart Harrison, the producer, literally the day after we had come all the way back to Wales to say they had decided the format was too difficult and they wanted to change the rules. 'However, in order for that to happen he said they needed us to fly back to Glasgow that night – which was the last thing we wanted to do. And he kept specifying on the phone, you must not tell anybody.’ Under the initial rules, the pair of contestants who make it to the final both had to push separate buttons at the same time in order to win prize-money accrued in the safe. Only Helen had succeeded, meaning the friends had initially walked away with nothing. But the day after they had filmed the first episodes on June 26, the production company admitted to the contestants the ‘flawed’ format made it ‘impossible’ to win. Under the new rules, only one contestant needed to hit the button to win half the prize money – meaning the Welsh pair had been entitled to £22,000 prize money the first time. ‘The new rules meant we had won the first time, so we thought they just wanted to re-shoot the final scene to show that,’ said Helen, a primary school teacher. ‘Instead they made us do the final round all over again. The crew kept drilling us about what we could say and what we couldn’t say. They even styled our hair exactly the same and made us say exactly the same lines as if we were actors. It was all about deceiving the audience.’ Rina added: ‘It was done in front of a skeleton audience of about 50 people at the most. All morning they said they were in a complete panic about finding people to sit in the audience. They were phoning friends and family and just grabbing people off the streets. The whole atmosphere was a sham.’ Helen said: ‘By that time, there was no natural reaction from either of us because it felt like a staged moment. We were expected to act out a natural, impromptu scene but we couldn’t because we aren’t actors. We came off the set feeling that we’d been used by the BBC to help fix their failed format. We went back to the hotel and cried.’ After returning to Wales ‘physically and emotionally exhausted’, Helen contacted the BBC to express her frustration at their treatment, and even asked for their episode to be scrapped. The BBC last night denied any wrongdoing and said the show had fully complied with their editorial guidelines. ‘This is absolutely not a deception of viewers or contestants,’ said a spokeswoman.","Friends Helen Griffiths and Rina .

When he was just a baby, 6-year-old Jayden David was diagnosed with a rare form of epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome, which causes him to have violent seizures several times a day. The seizures were so bad that they prevented the Modesto, California boy from walking, playing with friends and essentially living a normal life – he’s been rushed to the hospital by ambulance at least 40 times. To combat the disease, Jayden was prescribed 12 different medications that he has to take every day. In all, the boy takes 22 pills a day. Miracle: Before 6-year-old Jayden David started treating his epilepsy with marijuana, he couldn't even walk up stairs . ‘At one point Jayden had seizures 24 hours a day lasting an hour and a half,’ Jayden’s father, Jason David, told KCRA. ‘I went to my doctor and said, “I don't think Jayden is going to last, he can't sleep, can't eat, he hasn't used the restroom, he can't do anything.”’ At one point, the debilitating disease got so bad for his son that Jason said he considered killing himself. As a last resort, Jason David opted to try a liquid form of marijuana to treat Jayden’s seizures. And it worked. ‘(The) first day I gave him medical marijuana, thank God. (It was) the first day he went seizure free in his life,’ Jason David said. Jayden's father, Jason, said he considered suicide because he was so distraught over his son's rare condition . The marijuana used to treat Jayden’s seizures contains a component called CBD (cannabidiol) that provides the same medical qualities as normal marijuana, but with less of a high. Jayden has been getting a few drops of the CBD a day for the last two years, And his father says the results have been nothing short of remarkable – he plays, he can walk up and down stairs and he even gives his dad high-fives. The pediatrician who prescribes the boy with the medical marijuana said he’s seeing a spike in children with autism and seizures benefitting from medical marijuana. In many cases, it works when other medications fail. Prescription pot: Jayden's pediatrician says he's seeing a spike in parents opting to treat epileptic or autistic children with marijuana . Jason says he wants to share his story to encourage other parents in similar situations to do what they think is best for their children – even if that means using medical marijuana. Jayden’s paediatrician admits that there haven’t been many studies conducted to determine the medicinal benefits of marijuana, which is why doctors have differing opinions about whether it should be used to treat certain diseases. Currently, however, researchers at the University of California-San Francisco currently are studying the affects CBD has on epileptic children. Jayden and his father will be featured in a CNN special by Dr. Sanjay Gupta that examines the benefits of medical marijuana. Gupta wrote a column earlier this week saying that after doing research for the special, he now supports using medical marijuana to treat various illnesses. He previously opposed medical marijuana. The special is set to air Sunday. Flip-flop: Dr Sanjay Gupta now supports medical marijuana after opposing it for years .","Jayden David suffers from a rare form of epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome .

Shayanna Jenkins, girlfriend of former New England Patriot and accused killer Aaron Hernandez, may have helped him dispose of the weapon that allegedly killed Odin Lloyd, newly unsealed search warrants reveal. Two recently revealed warrants authorized a search of a Bristol, Connecticut storage facility where investigators believe that Jenkins may have disposed of the gun the day after the murder occurred. Authorities connected Jenkins to the weapon with surveillance video footage that shows her carrying a lock box in which the gun may have been stored out of Hernandez's home. Shayanna Jenkins, Aaron Hernandez's girlfriend, may have helped him dispose of the alleged murder weapon. Here she is last seen during Hernandez's court appearance in July . According to The Sun Chronicle police are now looking to Jenkins as an accomplice for possibly disposing of the alleged murder weapon. Surveillance video footage shows Jenkins carrying an object which appears to be a lock box out of Hernandez's home, the paper reported. This footage of Jenkins was captured about an hour after records show she received a text message from the former pro-footballer. Former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez, who is accused of killing his friend Odin Lloyd may have instructed his girlfriend to get rid of the gun at a nearby storage facility . Investigators uncovered a storage unit at US Storage in Bristol under Jenkins name paid for by Hernandez's credit card where they believe she disposed of the gun . The video footage shows Jenkins placing the box-sized item obscured by clothing into her sister's car and returning to the house about 35 minutes later minus the box, the warrants reported by the paper attest.

Prosecutors filed charges of bomb possession against a recently crowned Utah beauty pageant winner. Kendra McKenzie Gill was arrested last weekend with three accomplices for what one described as a prank. The 18-year-olds were arrested Saturday after driving around neighborhoods and allegedly tossing plastic bottles filled with caustic chemicals at people they knew. Scroll down for video. Kendra McKenzie Gill, 18-year-old Utah beauty contest winner, was arrested on felony charges for throwing bombs . All four face the same set of four felony charges, prosecutor Blake Nakamura said. 'We don't really understand a clear reason for their behavior,' he said. 'The reason we charged them is obviously, what they possessed was indeed explosives, and we're alleging they were throwing them near homes and at people, and therefore, had the potential to cause a great deal of harm.' No one was injured in the incident. Felony bomb possession is punishable by 1 to 15 years in prison. Gill is charged with manufacturing home-made bombs which her and three other teenagers threw from a moving car and people and homes . Gill was crowned Miss Riverton, topping a slate of nine beauty contestants earlier this summer in the Salt Lake City suburb. She showed off years of piano training with a Scott Joplin number and took home a $2,000 scholarship. Others charged Friday were John Patrick Reagh, Shanna Marie Smith and Bryce Christopher Stone. All four are due to make their first court appearance together August 26 in Salt Lake City. Each has been released on $50,000 bond. The teens are charge with ten first degree felony counts including construction on an incendiary device, KUTV.com reported. Gill had just been crowned Miss Riverton and was supposed to go on to compete for the Miss Utah title before her arrest . All four teens acknowledged they were tossing bombs powered by a toilet bowl cleaner reacting with aluminum foil on sidewalks, front yards or in streets 'to scare some of their other friends,' Unified Fire Authority investigator Steve Bowen said in a court affidavit. Stone reportedly told authorities it was a prank. 'They were throwing them at both property and people,' Unified Fire Authority Capt. Clint Mecham told KUTV-TV earlier this week. 'This goes well beyond a teenage prank.' One of Gill's friends claims they were throwing the bombs as a prank, however, authorities said someone could have been gravely injured by the explosives . 'They're very caustic, very nasty. So they can cause injury to somebody . just if the chemicals get on somebody, much less the fragmentation of . the shrapnel damage that can be caused,' Mecham told the television station. 'They can very . easily cause serious harm or even death.' A Riverton pageant official didn't immediately return calls Friday on Gill's prospects for moving up in beauty competitions, or whether her title will be revoked. 'That's a local matter,' said Jean Hatch, a producer for the Miss Utah Scholarship Pageant, set for next June. Hatch said she didn't know if Gill's legal troubles would disqualify her from statewide competition.

Meetings: The summits have often been with politicians representing Prince Charles's pet issues, such as rural affairs, climate change and town planning . The full extent of Prince Charles’s influence over public life emerged last night. Since the election he has held 36 private meetings with Cabinet ministers – one a month. The summits have often been with politicians representing his pet issues, such as rural affairs, climate change, health and town planning. But critics accused him of an ‘incontinence of lobbying’. Including junior ministers, Charles has enjoyed a total of 53 private audiences since May 2010. He has met David Cameron seven times and Labour leader Ed Miliband three times. But he has only met Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, once. Last night a Clarence House spokesman insisted the Prince of Wales ‘has a right’ to ‘communicate privately’ with the government. Ministers have long complained about being bombarded with so-called ‘black-spider’ handwritten memos from Charles, in which he has expounded his view on a variety of issues. In 2005, a memo was disclosed at an employment tribunal in which Charles blamed the education system for making people ‘think they can all be pop stars’. The Prince is known for his strident views on a range of public policy areas. He has spoken out on green issues and rural affairs, and is vocal in his support for alternative medicines such as homeopathy. He also speaks out on town planning – he has sponsored a new model development in Poundbury, Dorset – and against modern architecture. In line with his interest in green issues, he has met ministers from the Department for Energy and Climate Change seven times, including secretaries of state Chris Huhne and Ed Davey. He met junior minister Greg Barker no . fewer than four times. Ministers from the Department for Environment, . Food and Rural Affairs have been called in five times. Discussions: Charles has met David Cameron (left) seven times and recently spoke to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (right) about the regulation of herbal medicines . Talks: Charles has met almost all the Cabinet, including Foreign Secretary William Hague (left) twice and Home Secretary Theresa May (right) once . On health, Charles recently met Jeremy Hunt to discuss the regulation of herbal medicines and funding for alternative medicines. He has also met four ministers from the Department for Communities and Local Government, which has responsibility for town planning and architecture. While he has met almost all the Cabinet, he has shown much less of an interest in those heading up other important departments. He has met Home Secretary Theresa May and Chancellor George Osborne just once each, and has never met a justice minister. Details of the full extent of his meetings comes after controversy over the High Court’s continuing refusal to allow the publication of letters that he has written to a range of government departments. Dialogue: Charles met with former defence secretary Liam Fox (left) once and former environment secretary Caroline Spelman (right) twice . Last night Labour MP Paul Flynn said: ‘It is not the Prince of Wales’s duty to have private meetings with ministers and be involved in the political decisions of this country. The main qualification of the job of head of state – which he will eventually be – is to be above the maelstrom of politics. 'The main qualification of the job of head of state - which he will eventually be - is to be above the maelstrom of politics' Paul Flynn, Labour MP . ‘This is an incontinence of lobbying from Prince Charles. There is a move towards transparency in lobbying in general, but this should include royal lobbying from one of the most powerful and influential men in the country. ‘Imagine what will happen when he is monarch. If there is a bill he disagrees with, will he lobby against it? If he carries on like this when he is king, it will provoke a constitutional crisis.’ Mr Flynn called for minutes of the meetings to be publicly available. ‘There is absolutely no reason for all this secrecy,’ he said. Financial matters: Charles has met both Chancellor George Osborne (left) and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander (right) just once . Summits: He has met Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith (left) once in 2011, and Education Secretary Michael Gove (right) twice, in 2010 and last October . The issue of Charles’s opinions is becoming more and more relevant because he has recently started to take on more official duties from his 87-year-old mother. He will, for example, take the place of the Queen at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Sri Lanka in November. 'The Prince of Wales has a right, indeed it is his duty, to communicate privately with the government on any matter he chooses' Clarence House spokesman . It is understood the majority of the meetings were requested by the Prince rather than the ministers concerned. Minutes are not publicly available, with both sides refusing to disclose what is discussed. The bare facts of the meetings are published on the Court Circular. A spokesman for Clarence House said: ‘Official meetings, sometimes instigated by ministers, are important to the Prince in his role as heir to the throne and ministers from successive governments have found that he brings important insights, perspectives and knowledge built over 40 years of experience in a range of areas aimed at transforming lives and building sustainable communities.’ She added: ‘The Prince of Wales has a right, indeed it is his duty, to communicate privately with the government on any matter he chooses, to bring his unique perspective and reflect the many issues people raise with him personally on his extensive engagements around the country.’","Summits often with politicians representing his pet issues, such as rural affairs and climate change .

Most of us try (loosely) to drop a few winter pounds before we head to the beach on our summer holiday, in vague effort to look a little less wobbly in a bikini. But once we're propped on a sun lounge and offered an ice cream the diet goes whizzing out the window, and we're all wolfing down second helpings of tatziki, noodles and paella before you can say 'Is today my five day or my two day?'. And it shows. Almost 80 per cent of us will gain weight during our annual break, returning home with an average 8ln of 'excess baggage', according to studies. And it takes us a month of strict dieting to lose it once we're back at work. Most people kick the diet when they go on holiday and just eat whatever they want, returning 8lbs heavier and spending a month trying to shift the excess baggage . America is the worst place for holiday . waistlines, with visitors gaining an average of 8lbs over two weeks . thanks to the country's enormous portions and all-you-can-eat buffets . Only an extremely self-restrained four per cent of Brits say they pay attention to the nutritional content of the food they eat on holiday, and although 93 per cent of us attempt to eat local cuisine, barely any consider to check its nutritional value. Nearly three quarters of travellers confess to tucking into holiday favourites such as rib eye steak, moussaka, pizza and Peking duck without a care. And 79 per cent of us gain weight as a result. But rather than China or Italy, America is the worst place for holiday waistlines, with visitors gaining an average of 8lbs over two weeks thanks to the country's enormous portions and all-you-can-eat buffets, an amount that will take most people a month to lose. Not far behind the USA, the neighbouring Caribbean is also one of the worst offenders, with its all-inclusive resorts securing second spot in a 'holiday fat map': those questioned gained on average 7.4lb on their trip. France and Italy, with their wines, cheeses, creamy sauces and pasta are listed as the third and fourth, with Francophiles gaining 7.3lb while abroad and Italian food-lovers a round 7lb. Despite most of us trying to drop some winter bulge before getting into the dreaded bikini, we tend to bin the diet as soon as we get to our holiday destination . Only an extremely self-restrained four . per cent of Brits say they pay attention to the nutritional content of . the food they eat on holiday, though 93 per cent of us attempt to . eat local cuisine . The studies by Flora pro.activ and Obesimed blamed larger portions for putting on weight and the same number said it was down to 'lounging around'. Tanya Footman, senior nutrition and health manager at Flora pro.activ told Waitrose Weekend magazine: 'It is amazing just how much hard work people put in to being healthy before they go away - and then once on holiday they don't give it a second thought.' She added that there were some easy ways to avoid cholesterol-busting dishes abroad such as limiting deep-fried food and creamy sauces and asking for dressings, butter and sour cream on the side. A separate study revealed that of the 42 per cent of people who said they dieted before a trip abroad, two thirds have piled the pounds back on by the end of the vacation.","Almost 80% of us ditch the diet as soon as we go on holiday .

Phone companies in South Africa have taken to disguising the controversial masts so they fit into suburban streets. Blending in: Phone companies in South Africa disguise cellphone masts as trees to make them fit in . Surroundings: The masts are disguised as trees native to the area . Pioneering: The idea was first developed in South Africa in 1996 when a mast was turned into a palm . Photographer Dillon Marsh has created a series of some of the camouflaged towers erected around Cape Town. Called 'Invasive Species', the collections shows the lengths telecommunications companies have gone to make residents feel comfortable with having the masts so near to their homes. Mr Marsh said: 'A palm tree appeared almost overnight in a suburb of Cape Town. 'This was supposedly one of the world's first ever disguised cell phone tower.

The photographer said it took six months to complete the work. He said: 'There were already a wide variety of designs by the time I started photographing. 'The designs loosely mimic trees that are found in the local environment.' According to Wired, the world's first Palm Pole Tower was developed in the mid-1990s by Ivo Branislav Lazic of South African telecommunications company Brolaz Projects and his colleague Aubrey Trevor Thomas.

National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden's father has secured documents to visit his son in Russia and plans to discuss how he could fight espionage charges, Lon Snowden and his attorney said Sunday. Neither Lon Snowden nor his attorney Bruce Fein has spoken directly with the former NSA analyst since he fled the United States and received asylum in Russia, they said. But the father and lawyer also said they look forward to meeting with Edward Snowden to consider options for the leaker to return to the United States at some point. ""As a father, I want my son to come home if I believe that the justice system ... is going to be applied correctly,"" Lon Snowden said. Scroll down for video . Travelin' man: Lon Snowden will soon visit son Edward in Russia, it will be the first time he's spoken to his son since the former NSA analyst began leaking NSA secrets earlier this year . But the elder Snowden isn't convinced his son would get a fair hearing in court, given what he called ""absolutely irresponsible"" descriptions of his son's actions from President Barack Obama, his administration and top lawmakers from both parties. ""They have poisoned the well, so to speak, in terms of a potential jury pool,"" said Lon Snowden, of Allentown, Pa. Edward Snowden roiled the United States intelligence agencies and upended US relations around the globe with his disclosures of highly classified programs that allow the United States to collect millions of pieces of data, including Americans' phone records. The government has charged him with violations of the Espionage Act in federal court in Alexandria, Va. Persona non grata: US President Barack Obama cancelled plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin after the country granted Snowden asylum . Fein said the family is willing to discuss conditions under which Edward Snowden might return to the United States and perhaps face criminal proceedings. Fein added that he plans to ""suggest criminal defense attorneys who've got experience with criminal Espionage Act prosecutions"" when he meets with Snowden. Edward Snowden's whereabouts in Russia remain unknown. The timing of the visit from Lon Snowden and Fein was uncertain; both declined to elaborate. Last week, Edward Snowden's Russian lawyer said he had sent Lon Snowden the required invitation to visit the country, a step toward securing a travel visa. Anatoly Kucherena said he hoped a visit would happen in the coming days. Fein says the trip would happen ""very soon."" Asylum granted: Edward Snowden and his team walk out of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport August 1 after the fugitive was granted asylum in Russia . Russia's decision to grant Edward Snowden temporary asylum angered the U.S. government and scuttled Obama's plans for a one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in visit Moscow next month. Lon Snowden said the political outrage in Washington would fade and added ""the American people are absolutely unhappy with what they've learned - and more is going to be forthcoming."" ""Where my son chooses to live the rest of his life is going to be his decision. But I would like at some point in time for him to be able to come back to the U.S.,"" Lon Snowden said.

Katie Price is preparing to give birth to her fourth child earlier than expected after suffering complications during her pregnancy. The model, 35, has spent the past two weeks on bed rest after being rushed to hospital while on holiday on the continent. The mother-of-three is only 32 weeks along, so doctors have warned her she is likely to give birth early via Caesarean section. Stressful: Katie Price, pictured with husband Kieran Hayler in London on July 9, has been rushed to hospital on the continent . Speaking about her drama, Katie told The Sun: 'My . baby was in danger, but between the medical staff here and my doctor in . London, I am in good hands and have to believe all will be well.' Katie had been told the amniotic sac - a bag of fluid inside the womb - had torn, meaning her waters had broken early and her unborn child was at risk of becoming infected by the transfer of the bacteria. However, doctors believe the baby will be fine, although it is expected to arrive earlier than expected. Katie added: 'I just want my baby out so I can meet it and hold it in my arms. I will feel much safer knowing it is in an incubator. Difficult pregnancy: The model said her fourth pregnancy has been the most difficult . 'Doctors have told me they want to keep the baby inside me for as long as possible, but they've told me they want to perform a Caesarean.' The baby drama began after the star travelled for 27 hours in her horsebox following a mix-up over her children's passports. Katie was forced to cancel her booking at a Spanish villa after her ex-husband Peter Andre and his girlfriend Emily MacDonagh - who are expecting their first child together - 'forgot' to send over passports for son Junior, eight, and daughter Princess, six, making them 'abandon' their plans. Not wanting to let her children down, Katie explained she decided to wait for their passports and then travel around Europe in her horsebox - meaning they had been on the road for a staggering 27 hours by the time they reached their destination. Mix-up: The baby drama began after Katie travelled for 27 hours in her horsebox following a mix-up over her children's passports with ex-husband Peter Andre and his pregnant girlfriend Emily MacDonagh . While her husband Kieran Hayler has remained by her side during Katie's stay, her brother Daniel flew to visit her on Thursday and to bring her children Princess and Junior back to the UK so they could go on holiday with their father Peter to Australia. After spending the last fortnight holed up in the European hospital, Katie explained while the staff are 'great', she feels like she is 'in prison' and is hoping she won't have to stay at the facility for too much longer. Tough time: Katie had a much better pregnancy with son Junior, from her former marriage to Peter Andre . The model has made no secret of the fact her current pregnancy has been her most difficult yet and she has gained more weight than when she carried her previous children. She wrote in her Sun column recently: 'I haven't got long to go now. I've got a date and I know the sex but no one knows yet - and this time I'm huge. 'I'm the biggest I've been for all of my pregnancies. I'm 11st already, whereas I was not even ten-and-a-half full-term with the others.' As well as weight gain, Katie has also been very uncomfortable, suffering from anaemia and low platelets. Katie and Kieran wed in front of just a few people in the Bahamas on January 16 after getting engaged after Christmas - just two months after she ended her 20 month on/off romance with Argentine model Leandro Penna. In February, Katie announced she was pregnant with her fourth child. Her surprise pregnancy comes after failed IVF attempts to start a family with Leandro and second ex-husband Alex Reid. She started dating Alex just a few months after splitting from first husband Peter Andre, but left him in January 2011 after 11 months of marriage. She also had a 20 month on/off romance and subsequent engagement with Leandro, but they never made it down the aisle. Katie's representative confirmed to the MailOnline that the model and baby 'are stable at the moment'.","Spent 27 hours travelling in her HORSEBOX prior to hospital dash .

'Confused': Senior Labour figures have warned Ed Miliband to 'get a grip' or lose the next Election . Ed Miliband is being warned by senior Labour figures to ‘get a grip’ on his party or risk throwing away the party’s chances at the next Election. Criticism of the Labour leader’s ‘slumbering’ summer performance was led by a senior frontbencher who told The Mail on Sunday it was ‘bonkers’. While Mr Miliband has been invisible for the past two weeks while on holiday in France, David Cameron has kept up an energetic schedule of media appearances. Senior Shadow Ministers say Mr Miliband’s ‘confused’ leadership has left them unable to step into the breach – because they don’t know what line they should be taking. And health spokesman Andy Burnham yesterday openly warned that Labour had to ‘shout louder’ or risk losing the Election. Pro-Miliband figures then added to the rancour by briefing that Mr Burnham was ‘trying to save his job’ ahead of an expected reshuffle next month. He is regarded as vulnerable because Labour has been unable to land blows on the Government over the NHS. Mr Miliband returns to the UK this weekend with just five weeks until his crunch speech at the Labour conference. The senior frontbencher who spoke to the MoS said that the party’s apparent decision to leave the field open to the Tories in the quiet summer weeks was astonishing. The MP said: ‘It is completely bonkers. Everyone needs a break but we’ve had virtually no one in the Shadow Cabinet taking the fight to Cameron since the Commons rose for the summer holidays. ‘It’s very frustrating. And it’s going to make it that much harder when we come back for the party conference season.’ On the go: While Mr Miliband has been invisible for the past two weeks while on holiday in France, David Cameron has kept up an energetic schedule of media appearances . And a Labour backbencher called Mr Miliband’s approach ‘quite bizarre’. He said: ‘Miliband appears to think he can make one big speech here and another a few weeks later, and that’ll do the job. It won’t. It’s almost a 1950s view of politics.’ Plea: Health spokesman Andy Burnham yesterday openly warned that Labour had to 'shout louder' or risk losing the Election . The backbencher added: ‘No one has ever told me they’re voting Labour because of Miliband. They used to say they were voting for us because of our leader but that’s when we had Tony Blair.’ Another party figure added: ‘Ed Miliband’s team seem to have spent their entire time rowing over whether to hire a new spin doctor. Half of them have objected to the name they have in mind. That’s the sum total of their achievement.’ Labour MPs are deeply worried as their lead over the Tories has narrowed from an average of 11 points in March to five points in July. The party’s poll woes coincided with figures showing the economy returning to life – to the delight of No 10. Doubts over Mr Miliband surfaced ten days ago when senior Labour backbencher George Mudie said his party looked ‘slightly hesitant and confused’ while the Coalition was ‘making the weather on welfare, health and education’. However, backers of Mr Miliband last night dismissed the disquiet as ‘summer froth’. One said: ‘The fact remains that we’re still ahead of the Tories in the polls and there’s no prospect of Cameron winning a majority at the next Election.’","A senior frontbencher described Labour's 'slumbering' summer as 'bonkers'

The New York Post reported that In 2009, he crashed his plane into the Columbia River in Washington state with his 84-year-old mother on board. In a Facebook post last year, the 54-year-old father of three joked about having to buy another plane 'to replace the one that turned out not to be amphibious.' Henningsgaard blamed the crash on engine failure, explaining in a blog entry that 10 minutes into the flight, the plane motor 'coughed briefly' and then died seconds later. ‘The plane was starting to pitch forward, being pulled toward the bottom by the heavy engine, causing the wing we were standing on to start to tilt,’ he wrote. ‘When the plane went nose-down, we’d be in the water. I’d like to tell you I felt brave and confident at that moment, that I knew we’d make it. He went on to say that he felt fear of ‘exhaustion and panic and very possibly death as we tried for shore.

At present it is illegal to test for HIV at home and read the result yourself, although people can take a sample themselves, send it off for testing in a laboratory and receive the result at a later date. Now a change in the law will mean a saliva test will quickly give the user a ‘negative’ or a ‘positive indication’ result. The Health Protection Agency says the number of people in the UK with the virus is at a record level of nearly 100,000.

Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National AIDS Trust, said: 'With around 25,000 people in the UK living with HIV without knowing it, it is vital that we offer as many options as possible to take an HIV test.

A British fortune teller, who set out from Sussex to seek her own fortune when she was in her late teens, has been found naked and dead in a seedy rented room in Vietnam. Julia Anne Jay, 43, had been renting the room in Saigon, also known as Ho Chi Minh City, since January as she plied her trade as a fortune teller in the nearby streets. But police have been called to the hotel, located in an alley in the city’s backpacker district, after the staff broke into her room on the second floor and found her body in the initial stages of decomposition. Tragic fate: British fortune teller Julia Anne Jay, aged 43, was found dead in her hotel room in Ho Chi Minh City . Although there were no obvious signs . of foul play, police, confirming Miss Jay had been dead for several . days, said they were continuing their investigations. It is believed Miss Jay is the same . woman who set out from her English home in her late teens to travel . through South East Asia, working her way as she went. In recent months she has been a . familiar figure in scarfs and traditional dress, earning what she can in . the Pha Ngu Lao district of the city by turning over her tarot cards . and reading palms of people in the street. In a recent interview with the . ex-patriate magazine AsiaLife, she said she had first learned the ways . of a fortune teller at the age of eight from a friend of her adopted . grandmother. Then, in her late teens, she set off from Sussex for the far east, where she has spent most of her life. She bought precious stones and silver . in India and sold them in Greece, where a friend gave her a pack of . tarot cards, she told the magazine. Then she travelled back to the far . east, setting up in Bali where she ran a guesthouse for 10 years and . spent large amounts of time meditating. She said of her fortune-telling skills: ‘I believe I’m 100 per cent accurate. I wouldn’t be doing it if I weren’t.’ While most of her clients in recent . times have been Vietnamese - many have hired her to go to their homes - . she has told fortunes for Western tourists. Popular destination: Ben Tranh market in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, is a regular hotspot for backpackers . Holiday resort: Many visitors to the country head for Ho Chi Minh. Julia Anne Jay had been renting a room there since January . Sometimes, she told the magazine, a . 15-minute reading might turn into an emotional two or three-hour . sessions ending with the customer in tears. On one occasion, she recalled, a henchman for a local mafia ‘godfather’ came to search her out to set up a session for his boss. ‘Afterwards he (the Mafioso) ordered . loads of beer and insisted on me staying there,’ she told the magazine. ‘Then I asked the translator “He’s happy with me, right?” and he said . “Yes, he loves you.

Stroll: New Bank of England Governor Mark Carney strolls through the crowds at the Wilderness festival in Oxfordshire with his wife Diana . In his lilac polo shirt, crumpled shorts and suede loafers, new Bank of England Governor Mark Carney was wearing the burdens of office remarkably lightly at the weekend. The dressed-down 48-year-old made fixing the economy look like a walk in the park as he strolled through the crowds at a music festival in Oxfordshire with his wife Diana. At one point he lay back on the grass with his hands behind his head and seemed to be doing a stretching exercise as he listened to a band. The Canadian’s casual outfit might have come straight from the David Cameron guide to chillaxing. The Prime Minister was spotted in similar attire on holiday in Portugal last month. With hopeful signs on the economy and the best summer weather for years, Mr Carney could perhaps be forgiven for making the most of his time off. He was at the Wilderness festival in the 1,700-acre grounds of the Cornbury Park estate near Bicester. Known as ‘Poshstock’, the festival is an hour’s drive from the Carneys’ £15,000-a-month taxpayer-funded West London home, and features a luxury spa, gourmet food and heated yurts. Unlike the rest of the 15,000 revellers enjoying the £146-a-head festival this weekend, the Carneys were not glamping under the stars, but staying in the manor house itself - the home of Mrs Carney’s sister, Lady Tania Rotherwick. The 17th-century building is the ancestral seat of Robin Cayzer, the 3rd Baron Rotherwick, a Conservative hereditary peer who married Tania in 2000. The Rotherwicks famously play host to the powerful Oxfordshire set including David and Samantha Cameron - who have attended festivals at Cornbury Park in the past - and Andy Coulson, Rebekah Brooks, Jeremy Clarkson and Alex James.

Headlining on stage were folk singer Martha Wainwright, piano man of the moment Tom Odell and rock band Noah and the Whale. Mr Carney - who last week criticised self-obsessed bankers who are so detached from reality have become ‘socially useless’ - met his wife Diana when he was studying for his doctorate at Oxford University. She is an outspoken economist and environmental campaigner who was born in Cheltenham to a pig farmer and attended £31,000-a-year Marlborough College in Wiltshire. Mr Carney, a former £1million-a-year Goldman Sachs banker, was poached by Chancellor George Osborne from the Bank of Canada for a five-year term. He was lured from Canada with an £874,000 pay packet - about £100,000 more than predecessor Sir Mervyn King earned - which includes a £250,000-a-year housing allowance, or £4,800 a week. After tax, it works out as £11,041 a month towards his rent which is believed to be nearly £15,000 per month. The two younger Carney children have enrolled in a local junior school and the elder two are going to different secondary schools - all fee-paying establishments which will cost their parents £18,970 per term. Last week, in an unprecedented action of ‘forward guidance’, Mr Carney confirmed interest rates would be held at their current record low of 0.5 per cent for the next three years or more - spelling more pain for savers until at least 2016.","Mark Carney, 48, was at Wilderness festival in Oxfordshire with wife Diana .

Hunt: Paranoid schizophrenic and convicted murderer Daniel Rosenthal, 58, has been found in Southampton this morning after going missing from a mental health hospital . One of Britain’s most brutal murderers who hacked both his mother and . father to death has been found in Southampton today after he escaped from a mental health . hospital. Paranoid schizophrenic Daniel Rosenthal, 58,  was last seen at 2.30pm yesterday taking 'a routine unsupervised walk around the gardens' of Tatchbury Mount Hospital, Totton. His disappearance sparked a huge police manhunt with members of the public warned not to approach him. But Hampshire Police said today that the killer was found in Southampton this morning. A police spokesman said: 'Daniel Rosenthal was located in Southampton around . 11am this morning and has returned to Tatchbury Mount Hospital. 'Police would like to thank members of the public and the media for their assistance with enquiries into his whereabouts.' Rosenthal, 58, was dubbed the ‘mad scientist’ when he was jailed for life . in 1981 after dismembering his mother’s body with a hacksaw. A court . heard he hacked his father to death in France and dumped his body near . Paris before returning to the family home in Hampshire to kill his . mother. Rosenthal is a patient at Tatchbury Mount Hospital which is on the edge of the New Forest in Totton, near Southampton. The hospital, run by Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, is just 15 miles from the family home in Hedge End, near Southampton, where he brutally killed his mother. After he was found this morning, Dr Julian Lewis, Tory MP for New Forest East, questioned why Rosenthal was given the freedom of taking unsupervised walks. He said: 'Whilst it is a relief that this man has been found, it is disturbing that someone regarded as a danger to the public - who should not be approached - was allowed to go for unsupervised walks.' Rosenthal was locked up after Winchester . Crown Court heard he hacked his father Milton to death in Paris, then . hid the body in a British bin bag in a forest 100 miles from the French . capital. He then returned to England and killed . his 60 year old mother, Leah Rosenthal, cutting up her body with a . hacksaw at their house. Missing: Rosenthal, 58, was last seen at 2.30pm yesterday taking 'a routine unsupervised walk around the gardens' of Tatchbury Mount Hospital, Totton, pictured . Her body was never found and police believe her remains were unwittingly carted off by dustmen. He could not be charged with the murder of his father. Rosenthal was dubbed ‘the mad scientist’ because of weird experiments he carried out on chicken eggs and embryos in a ‘lab’ he built in the living room. He claimed to be a ‘genius’ and would leave bloodied feathers and chicken remains - the remnants of his bizarre experiments - in bags for the dustmen. The home in Hedge End was finally sold for £50,000 in 1994 and Rosenthal collected a sum of £16,000 despite serving a life sentence. At the time a spokesman for the . solicitors’ firm dealing with his mother’s will said they hoped he would . never be able to spend the money. She added: 'Our worst nightmare is of Daniel Rosenthal on the streets again.' Killer: Rosenthal, 58, was dubbed the 'mad scientist' when he was jailed for life in 1981 after dismembering his mother's body with a hacksaw. He also hacked his father to death . Speaking earlier today, Hampshire Police spokesman Julie Knight said today: 'We are conducting an ongoing, extensive search for Daniel Rosenthal. 'He is considered potentially dangerous and a risk to the public. 'Police are urging members of the public to report any sightings of him by calling 999 and should not approach him.

Confidence among firms has risen to its highest level in five years as Britain leads its main rivals on the road to recovery. The optimism of company bosses is backed by figures indicating that the UK is outpacing Germany, France, Japan, the US and even China. Both sets of results will be a major fillip to Chancellor George Osborne who has declared that the economy has moved from ‘rescue to recovery’. Road to recovery: Results will be a major fillip to Chancellor George Osborne, left, but also cheered by Prime Minister David Cameron, right, who has talked repeatedly about being in a 'global race' David Cameron will also be cheered as the Prime Minister has talked repeatedly about being in a ‘global race’. The bullish prognosis for Britain comes from a survey of global economies by US banking giant JP Morgan and analysts Markit. Their examination of services and manufacturing shows activity in these crucial sectors grew at its fastest pace for 16 years in July, even beating China. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ‘The UK is showing stronger growth at the start of the third quarter than America and its eurozone competitors. ‘Although there have been some signs of stabilisation in the eurozone, it is still hovering around the stagnation mark.’ The comments underline official figures which show the recovery is gathering pace in Britain. The economy grew 0.6 per cent in the three months to the end of June, double that in the first quarter of 2013. There has also been a flurry of positive data in recent weeks, with strong growth in car sales, manufacturing and house prices. These signs of revival have cheered bosses, with a closely watched report showing that confidence is at its highest level since the worst of the financial crisis in 2008. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development analysis shows that employers expect to hire more staff this quarter – which would help to make it the sixth consecutive quarter of jobs growth. It also shows that the net employment balance – which measures the difference between the proportion of employers who expect to increase staffing levels and the proportion who expect to cut jobs – has hit 14 in the second quarter. This marks an increase from nine in the first three months of the year. Mark Beatson, CIPD chief economist, said: ‘These results suggest we should see further jobs growth over the summer and autumn, and hopefully reflect a degree of optimism about growth prospects.’ The decline in British wages is the fourth worst in the EU since the downturn began, according to official figures. Workers here have endured more savage cuts to their wages than even the Cypriots. Figures from the House of Commons library show average hourly wages have fallen 5.5 per cent since mid-2010, adjusted for inflation. This marks the fourth biggest decline out of the EU’s 27 members since 2008.British workers saw their salaries fall almost twice as steeply as those in Cyprus, which received a bailout from Europe in March. Only Greek, Portuguese and Dutch workers have fared worse. Hourly wages in Germany rose by 2.7 per cent in the past three years. Experts have warned there is little to suggest that salaries will rise soon. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said a third of British workers who stayed in the same job endured a wage cut or freeze between 2010 and 2011. Last night the Treasury said it has taken 2.7 million people out of income tax by raising personal allowances to £10,000. A spokesman said: ‘The economy is on the mend, but we appreciate that times are still tough for families.’ Details of wage levels emerged as  official figures are expected to confirm that inflation remains well above the Bank of England’s 2 per cent target. The Consumer Prices Index is set to show prices up 2.8 per cent in July after a 14-month high of 2.9 per cent in June. However, the economic crisis has taken . its toll on pay packets, with wages in the UK recording one of the . largest falls in the European Union, official figures show. Mr Beatson warned: ‘There is little . sign of improved confidence about employment prospects feeding through . into pay expectations, which remain below the rate of inflation. ‘Clearly employers feel they do not . need to raise pay to meet recruitment goals and, with turnover low, . retention is unlikely to be a pressing issue for most organisations.’ Yesterday Shadow Treasury Minister . Chris Leslie said: ‘Despite indications the economy is improving, the . reality is that most ordinary people are struggling to stand still. ‘Even those who have not seen a cut . in their wages are seeing the pound in their pocket shrink in value . because of high inflation.’","Chancellor has declared that the economy has moved from ‘rescue to recovery’

Yahoo's recently completed acquisition of Internet blogging service Tumblr includes an $81 million payment to Tumblr founder David Karp as long as he remains on the job for the next four years. The retention payment disclosed in a regulatory filing Thursday is part of the windfall that Karp and Tumblr investors realized by agreeing to sell the service for $1.1 billion in May. Karp turned 27 last month. He started Tumblr in 2007, a few years after he dropped out of high school in New York to concentrate on computer programming. Rollin' in it: David Karp continues to cash in on the micro-blogging platform that has made him a millionaire several hundred times over . Yahoo Inc. CEO Marissa Mayer has pledged not to make any dramatic changes at Tumblr in hopes that the acquisition won't alienate the blogging service's existing users, which includes a substantial number of teenagers and young adults. As part of her promise 'to not screw it up,' Mayer is allowing Karp to run Tumblr independently in New York. Yahoo is based in Sunnyvale, Calif. Karp is believed to own a 20 to 25 percent stake in Tumblr, which means he probably has already received a windfall, which hasn't been disclosed, from the sale to Yahoo. But he must stay at Tumblr until June 2017 under the provision disclosed Thursday to get the $81 million retention payment. Yahoo! bought Tumblr from Karp in May for $1.1billion .

Mothers who stay at home to look after their children have criticised plans to allow working families earning up to £300,000 to enjoy tax-free childcare. The scheme, which would be available to up to 2.5million families where both parents work, would let them claim back 20 per cent of childcare costs. But the 1.2million parents who stay home will not get a penny. Ministers claim that restricting the scheme to those in a lower tax band would exclude middle-earner families and would raise administrative costs. Stay at home: 1.2million parents will miss out on help with childcare costs. Campaigners said the proposals ignored the cost and work required to stay at home and raise children . But Laura Perrins, of the campaign group Mothers at Home Matter, said this argument ignored the ‘cost and dedication involved in raising children’. Mrs Perrins, a barrister who gave up work to look after her two children, attacked the Government’s focus on helping families where both parents work. Such families have been offered up to £1,200 per child under five, but Mrs Perrins said this discriminates against traditional families who have only one income. She was backed by Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who said yesterday that the Government’s policy was ‘nonsensical’. He accused ministers of behaving as if ‘the real economic enemy isn’t the failure to cut red tape and empower small- and medium-sized businesses, but seems to be the concept of the traditional family where one parent ... goes out to work while the other brings up the children.’ George Osborne said last week that he had ‘huge respect’ for parents who stayed at home, but was accused of being ‘patronising’ when he said they had made a ‘lifestyle choice’. 'Patronising': George Osborne said raising children at home is a lifestyle choice'. Campaigners said the proposal discriminates against traditional families who have only one income . Mrs Perrins said the figure of £300,000 per family, which is under consultation, is a ‘grossly unfair measure in austerity Britain’. ‘George Osborne defended the limit on administrative and cost grounds, saying that to set it at the lower tax band would exclude middle-earner families,’ she said. ‘The Chancellor was disingenuous in his explanation, as even a limit of £40,000 would result in families earning up to £80,000 benefiting from the scheme. This is well above the cut-off for child benefit, which was set at £60,000. ‘These limits reek of political point scoring. Mr Osborne clearly doesn’t want to exclude his party’s key voters from benefiting from his proposals.’ Marie Peacock, chairman of Mothers at Home Matter, said subsidised childcare should go to those on around the average income of £26,500, not ‘ten times that amount’.","Proposed scheme would let working parents claim back 20per cent of childcare costs .

A 34-year-old businessman was facing financial ruin today after he lost almost £90,000 - including £48,000 in legal fees - despite winning £1,000 in an action against a Porsche car dealership. Model shop owner Damian Markland, of Preston, Lancashire, was hoping to get £40,000 when he sued over costly engine repairs and mechanical mistakes to his 911 car. But after a six-year legal battle a court eventually awarded Mr Markland just £998 - less than half the £2,500 the garage offered him as an out of court settlement just one year ago. Expensive battles: Model shop owner Damian Markland, 34, of Preston, Lancashire, was hoping to get £40,000 when he sued over costly engine repairs and mechanical mistakes to his 911 car . Although he won his case, because Mr Markland turned down the higher offer, he found himself liable under the law for the £34,000 costs of the garage’s lawyers plus his lawyer’s fees of £14,000. His total bill also includes the £35,000 repair work and £6,000 in car rental fees. Mr Markland said he will now have to sell his shop and the car - which is now in good working order - to pay off the fees. In making his ruling one of Britain’s top judges said he had ‘every sympathy’ with the businessman - who could also lose his home - and admitted he had got ‘his fingers burnt very badly.’ Mr Markland said: ‘I feel like I’ve been screwed over twice - once by Porsche and then by the lawyers and the British legal system. It seems the only people who win in these things are the lawyers. ‘I might have won around £1,000 but in my eyes I haven’t won at all. There were four parts to my claim and I lost the biggest one which was all the main money from the engine and around £40,000. ‘I fought this thing for six years and following this I have lost faith in the justice system. The court system has let me down and to add insult to injury the solicitor fees just topped everything off. 'To me that’s really wrong, it’s terrible. It was the final insult. I have always had faith in the justice system but now I don’t. It’s been a horrible experience which I wouldn’t have expected in buying my dream car - and it has ruined my life and my business. Paperwork: After a six-year legal battle a court eventually awarded Mr Markland just £998 - less than half the £2,500 the garage offered him as an out of court settlement just one year ago . ‘I feel like I’m being punished as a guilty man yet I’m the one who is not guilty of anything. This whole business has seriously messed my life up. ‘My shop is now up for sale which I have worked hard to make a success with me working six days a week - all so I could buy my dream car. ‘I’ve worked hard and now my business is going to go under all because of these costs.’ Mr Markland had bought the second-hand Porsche 911 GT3 MK1, which had 25,000 miles on the clock, for £48,000 in 2007. Despite it having a full Porsche service history the luxury car began experience technical problems and he took it to the Porsche Centre Bolton, operated by Pendragon Sabre. Mechanics were asked to resolve problems including power steering failure, a loss of power and the engine repeatedly cutting out. Mr Markland also ordered new tyres, a new clutch and a full service to bring the car into ‘the best possible condition.’ But during the course of the rebuild only one of the 12 cam shaft followers was replaced and the failure of a further component led to the engine later seizing and suffering ‘catastrophic failure’. Behind the wheel: Mr Markland had bought the second-hand Porsche 911 GT3 MK1, which had 25,000 miles on the clock, for £48,000 in 2007 . When he took the car to another garage, . it emerged that the tyres had been put on the wrong way round and . mechanics failed to connect the throttle cable to the engine properly. Mr Markland decided to fork out £25,000 of his own money for an engine rebuild on the understanding that he would get the money back through warranty agreements. 'It's been a horrible experience which I wouldn't have expected in buying my dream car - and it has ruined my life and my business' Damian Markland . But he sued for £40,000 when he got it back, only to find it was not covered after all. In . November last year at Lancashire County Court a judge ruled Pendragon . had breached its contract in respect of the tyres, throttle and steering . but awarded Mr Markland damages of £998.98. He warned Mr Markland would liable for Pendragon’s costs as he had declined the out of court settlement offer in 2011. Lawyers acting on behalf of Porsche said Mr Markland told mechanics to cut costs when rebuilding the engine of his high powered sports car and claimed the engine had failed when he overrevved it. Money troubles: Mr Markland said he will now have to sell his model shop (pictured) and the car - which is now in good working order - to pay off the fees . Mr Markland appealed at London’s Civil Appeal Court but his plea was turned down last month. Lord Justice Longmore expressed sympathy for him, but said his appeal stood no reasonable prospect of success and he would only be exposing him to the risk of yet bigger costs bills if he allowed his case to go any further. 'I am afraid that you got your fingers burned very badly and I'm sorry about that' Lord Justice Longmore . The judge said: ‘It is terrible that you feel that you have not been properly served by the system. But, while having every sympathy for you, it is impossible to see that there was any error of law in the judge’s decision. ‘It is, I fear, pointless to grant permission to appeal. I fear I would not be doing you any favours if I were to do that. I know it is galling, but I hope that you can put this matter behind you. ‘I am afraid that you got your fingers burned very badly and I’m sorry about that.’","Damian Markland wanted £40,000 when he sued over repair blunders .

Prime minister Mariano Rajoy refused to back down in the dispute over the Rock as ten Royal Navy warships prepare to set sail for the Mediterranean.

In talks: Illegal immigrants living in 'beds in sheds' are desperate to leave Britain and return home, Gurmel Singh-Kandola, secretary-general of the Sikh Council, has said . Illegal immigrants living in ‘beds in sheds’ are desperate to leave Britain and return home, an ethnic minority leader says. Gurmel Singh-Kandola, secretary-general of the Sikh Council, said many arrivals from India who had entered the country unlawfully were stuck here, unable to work, and wanted help from the Home Office to go back. His support for a ‘voluntary returns process’ echoes Home Office efforts to persuade some of the estimated one million illegal immigrants in Britain to leave of their own accord. His organisation is now in talks with the department over how migrants with no right to remain might contact officials  for help to return voluntarily. His remarks are in stark contrast to the fury provoked by the poster campaign among human rights advocates, refugee groups and left-wing politicians. The posters were mounted on vans driven around parts of London, and stating: ‘In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest.’ A text number was provided for advice and help with travel documents. An investigation into whether they were ‘offensive and irresponsible’ was launched yesterday by the Advertising  Standards Authority. The watchdog said it had  received 60 complaints about the posters including that they were ‘reminiscent of slogans used by  racist groups to attack immigrants in the past’. Mr Singh-Kandola believes the message behind the posters could have been delivered ‘more softly’. ‘If it said something like, “If you want to go home contact this number” or “assistance is available to return home” I think it would have been the same message but delivered more softly,’ he said. Many from the Punjab and Delhi were stuck here, impoverished and unable to work, he said. Controversial: This poster campaign caused fury among human rights advocates, refugee groups and left-wing politicians . ‘Their plight is well known; they are sleeping very rough under bridges and in multiple occupancies, sometimes in sheds in the back of people’s gardens. 'We have been quite concerned about the abject poverty in which they are  living. Many of them have been trafficked by unscrupulous agents who take a lot of money from them.’ Many illegal immigrants destroyed their passport once they arrived in the country,  Mr Singh-Kandola said, making it difficult for them to go home even if they wanted to. It could take six or seven months to get replacement documents  papers from the Indian consulate, he said. The Home Office could help them obtain a new passport quickly and buy them a flight home. ‘Our discussions have been for those who want to go back home to facilitate that process in a humane and generous way.’ He said illegal immigrants were victims of ‘hype’ which led them to believe they could live and work in Britain once they arrived. ‘In fact they are stuck. They want to go home on a voluntary basis and what we need is processes to facilitate that.’ Raid: An Uzbekistani man who is said to have . overstayed his visa was detained by UK Border Agency officers in a raid . on a busy central London restaurant on Thursday . Officials said the £10,000 cost of the poster campaign would pay for itself if just one migrant returned home because of the cost of enforced removals. Yesterday, Eric Pickles became the first senior Tory to raise doubts about the use of the vans, and said they should be rolled-out nationwide only if it could be proved they work. The Communities Secretary said: ‘I will be looking at that evidence. I need to see some very persuasive evidence that this should be passed out nationally. If something like this has to happen it needs to be evidence-based.’ The Communities Secretary is cracking down on traveller sites which ‘trash’ the countryside, with new guidance to councils on removing illegal camps. Prepared: The UK Border Agency sent three vans to Soho to seize the employee . Mr Pickles said £60million was being made available to local authorities to help them act more quickly to shut down unauthorised encampments. He told ITV’s Daybreak: ‘We inherited a situation where the number of illegal sites had gone up four-fold and what we expect them to do is obey the law like you and I do. ‘The idea that this is somehow an attack on the traveller community is not true. This is a very good deal for travellers.’ His department hopes the guidance will give local residents a stronger voice in getting authorities to take action against illegal camps, and prevent incidents like the £7million clear-out of Dale Farm in 2011 after a 10-year wrangle.","Gurmel Singh-Kandola said many illegal arrivals from India were stuck here .

When Lee Gardner rushed to hospital after vomiting blood and suffering debilitating stomach cramps he feared the worst. But doctors in Barnsley were left stunned when they discovered a nine-inch fork in the man’s stomach and incredibly it had been there for more than a decade. The baffled medics were even more confused when they found the piece of cutlery as Mr Gardner, 40, admitted he had completely forgotten swallowing it. Incredible: Doctors were left stunned when they discovered a nine-inch fork in Lee Gardner's stomach . A decade ago doctors had said that the whole fork would pass through his system naturally, so he assumed that it had gone. But in fact it was still completely intact and sitting at the bottom of his tummy. He has now made a full recovery. 'I had been vomiting blood, and when they were looking inside me with the camera the doctor said: ""Are you sure you’ve not swallowed anything?"",' he said. 'I said no but when he said: ""Are you sure, I can see prongs of what appears to be a fork?"" - I remembered accidentally swallowing one years and years ago. 'I couldn’t believe it. I have never had any problems with my stomach, except once a couple of years ago I remember thinking I felt like something had lodged when I bent over awkwardly. Painful: Lee rushed to hospital in severe pain, and bizarrely had forgotten he swallowed a whole piece of cutlery . 'But the advice when I swallowed it from the doctor was that it would just pass through my system and as that was so many years before I really didn’t think it could be the fork.' Mr Gardner remembered messing about with a plastic fork in his mouth years earlier - when he gagged and accidentally swallowed it. Doctors at Barnsley Hospital used a camera to look inside his stomach for a cause when they stumbled across the ‘mystery’ object. Images showed the fork head was resting in Lee’s stomach with the handle protruding into his small bowel. Its prongs, called tines, had pressed on the stomach lining causing an ulcer that led to the bleeding. Grim: A camera found the fork in his tummy, which was causing him serious damage . Consultant general surgeon, Hanis Shiwani, was asked to take a look by his baffled colleagues. He decided it would be too dangerous to try to extract the fork without surgery and carried out a 45-minute operation to cut open his stomach. He said: 'The fork was impacting on the stomach wall, causing an ulcer which was bleeding. I had to remove that part of the stomach and I was glad when it wasn’t cancerous. 'Technically it was not a challenging operation but it was exciting because it is not something we have ever done before. 'We know that coins, nails, pins and batteries are common things people swallow but not a nine-inch fork. I jokingly said that we should contact the Guinness Book of World Records.' Mr Shiwani said Lee was fortunate the fork had not damaged his gullet on the way into his stomach. 'If it had been a metal fork, or had got stuck in the gullet it would have caused more damage earlier.' He said Lee, could have suffered a perforated stomach, potentially leading to a fatal infection, if the fork had not been removed. But Lee, who was discharged from hospital this week, is expected to make a full recovery. The consultant, who has worked at Barnsley Hospital for ten years, said he had never known a foreign object to last so long inside a person. 'If something does get lodged, then normally a patient would become ill almost immediately. This is why Lee’s case is so uncharacteristic. 'The plastic had been exposed to stomach acid for ten years but apart from it being black, there was no damage. It didn’t melt it down or anything which is remarkable.'","Lee Gardner, from Barnsley, told doctors he had completely forgotten swallowing it .

During a press conference yesterday, President Obama revealed the existence of a sealed indictment in the Benghazi attacks in Libya on September 11, 2012, leaving some experts questioning whether the president broke the law. Federal law states that 'no person may disclose [a sealed] . indictment's existence,' and that doing so may be 'punished as a . contempt of court,' a charge that carries a minimum sentence of six months prison. The announcement came as a surprise to some insiders, as the existence . of a sealed indictment has not been publicly confirmed or denied by law . enforcement or government officials. Announcements: President Obama spoke about the NSA reforms, his relationship with Russia's Vladimir Putin and the sealed Benghazi indictment at a press conference yesterday . The president did not name anyone or divulge the number of suspects. President Obama held the press conference before he takes off on holiday with his family to Martha's Vineyard. A reporter asked the president whether the perpetrators of the 2012 Benghazi, Libya attack that left four Americans dead would be brought to justice. President Obama responded, 'We have informed, I think, the public that there's a sealed indictment. It's sealed for a reason. But we are intent on capturing those who carried out this attack, and we're going to stay on it until we get them.' Signed, sealed, delivered: Speculation has been mounting about the sealed indictment, but no one would confirm or deny their existence until President Obama's revelations yesterday . That the first charges had been filed in the Benghazi case was widely reported, but repeatedly denied by administration and intelligence officials. An official, speaking to ABC News on the condition of anonymity, labelled the revelation 'crazy', and joked, . 'Doesn't the law apply to the President too? I guess he could pardon himself.' But you don't get to be leader of the free world without a few perks - one of which is being immune from non-disclosure or confidentiality laws. Terrorism: Of the 2012 Benghazi attack perpetrators, Mr Obama said he would pursue them 'until we get them' According to a former lawyer for Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, by virtue of his position, leaking classified information turns it into authorized information. Peter Zeidenberg told ABC News, 'Nothing he says is technically a leak. If he does it, it is authorized.' However, had any other official mentioned the existence of the indictment, they would have been guilty of contempt of court. Zeidenberg said that it is, however, possible to form an argument that a sealed matter can only be unsealed by a court. White House officials told ABC News that the President was only 'referencing widely reported information and was not asked about, nor did he comment on any specific indictment.'","President Obama confirmed the existence of a sealed indictment in the Benghazi terror attack yesterday .

Walking home after a particularly arduous night out, you sometimes just feel like a lie-down. For one unfortunate friend of mine, that meant seeking shelter under a pile of newspapers on someone's doorstep. If only he had had a shoe tent. Australian design firm Sibling has unveiled an ingenious invention - the Walking Shelter - that is basically a pair of hi-top running shoes with a full-sized tent cached in the netting on the heel. Walking home and need a rest? Thank goodness you have a tent stashed in your shoes! Okay, so the design is not the most . subtle - the streamlined shape of the trainers is compromised slightly . by the bulging fabric stuffed in the netting. But, as anyone who has tramped miles . across fields to reach their camping spot at a festival will testify, . the alternative (lugging a heavy, cumbersome bag of tent) is a lot . worse. Dismiss any romantic notion of . camping a deux under the stars though - this is less Out Of Africa and . more Bear Grylls' fashionista sister's idea of survival in the wild - with a 21st Century fashion . update. With no poles to hold it up, the wearer has to use their own . head, hands and legs as supports - meaning they are likely to get quite . wet. The . trainers are not unlike a pair of regular hi-tops, but with the tent . bundled up and cached in netting along the sides and at the rear of the . shoe . Sibling, who . created the Walking Shelter as a conceptual design project rather than . intending for it to be used as a fully functioning tent, say the garment is a 'human shelter stored within a pair of . sneakers'. 'Stored . compactly in integrated net pockets within the shoe, the shelter expands . out and around the body to form an enclosure that relies on the human . frame as a supporting structure,' they say. 'The . shelter accommodates for the body in a variety of ways and can be . customised by the user to adapt to a variety of contexts and . environments.' The only drawback? With no poles or pegs, the person themselves acts as the supports for the tent, making it tricky to pop out to get the beans on the Calor stove . ... and should it rain, the spontaneous camper's hands and feet wouldget a little wet, and their head where it touches the canvas. To be entirely fair though, the tent was created more as a conceptual design piece than functioning back country gear . The trainers, created by Australian design firm Sibling, feature a pull-out tent that becomes a fully functioning shelter . The tent has no poles - making it incredibly light to transport - but less than practical in the wild. More of a wind-proof shelter to eat a sandwich than a tent for a night in the back country . The tent pulls out rapidly and, once the wearer sits down - they have to provide the support for the tent - the shelter is erected .","Created by Australian design firm Sibling .

The video shows innocent bystanders making their way home caught up in the violence as groups of thugs attack each other. Norfolk Police said that there has been a 210 per cent increase in violent crime in the city between 3am and 6am since licensing hours were extended in 2005 allowing pubs and clubs to open longer. The force said that the surge in violence has led to an increase in police hours of 12,000 per year. It is now calling on the local council to ban the sale of alcohol during the early morning and showed the video to councillors to reinforce how bad the situation has become.

The council is considering introducing early morning restriction orders (EMROs) in three city centre areas, which would ban alcohol sales from 3am to 6am on weekdays and from 3.45am to 6am at the weekend. Detective Superintendent Paul Sandford of Norfolk Police said early-morning drinking was causing ‘significant problems’. He said: ‘Pubs and clubs used to close so much earlier than they do now. Their later hours of operating have undoubtedly seen an increase in crime and disorder reported to us. ‘The point I want to make is that in these very small hours at the end of the night is when we’re seeing an increase in crime and it's only in these small hours that we want to restrict the sale of alcohol.’ In some of the footage, innocent bystanders are caught up in the violence .

A group of fishermen dived into the sea and pulled a young woman to safety after her car plunged off a harbour wall in the early hours yesterday. The 23-year-old was driving a white Ford Fiesta when it fell into the icy waters of Peterhead Harbour in north-east Scotland and started to sink. Anglers who had been fishing nearby dived to the young woman’s rescue and managed to drag her back to shore before emergency services reached the scene. Heroic early morning fishermen rescued the young driver of this car after it plunged into the sea at Peterhead . The woman was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for a check up but is believed to have miraculously escaped serious injury. The car, which is believed to have gone through metal railings before hitting the water, was later recovered from the harbour by crane after police divers secured a cable to it. The early-morning drama took place at Peterhead harbour’s south breakwater, which is used as a pier for loading and unloading offshore supply vessels. A police spokesman said: 'At about 5am, emergency services including police, ambulance and coastguard attended at the south breakwater of Peterhead Harbour following a report of a car going into the water. 'Members of the public had assisted in recovering a 23-year-old woman from the water. 'She was not injured but was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary as a precaution. 'As far as we aware she was the sole occupant of the car and inquiries are ongoing to establish how the car came to be in the water.' After the woman was taken to hospital police divers went down and secured a cable to the sunken car . The dented Ford Fiesta was then hauled out of the harbour waters and onto dry land yesterday . Peterhead Harbour is a sheltered deep-water port which services the North Sea’s busy fishing business as well as the oil and gas industry. The south breakwater has a six-inch kerb on one side and metal railings on the other, where the car entered the water. A spokesman for the RNLI’s Peterhead lifeboat crew said: 'The lifeboat launched at 5.12am with its volunteers crew to help recover a casualty after her car plunged into the sea off the east side of Peterhead south breakwater. 'The casualty was successfully recovered to the breakwater prior to the arrival of the lifeboat. Police divers recovered the badly damaged car by crane at the Scottish harbour yesterday . The car was recovered from the chilly waters of what is Scotland's easternmost point by crane yesterday . 'After a search for debris the lifeboat returned to its berth at Peterhead Harbour at approximately 6.40am. 'The sea conditions off the breakwater were a three to six foot swell, and the wind was south by south-westerly force five to six.' Members of the Peterhead coastguard team remained at the scene with the police to help with the recovery of the car. Two days beforehand, a woman was rescued from Burghead Harbour in Moray after her Vauxhall Corsa plunged into the water. She was taken to hospital in Elgin for a check up but did not suffer any serious injuries.","Early morning anglers dived in and pulled female driver from icy waters .

Andrew Baker, 64, pictured with wife Anne, 61, of South Petherwin, Cornwall, is accused of money laundering - his wife has already admitted money laundering and false accounting . A pensioner splashed out on a villa in Turkey and lavish home improvements using £1.1m his wife stole from her bosses at a top private hospital, a court heard today. Andrew Baker, 64, invested £94,000 in a property in Bodrum and blew tens of thousands installing waterfalls, fountains and an aviary of exotic birds at his home in Cornwall, jurors heard. The cash had been swiped by his wife, Anne, 61, during a ‘breath-taking’ 13-year fraud while she worked as a radiology department manager at the Princess Grace Hospital in Marylebone, central London. She has admitted false accounting and will be sentenced later. Using her maiden name Fitzpatrick, Anne Baker swindled a total of £1,142,101.92 by forging a string of 131 invoices authorising payment to a fictional radiologist, Dr Baker, for ‘consultancy services’. The con took place between 1998 and 2012, when the hospital was run by HCA International Limited, Southwark Crown Court heard. Mr Baker, allegedly a ‘key beneficiary’ of the stolen cash, also transferred £85,000 into two Turkish bank accounts and stashed £25,000 in a gun cupboard at his home. He claims he had no idea about his wife’s wrongdoing, but the couple’s genuine income was ‘dwarfed’ by their dishonest earnings, prosecutor Hugh Forgan told the jury. Mr Forgan said: ‘Anne Baker, the wife of the defendant Andrew Baker, between November 1998 and January 2012, while she was working at the Princess Grace Hospital, created 131 false invoices. ‘The creation of these invoices for payment [for work] which was never done enabled her to defraud her employers out of over £1m. ‘Often the defendant was the beneficiary of that money, sometimes via direct transfers to his bank account, other times the money was being spent on improving the matrimonial home. The court heard that Mr Baker's wife defrauded the London hospital where she worked out of more than £1m . ‘The crown say he was a key beneficiary of this very large amount of stolen money and he knew what he was doing when he received it. ‘The illegal income was many, many more times the legitimate income and the prosecution say the defendant must have known this. ‘From 2008 onwards there was income on his part coming out of rental property but that was effectively minimal. ‘We say he was living off her [Anne’s] income, which was mainly dishonest.’ Anne Baker, who retired from the hospital in March 2012, authorised a bogus invoice around once a month, with annual amounts ranging from £80,000 to £179,000, jurors heard. The Bodrum villa was purchased in September 2007 before £85,000 was transferred to Guaranteed Bank accounts, which had Andrew Baker’s name ‘all over’ them, said Mr Forgan. Holiday retreat: The court heard that Mr Baker spent £94,000 on a luxury villa in Bodrum, Turkey (file image) A further £88,882 was spent on building work at the couple’s home in Launceston, with more cash ploughed into landscaping projects. ‘Mr Baker turned the house in Cornwall into something rather splendid,’ Mr Forgan added. ‘We say that could only have been afforded when one factors in the dishonest money and the defendant knew he could afford it because he knew full well what his wife was up to.’ Andrew Baker, who was arrested in August 2012, told police the allegations were ‘crazy’. He claimed he used cash from the sale of a property in Putney, south London, and money his wife received as a bonus to fund his extravagant purchases. He insisted he was unaware during the whole period his wife defrauded her bosses, jurors heard. ‘Mrs Baker was charged with fraud and she has pleaded guilty to taking over £1.1m from the hospital,’ Mr Forgan told the jury. Andrew Baker, of Manderley, South Petherwin, Launceston, Cornwall, denies two counts of money laundering. Anne Baker, of the same address, has admitted false accounting and two counts of money laundering and will be sentenced at the conclusion of her husband’s case. The trial continues.

At the height of the Troubles, the sight of British Army soldiers on patrol in Northern Ireland was a familiar one. But these pictures reveal a side to army life unlikely to be found in the pages of any traditional military history book. From 'munching on acid' to attending illegal raves, former soldier Stuart Griffiths has lifted the lid on the hedonistic exploits of young servicemen seeking an escape from the horror of the conflict in Northern Ireland during the late '80s and early '90s. On parade: Stuart Griffiths was posted to the Parachute Regiment in Northern Ireland after joining the Army as a 16-year-old in 1988 . Now a writer and photographer, Mr Griffiths, 41, was posted to Northern Ireland with the Parachute Regiment after joining the army in 1988 at the age of 16. While there he began to document the reality of everyday life in the forces with an instamatic camera, capturing drug-fuelled parties, soldiers posing with Page 3 girls and horseplay with rifles and equipment. Those photographs form the basis of Mr Griffiths' new book, Pigs' Disco - named after monthly parties which saw local girls invited into the barracks for a night of drinking, dancing and sex. Horseplay: Mr Griffiths said that - while the soldiers who took acid reserved it for when they were in camp - 'we still had rifles' Down-time: Mr Griffiths spent five years in the army after joining as a 16-year-old . 'I just wanted to do something which is very truthful,' said the writer, who admitted his book was 'not going to please everyone'. 'It's basically my own experience from how I saw it,' said the author, whose stint in the army pre-dated the introduction of compulsory drug testing. Mr Griffiths said many soldiers used recreational drugs as a means of finding respite from the rigours of military life. 'I remember being on my two days off and being completely off my head,' he said. 'Fortunately I managed to get my head straight.' Hedonism: The former soldier said many young servicemen were seeking an escape from the rigours of daily life in the military . The author paints an eye-opening . portrait of military life at the time, but says the drug taking he . witnessed was largely reserved for soldiers' down-time. 'We used to have a rota, we'd be on . guard duty or escort duty, then go on a four week stint of West Belfast - . the only thing we did there was smoke cigarettes,' he said. 'We weren't taking acid then. 'The acid thing was when we were on camp - but we'd still got rifles.' 'Truthful': Mr Griffiths was posted in Northern Ireland, as the Troubles continued to rage, during his five year stint with the Army . Recreational: The army was yet to introduce compulsory drug testing when Stuart was a serving soldier . Mr Griffith said that, having fallen . in with 'a bad crowd' in his home town of Warrington, he joined the army . with the aim of setting himself on the straight and narrow. 'When I joined all my friends from . school were going to the Hacienda and listening to the Stone Roses and . the Happy Mondays, I was very anti-drugs at the time. 'But I realised a lot of soldiers were listening to the same thing - it was filtering through.' Pressure: The former soldier said he suspects the type of drug use he describes in Pigs' Disco still goes on among some servicemen today . Burgeoning scene: This photograph taken at an illegal rave at Black Rock in Brighton features in Pigs' Disco . Parties: The former soldier said he has 'no regrets' about his five years in the army . A paratrooper poses for the camera flanked by two Page 3 models in East Tyrone in 1992 . Before too long Mr Griffiths was experimenting with hallucinogenics and burning incense in the barracks to hide the smell of marijuana. That the influence of the nascent . rave scene and its drug culture had reached serving soldiers is evident . from Mr Griffiths' photographs, which capture soldiers letting loose at . illegal parties on Brighton's Black Rock. The army introduced compulsory drug testing in 1998. But asked whether he suspects some soldiers still seek an escape from the pressures of military life with the help of illegal substances, Mr Griffiths replies: 'Very much so.' A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: 'It is difficult to comment on the accuracy of historic accusations of drug misuse going back decades. However, since the period in question the MOD has introduced Compulsory Drug Testing (CDT) which has shown that drug misuse in the Armed Forces is extremely rare. 'In fact, positive CDT rates in the armed forces over the last few years average around 0.42 per cent, compared with 7 per cent in civilian workplace drug testing programmes in the UK. 'Drug misuse is significantly less prevalent among service personnel than in corresponding civilian demographic groups and we are clear that there is absolutely no place in the Armed Forces for those who use illegal drugs.' Stuart Griffiths' book Pigs' Disco is available now from Ditto Press.","Stuart Griffiths was posted to Northern Ireland with Parachute Regiment .

Twenty of Britain's most odour-able creatures battled it out to land the top prize at the first ever pet skunk beauty pageant. The stinky but groomed animals were judged on tail length, attitude and the cuteness of their nose. And when the ballots were in, they lined up again for the fancy dress round.

Hairdresser Sandra Vaughan, 43, has been planning her entry since June, having designed bride, groom and bridesmaid outfits for her pets Essence, Effy and Pepe Le Pew. But the happy wedding scene became a solemn affair when Essence died three weeks ago.

A Florida man accused of having sex with a miniature donkey in his care claims that state laws forbidding him from doing so are are a violation of his constitutional rights. Carlos R. Romero, 32, of Ocala, was arrested on September 14 . and charged with engaging in sexual activity involving an animal and . animal cruelty after police said he had sex with Doodle, a two-year-old miniature donkey in his care. But before his trial, Romero's lawyers have filed a measure in court urging a judge to declare the state laws forbidding sex with animals unconstitutional. Busted: Attorneys for farmhand Carlos Romero are arguing that Florida's laws prohibiting sex with animals are a violation of his constitutional rights . The motion argues that the law encroaches on Romero's due process rights, according to the Ocala Star-Banner. The paper reported that the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, which was the basis for the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case, has been violated in Romero's case. The motion was filed on December 6. Romero was taken into custody at the Ocala farm where he was employed after reportedly admitting to police that he becomes aroused when seeing animals in heat and mating. Crimes against donkey: Romero was jailed after admitting he had masturbated on Doodle, pictured, 'five or six times' When interviewed by police, Romero described in graphic detail his sexual encounter with Doodle, saying that he likes how the critter's fur feels against his privates, according to the police report obtained by The Smoking Gun. He went on to say that he 'may have come in contact with the donkey' by accident and left his DNA - also 'by accident.' Who's Doodle's daddy? A custody hearing for Doodle has been delayed twice, and is now slated for December 21 . Romero also admitted that he masturbated with Doodle five or six times, but said he did not have sex with the critter because 'she's blooming into maturity,' the Star-Banner reported. He added, according to the arrest report, that Florida is a 'backwards' state and 'people frown on zoophilia here.' The alleged incident that landed Romero behind bars took place on August 15, when Gerald James, who rents the farm in the 9100 block of NW 60th Avenue arrived at around 9:30pm to deliver a horse. James told police that all the farm buildings were shrouded in darkness, but there was light in the tac room. Through the window, James said he saw Romero 'up against the rear of the donkey' with his shirt off and his pants down and was apparently having sex with the animal. He said Romero pulled away from the 21-month-old animal after he saw James looking at him. He then pushed Doodle out the room and closed the door behind her. Romero was booked into the Marion County Jail on $2,000 bond. The miniature donkey was taken away by animal control officials. Since his arrest, Romero has spoken out about the incident, demanding that Doodle - which he claims he paid $500 for - be returned to him. A custody hearing for Doodle has been delayed twice, and is now slated for December 21, according to the Star-Banner.","Carlos R.

And now the wait is finally over as the most fashionable people of 2013 have been declared. Some of the choices were far from surprising. The Duchess of Cambridge makes the list for the fourth time since she first appeared in 2008. And the Duchess of Cambridge doesn't want for royal companions either. Princess Letizia of Asturias is also on the List, as is Princess Madeleine of Sweden. Scroll down for video . The Duchess of Cambridge was included in Vanity Fair's International Best-Dressed List for the fourth time . New names on the list include singer Beyoncé and burlesque dancer Dita von Teese . Scandal actress Kerry Washington, who graced the cover of the magazine's August issue, made the number one spot. Gisele Bundchen, Charlize Theron and Justin Timberlake also appeared, as did Stella Tenant. Victoria Beckham was also listed. There were the obvious choices, and then the more intriguing ones. Peng Liyuan, the wife of the Chinese President Xi Jinping, makes her debut this year. It's an interesting choice; Peng, who is also a singer and performing artist, has been feted for adding some glamour to her husband's staid office. But if the List charts those whose star is on the rise, those whom it excludes must feel the burn. With that in mind, it's interesting that the List's compilers have failed to include Michelle Obama - for the second year running. (Barak hasn't appeared since 2009). Lighthearted: David Walliams with his wife Lara Stone . In fact, the wives of Western politicians are conspicuously absent. Samantha Cameron hasn't appeared since she was included for the first time in 2010. And, while Carla Bruni-Sarkozy is a veteran of the List, having appeared four times, the wife of the former French president isn't in the List this year. For some, the List is a sacred affair, but there are those who treat it more lightheartedly. While Lara Stone, appearing in the Couples category with husband David Walliams, said her favourite item of clothing is 'my wedding . dress, made by Riccardo Tisci', David said his were his 'Charvet pajamas'. He added that his style icon is Italian actress 'Omella Muti as Princess . Aura in Flash Gordon.' When asked who his is, Keith Richards, new to the List, responded, 'Why should I [have one]... I am one!' He also insisted that 'I don't shop!' Keith Richards and Kerry Washington featured on the coveted list . Other newbies include Beyonce and Dita von Teese. The burlesque dancer said her favourite article of clothing is ""The 'Hussar' gown from Jean Paul Gaultier's 2002 winter haute couture collection.' Fittingly, her style icons are 'the women of 1940s-era fetish artist John Willie.' Ronan Farrow, a writer, human-rights lawyer and diplomat but better known as the son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, was also included. For the first time in its history, the fashion's who's who has been opened up to the public. The International Best-Dressed Challenge, as it was known, invited submissions from readers.

The prime minister only confirmed his identity when passengers realised who he was. Scroll down for video . Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg worked secretly as a cab driver to listen to voter's views . Stoltenberg wore a taxi driver's uniform and sunglasses as he tried to go incognito for the election stunt . He said he wanted to hear what Norwegian's really felt about their politicians and what they wanted for their country. The stunt was dreamed up by an advertising agency as part of Stoltenberg's campaign for re-election, was filmed on hidden cameras. A video of the event was published yesterday by daily newspaper VG and on the PM's Facebook page. Stoltenberg told the newspaper he had wanted to hear people's honest views on politics. 'If there is one place where people say what they really mean about most things, it is in a taxi. Right from the gut,' he told VG. Many berated Stoltenberg, who has led the Nordic country for the past eight years, for his poor driving. Most conversations became political when the passengers realised who was driving while others berated him for his skills behind the wheel . The prime minister admitted that he is more used to sitting in the back seat of a chauffeured car than driving . At . one point the car jolts abruptly when the politician thinks he is . pressing the clutch but hits the automatic vehicle's brake and he . confessed that he is more used to sitting in the back of his chauffeured car. One passenger told him: 'I am not really happy about the driving' and another said: 'I guess I will live'. Another passenger took his criticism to another level and bluntly said: 'Your driving is really bad.' Most passengers realised quickly who their driver was. One told him: 'From this angle you really look like Stoltenberg', while another said: 'Have you quit as prime minister?' The prime minister's passengers were shocked, bemused and curious before their discussions inevitably turned to politics. Stoltenberg (left), pictured with Angela Merkel and David Cameron, is seeking reelection in September . Stoltenberg said he did not think he could be a taxi driver full time. He told Norwegian media: 'I think the nation and Norwegian taxi passengers are best served if I . am the prime minister and not a taxi driver.' Some passengers were picked up after hailing the prime minister's cab while others were told that they would be picked up but not who would be driving, Labour Party spokeswoman said.

The Maersk Triple E set off on its maiden voyage last month and has now visited six different Asian ports on its 23 day route around Asia and Europe. Scroll down for video .

Just parking up: The Triple-E vessel -- the world's largest ship -- pulls into the port ready to load up on cargo . And a fascinating time lapse video shows the giant container vessel in action, making its first point of call at Busan in South Korea. The video shows the ship gliding through the water towards the dock and being moored using heavy duty ropes. The giant vessel dwarfs cars and workers on the dock as the ship's crew look over the side  of the ship all the way down to dry land. The video then shows cargo containers being loaded neatly row upon row by automated cranes before the ship sets sail again. Empty: The Triple E vessel can fit around 18,000 shipping containers in its vast hull . Impressive: The time lapse video shows an automated crane system slowly filling up the ship as night falls . Eventually there will be 20 of the Triple E ships produced and they will sail on the world's biggest shipping route between China and Holland in 23 days stopping at eight ports in Asia and another six in Europe. The fleet is called the Triple E because its manufacturers claim it refers to the boat's economy of scale, energy efficiency and its 'environmental improvement proficiency'. The company will save around £750,000 on fuel in a typical journey between Shanghai and Rotterdam. The ship is designed for maximum storage and efficiency rather than speed. Instead of a streamlined hull, the boat is more boxy so that it can carry more cargo and features a special engine that recycles heat and uses it to gain extra propulsion. It is also the greener option when it comes to transporting a range of goods across the world - it produces just 3g CO2 per ton of cargo compared to an airplane which emits 560g per ton. The ship, which has cargo space the equivalent of 36,000 cars or 111 million pairs of trainers, would be longer than the Eiffel Tower if the famous Parisian landmark was laid flat.

The 18th century neo-classical villa includes four enormous reception rooms, a kitchen, breakfast room and study on the ground floor, with a spa, games, cinema room and gym areas on the lower ground. There are ten main bedrooms and nine bathrooms, a large wing and a even a Stable House which provides secondary accommodation and boasts a swimming pool and spa. Tyringham Hall , which is owned by property developer Anton Bilton, has been put on the market through Savills Country Department with an £18 million guide price. Renovated: The estate has recently undergone a multi-million pound overhaul with the help of English Heritage, helping to restore the ten-bedroom mansion to its stunning former glory . Stunning architecture: Inside the mansion which was bought for £2.5 million a decade ago but is now on the market for $18 million . Mr Bilton paid £2.5 million for the property in 2001 when it was being used as naturopathic clinic.He then spent millions restoring it with the help of architect Ben Krauze and under the guidance of English Heritage. Sir John Soane was son of a bricklayer who rose to become professor of architecture at the Royal Academy. He specialised in the Neo-Classical style of design and his architectural works are distinguished by their clean lines,  decisive detailing, careful proportions and skilful use of light. The influence of his work, coming at the end of the Georgian era, was swamped by the revival styles of the 19th century. It was not until the late 19th century that his influence  was widely felt. His best-known work was the Bank of England, a building which had a widespread effect on commercial architecture. He also designed Dulwich Picture Gallery, which, with its top-lit galleries, was a major influence on the planning of subsequent art galleries and museums. His main legacy is Sir John Soane's Museum, in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London. He received a knighthood in 1831, six years before his death at the age of 84. In total Tyringham Hall has 25 bedrooms and 32 bathrooms, all of which deliver piping hot water on demand. Crispin Holborow, head of Savills Country Department, believes Tyringham Hall is right up there with Britain's finest homes . He said: 'Tyringham Hall combines some of finest work of Soane and Lutyens, and as such could be labelled as one of England's greatest architectural masterpieces.What's more it is in exceptional condition having been beautifully restored."" Mr Holborow believes Tyringham Hall is likely to be snapped up by someone looking for a piece of English history. He added: 'It is enormous but also remarkably compact. It has some wonderful formal rooms so can expand into a party home or contract into a family home. 'It is right at the top of English homes, an architectural jewel. It is architecturally and historically significant and this will attract buyers."" Tyringham Hall was designed by Soane in the late 18th century for William Praed, renowned banker and MP, and completed six years later. It was was one of a series of new . country houses designed by Soane, who is internationally regarded as one . of the greatest architects of the neo-classical period. Soane, writing in his memoirs, described the period he was working on the house as some of ""the most happy years of my life"". In . the 1920s, then owner Frederick Konig commissioned Sir Edwin Lutyens to . construct a substantial outdoor swimming pool which is now an . ornamental pond. He also created the bathing pavilion and the 'Temple of Music', which was modelled on Viceroy's Palace, in New Delhi. Mr . Konig died in 1940 and, during World War II, Tyringham Hall became a . maternity home before it was bought by the Australian and New Zealand . Bank as a weekend club.

'I know that 99%, if not more, of the population will stand with me in utterly condemning those who scarred the reputation of our beautiful city last night,' said Mr Baggott. 'Those people had no intention of peaceful protest, they lack self respect and they lack dignity.' Mr Baggott, who warned that the 'prisons would be bulging' once the police had identified and arrested those responsible, added: 'The only voices we should hear now are those unequivocally condemning the violence and supporting fully the actions of the police and the rule of law and I don't want to hear any excuses for the disgraceful scenes that took place last night, because quite frankly there aren't any.' 'Disgraceful scenes': Police officers deployed water cannon in a bid to quell the unrest on the streets of Belfast . Protest: A loyalist is arrested by riot police as violence erupted in the city centre on Friday night . The trouble broke out as the city hosts thousands of international visitors attending the World Police and Fire Games. Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers condemned the rioters. 'Last night's violence and attacks on police officers were shameful,' she said today. 'After success for Northern Ireland this summer as host to both the G8 Summit (in Co Fermanagh in June) and the World Police and Fire Games, disorder on the streets is a hugely regrettable step backwards.' Last night's violence spread from the Royal Avenue area as the Anti-Internment League parade, which was sanctioned by the Parades Commission adjudication body, approached from north Belfast. Some direct clashes with loyalists and republicans ensued close to the entrance to the unionist Shankill Road, and police said they came under attack from both sides, but officers have stressed that loyalist protesters were responsible for the vast majority of the violence. Aftermath: A man walks past a burned out shop today as the clean-up operation continued on the Shankill Road after a night of chaos . Sheer thuggery: A burned out van stands in the Shankill Road today in the aftermath of serious disturbance in Belfast last night . A number of parked vehicles were set on fire in the nearby North Street area and police have revealed that some rioters took to the roof tops of city buildings and houses and tried to set them on fire. The parade did not pass down Royal Avenue as intended. After a significant delay, it did finally proceed along the outskirts of the city centre and onward to west Belfast. Police stressed that the parade was not re-routed by their officers with organisers voluntarily deciding to take another road. The Parades Commission had authorised the parade and permitted six notified protests, including one by the Orange Order. Assistant Chief Constable George Hamilton heavily criticised those who arranged the demonstrations.'There was absolutely no organisation, no co-ordination, no leadership around any of those protests,' he said. The officer said it was clear that a large number of the protesters arrived with 'violent intent'. 'There was no attempt whatsoever, that we could see, of any organised or coordinated protest activity in keeping with that which had been notified to the parades commission.' Mr Hamilton characterised the violence in Royal Avenue as 'very severe'. 'There were all sorts of weapons and equipment being used against police, including scaffolding, masonry, people were pulling up the paving stones from the busiest shopping precinct in Belfast and were destroying our city and taking that masonry and throwing it at our police officers who put their lives on the line to try and keep people safe. 'There was nothing lawful about this protest, there was nothing peaceful about it - it was sheer thuggery.' The assistant chief constable said officers had almost cleared Royal Avenue of protesters when the parade organisers decided to take another route. 'It's perhaps understandable that they would do that,' he said. 'But the police did not re-route the parade away from Royal Avenue and in fact we were within minutes of having Royal Avenue cleared to allow the parade go through.' Mr Hamilton added: 'We would call on anyone with any influence to stand up and be counted, actually to show some leadership around what is a difficult set of circumstances for us, but we actually need those with influence within the community to use that for good, so that we don't resort to the violent scenes that we saw last night.'","Protestors pelted police with scaffolding poles and stones in Royal Avenue .

It was obviously an inspired choice on Pippa's part as it was at the April 2011 nuptials that she shot to fame dubbed 'Her Royal Hotness' thanks to how pert her derriere looked in the figure hugging dress. She acknowledged in her book, Celebrate, that it had been a bizarre experience to suddenly become famous around the world thanks to her bottom.

Blazing a trail: Veteran broadcaster Barbara Walters has lifted the lid on how she battled sexism early in her career by keeping her head down and working hard . Ms Walters began her broadcasting career in 1962 doing women's issues for The Today Show, which she calls 'tea pouring interviews', and admits that 'it was a very different time.' She once even had to wear a swimsuit on air after a model failed to appear. 'Who knew from sexism?' Ms Walters told the magazine. 'Now if somebody says ""I like your sweater"" you can go to human . resources, and the person could get fired.' She had a great relationship with Hugh Downs, but when he left in 1971 his replacement Frank McGee was much less welcoming. 'He didn't want me to participate at all,' she reveals. 'The compromise was that after the third question, I could come in.' Getting answers: Ms Walters says that her friendly manner when interviewing guests like Senator Hilary Clinton has helped her ask more probing questions . Range of guests: Throughout her career Ms Walters has interviewed everyone from Dr Jack Kevorkian (left, pictured in 1993) to Sesame Street's Elmo (right) She adds: 'I worked very hard on that fourth question.' But instead of . getting angry, Mr McGee's studio rules drove Ms Walters to go out into . the field and do her own interviews. This earned her, she says, a . reputation as a 'pushy cookie'. When . McGee died in 1974 - which she says no one expected - she became the network's first female co-host. A few years later she also became the first . female to host the ABC Evening News. Career highlights: Ms Walter's interview with Monica Lewinsky in 1999 was viewed by 74 million people and remains her highest-rated interview of all time . Battling sexism: Ms Walters (pictured with Harry Reasoner in 1976) has battled sexism during her a 50-year career by staying focused on the job . Whether it's a head of state or celebrity, Ms Walters says that the secret to doing a great interview is doing your homework. 'It used to really annoy me when someone would come to interview me and say, ""I'm sorry. I've never seen you on the air"",' she admits. She also discovered that that low-key friendly approach worked to her advantage during interviews. 'If you say “What’s the biggest misconception about you?”, that's easier than saying “Tell me why you married your sister"".' she explains. 'It was a very different time. Now if somebody says ""I like your sweater"" they could get fired' But she says that some guests, like former president Richard Nixon, have still been painfully awkward. 'Nixon wanted you to like him. It was almost pathetic,' she says. 'He would tell off-color jokes to the camera crew. He was such an uncomfortable person that he didn't know how to do it.' This isn't the first time that Ms Walters has expressed contrarian views on feminism. She made headlines in 2012 for taking former . Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum's side after blamed 'radical . feminism' for convincing women that working was the key to happiness. Through it all, Ms Walters says that she is proud of the fact that she has affected the way that women are regarded. 'If I have done stories and interviews that have in the past been done by men, and I opened the door a little bit, and now it’s taken for granted, that would be a legacy I could be proud of.'","While working on The Today Show in the 1970s, her male co-host refused to do joint interviews with her unless he could ask the first three questions .

She may be fast approaching her 40th . birthday but Kate Moss's domination of the fickle fashion world . shows no sign of abating. After twenty stellar years dominating the industry Kate has seen her earnings triple in the past year alone. Her total earnings as of October 2012 for the preceding year totalled £11.72 million - that's nearly three times the amount she earned in 2011. Big earner: Kate Moss has seen her earnings triple despite being in the industry for over 20 years . The Telegraph have revealed that Moss' company, Tilly Church, posted profits of almost £8 million, according to figures filed at Companies House. And her second company, Skate LLP, saw earnings of £3.8 million. This was topped off by lucrative campaigns, deals and appearances such as her own range for Rimmel, her stint in the Olympics Closing Ceremony and a starring role in George Michael's music video. The 39-year-old also fronted campaigns for Salvatore Ferragamo, Mango, Rag & Bone and Dior Addict. The best is yet to come: This year saw her publish her own book, launch a phone accessories collection, and star in campaigns with Stuart Weitzman, Versace, Givenchy, Matchless and St Tropez . And while 2012 was a lucrative year for the model, earnings for 2013 look set to be even bigger. In 2013 she has already published her own book, launched a mass market phone accessories collection with Carphone Warehouse and starred in campaigns with Stuart Weitzman, Versace, Givenchy, Matchless and St Tropez. The latest figures prove that the 2005 drug scandal, where she was pictured allegedly snorting cocaine with ex-boyfriend Pete Doherty, was just a minor blip in her career .

"By . Marianne Power . PUBLISHED: . 16:29 EST, 7 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:54 EST, 7 August 2013 . Marianne Power tests two different 'seasonal' Spanx . The wedding was straight out of the pages of a magazine. The bride wore Fendi, the vows were exchanged in a garden overlooking Lake Como and the lunch was five courses of pure heaven. But the thing I remember most about my friend's perfect wedding last summer is just how hot I was. It's not that the temperatures were particularly scorching - in the pleasant mid-20s at most - but I still spent the celebration sweating like a pig on a spit, and looking about as attractive as one. By the end of the day I was so hot and bothered I was ready to pass out. The cause of this discomfort? My industrial-strength Spanx pants. I had bought the thickest and longest pair possible - the ones that go from your knees to your bust and suck you in so tight you can hardly breathe - in a bid to get away with the long, clingy dress I'd bought for the wedding. It never occurred to me in the cold London changing room that being trapped in some sort of giant compression bandage would not be the most comfortable attire for a Mediterranean summer's day. By the start of the evening, my shorts had been peeled off - after a five-minute battle in the loos - and all my lumps and bumps were wobbling in gay abandon on the dance floor. I learned my lesson that day - that summer and support wear don't mix. It's one of those cruel facts of life that the very time you need slimming the most - thanks to both a glut of weddings and lack of opaque tights - is the time that you have to go au naturel. Or is it? Spanx - which are worn by everyone from Princess Beatrice to Adele, Kim Kardashian to Gwyneth Paltrow - also offer a summer-friendly range it insists will help you keep your cool. The Skinny Britches range, first introduced last year but re-launched this summer with extra support panels, is made of lightweight breathable fabric, designed to tone lumps and bumps without causing hot flushes. The range of shorts, slips and body shapers, which claim to firm the tummy, hips, thighs and bottom, have been created with ultra-light, sheer fabric, a cotton gusset and a 'non-binding' unseamed waistband that won't dig in or create lumps and bumps. Spanx even includes a mysterious item called the 'skort', which, for the uninitiated, is a pair of shorts with a skirt over the top. The benefit being that if your dress or skirt rides up, you look like you're wearing a slip rather than a pair of control pants. It all sounds great on paper, but can they pass the comfort test during our hottest summer in years? I decide to try them out. Marianne test drives the summer Spanx and the 'skort', which means if your dress flies up in the breeze it will look as if you are wearing a slip rather than control pants . I start with a pair of Skinny Britches shorts (£44). The first impressions are good - they're delicate, semi-sheer and nicely silk to the touch. More sexy stocking than Elastoplast. In fact, the nude blends so well with my skin I can hardly see them and they're extremely comfortable. I tried them out under an unforgiving jersey maxi-dress, which normally shows up every lump and bump. They definitely smoothed out my silhouette, lifted my bum and controlled my tum -but, I have to admit, they didn't suck everything in quite as much as my old industrial-strength wedding shorts. That's because Spanx's 200 products (who knew women needed trussing up in so many different ways?) fall under three categories: Medium support, which 'smoothes your figure and offers a close, yet comfortably forgiving fit'; Super support, which 'shapes your body and flattens your stomach'; and Super Duper support, which 'powerfully transforms your physique targeting specific problem areas with zoned compression'. Summer Spanx come in shorts or skirt format - known as the 'skort' - for breeze-related emergencies . The summer Spanx, it turns out, offer only the Medium support - so they're lightweight in more ways than one. The real litmus test, however, came when wearing them out on a scorching London day. The temperature was in the early 30s and I was getting on and off the Tube and sitting in the park. But far from causing me to overheat, they were so comfortable that I forgot I was wearing them until I undressed again that night. So far so good. The next day I tried them out under a pair of light Capri pants, which always show my knicker line. These trousers fitted comfortably when I bought them last summer but now cling like leggings, thanks to a year of over-indulgence on the ice cream front. The shorts made them fit much better - no VPL and my bum looked less saggy, my tummy much flatter. 'The good news is that no matter what . crazy shapes I was making, my skort stayed in place without being too . constricting or making me overheat' In fact, they sucked in my tummy so much I realised that for both days I'd worn them, I'd been eating less. There's just not enough room to tuck into that extra helping. Could Spanx actually force me to diet? I wondered. Next up, I tried the Skinny Britches Skort (£52) under a shortish summer dress that I'm usually too self-conscious to wear. I don't like my bare legs and am always worried that a gust of wind is going to reveal too much cellulite to the world. The skort may be a ridiculous word but it's a good solution to this rather universal problem. A flimsy-looking bubblegum pink undergarment, this acts as both a slip and shorts in one, promising to keep both your dignity and wobbly bits under control. I liked it. When my skirt did fly up with a gust of wind, my pink slip stayed in place and looked much more respectable than a beige pair of Spanx would have done. Marianne gives the skort a thumbs-up... in spite of the silly word . Again, I wore it all day and felt perfectly cool and comfortable. For the ultimate test, I took my skort to a wedding in Surrey. The sun was blazing and the marquee felt like a furnace. I'd like to say that I stayed cool as a cucumber throughout but that wouldn't be strictly true. Only this time, it wasn't my undergarments that were making me sweat like I was at an aerobics class - I blame Beyonce. Or whatever else the DJ was playing that kept me on the dance floor all night. The good news is that no matter what crazy shapes I was making, my skort stayed in place without being too constricting or making me overheat. By the end of the night my head spun, my heels hurt but my wobbles stayed firmly under control. What more could a girl ask for?","Marianne Power test drives Spanx lightweight control underwear .

"By . Ap . PUBLISHED: . 01:00 EST, 10 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:14 EST, 10 August 2013 . Infamous drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero walked free Friday after 28 years in prison when a court overturned his 40-year sentence for the 1985 kidnapping and killing of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent, a brutal murder that marked a low point in U.S.-Mexico relations. The U.S. Department of Justice said Friday it was extremely disappointed by the release of the man convicted in the killing of DEA agent Enrique Camarena, calling it 'deeply troubling.' Mexico’s Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said in a statement that he was 'worried' about the court’s decision, adding that his office is analyzing whether there are any charges pending against Caro Quintero. Released: Drug kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero was released from prison today after a court ruled his 1985 murder conviction needed to be tossed out . Caro Quintero, 60, was a founding member of one of Mexico’s earliest and biggest drug cartels. The court ruled Wednesday that he had been improperly tried in a federal court for a crime that should have been treated as a state offense. Prison officials were notified of the ruling on Thursday, and an official at the Jalisco state prosecutors’ office said the drug lord left prison before dawn on Friday. The official was not authorized to speak on the record. News media were not alerted until hours after the release, and U.S. authorities apparently received no prior notification. 'The Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Administration learned today that early this morning Rafael Caro Quintero was released from prison,' said Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr. The DEA, meanwhile, said it 'will vigorously continue its efforts to ensure Caro-Quintero faces charges in the United States for the crimes he committed.' Caro Quintero still faces charges in the United States, but Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office said it was unclear whether there was a current extradition request. Hero: Slain DEA Agent Enrique Camarena is considered amongst his colleagues to be an original hero in the war on drug cartels . Apparently, the U.S. had requested his extradition for the Camarena killing — something Caro Quintero can’t be tried twice for — but may not have filed extradition requests for pending U.S. drug charges. The U.S. Department of Justice said it 'has continued to make clear to Mexican authorities the continued interest of the United States in securing Caro Quintero’s extradition so that he might face justice in the United States.' Caro Quintero helped establish a powerful cartel based in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa that later split into some of Mexico’s largest cartels, including the Sinaloa and Juarez cartels. He is still listed as one of the DEA’s five top international fugitives, and U.S. authorities believe he continued to control the laundering of drug money from behind bars. 'Caro Quintero continues to launder the proceeds from narcotics trafficking and he maintains an alliance with drug trafficking organizations such as the Sinaloa Cartel, most notably with Esparragoza Moreno’s network,' said Treasury Department spokesman John Sullivan, referring to Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno, also known as 'El Azul,' or 'Blue' because of the dark color of his skin, who is allegedly a top leader of the Sinaloa cartel. 28 Years: Quintero spent 28 years behind bars before he was released on a technicality Friday morning . In June, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions against 18 people and 15 companies that allegedly moved money for Caro Quintero. Caro Quintero has used a network of family members and front persons to invest his fortune into ostensibly legitimate companies and real estate projects in the city of Guadalajara' said Adam Szubin, Director of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. Caro Quintero has spent almost his entire sentence at a prison on the outskirts of that city, Mexico’s second-largest city. Mexico’s relations with Washington were badly damaged when Caro Quintero ordered Camarena kidnapped, tortured and killed, purportedly because he was angry about a raid on a 220-acre (89-hectare) marijuana plantation in central Mexico named 'Rancho Bufalo' — Buffalo Ranch — that was seized by Mexican authorities at Camarena’s insistence. Camarena was kidnapped on Feb. 7, 1985, in Guadalajara, a major drug trafficking center. His body and that of his Mexican pilot, both showing signs of torture, were found a month later, buried in shallow graves. American officials accused their Mexican counterparts of letting Camarena’s killers get away. Caro Quintero was eventually hunted down in Costa Rica. At one point, U.S. Customs agents almost blocked the U.S. border with Mexico, slowing incoming traffic to a standstill while conducting searches of all Mexicans trying to enter the United States. Camarena’s fellow DEA agents considered him a hero in the war against drug trafficking and the El Paso Intelligence Center, where U.S. federal agencies collect information about Mexican drug barons, is dedicated to him. Times have changed since the low point, and . cooperation has strengthened, but Caro Quintero’s release Friday . reopened old wounds. Prison: Quintero spent the majority of his time behind bars at this prison in Guadalajara . Edward Heath, the former DEA . regional director for Mexico at the time of the Camarena killing who was . present during the identification of the agent’s body from dental . records, said the release reflected a broader lack of cooperation with . the U.S. from the new Mexican government, a contrast to the policy of . former President Felipe Calderon. 'You had a president that was . working very close with our government in a quiet way. These people come . in and so, boom, the curtain comes down,' said Heath, now a private . security consultant. 'It means a disrespect for our government.' He said he was skeptical of the explanation that there was a justifiable legal rationale for Caro Quintero’s release. 'There’s some collusion going on,' he said. 'This guy is a major trafficker. This guy is bad, a mean son of a gun.' Caro Quintero is said to have . pioneered links between Colombian cocaine cartels and the Mexican . smugglers who transport their drugs into the United States. The ruling left many wondering why it took so many years for judges to determine Caro Quintero was tried in the wrong court. 'They were always ''political'' prisoners serving sentences for as long as the U.S. kept up the . pressure,' said a former DEA official who once worked in Mexico. He is . not authorized to talk about the case because he still does work in . Mexico. Road to freedom: Mexican officials travel to the prison to inform Quintero that he is to be released . 'The bribe money to get them out . was always there. Mexican ''justice'' is always built on very weak . foundations. And they seem to like it that way. Sad,' he added. Raul Benitez, a security expert at . Mexico’s National Autonomous University, said the ruling may portend . more such procedural rulings following the January freeing of French . citizen Florence Cassez, who was convicted in Mexico for being part of a . kidnapping ring. The Frenchwoman served seven years . of a 60-year sentence before Mexico’s Supreme Court voted 3-2 to . release her in January because of procedural and rights violations . during her arrest, including police staging a recreation of her capture . for the media. 'What appears to be coming is an . avalanche of judicial appeals, with the drug traffickers hiring very . good, very expensive lawyers, arguing there were violations of due . process,' said Benitez. 'The government is going to have problems.' Mexican courts and prosecutors . have long tolerated illicit evidence such as forced confessions and have . frequently based cases on questionable testimony or hearsay. Such . practices have been banned by recent judicial reforms, but past cases — . including those against high-level drug traffickers — are often rife . with such legal violations. 'The government has to be . prepared to keep an eye on judges so that they don’t fall into the easy . argument of due process,' Benitez said, 'because there may also be . judges who are receiving money' to accept such arguments.","Rafael Caro Quintero was convicted of kidnapping, torturing and murdering DEA agent Enrique Camarena in 1985 .

"By . Jo Knowsley . PUBLISHED: . 17:08 EST, 10 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:06 EST, 10 August 2013 . High flier: Victoria Sadler took up burlesque dancing to counterbalance her £150,000 city job . After a decade in a high-flying job in the City, Victoria Sadler thought she had seen and heard it all: traders who used their expense accounts to take clients to strip clubs; colleagues openly mingling with prostitutes and vile sexist language bandied about on a daily basis. There was the 40-year-old trader who had a heart attack and died at his desk. And another who threw a tantrum in the office – sweating profusely and sniffing constantly then screaming ‘you bitch’ at her before he smashed her phone against the wall. He had not even bothered to wipe the tell-tale smudge of white powder from his nose. So when the disenchanted internal auditor took up burlesque dancing – swapping austere daytime suits for pink sequins, spangles and feathers in the evening – she never suspected it would end her £150,000-a-year career. Now, instead of auditing the professional behaviour of traders, Victoria has adapted their characteristics to feature in her routines. In one dance she begins dressed as Michael Douglas’s unscrupulous Wall Street trader Gordon Gekko and morphs into Madonna’s Material Girl in a basque covered in bank notes. She works under the name Victoria L’Etoile and performs for an audience dominated by men – but one over which she says she has total control. ‘When I took up burlesque in 2003 I was working at Merrill Lynch,’ says Victoria, 36. ‘I liked it because it countered the testosterone-fuelled environment of my working life. ‘Even though I was the pudgy, pasty-faced girl in the corner of the burlesque class I appeared to have a talent for it. I did keep it secret from the bank. Compared to the behaviour of those around me on the trading floor, it seemed a harmless hobby.’ But in 2008, when she was working for another major bank, a colleague sent an email to her employers containing a video clip of her performing at Soho cabaret bar Madame JoJo’s. Pressure: Victoria says drugs are rife among city workers under immense stress . Victoria had just been promoted but was accused of bringing the firm into disrepute – a charge which carried the threat of instant dismissal. ‘I was in shock,’ Victoria recalls. ‘I cried, broke down and rang my lawyer. The sheer hypocrisy of it was just astonishing. The banks quietly condone the poor behaviour of male traders but I was being faced with the sack.’ It was September 2008, the time of the financial crisis. ‘You would have thought the banks had more to worry about,’ she says. But Victoria was subjected to a painful and painstaking eight-month-long investigation. The final 200-page report from the bank’s human resources team, who had studied the video of her dancing, included comments that she stroked her leg during her act, and that her breasts ‘wobbled’ when she danced. ‘They pulled everything out of context,’ Victoria says. ‘They made it seem smutty.’ In September the following year she finally left in disgust, forced out by the ‘sexist’ bosses who refused to discipline her colleagues. Exposed: Victoria was disciplined when it emerged at the bank that she was also a burlesque dancer . Today she is more interested in her performances and has transformed her act to bring comedy – and her experiences of banking – into her act. ‘My audiences are a mixed crowd of men and women – the women “get it” when there’s satire and comedy, which after all is in line with the origins of cabaret. It’s very gratifying.’ Victoria is also releasing an explosive new book, Banking On Burlesque, in which she lifts the lid on what really takes place on the trading floors of the City’s biggest banks. She claims that at Merrill Lynch male colleagues openly boasted they were going to clubs to ‘get some slags’, and that one of her managers – a  married man with children – invited her into his office and wanted her to mark him out of ten for his naked body. There were also sexist insults on the trading floor. ‘The big screens on the trading floor were supposed to show news clips but they were showing women’s aerobics, on a loop,’ she said. Far more seriously she was appalled to discover fraudulent traders creating fake trades to boost apparent profits to secure their jobs and their bonuses. ‘I audited one trader who later was investigated by the bank. The sum involved was around £300 million,’ she said. ‘I was then told that was the fifth trader who had been investigated for suspected fraud that year.’ She claims drug taking was rife. ‘I never saw the traders take drugs, but I witnessed their behaviour,’ she says. ‘They weren’t taking drugs in a party way, it was to survive and cope with the stress.’ The eldest daughter of an architect father and mother who is a nurse, Surrey-born Victoria opted for a career in the City in 2000 after gaining a politics degree from Manchester University. ‘I never saw the traders take drugs, but I . witnessed their behaviour. They weren’t taking drugs in a . party way, it was to survive and cope with the stress.' Victoria Sadler . ‘It was one of the few jobs that paid enough to allow me to move out of home and buy a flat on my starting salary,’ she concedes bluntly. ‘I do think I was perhaps naive.’ But by 2002, when she was working as an internal auditor for Merrill Lynch, she was beginning to dislike the sexism and policies she saw on the trading floor. ‘I am a bolshie and brusque personality so I assimilated with the culture quite easily,’ she said. ‘But then there was a big sex discrimination case brought by Stephanie Villalba who had been the head of the private wealth division. She was the only female head of a department. Out of the blue she resigned and sued Merrill Lynch. ‘It was at that point that the scales began to fall from my eyes. Because I worked in internal audit I was responsible for investigating traders. I realised that every trader I saw had been white, and male.’ Around the same time Victoria was up for a pay review and had been discussing with a male colleague, who did the same job and got the same promotion, what their salaries and bonuses were likely to be. Glamour: Victoria as her burlesque alter ego Victoria L'Etoile, left, and her book, right . When he came out of the manager’s office he triumphantly revealed the figures, expecting she would get the same result. But when I went in the figures were different,’ she said. ‘He had got £60,000 and a bonus and I had £57,000. We had the same performance scores and reputation. ‘When I told the boss I knew about this he was furious and said we shouldn’t have been discussing it. They later offered to pay me more – even more than my colleague – as long as I kept quiet about it. ‘I thought, “Wow this sexist stuff does really exist.” It was the first clue I had that I would have to fight to be treated equally. ‘Merrill Lynch was like a boys’ club where everyone was trying to do the Gordon Gekko thing.’ 'The pressure on the traders was . immense. They looked like sick dogs who didn’t know how to . get out. They were cannon fodder and their behaviour was erratic.' Victoria Sadler . But if Merrill Lynch was a boys’ club, Victoria says the other bank was ‘a grim treadmill’. ‘The pressure on the traders was immense,’ she said. ‘They looked like sick dogs who didn’t know how to get out. They were cannon fodder and their behaviour was erratic. ‘Later, when I had my own discussions with my bank’s human resources department over my burlesque show, I talked about what I had seen in the industry. ‘I was told that there was no evidence that traders went to strip shows and no evidence that they took drugs. I was staggered.’ But had Victoria never considered her double-life as a performer might create problems? ‘No,’ she says. ‘But when I told my mother I had taken up burlesque she was appalled, and she gave me a warning:  “Watch who you tell.” ‘It wasn’t that she thought it was shameful, but I should beware of other people’s prejudices.’ After being forced out of the bank, Victoria got an 18-month contract with Goldman Sachs, where she felt that despite the devastation of the credit crisis ‘nothing much had changed’. Yet she insists, despite conceding she faces an uncertain future as  a writer and a dancer, that she has no regrets. ‘I enjoyed working in banking for a time,’ Victoria said. ‘But I’m much happier doing burlesque now and working on books. ‘In banking I felt I was losing my identity as a woman. I don’t want to go back to that hell. It was a world of abuse, sexism, ruthlessness – I felt like I was wasting my life. ‘Now burlesque has freed me from that. And the women in this world are bold and assertive – unlike the few pretty little female assistants you meet on the trading floors. ‘I’m 5ft 8in and a size 14 but burlesque is not about how you look. And my role models here are women who don’t need to take any crap.’","Victoria Sadler was a disenchanted internal auditor working in the city .

Demand from wealthy overseas buyers for multi-million pound London homes is fuelling a property bubble in the capital, experts say. High-end property prices are soaring as London becomes ever more attractive to foreign investors seeking a 'safe haven' for their cash, amid economic and political instability in many other parts of the world. Meanwhile new figures reveal a boom in the buy-to-let market, with lending to landlords topping £5billion. Booming market: The number of buy-to-let mortgage lenders has surged to levels not seen since 2008 . Some 40,000 buy-to-let mortgages were advanced in the three months until the end of June, worth £5.1bn in total. Demand for buy-to-let properties has also seen house prices driven up further in the capital, where one expert described an £850,000 house in Battersea that would give a gross rental yield of just 3.6 per cent before any costs to the landlord. 'That just cannot carry on,' buying agent Henry Pryor told the Guardian, adding that the capital was 'in a bubble'. But Mr Pryor said that, with London now on the radar of wealthy Brazilians, the bubble would 'grow before it pops'. Boom: House prices are creeping up to levels not seen since the financial crash . Bubble: Demand from wealthy overseas buyers is driving up property prices in Chelsea, Mayfair, and other boroughs of the capital identified as Prime Central London . The 40,000 buy-to-let mortgages advanced in the three months to the end of June marked an increase of just under a . fifth from the first three months of the year, according to figures from . the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML). It included a 24 per cent rise in remortgaging as landlords took advantage of cheaper deals on offer from banks and building societies. Demand: Multi-million pound properties in London's most exclusive areas are being snapped up by international buyers . It means the buy-to-let market is now at its most buoyant since the third quarter of 2008, when the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers sent global markets into freefall. But it remains much lower than at the peak of the housing market boom in the summer of 2007 when £12.7bn was lent in just three months. Jackie Bennett, head of policy at the CML, said the recent surge had been driven by strong demand from renters as well as low interest rates. New role: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said interest rates could stay at a record low . She said: ‘These conditions are creating more opportunities for landlords to remortgage, as well as helping to fund increased activity in the mortgage market more generally.’ But last night campaigners said the figures highlighted the widening gulf between the fortunes of borrowers and savers. Dr Ros Altmann, a former government adviser and savings expert, said: ‘This is great news for borrowers. ‘Those who have got plenty of money and can afford a second property are able to borrow at record low rates. ‘But people who have done the right thing and saved for the future are being wiped out.’ Meanwhile the number of properties in London's most desirable postcodes being snapped up by foreign buyers has sparked fears UK buyers are being priced out of the market. Buying agent Mr Pryor said the property market in the capital had 'lost touch with reality', pointing to soaring profits at upmarket estate agency Savills for evidence of 'everything you need to know about the housing market'. Thanks to booming sales in Kensington and Mayfair Savills average sale price has risen 18 per cent to £3.2million. Macroeconomic and financial consultancy Fathom Consulting identifies the most monied areas of the capital - including Kensington and Chelsea, Mayfair, Notting Hill and Belgravia - as Prime Central London. It said more than half of PCL properties that sold for upwards of £2million in the 12 months to March this year went to overseas buyers. When it comes to the most expensive of properties the trend is even more pronounced - the proportion of £5million plus properties bought with foreign cash is closer to 60 per cent, the report said. According to Fathom, the prime London market is currently more overvalued than any time since 1995 at the latest. Prime Central London: The rise in house prices across the country is most pronounced in exclusive areas of the capital . Peter Young, the Kensington-based . managing director of estate agent John D Wood & Co, told the . Guardian the boom in international buyers meant London was effectively becoming a . 'land bank'. From Chelsea to Notting Hill, house prices in London's most desirable postcodes are soaring. And a Fathom Consulting report reveals that, when it comes to multi-million pound properties, overseas buyers account for more than half of all sales. But what is it that makes international buyers so keen to spend their money in London? According to Fathom, there are three main factors contributing to the popularity of the capital's most exclusive areas. First, the weakness of the pound means beneficial exchange rates can boost foreign buyers' spending power. Second, the performance of global equity markets, and third, the perception of London as a 'safe haven' in which to invest money - immune from the troubles of the euro. He said: 'Would you put your money into the euro or sterling if you were a Russian? 'Do you trust Spain, France of Portugal for laws on property, tax, the government and economic stability more than Britain?' But Savils chief executive Jeremy Helsby said it was inaccurate to suggest UK buyers were being priced out of the market by overseas investors. 'They are still the majority buyers of secondhand properties and that trend is increasing,' he said. Nonetheless prices continue to rise, with Chesterton Humberts forecasting prime London properties to go up by 8 per cent a year between now and 2018. Sales director Debra Stroud said the estate agency was busier now than even 2007 - before the financial crash. While the rest of the country has not quite reached the heady heights of the London property market, house prices are rising thanks to the drop in mortgage rates since the Government introduced its Funding For . Lending Scheme to breathe life into the economy last summer. But the stimulus plan has caused misery for savers as banks have also rushed to cut interest rates on deposit accounts. The . bottomless pit of cheap money from the Bank of England means they no . longer need to attract savers’ cash by paying competitive returns. On . Wednesday the Bank of England said that rates could stay at a record . low of 0.5pc for another three years, as it unveiled its new ‘forward . guidance’ policy. Figures released today from estate . agency group LSL Property Services show that house prices in England and . Wales have reached their highest ever level - higher than the 2007 . peak. An average house now costs £232,969 - an increase of more than £500 a month in the past year. According to Savills, which sells high-end property, the average price of its London portfolio is £3.2m. Halifax also confirmed that house prices have been increasing at their fastest rate in three years. Stephen . Lewis, chief economist at Monument Securities, told The Guardian: 'The . danger is that, when a flood tide of mortgage finance meets a chronic . shortage of housing, the result will be an escalation of house prices.'","Some 40,000 buy-to-let mortgages approved in three months up to June .

A biologist from the Bahamas has discovered while that some sharks can be aggressive, others can be 'mellow'. He said that his evidence points to the existence of a 'personality' in the much maligned fish. Biologist Jean Sebastien Finger added that it is impossible to generalise the behaviour of one individual to a species. A study of young Lemon Sharks, like the one pictured, found they have personalities and fish that were novelty-seekers, were less sociable than sharks that played it safe when exploring a new enclosure . In a study of young Lemon Sharks, he found that some of the fish were novelty-seekers while others were less sociable and played it safe when exploring a new enclosure. Mr Finger, of the Bimini Biological Field Station in the Bahamas, conducted the first study of its kind into the behaviour of Lemon Sharks, which are relatively easy to capture and handle, measuring less than a metre when they are young. The biologist caught and tagged sharks living around 60 miles east of Miami and studied them in pools. In a bid to determine if the sharks were sociable he watched them swim together for 20 minutes and documented their behaviour every 30 seconds. Mr Finger told Smithsonian that two sharks typically follow each other and are sociable. In another test that looked at solitary sharks in a new pen measuring 80 feet squared, they displayed distinctive personalities. He said: They are not machines, they have personality.' A Bahamian biologist believes some sharks (a Hammerhead is pictured) can be 'mellow' and it is impossible to generalise the behaviour of one individual to a species . Certain sharks were more inclined to explore and were described as novelty-seeking, while others were more sociable, according to repetitive tests designed to ensure consistency. The scientist presented the results of the study - which found novelty-seeking sharks tended to be less sociable then their peers and vice-versa - at the Joint Meeting of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists. He said: 'You can’t generalise behaviour of one individual to a species.' Despite the species' reputation as a fearsome predator and an aggressive hunter, Mr Finger says some sharks are 'pretty mellow' compared to their peers. The biologist believes animals that usually live as part of a group take fewer risks than solitary creatures that are more prone to danger. His work sits neatly within a new field of science called behavioral syndromes that studies how creatures' behaviour differs from one individual to another, but how their reaction is also consistent in a certain situation. Mr Finger believes animals that usually live as part of a group like Great White Sharks (pictured) that hunt together, take fewer risks than solitary creatures that are more prone to danger . Scientists are interested in comparing research into animals' personalities across different species to see how the quality has evolved. A mixture of personalities in a group could potentially have a huge bearing on the survival of certain species. However, the idea that animals have personalities is not new and perhaps originated in the 1920s when Ivan Pavlov famously described his observations of different responses in dogs. In the 1930s, an American psychologist created a way of grading the behaviour of young chimpanzees, but now studies are more mainstream and many scientists agree that animals can behave as individuals.","Biologist from the Bahamas believes some sharks .

An infamous house of horrors where one of Britain's most brutal torture killings took place has now been sold for £250,000 as a 'delightful' development opportunity. Burnt House Farm in Tabley, near Knutsford, Cheshire was described by estate agents as having an 'excellent range of outbuildings providing tremendous potential standing' when it was put on the market this year. However, the details did not mention the horrific murder at the farmhouse ten years ago, in which a drugs gang tortured a man to death in front of his family. Crime scene for sale: Burnt House Farm was finally sold for just £250,000 because of the infamous murder of Brian Waters at the house . Makeshift torture chamber: Waters, who rented the farm, died a slow and agonising death at the property in 2003 before being dumped in the milking parlour . Drug money: Waters grew cannabis plants at the farm, pictured, but was also involved in narcotics trafficking and said to owe one of his torturers £20,000 . In June 2003 market trader Brian Waters, 44, who was renting the farm, suffered up to 167 different injuries to every part of his head and body, including 24 individual rib fractures when he was killed in the cowshed. Waters was beaten, whipped, burned, attacked with a staple gun and hung upside down before being assaulted with an iron bar, which fatally damaged his internal organs. Victim: Waters suffered around 167 different injuries as part of the gang's systematic torture . After the systematic torture his body was dumped in a milking parlour. At the Chester Crown Court trial, the . jury heard how Waters, a former chemists’ worker, had rented Burnt House Farm since 2002 and used it to grow cannabis. But he was also involved in narcotics trafficking with one of his killers drug dealer John Wilson and was said to have owed him £20,000. The murder of Waters was planned to exact revenge on him for the debt and took place in what was described as a 'makeshift torture chamber.' The . killers initially broke into the farmhouse and destroyed the cannabis . farm, then attacked the stepson of Waters’ business partner. He . was battered senseless dragged into the barn, where he was tied up by his . ankles with his face submerged beneath water in a . barrel. He was burned with chemicals and a pillowcase covering his head was set on fire as the gang laughed at his distress. Waters then arrived at the farm and was suspended upside down and used as a 'human punchbag.' When Waters’ son Gavin and a woman arrived at the farm they were abducted at gunpoint. In prison: Drug baron John Wilson, left, was the mastermind behind the murder over the unpaid debt, aided by James Raven, right, who had previously worked undercover for the BBC and Channel 4 . Gavin was put in a position with a rope round his neck so if he moved beyond a certain limit he would choke to death. The 21-year old woman was tied up and had her breasts fondled. Brian Waters’ wife Julie was also abducted from the family home and . taken to the scene of the murder. She arrived to discover that her husband had been murdered.

And now researchers have suggested that far from reading too much into their pet’s actions, they may well be right. Not only do dogs yawn when humans do, they are much more likely to do so if that person is their master. A new study shows how the irresistible impulse to yawn can even spread between humans and their dogs. According to researchers in Japan this could be an indication of empathy . Two cameras were used to record dogs' responses during the testing sessions. Owners called their dogs by name and then yawned, or made a yawning movement, after making eye contact . Scientists say this behaviour reveals . that dogs have a human-like ability to show empathy – the capacity to . identify with another’s feeling. Lead researcher Dr Teresa Romero said: . ‘Our study suggests that contagious yawning in dogs is emotionally . connected in a way similar to humans. ‘Although our study cannot determine . the exact underlying mechanism operative in dogs, the subjects’ physiological measures taken during the study allowed us to counter the . alternative hypothesis of yawning as a distress response.’ For the study, published in the . journal Public Library of Science ONE, the Japanese team from the . University of Tokyo recruited 25 dogs and their owners. Dogs watched their owner, or a stranger, yawn or mimic yawning mouth movements, while having their heart rate monitored. The researchers found that the dogs yawned significantly more in response to their owners’ actions than to the strangers’. Dogs were much more likely to yawn in response to their owner yawning than the actions of a stranger. The dogs were also far more sensitive to genuine yawns . The dogs' heart rates were monitored using a device strapped to their chests during the testing . They were also far more sensitive to genuine yawns, and yawned significantly less often after seeing fake movements. One possible explanation for the . behaviour is that it is a tension-releasing reaction to mild stress. But . the animals were found to have maintained a constant heartbeat during . the test which, combined with their heightened response to their owners’ actions, suggests they are reflecting their master’s feelings. In non-human primates, the phenomenon of contagious yawning has been observed in chimpanzees, bonobos, and gelada baboons . The researchers concluded: ‘Our . findings are consistent with the view that contagious yawning ... may . indicate that rudimentary forms of empathy could be present in . domesticated dogs.’ During the testing sessions two cameras were used to . record the dogs’ responses. Owners called their dogs by name, made eye contact with them and then yawned or made a yawning movement. Four test sessions lasting five . minutes were conducted, involving either a real or fake yawn by an owner . or a stranger. At the same time, the dogs’ heart rates were monitored . using a device strapped to their chests. In the human world it is known that contagious yawning affects around half of all adults, yet the causes remain unclear. Among animals, the phenomenon has been observed not only in dogs but also in chimpanzees, bonobo monkeys, and gelada baboons. And like humans, they are more . responsive to yawns from individuals with whom they have close social . bonds. A study earlier this year also found that dogs really can see . things from a human perspective – and that it influences their decision . making. Researchers discovered that when a . person forbids a dog from taking food, they are more than twice as . likely to disobey in a dark room than a lit room. The study suggest man’s best friend first considers what a person is able to see, before choosing whether to break the rules.","Study shows dogs are far more sensitive to genuine yawns from humans .

The internet could have been known as the catenet if an early web pioneer had got his way. In 1974, French engineer Louis Pouzin designed one of the first packet-switching technologies, which breaks down data into smaller 'packets' and send this information in parts wirelessly between computers. He called it the catenet - pronounced cat-en-et - and it was a precursor to what finally became the internet we use today. A French engineer who created one of the earliest precursors to the modern-day internet wanted the network to be called catenet. Although the term is now obsolete, his work into packet-switching technology that sends information wirelessly inspired some of the technologies used today . Packet-switching - This technology breaks down digital data, such as photos or emails for example, into smaller 'packets'. These packets are sent over networks, wirelessly between computers and information processing devices. The data is then reassembled at the other end. Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) - TCP/IP are the protocols used with packet-switching technologies on the modern-day internet. They format the packets - depending on . how and where they're being sent - transmits them from one decide how this data is received by a second device. Local area network -  LAN networks connect computers within a limited area such as a home and office. Catenet - The term used for a packet-switching network coined by pioneer and creator Louis Pouzin in 1974. It was a precursor for the internet. Arpanet - The world's first operational network to send packets over networks and the first to implement TCP/IP, which replaced its original protocols. Pouzin coined the phrase in a paper called A Proposal for Interconnecting Packet Switching Networks that he presented to Brunel University in London. Pouzin founded the Cyclades packet-switching network in the early 1970s. At this time the word 'network' meant what is now referred to as a local area network (LAN). This meant it was a network that connected computers within a limited area such as a home and office. It did not extend outside of this area, in the way the modern-day internet networks can. Pouzin's catenet network was the concept of linking these networks into a 'network of networks' that could give devices different addresses. It was created at a similar to time to the Arpanet packet-switching network that was the world's first operational network to send data packets. Arpanet became the first to adopt Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), which later became part of the framework for the modern-day internet. One of the limitations of the catenet network was that data was not always received in the same way that it was sent. Pouzin also did not implement the TCP/IP suite. The world's first operational packet-switching network was Arpanet. This map details the processes early versions of the network used. Arpanet was the first to implement TCP/IP which is still used in the modern-day internet. Catenet didn't adopt these protocols and became obsolete . The TCP/IP suite gives 'end-to-end' connectivity that specifies exactly how data packets should be formatted - depending on how and where they're being sent. The packets are then addressed, transmitted by the first computer or processing device and TCP/IP controls how the data is received by a second device. These protocols replaced earlier protocols presented by catenet as well as Arpanet because it was a much more efficient way of sending information. This became the basis for the internetwork, which was later shortened to internet, and led to the catenet term becoming obsolete.","In 1974 a French engineer created a information network called catenet .

A fossil of a squirrel-like creature, described as a 'great-great-grand uncle 165 million years removed' of modern man, has been discovered in China. The ancient mammalian relative, called Megaconus mammaliaformis, is one of the best-preserved fossils of . the mammaliaform groups, which are long-extinct relatives to modern . mammals. The discovery in Inner Mongolia has also provided evidence that traits such as hair and fur originated well before the rise of the first true mammals. An artist's impression of a Megaconus. The small mammal is older than T-Rex and had reptilian features and long poisonous spurs. Discovered in China by the University of Chicago, the creature has been compared to a modern-day squirrel and may be one the most ancient relatives of humans . The earliest evidence of hair or fur is in fossils of Castorocauda, from 164 million years ago in the Middle Jurassic. During the 1950s scientists suggested that the passages in the front of the upper jawbones of the Castorocauda were channels which supplied blood vessels and nerves to whiskers. This is thought to have been the first evidence of hair or fur. More recent research claims that the passages don't prove that the animal had whiskers because modern-day lizards have almost identical facial structures. Believed to date back around 165 million years, Megaconus co-existed with feathered dinosaurs in the Jurassic era, nearly 100 million years before Tyrannosaurus Rex roamed Earth. Zhe-Xi Luo, professor of organismal biology and anatomy at the University . of Chicago said: 'We finally have a glimpse of . what may be the ancestral condition of all mammals, by looking at what . is preserved in Megaconus. 'It allows us to piece together poorly understood details of the . critical transition of modern mammals from pre-mammalian ancestors.' Preserved in the fossil is a halo of guard hairs and underfur . residue, making Megaconus only the second known pre-mammalian fossil . with fur. It was also found with sparse hairs around its abdomen. On its heel, Megaconus had a long spur made from a tough protein substance which was thought to have been poisonous. Similar to those found on modern egg-laying mammals, . such as male platypuses, this spur is evidence that this fossil was most . likely a male member of its species. Researchers have described the Megaconus as being similar to modern-day squirrels, pictured. The fossil was found with sparse hairs on the animal's abdomen and fur around the top of the creature. This makes Megaconus only the second known pre-mammalian fossil to have fur . Professor Luo said: 'Megaconus confirms that many modern mammalian . biological functions related to skin and integument had already evolved . before the rise of modern mammals.' The biological features of Megaconus are described by scientists from the University of Chicago in the journal Nature. A terrestrial animal about the size of a large ground squirrel, Megaconus was likely an omnivore, possessing clearly mammalian dental features and jaw hinge. Its molars had elaborate rows of cusps for chewing on plants, and some of its anterior teeth possessed large cusps that allowed it to eat insects and worms, perhaps even other small vertebrates. It had teeth with high crowns and fused roots similar to more modern, but unrelated, mammalian species such as rodents. Its high-crowned teeth also appeared to be slow growing like modern placental mammals. The skeleton of the Megaconus, and in particular its hind-leg bones and finger claws would have given the animals a gait similar to modern armadillos, pictured. a previously unknown type of movement in mammaliaforms . The skeleton of Megaconus - especially its hind-leg bones and finger claws - likely gave it a gait similar to modern armadillos, a previously unknown type of movement in mammaliaforms. Prof Luo and his team identified clearly non-mammalian characteristics such as its primitive middle ear, still attached to the jaw, is often seen in reptiles. The Megaconus' anklebones and vertebral column are also similar to the anatomy of previously known mammal-like reptiles. Professor Luo said: 'We cannot say that Megaconus is our direct ancestor, but it certainly looks like a great-great-grand uncle 165 million years removed. 'These features are evidence of what our mammalian ancestor looked like during the Triassic-Jurassic transition. 'Megaconus shows that many adaptations found in modern mammals were already tried by our distant, extinct relatives. 'In a sense, the three big branches of modern mammals are all accidental survivors among many other mammaliaform lineages that perished in extinction.' The fossil is now in the collections in Paleontological Museum of Liaoning in China.","Fossils of the Megaconus mammaliaformis found in Inner Mongolia, China .

An elderly couple endured a seven year 'nightmare' when a council broke its own planning laws and filled a B&B next door to their house with homeless people. Norman and Mavis Wisbey, from Cambridge, were kept awake by the sounds of shouting, swearing, loud music and fighting emanating from the Green End Guest House, and they said police were frequently called out to disturbances at the property. The Wisbeys, who likened their ordeal to 'living in a war zone', say Cambridge City Council ignored their complaints for years before finally launching an investigation and apologising to the pensioners. 'Unacceptable': Norman and Mavis Wisbey, pictured with their friend Clare Blair, a former Cambridge City Councillor, described their seven year ordeal as like 'living next to a war zone' The problem had escalated to the point where the Wisbeys were too scared to leave their home for fear of it being damaged or burgled, and missed out on spending Christmases with their children and grandchildren to stay in the house. Moving would have meant selling their three-bedroom semi detached home in Cambridge for a fraction of the £300,000 it is worth. In 2002 the council’s own planners and a planning inspector ruled that only four rooms could be let at the B&B. Tormented: The couple grew too afraid to leave their house due to the 'barrage of inappropriate behaviour' at the B&B next door . But three years later the authority signed an agreement to place up to nine homeless people there, taking some from other councils' areas. The Wisbeys are now seeking compensation from the authority after an independent investigation found they had suffered a 'wholly unacceptable level of hostility, aggression and disturbance'. Police were called to the B&B on average three times a month said retired van driver Norman, 71, and his wife Mavis, a 69-year-old retired laboratory assistance. They made hundreds of complaints but it was five years before the authority launched a full investigation. Mrs Wisbey, who suffers from stress as a result of the case, said: 'We saved up for our own home but we were prevented from enjoying it. 'We couldn’t sit in our garden or we would be subjected to a barrage of swearing and inappropriate behaviour. 'It was like living in a war zone sometimes, and someone even committed suicide there in 2011. 'We were constantly on edge wondering who was going to move into the house next. There were nine strangers with various social problems - it was a recipe for trouble. 'It was horrible when mothers and children were in there and all you could hear was shouting. 'They chucked used tampons and condoms into our garden which we had to clean up ourselves. 'We could not sit and have our evening meal in peace - and all you could hear was loud rap music, death threats and every other word was a swear word.' Mrs Wisbey added: 'The council were flouting their own rules. 'They used the property for their own purposes without consideration for what the neighbours had to put up with. 'No-one should have to put up with what we did these last seven years, you shouldn’t have to live like that. 'The council have a duty to the homeless but they should have thought it through properly. 'They never checked with the planning department that what they were doing followed the rules.' Mr Wisbey said: 'We were always on edge, never knowing what’s going to happen. We couldn’t lead a normal life in our own home.' 'The owner has made a lot of money at our expense.' His wife added: 'The council has said the problems started in 2007, but we were making repeated complaints to the police and council from 2005. 'We were never in it for the money, we just wanted a peaceful life. But now we think the council should pay for its cock ups. 'We want the compensation to cover the full time we had to endure this nightmare. 'No-one else should have to endure all that we did over the years.' Apology: An investigation commissioned by Cambridge City Council indicated the authority had made mistakes including failing to share information across its departments . Mr and Mrs Wisbey say they started . making complaints about anti-social behaviour at the Green End . guesthouse back in 2005, but the council maintains it only has records . from 2007. Eventually . in 2010 the council recommended the hostel employ a night manager, but . the Wisbeys say they failed to keep the place under control. The landlord applied for ‘lawful development’ in 2012 to use more than four rooms, but planners turned it down. The . council took no action until Cambridge MP Julian Huppert and former . city councillor Clare Blair pointed out that their own planning status . restricted it to four tenants only. Independent complaints investigator Corinne Hibbert said the Wisbeys had endured a 'wholly unacceptable level of hostility, aggression and disturbance'. She added: 'I find it extraordinary that the council not only failed to uphold the decision of the planning inspectorate but encouraged use of the property in direct contravention of it.' She has recommended the council pays the substantial compensation to the couple. Simon Payne, the council’s environment director, said he had apologised to the couple. He said: 'The investigation that we commissioned shows we made mistakes, including failing to share relevant information between our own departments. 'We recognise that was unacceptable.' The B&B which stands next to the Wisbeys is now empty and a spokesman for the property owner claimed complaints had always been acted upon.","Norman and Mavis Wisbey disturbed by shouting and fighting at B&B .

A New York City surgical ophthamologist is offering free surgery and cosmetic procedures in exchange for dates with women who meet his stringent standards. In a case of, 'You scratch my back, I'll fix your face,' Dr Emil Chynn, 47, has taken to using business networking events as his own personal matchmaking service. According the The New York Post, the unlucky-in-love doctor, who runs Park Avenue SafeSight, attended a business networking event recently, only to hand out his business cards, along with his dating criteria, to random attendees, offering free plastic surgery for a date with the right woman. Fix up: Dr Emil Chynn is a successful surgeon but hasn't been quite so lucky in love . Having exhausted online dating options and matchmaking services, Chynn decided that, for the right woman, he's willing to pay. According to the Post, the woman of Chynn's dreams is aged between 27 and 35 - significantly younger than himself. She's thin, very thin - a size zero to two. She has no children and maintains a healthy lifestyle. She's Christian - but not too Christian. 'Any denomination is fine, I’m Catholic but not very religious, [I] prefer any religion over none,' reads Chynn's email. She's white ('not black, Hispanic or Asian'), the graduate of an Ivy League school, and on a scale of attractiveness from one to 10, she's an eight - nines and tens are too much trouble. And he doesn't want anyone who's vain or materialistic. Particular: Whether or not the skinny, beautiful, not vain, un-materialistic Christian career woman Chynn seeks actually exists is unknown - but if she does, he's determined to find her . The woman must have lived out of the U.S. for more than six months - and it can't have been a holiday. She must have lived in a city of one million people or more for more than one year. Her personality needs to be a 'Highly functional Type B (not a Type A because too similar, not a Type B who can’t get stuff done).' Dates for dollars: Anyone who finds Chynn the date of his dreams stands to gain cash, or perfect vision in one eye . And she must come from a good 'nuclear' family so she 'can emulate good patterns of behavior.' In return for a first date, Dr Chynn will hand over $100 to the matchmaker. For a second date, they will be treated to a Latisse eye-lash enhancing treatment or $200. The third date is Botox or $300 and the fourth date is free Juvederm injections. The fifth date seems designed to guarantee a sixth - free LASIK surgery on one eye, or $500 cash. The New York Post reports that Chynn sent out these requirements in a group email to colleagues and associates, some of whom he'd met only once. One of the recipients was blogger Marc Ensign, who met Chynn at a Department of Commerce networking event and received the email the next day. He posted it to his blog last week, but has since taken the post down. 'He kind of walked in, very hurried. He said, ""Here’s my card, I’m surgeon,"" and moved on to the next guy,' Ensign told The Post. 'We didn’t talk too much because he was busy, busy, busy.'

A quick search of Dr Chynn reveals he has previously posted odd Craigslist ads seeking 'assistants' to live rent-free at his surgery whose duties would include finding him a wife ($10,000 bonus) and walking on his back. In 2010, ABC News reported that Chynn had placed an eye-catching personal ad in Columbia University’s alumni magazine to 'outsource' the work of finding a mate. The ad in the Spring 2012 issue reads: . 'LASEK SURGEON: Featured in NY Times/Wall Street Journal. Dartmouth, Columbia, Harvard, Emory, NYU degrees.

His blackboard (pictured) outlines his morning routine - consisting of a shower and shave, walking the dog and then having lunch . Ricky Dean has notices all over his home (such as the pictured left) and even carries a card in his walet (right) to advise  him how to cope if he doesn't remember where he is . ‘My mates are constantly having a joke about it, which is good, telling . me I borrowed a tenner from them the week before.

"By . Inderdeep Bains . PUBLISHED: . 11:21 EST, 5 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:07 EST, 5 August 2013 . However friendly your boss is, they’re unlikely to be the first person you’d ask about family planning. Alas, wealthy socialite Countess Maya von Schoenburg thought otherwise. Not only did she ban her live-in housekeeper from getting pregnant for a year, but she also told the mother-of-one she had to ask her permission if she wanted to have another child. 'Overbearing': Teresa Filipowsa, seen left outside the tribunal, was told she had to keep her employer Countess Maya Von Schoenburg, seen right in a file photo, informed of any plans to expand her family . And when Teresa Filipowska, 36, did become pregnant four years later, she was dismissed within three days. Yesterday a tribunal ruled that the . 54-year-old countess, ex-wife of Mercedes Benz heir Mick Flick, was . ‘intrusive’ for imposing the rule. The socialite has been ordered to pay . Miss Filipowska almost £19,000 after she successfully won a claim for . unfair dismissal, sex discrimination and unpaid wages. She spent four years working for the . millionairess at her 13-acre country estate in Englefield Green, Surrey, . which was once home to Marilyn Monroe. The judge concluded that the countess, a companion of Lord Rothschild, . was ‘plainly annoyed and irritated’ when she learned of the pregnancy, . and it was a factor in the housekeeper’s dismissal. But the countess, who did not attend the hearing in Reading, Berkshire, . claimed she was forced to make her housekeeper redundant after she was . diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and moved back to her native Germany . for treatment. Country residence: Parkside House, Englefield, where Ms Filipowsa was the live-in housekeeper . Miss Filipowska said: ‘Initially, I was only asked to not get pregnant . in the first year which, despite my being entitled to, I did not. ‘The respondent continued to suggest on numerous occasions that I should discuss any family planning with her. Heir: Countess Von Schoenburg was married to Mercedes Benz tycoon Mick Flick . ‘The respondent was overbearing over the time I worked there, pressuring . me not to get pregnant without first “discussing it” with her. Nobody . should be made to sit around a table and discuss intimate family . planning issues.’ The countess hired Miss Filipowska in May 2008. She moved into a cottage . in the grounds of Parkside House with her partner Piotr Bartosiak and . her young child. Miss Filipowska claims that two years later the nanny left, so she was . given the added responsibility of looking after the countess’s daughter . when she was away. Miss Filipowska said the countess was often abroad for parties, adding: . ‘She is what can best be described as a socialite and has many famous . friends. ‘As a matter of confidentiality, I do not believe that it is appropriate . to identify who these people are but it is fair to say she is friends . with numerous high profile politicians (from the UK and America), actors . and other celebrities.’ She also hosted parties at which the housekeeper was expected to help. Miss Filipowska explained her days could start at 8am and not finish until 3am. ‘I was expected to be ready and available for any task at the request of the respondent,’ she said. ‘The job morphed from being a housekeeper to an on-call housekeeper, . nanny, taxi driver and came to involve Piotr, despite him never actually . being employed by the respondent.’ In November 2011 the countess moved to Italy. But the property was . rented out to a senior banking executive, and Miss Filipowska was . assured her job was safe. In the summer of last year the countess moved to Germany after being . diagnosed with cancer, but continued paying Miss Filipowska. Family planning: Ms Filipowsa, 36, successfully sued the countess for sexual discrimination and unfair dismissal . Last autumn the housekeeper, who now lives in Addlestone, Surrey, . discovered she was pregnant with her second child, and emailed the . countess to tell her. The countess replied with congratulations, but ‘suggested I ought to have discussed enlarging my family with her first’. Three days later the countess emailed again stating she no longer needed Miss Filipowska because her circumstances had changed. In statements to the tribunal the countess, who has recently undergone . surgery, explained that at the time she was making plans to sell her . home. ‘I called it an unfortunate coincidence of events that Teresa got . pregnant exactly at the same time when I had to make her redundant,’ she . said. Employment judge Robin Lewis said the conversations about pregnancy were . intrusions on a ‘personal and intimate matter that are no concern of an . employer’.","Teresa Filipowsa sued Countess Maya Von Schoenburg for unfair dismissal .

The Mayor of Rome is furious that the British embassy has warned tourists of the rising threat of thieves on the streets of the Italian capital. Ignazio Marino reacted angrily at the weekend to official warnings from the British government that alert visitors to evidence of worsening crime levels in Rome. Mr Marino took aim at David Broomfield, the British consul-general in the city, who last week sought to alert tourists to the high risk of personal theft by ‘co-ordinated gangs’ on Rome’s public transport system and at the city’s top visitor attractions such as the Vatican. Unimpressed: Rome's Mayor Ignazio Marino reacted angrily at the weekend to official warnings from the British government that alert visitors to evidence of worsening crime levels in Rome . Mr Broomfield urged British travellers to leave their valuables inside their hotel, claiming the gangs were a pervasive threat. ‘Visitors to Italy and especially to Rome should be aware of the high risk of personal theft, bag snatching, pick pocketing, that is endemic on public transport and at main tourist attractions in Rome,’ he notes on the British embassy’s official website. But Mr Marino, Rome’s newly-elected mayor, strongly rejected the travel alert, saying Britain are guilty of scaremongering. ‘Rome does not deserve to be the victim of alarmism,’ Mr Marino said. Advice: The British embassy urged travellers to leave their valuables inside their hotel in the city (file picture), claiming the gangs were a pervasive threat . ‘The incidence of petty crime in several European and American cities is much higher than in Rome. The capital is complex like many big cities but it is hospitable.’ 'Rome does not deserve to be the victim of alarmism' Ignazio Marino, Mayor of Rome . In May this year Rome made international headlines in a tourist rip-off scandal after British tourists Roger Bannister, his brother Stephen and their wives Wendy and Joyce, from Stourbridge in the West Midlands, were charged €64 (£55) for four ice-creams they ordered on the last day of their holiday in Rome. The incident triggered a debate in Italy about scams and rip-offs and now the threat of street crime has further damaged the city’s image. Mr Broomfield said Italian media had noted the high level of criminal activity over the summer tourist season, often involving gangs which include children.","Ignazio Marino reacts angrily to official warnings by British embassy .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . PUBLISHED: . 06:53 EST, 11 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:56 EST, 11 August 2013 . Killed: Shaaliver Douse, 14, was killed by police early Sunday. Officers say he pointed a gun at them . The gun found on the body of a 14-year-old boy shot dead by NYPD cops earlier this month was originally purchased at a Kentucky gun show the same year the slain teen was born. Federal investigators, hoping to learn how the 9mm Astra semi-automatic pistol got into the hands of young Shaaliver Douse, have tracked the gun back to Brian Quigley, of Crestview, Kentucky. Quigley bought the gun from T&J Sporting Goods in 1997 - the very same year that Shaaliver was born in the Bronx, New York. Quigley told the New York Daily News he gave the Spanish-made pistol to his roommate as partial payment for rent he owed. 'That gun was a piece of s***,' he said. When told that the gun had made it all the way to New York and was used by a teenager, Quigley was shocked. 'That’s crazy. I can’t believe that gun made it all the way out there,' he said. Quigley said he 'thought' his roommate handled the transfer paperwork on the pistol - though federal investigators found that the last recorded transaction for the gun was in 1997 when Quigley purchased it legally. Quigley's former roommate reportedly told investigators that the gun was stolen, though he never filed a theft report on the weapon. Quigley, however, said the roommate sister was involved with people in gangs in New York and Florida. Scroll down for video . This bloody 9mm handgun (pictured here) was involved recovered from an armed 14-year-old Bronx boy who was killed by a rookie NYPD officer . The NYPD says a rookie white police office shot and killed Shaaliver August 4 after the teenager raised the pistol and fired when two officers commanded him to stop and drop the weapon. Police released a gory picture of the black gun covered in the boy's blood. The New York City Police Commissioner, Ray Kelly, concedes that the teen may be the youngest person ever killed by the NYPD. Despite the tragic young age of Shaaliver, Kelly was quick to defend the 26-year-old officer, who just graduated from the police academy last month. Kelly said the teen had fired multiple rounds and was chasing someone through the streets of the Bronx about 3am Sunday. The NYPD says this video shows Shaaliver shooting at the man in the blue t-shirt and then chasing after him . When two officers confronted him, he refused to drop the pistol and pointed it at them, the Commissioner said at a press conference Sunday evening. The officer fired a single round from his 9mm service pistol, striking Shaaliver in the jaw and killing him. Police sources told the New York Times that they believe Shaaliver was pursuing a gang rival. Detectives believe the incident was also . related to the shooting of a 15-year-old boy on May 24, only a mile and a half from where he was shot on Sunday. In that incident Shaaliver was arrested and charged with attempted murder. The Bronx District Attorney didn't prosecute after the victim couldn't identify Shaaliver, according to the Daily News. Farrar said of the victim: 'This person can't keep their story straight.' Shaaliver was also due a court appearance later in August from a weapons possession arrest in October. Police say this teen in a white T-shirt is Shaaliver. He can be seen running after his target on the streets in the Bronx . Douse threw a loaded revolver to the ground on October 10, as reported to the Daily News. The . NYPD released a picture of an Astra 9mm semiautomatic pistol covered in . the boy's blood after his shooting on Sunday- in an effort to prove . that he was armed at the time he was killed. The department also produced surveillance video that purportedly shows Shaaliver in a white t-shirt running toward a man standing in . front of a bodega and opening fire. A second video . shows Shaaliver chasing the target around the corner. It was there that . the teen was confronted by police. When Kelly was asked whether the Bronx teen was the youngest person ever killed by a New York police officer, he hesitated. 'I don't recall any other at this juncture. There may have been, I just don't recall,' he said, according to the New York Post. Despite this show of evidence, his family has denied that the 14-year-old boy was involved in gangs and said the NYPD is trying to whitewash the killing. 'They're making it all up. There was no gun. It’s all a cover-up. It’s what the police do. They kill us and cover it up,' the boy's aunt Quwana Barcene told the Post. 'It’s not fair. It was my sister’s only child. You shouldn’t have to bury your child. My beautiful nephew got shot in the head. A mother of one now has to bury her only child.' NYPD top brass are standing by the officer in the shooting - but are treading carefully. 'Regardless of the circumstances, this is a crushing blow to any parent,' Kelly said. The crime scene (pictured here) was located in the Bronx where in the early hours of the morning two uniformed police officers found boy firing at a fleeing man . In the aftermath of the shooting NYPD officers carefully case the scene for evidence where two rookie cops shot an armed 14-year-old boy . Ms Barcene likened the shooting to . the death of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida - a case that sparked . outrage across the country. 'Him, . Trayvon Martin, it’s never going to end.' she said. 'A child. Fourteen . years old. Fourteen years old. Gone. Shot in the head. By police.' Many . in the black community remain highly skeptical of the NYPD over the . shooting death in march of 16-year-old Kimani Gray in Brooklyn. Police . said the teen also had a gun, though the shooting drew marches across . the borough in protest of the killing. Sunday . was not Shaaliver's first run-in with police. In May, he was arrested . and charged with attempted murder after he shot and wounded a . 15-year-old boy in the neighborhood. Police say they used surveillance . video from that that incident to identify Shaaliver among a group of . teens running from the scene. However, those charges were later . deferred and Shaaliver was released back onto the streets when the . 15-year-old victim couldn't testify against his shooter. Police believe that shooting was gang-related, as well. The fatal shooting occurred in the Bronx at the volatile corner of Courtlandt Avenue & 151st Street . The shooting occurred right near this Bronx convenience store where police discovered Douse firing shots at a fleeing man . Police . said the altercation Sunday started when Shaaliver, who lives in a . nearby housing project with his mother, opened fire on a man standing . outside a bodega in the crime-ridden Melrose section of the Bronx. The target fled, running down the street, with Shaaliver chasing after him. Two . officers, age 26 and 27, who had jointed the NYPD in January and . graduated from the academy last month, were in the area as part of an . Operation Impact deployment of police in the neighborhood. The . uniformed officers identified themselves as police and ordered . Shaaliver to drop his weapon when they confronted him, authorities said. Instead of dropping the weapon, police say, he raised it and pointed at the officers. One . of the officers opened fire shot him in the left side of the jaw, . police said. The teenager was pronounced dead at the scene. '(The officers) literally were half a block away from where the (first) shots were being . fired,' a police source told The New York Daily News. 'They ran . to the corner and there it was.' The man Shaaliver was firing at is still at large. Run-in with the law: Police say this picture shows Shaaliver running away after he shot a 15-year-old boy in the Bronx in May.

Brits have been facing an obesity crisis for years but now help is at hand in the shape of fit and toned personal trainer Jessie Pavelka. The L.A. based 30-year-old has been helping Americans with their battle with the bulge and now he's come to the UK to offer his advice on the Sky TV show Fat: The Fight For My Life. On the programme, Jessie meets morbidly obese Brits and advises them how they can shape up and change their lives. Fat fighter: Jessie Pavelka advocates a healthy lifestyle . Love to workout: The weightloss expert wants people to embrace exercise and the way it can make them feel . He told the MailOnline: 'For many of them, it was almost as if they had given up. They had tried gimmick diets that just weren't working. My approach is not to just cut food but to get active. In doing so, you then feel better about yourself.' He added: 'It's great when my clients lose weight but I also want to change how they feel about themselves.' Sport has always been a huge part of Jessie's life and he was a bodybuilder before moving into a career as a weightloss expert. Stuck in a body she didn't like: Alison was 26 stone before she followed Jessie's advice . Get active: Jessie taught Alison to face her fears and push her boundaries to try new things . Turned a corner: She has lost 9st, right, and never felt happier . He trains every day doing interval sessions, resistance training and running. But he said people don't have to do as much exercise as he does to notice the benefits. He said: 'The first thing I tell clients is get off the couch! Just start making some small lifestyle changes such as walking to work instead of driving or taking the stairs instead of the lift. The small things you can change all add up.' Jessie recommended the participants on Fat: The Fight For My Life to try these sort of lifestyle changes. He also got them to do low impact resistance training before making them push themselves harder through exercise alongside healthier eating. New horizons: Jeni also lost 9st, right, with Jessie's help and now wants to start a family . He worked with each of them over a year, in person when he was in the UK and then via Skype. He said: 'They all had to be vulnerable and open to change. They had to trust me. My aim was to get them to fall in love with exercise and the freedom it gives you. It helps you feel good about yourself and it also means you can treat yourself to the odd burger because you've earned it.' The Brits who Jessie helped shed the pounds included Alison, a comfort eater who had ballooned to 26st. She would drive a mile from her home to her workplace at a petrol station where she would be sedentary all day. Jessie said: 'Alison had never challenged herself, she needed to step outside her boundaries and face her fears.' Simple to shape up: Jessie said small changes can go a long way in making a difference to your health . Alison summed up her situation as a 'hopeless place to be, stuck in a body that you don't like.' She added: 'A lot of the time I didn't think about my size or the weight I was, because I think if I did I'd never leave the house.' Jessie got Alison to face up to her size and the fact that it meant she was in danger of developing major health problems such as diabetes. He got her to take simple steps such as walking to and from work instead of driving and pushing herself with workouts including boxing - as well as cutting out the junk food she usually consumed. Seven months later she lost 9st and 3lbs and has never felt better. She said: 'You've no idea how glad I am that I started this journey - there's no words to explain how lucky I feel and how proud I am that I've done it and seen it through. This is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, but easily the most rewarding’. Also featured on the progamme is Jeni who, with Jessie's help, dropped from 22st to 12st and now hopes to fulfill her dream of starting a family - as her size had been a barrier to getting fertility treatment. Jessie said it's rewarding seeing how much his clients change - not just physically but emotionally.He said: 'There were times on the programme where they all resisted my advice or were frustrated but the transformation they have all made is amazing, just from leading a more healthy lifestyle.'The TV programme shows the dark and light sides of their journeys and the real rewards they gained. I hope it can inspire people watching to think ""I can do that.""' Fat: The Fight of My Life is on Sky Living HD Monday nights at 9pm .","Jessie Pavelka is a weightloss expert .

For evidence that we are becoming more self-centred, you need look no further than your bookshelf. Analysis of more than 1.5million books has revealed the use of the word ‘get’ has gone up while ‘give’ has fallen out of favour. Modern books also favour feelings over religion and choice over obedience. Analysis of more than 1.5million books has revealed the use of the word ¿get¿ has gone up while ¿give¿ has gone down . The changes, revealed in a study of British and American books published between 1800 and 2000, including popular and academic works. The University of California researchers say the changes in the printed work reflect the change in values that comes with urbanisation, with caring, sharing rural communities being increasingly replaced by materialistic, go-getting town and city-dwellers. Psychologist Patricia Greenfield used a computer programme provided by Google to assess the frequency key words appeared in almost 1.2million American books. Key words included ‘obliged’, picked because of the importance of duty in small family-orientated communities,  and ‘choose’, a word which denotes the freedom of choice important to modern generations. The use of ‘obliged’ fell at least six-fold over the 200 year studied, while ‘choose’ became increasingly common.  By the 1930s, authors spoke more of choice than they did of obligation. Frequency of use of the words ‘act’ and ‘feel’ was also compared. Other recent research found that modern-day British novels lack emotion . By the 1970s, books spoke more of feelings than of actions. The analysis, published in the journal Psychological Science also showed a move from giving to getting. Use of the word ‘get’ quadrupled from 1800 to 2000, reflecting, it is though a move towards a more materialistic society. However, there was a blip in its rise between 1940 and 1960. Researchers say this could be a reflection of a greater community spirit during the Second World War and the civil rights movement. The study also revealed the words ‘obedience’, ‘authority’, ‘belong’ and ‘pray’ to be in decline. The task was repeated using an online library of 350,000 British books which produced similar results. Professor Greenfield said: ‘These replications indicate that the underlying concepts, not just word frequencies, have been changing in historical importance over time. ‘Developing countries have become wealthier, more urbanised, more technologically advanced and more highly educated. ‘But the process also applies to countries such as the United States and United Kingdom. ‘The trend is particularly noticeable if one views the situation over a timescale of centuries, as in the present study.’ Other recent research found that modern-day British novels lack emotion – perhaps because we have started to feel it is a weakness to show our feelings.","Study analysed 1.5million British and American books published between 1800 and 2000 .

Assaulted: Ray Widstrand, 26, suffered potentially fatal brain swelling after he was attacked by a gang of youths . A man is in a critical condition after he was brutally assaulted by a teenage gang, a stone's throw from the local police station. Ray Widstrand was enjoying a late-night walk through . his neighbourhood on St Paul’s East Side and was attacked as he walked . through a group of 30 to 50 juveniles and young adults.

The BBC has called in external auditors to widen the search for excessive severance payoffs made to its senior executives, it emerged last night. The corporation’s director general Tony Hall told staff in an internal email he has ordered KPMG to look at deals made to departing staff prior to 2010 to get to the bottom of the severance pay scandal. The National Audit Office is investigating the files of 90 senior managers handed golden goodbyes in the past three years to see if they breached contractual limits. Questions: The BBC is under pressure over the scale of severance payments to senior managers . Its devastating report found the BBC handed its staff £369million over eight years, but only looked in detail at the most recent cases. The KPMG review means even more high-profile deals could come under scrutiny, including a £500,000 payoff to former BBC1 controller Peter Fincham in 2007. He resigned in disgrace after he was criticised for making false claims about doctored footage of the Queen. Lord Hall has already asked for a ‘detailed briefing’ into his payoff, although the BBC has not yet confirmed whether it will publish what he is told. Another historic payoff likely to come under the spotlight is a six-figure sum handed to Lesley Douglas, a former controller of Radio 2 who resigned over the ‘Sachsgate’ scandal involving Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross. Police: Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley has written to Tory MP Rob Wilson to confirm fraud squad officers are gathering evidence covering BBC pay-offs . Many BBC staff on lower salaries are understood to be furious at the high severance payments. In his email to staff yesterday, Lord . Hall tried to boost morale, saying: ‘I know this issue has provoked a . very strong reaction from many of you and I understand why you feel that . way. Lord Hall was yesterday accused of attempting to keep an internal inquiry into one controversial payoff secret. He ordered workers to brief  him verbally about a deal to award former BBC1 controller Peter Fincham £500,000 in 2007, meaning that the results would not be published. He is now reportedly reconsidering his decision after being asked whether the BBC was trying to prevent the release of information which could embarrass them. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The format of the presentation of the information is yet to be confirmed.’ 'It is worth saying however that severance pay in general was part . of an attempt to reduce senior management numbers, and in the process we . did save £35m which went back into programme-making and will continue . to do so at a rate of £19m a year as we move forwards. ‘However, it is clear this was not . done in accordance with best practice – that is why we have already . tightened up procedures and also why we will not contemplate this level . of payoff in the future, even though senior posts will continue to . decline in number.’ Yesterday, it was revealed the . Metropolitan Police are assessing whether to investigate BBC staff over . allegations of misconduct in public office as a result of the scandal. Lord Hall said he had ‘not had any approaches from the police on this . matter’. A BBC spokesman would not comment on which specific deals KPMG is likely to look at.

Jason and Michelle Phillips, their sons Louis, 15, Luca, five, and Cobie, three, and daughter Evie, one, are signed to one of the country’s biggest modelling agencies. Advertisers are so keen to use them that they model together eight times a month for up to £6,000 a go. Industry experts say it is rare to find an entire family of appealing people who all want to take part in shoots.

A father-of-one has told how his testicles were left dangling five inches down his thigh after he slid off his boat and got them caught on a hook. Roofer Pete Lovett, 48, was enjoying a day out on his motorboat off Calshot in Hampshire when he decided to have a swim and slipped down off the boat into the sea. But as he did so, he got his private parts caught on a steel bracket used to carry the jet ski - nearly castrating him and leaving him in danger of bleeding to death. Roofer Pete Lovett, 48, was left dangling by his scrotum after catching it on one of these steel jet ski hooks . Mr Lovett, from Wolvey in Warwickshire, was enjoying a day out on this boat when the accident happened . Mr Lovett, of Wolvey in Warwickshire, said he was left hanging by his sexual organs for several seconds before he pulled himself back up and felt between his legs. 'I put my arms between my legs and realised to my horror there was nothing there,' he said. The accident happened as Mr Lovett, his wife Lorna, 49, and their 21-year-old son Alex spent the day on their 32ft boat Tanzanite, sailing, swimming and riding their jetski, before Mr Lovett decided to go for a swim. He said: 'The jet ski was tied to the back of . the boat and I tried to scooch my bum over the snap davits - steel . brackets which the jet ski was tied to. 'Somehow I misjudged how high it was and the hook pranged my wetsuit, hooked me up and pulled me backwards. 'The metal went right through my . scrotum and for five to six seconds I was hanging from it, floating in . the sea as it ripped through my scrotum. Fitness instructor Lorna Lovett, 49, called emergency services while her husband held a gauze to his wound . Mr Lovett said the surgeon who put him back together winced when he told him what had happened . 'It was terrible. When I came up, I really did put my arms between my legs and to my horror found there was nothing there. 'I scrambled back on board and Alex, who had been sitting right next to me, knew something horrible had happened. 'He said, 'Dad, are you ok?', and I said: ""No, it's serious"". 'I work on building sites and am used to bangs and crashes, but this was different.' Mr Lovett's testicles were dangling by just the vas deferens tubes. He said: 'If it wasn't for the tubes holding my testicles, they would have gone into the sea and I would never have seen them again. He asked his son to take the jet ski . to shore and talked his fitness instructor wife through calling for . help as he pressed gauze into the wound. The roofer spent a week recuperating after his accident and the wound split open twice but he is now better . A crew from Hamble Lifeboat, an independent lifeboat station, was on scene within nine minutes and Solent Coastguard Helicopter was then . scrambled to airlift the bleeding Mr Lovett, whose testicles were dangling five inches down his leg, to Southampton General Hospital. Two specialist plastic surgeons were drafted in from their holidays and stitched Mr Lovett, who had never been in hospital before, back together in a three-hour operation. He said: 'I knew I was in trouble and hadn't got time to think about the pain. Luckily nothing was ripped out and fully removed. 'Although there was quite a lot of skin missing, they put my balls back where they should go with the skin I had left. 'I'm lucky - if the hook had punctured two inches either side of where it did, it would have hit an artery and I'd have been a goner.' - Pete Lovett, 48 . 'The next morning a surgeon came and . sat on my bed and said ""I've heard some stories - how did you do it?"". They couldn't figure out what I'd done. 'He put his hands between his legs and said ""Bloody hell, that sounds painful"".' Mr Lovett recuperated for a week before returning to work but suffered a couple of painful setbacks when the scar split open twice. Now fully recovered, although he doesn't want any more children, Mr Lovett insists he's 'lucky'. He added: 'If the snap davit had . punctured two inches either side of where it did, it would have hit an . artery in my leg and I would have been a goner. 'I owe a huge thank you to the emergency services and feel massive gratitude that they were there for us in our moment of need. 'They got me from that terrible position to being put back together within hours.' Mr Lovett, who left hospital with 32 stitches along a six-inch scar the next day, is now back at work and slowly recovering. He has launched a campaign called Pete's Plums and hopes to raise £10,000 for the lifeboat crew that helped save his life.","Pete Lovett was left dangling by his scrotum from a steel hook after slip .

Horrific: Dutch Prince Johan Friso and his daughter Zaria earlier this year. He was trapped while on holiday in Lech, Austria in February 2012 and never regained consciousness . He was initially treated in a London hospital and was brought back to The Hague last month. The Dutch royal’s death comes just months after his mother Princess Beatrix abdicated in favour of her oldest son, now King Willem-Alexander. Prince Friso, full name, Johan Friso Bernhard Christiaan David, Prince of Oranje-Nassau, also himself gave up his claim to the throne in 2003 in order to marry commoner Mabel Wisse Smit, with whom he had two daughters, Princesses Luana and Zaria. Happier times: Dutch Prince Johan Friso right and his wife Mabel Wisse Smit during their wedding in Delft, the Netherlands in 2004 .

Following the accident his condition was at first described as 'stable but life-threatening', and the queen and his wife came to be by his side. At the time Stefan Jochum, a spokesman for the Lech ski area where the accident occurred, said the incident took place as the prince and other skiers were on slopes away from the marked Lech ski runs which were laden with snow after weeks of record falls.

Difficult: The men had to lug huge backs holding their tent and food supplies across the glacier - Iceland's second largest . It involved a challenging ten hour trek on skis to cross 33km of the glacier - Iceland's second largest. The prince was joined by members of his UK South Pole team Glenfiddich and West, 43, star of The Wire, who will head a rival Commonwealth team in the Walking With The Wounded charity event in November. Conditions were variable, from slushy wet snow for the first couple of days to stunning clear conditions with hard crispy snow underfoot for the final day. Each evening the team was met with sleet which froze quickly to goggles making visibility difficult, reminding everyone of the challenges and frustrations they must overcome in this environment.

Hard work: The team had to march through wet snow and sleet - making it difficult to dry off equipment . Prince Harry is now in Angola on a visit for the 25th anniversary appeal of a mine clearance charity which was championed by his mother Diana, Princess of Wales. The Prince is working on behalf of the HALO Trust, his spokesman said. His late mother was passionate about its work in trying to rid mines and unexploded devices from war-torn lands. His spokesman said: 'Prince Harry, as patron of the HALO Trust's 25th Anniversary Appeal, is currently on a private visit to Angola to see HALO's mine clearance and will be touring minefields and meeting beneficiaries of HALO's work'. The late Princess Diana visited minefields being cleared by HALO in Angola just before her death in 1997 to help draw world attention to the horror of landmines. Duncan Slater, who has had both his legs amputated below the knee after his vehicle hit an IED in Afghanistan, can be seen removing one of his prosthetic leg during the trek . Pushing themselves to the limit: Members of the UK team for Walking With The Wounded on a training exercise in Iceland at the end of July . The HALO Trust works with some of the world's most vulnerable people so they can plant their crops, rebuild their homes and raise their families in safety once the mines have been cleared.

The man who killed his 9-year-old son during a supervised visit Sunday apparently did so to spite the boy's mother, authorities said. 54-year-old Muni Savyon was meeting with his son Joshua and a counselor at the YWCA in Manchester, New Hampshire when he brought out a hand gun and shot his son several times before turning the weapon on himself. The counselor escaped unharmed. 'There's a lot of sadness and also anger on the part of everyone involved that a father would take his son's life for no other reason than apparently to spite his mother,' New Hampshire Assistant Attorney General Jeffery Strelzin told the Boston Herald. Scroll down for video . Dead: Muni Savyon shot and killed his 9-year-old son Joshua Sunday during a supervised parental visit at a YWCA in Manchester, New Hampshire . The boy's mother had dropped Joshua off at the YWCA around 9:30am and was not in the building when the shooting happened.The organization is open on Sundays for supervised child visitation and custody exchanges.The couple's marital status wasn't clear: Savyon's rabbi said the couple were divorced while law enforcement officials said the two were separated. Muni, a software engineer, sent an email to a friend suggesting he was suicidal before the shootings. He had a troubled relationship with the boy's mother and threatened to kill them and himself before. Response: Police arrived to the scene quickly and in force after 10am Sunday, forming a perimeter . Shooter: Not knowing whether the shooter was alive or dead, police raided the building in a strategic manner . Intent: Savyon had threatened to kill himself, his son and the boy's mother before . 'She had reservations which is why he was having supervised visits,' Strelzin said. Savyon  also recently lost his younger brother who suffered a heart attack in their home country of Israel. His . rabbi, Levi Krinsky of Chabad Lubavitch, said the man was depressed . when he returned from Israel to bury his brother but that no one . expected he was capable of killing his own son. Motive: Savyon's rabbi, Levi Krinsky, said the man had become depressed after his younger brother died in Israel recently from a heart attack . 'He was just very broken, which I thought was directly related to his brother's passing,' Rabbi Krinsky told the Boston Globe. 'Did I think he was suicidal? No. Did I think he was dangerous? Not in the slightest. Apparently this is what he was thinking. End it all.' Savyon's ex-wife Ellen Vig - not the boy's mother - got a copy of the suicide email written in Hebrew which she says spells out his intentions and what he wants done with his property. Vig divorced Savyon in 1997, but remained friends with her ex-husband. She described him as a kind-hearted person who loved his son and tried to give the boy varied experiences. 'He was non-violent. He would try to help anyone he could. He was a really nice guy,' she said from her home in North Billerica, Massachusetts. Police and emergency services responded at approximately 10:30 a.m. to a . report of shots fired inside the YWCA in Manchester, New Hampshire . Families: On Sundays the YWCA is open for supervised child visitation and custody exchanges . Savyon was active in Libertarian causes, Vig said, and was a twice-defeated candidate for the New Hampshire Legislature, most recently in February. Current New Hampshre State Representative Peter Sullivan said Savyon was a political hopeful in years past . ‘Muni Savyon was my opponent in the special election a few years back,’ Sullivan, who easily beat Savyon, wrote on his Facebook Sunday. ‘He was a gracious opponent. I am utterly stunned at the news concerning this morning's horrific events.’ Born in Israel, Savyon was a naturalized citizen who lived in several Western states before coming to New England, where he worked as a software engineer, Vig said. Others were inside the YWCA building when the shots were fired partway through the one-hour visitation. The counselor who was present at the time managed to escape unarmed, officials said. The YWCA issued a statement late Sunday saying its 'thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of all those involved in this incident.' Perhaps most tragic is that the . incident could have been prevented if the organization had enough money . to hire security officers - something they've done in the past. 'There wasn't any security in place other than the fact that there was a counselor in the room,' Strelzin said. 'They've had security in the past and were able to hire police . officers, but because of budget cuts they haven't been able to do that . recently.","Muni Savyon, 54, of Manchester, New Hampshire killed his son Joshua around 10am Sunday .

To entice the swarms of honey bees to land contestants wear a queen bee in cage from around their neck, the Journal reports.

Marenda Schipper and Patrick Boelsterli model their bee beards that typically weigh 4 lbs and are made up of 13,000-16,000 bees . Bees flock on to the contestants faces and upper torsos around their queen as the recognize and are drawn to her scent, the BBC reports. Veteran competitors use petrolatum, a substance bees avoid, to help sculpt and 'grow' their bee beards into particular shapes, the news organization goes on to report. In addition, to keep the participants from being stung the bee keepers keep the colonies well feed with sugar water and sedate the bees with smoke before letting them amass on the contestants. All smiles: University student Schipper smiles as thousands of bees cover most of her face . To determine the weight of the beards judges weight the contestants before and after the bees collect on their face, according to the BBC. It takes about 5,000 bees to weight a pound. Officials also judge the contestants based on the beard's style and the performance each person puts on for the audience. In the past contestants on the catwalk have managed to hula hoop while covering by the stinging insects. Covered: Only Schipper's nose peeks out from under her bee beard as she competes in the Pioneer Games on Clovermead Farm . This year's competitiors included everyone from middle-aged adults to University students. The 2013 winner was Justin Hiemstra, who won for having the heaviest beard, according to Ruptly.com. Marenda Schipper was also recognized for her beard's atheistic with the 2013 Judge's Choice Award.","In the 9th Annual Bee Beard Competition held in Ontario, Canada competitors covered their faces with bees to form a 'beard'

One of North America's rarest birds has fought back from the brink of extinction and is enjoying a renaissance - on a rocky outcrop used by the US Navy as a firing range. The San Clemente Island loggerhead shrike is thriving on the rocky outcrop off the Californian coast, known as the 'boom box'. In the 90s its numbers had dwindled to just seven breeding pairs, but now there are believed to be 70 on the island. Back from the brink: A San Clemente Island loggerhead shrike chirps away in its enclosure at a facility on San Clemente Island . It is a remarkable success story given the black, grey and white songbird shares its home with an area that is regularly bombed by US Navy battleships. The Navy itself has claimed credit for the shrikes survival after it launched a  $3-million-a-year captive breeding programme to protect the threatened species, according to a report in the Telegraph. Where once the volcanic island was pitted with craters, the investment programme has allowed native plants to be reintroduced, such as the Channel Island tree mallow. Warhead: An old target from the days of extensive Navy bombardments now decorates the scenic coast . Vital work: Wildlife biologist Melissa Booker is helping to protect a variety of endangered species on San Clemente Island . Navy biologist Melissa Booker said: 'The shrike seems to be unaffected by the loud noises. Ms Booker added: 'Some places that . resembled cratered moonscapes are now covered with native shrubs so . thick it's hard to wade through them.' Snipers have been told to the nests of . endangered birds, such as the shrike. The nests of western snowy plovers . have even been moved out of the way of tanks. Aid: The US Navy injects $3million each year to help protect the wildlife on the island, such as the shrike . Saved: Botanists have prevented the Channel Island tree mallow from being wiped out on San Clemente Island too . San Clemente Island . fox numbers have also bounced back from just a few hundred 10 years ago to about 1,100 . And the Navy is now trying to get the San Clemente night . lizard taken off the endangered species list, after numbers increased. According to the Pentagon, $73 million was spent on protecting more than 400 species across an area of 28 million acres last year. They are making the investment to avoid possible confrontations with conservationists. Commander Christopher Kirby, the officer in charge of San Clemente, said: 'If we were to abuse the island, we would lose it.'Noah Greenwald of the Center for Biological Diversity, said: 'They're doing some good things for endangered species, which is great, but there are activities that are really damaging to the environment at the same time.'

Tracked: Anthea Orchard, 35, discovered a GPS tracker device on her car while signed off sick from her job with the fire service . A 999 operator who was on sick leave from the fire service found a GPS tracker planted on her car by a private detective hired by her bosses. Mother-of-two Anthea Orchard, 35, discovered the device after neighbours told her they had seen men acting suspiciously outside her home in Bradford. Mrs Orchard, who had been signed off work at West Yorkshire Fire Service due to stress and hyperthyroidism, has hit out at her former employers for using public money to employ somebody to 'infringe on my family life'. The call centre worker - who has since left the service with an £11,000 pay-off - said her bosses had suspected her of turning her hobby of balloon-making into a business while she was on sick leave. Mrs Orchard said she became convinced she was being watched when she began to receive telephone calls at home from people asking her to do work for them. She added that men had been spotted hiding in cars outside her house. 'I was getting phone calls from people trying to get me to take on work,' said Mrs Orchard, who lives her her husband Gareth, daughter Ashleigh, five and son Haydn, two. 'I'd told them I couldn't because I was signed off work. 'The number hadn't been withheld and when I looked it up it was for a private investigator,' she said. Mrs Orchard, who has since left West Yorkshire Fire Service with an £11,000 pay-off, then discovered the tracker device hidden on her car. 'This is an infringement into my family life,' she said. 'The whole situation has made me very ill. It is not right that public money is being used in this way. 'The car is in my name, but it was also used by my husband. 'One of my children was just a baby when this surveillance started,' she said. 'Since then I’ve spent £300 on installing blinds on my windows. 'It was horrible to think someone was watching us. 'When I saw a man laid down in the car near my house, I never felt so scared in all my life.' 'Scared': Mrs Orchard, from Halifax, says the fire service hired a private detective who planted the tracking device on her car . 'Extreme case': Mrs Orchard has now left the fire service after reaching a 'compromise agreement' with her former employers . Mrs Orchard started working on a potential balloon decorating business last June while on maternity leave. While on maternity leave she developed hypothyroidism - which affected her cognitive functions - and she was advised by a doctor not to work long hours or night shifts. 'In my spare time I was doing the balloon stuff, it wasn't using up much of my concentration and energy and I enjoyed doing it and meeting people,' Mrs Orchard said. When she went back to work in October last year she needed to ask permission from West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue to carry out secondary employment, but hadn't dealt with it after two weeks of being back at her desk. The tracking device was left on the back of Mrs Orchard's Audi while she was off sick . Several days later she said she was taken in to a room and handed a letter saying she was under investigation. On October 31, she signed off sick due to stress at work, depression and her recently diagnosed condition. She said: 'As soon as I booked sick, I refrained from work. My husband took over the reins of the simple stuff but I didn't work with the balloons. I took the website down and didn't think of doing any more.' Mrs Orchard was exonerated by the probe but complained to her bosses and contacted the Fire Brigades Union. She has now left her job after signing a 'compromise agreement' in which she agreed not to take the service to court for human rights violations over 'unnecessary surveillance or invasion into privacy and family life'. In a separate letter, Mrs Orchard was told this clause was added to the service’s usual wording due to the 'specific circumstances' of her case. Mrs Orchard said she was advised by the Fire Brigades Union to check her car. She said: 'Straight away I could see it wasn't right. When I tried unlocking the towbar it wouldn't come away from the bumper, so I had to pull it and that's when the tracker fell down. 'It was a PVC pouch with a sim card inside, stronghold magnets to hold it to the chassis of the car and a heavy duty battery. The unit is locked so we removed the sim card to deactivate it.' David Williams, West Yorkshire secretary at the Fire Brigades Union, said: 'This is an extreme case. 'It’s sad that they go to all that trouble and expense to see if someone is working on their days off. 'It’s a shame they feel they have to stoop to this level. It’s not great when they are spying on their own employees.' Mrs Orchard’s Tory MP, Philip Davies, said: 'I’m generally for intelligence-led investigations. If groups like the Department of Works and Pensions didn’t do this people would be asking why. 'If it is done well then it can work, but it shouldn’t be used whenever someone is off sick.' Mrs Orchard has also contacted Carrie Austin, of private investigation firm Local PI, who confirmed to her that one of its agents fitted the GPS tracker to her car, and even asked her for its return. West Yorkshire Fire & Rescue Service today refused to comment. Mrs Orchard said that since she found the tracking device (pictured) she has fitted blinds on her house to protect her privacy .","999 telephone operator Anthea Orchard, 35, signed off work with stress .

A Facebook page in France inciting racial hatred and calling for the elimination of Roma gypsies has been taken down following a public outcry. Adopte un Gitan - translated into English as Adopt a Gypsy - caused outrage with one rights' group in France when it was posted earlier this month. Roma group Amaro Drom, based in Bouches-du-Rhone in the south of the country, reported the matter to police for incitement of racial hatred, when it got wind of the page, which received 800 'likes'. Outrage: The Facebook page that was accused of inciting racial hatred has been taken down, but not before it was 'liked' by 800 users . The page labelled Roma gypsys . 'thieves'. One image on the page showed members of the musical group the Gypsy . Kings covered in yellow stars reading 'Jew'. President Véronique Labbe told English speaking news service The Local: 'We cannot allow this flood of hatred against the gypsy community on a social network.' In her complaint, shared on her blog, . Ms Labbe pointed out that one post on the page read: 'Gypsies? We shouldn’t adopt . them, we have to eliminate them.' Ms Labbe argued the people who 'liked' the page should be reprimanded and has urged that Facebook be monitored more closely in future. She said: 'I . hope the police will look at social networks more closely, because . anyone young or old can start a page or open an account and incite . racial hatred against Roma people or anyone they want. It should not be that way.' She is refusing to let the matter lie, saying the page was closed down, only to reopen last Tuesday. She said: 'Well, it was already closed down once, and then it was opened again on Tuesday – why? 'So this is definitely not the end of the story.' Adopte un Gitan: In the latest attack on Roma gypsies in France, a Facebook page was set up reportedly calling for their 'elimination' The UK's life president of the Gypsy Council Hughie Smith backed Ms Labbe. He said: 'This does not surprise me at all. It's nothing new as far as we're concerned. 'We've had it for centuries, people trying to get rid of us and we're still here. 'It sounds to me as if it's a load of . crackpots. I think Facebook should be providing some kind of filter for . this kind of thing. 'It's always been going on, but there are pockets in different parts of this country that are worse than others and we've got to work hard to be accepted.' The page's creator has not yet been identified, although Ms Labbe told English speaking news webisite RFI she believed neo nazis were behind it. A rival Facebook page was set up in answer, called 'For the closure of Adopt a Gypsy.com'. That has already received 1,207 people as members. The public prosecutor has said it is too early to determine the next steps. Attacked: Roma gypsies were branded 'thieves' on the Facebook page, which has now been taken down . The Facebook page is not the first time France has seen racist comments directed at the Roma population. Last week a mayor in central France threatened to kill himself if travellers returned to his village. And last month, centrist French deputy Gilles Bourdouleix allegedly suggested 'maybe Hitler didn’t kill enough gypsies'. He later resigned over the matter. Bourdouleix was said to have made the comments under his breath during a meeting with travellers at a camp in the western town of Cholet, where he is mayor. Earlier in the summer, the European Roma and Travellers Forum (ERTF) announced it would be suing Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the far-right National Front, for incitement to racial hatred. The 85-year-old right-wing firebrand made comments in Nice on July 4th where he labelled the local Roma community a 'smelly' and 'rash-inducing' presence in the southern city. The following day, the city’s mayor and centre-right UMP deputy Christian Estrosi also caused outrage by labelling the Roma community 'criminals' and proposing tougher measures for dealing with them, including installing video surveillance in Roma and traveller camps.","Roma gypsies branded 'thieves' in the latest attack in France .

The family of an Atlanta teen claim that doctors at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta have condemned him to a 'death sentence' because they will not place him on the transplant waiting list. Suffering an enlarged heart, Anthony Stokes, 15, has only six months to live, but his hospital said last week that because he has failed to take his medication in the past, this history of 'non-compliance' rules him out. His outraged family and civil rights groups claim that this is not the whole truth and say that it is Anthony's low grades at school and brushes with the law that mean Children's Healthcare will send him home from hospital with no hope of survival. Scroll Down for Video . Desperate: Anthony Stokes, 15, needs a heart transplant or he will most likely die within six months . 'He's been given a death sentence because of a broad and vague excuse of noncompliance. There was nothing specific in that decision. Just noncompliance,' said Christine Young Brown with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Previously healthy, Anthony discovered last month that his heart was failing. 'Every day is up and down. He's OK one minute, the next minute he's not,' said Anthony's mother, Melencia Hamilton to CBS Atlanta. Despite specialists informing Anthony and his family that he has less than a year to live, they also sent them a letter on August 7th, explaining why he wouldn't be put on the transplant list. Outraged: Christine Young Brown of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference has joined with Anthony Stokes' mother Melencia Hamilton (right) to condemn the decision . Denied: Anthony Stokes has an alleged history of brushes with the law - which his family feel could be part of the reason why he was denied a heart transplant . Illness: Anthony Stokes was diagnosed with a heart complaint in July and is now in desperate need of a heart transplant . 'The decision was made that Anthony is currently not a transplant candidate due to having a history of non-compliance, which is one of our center’s contraindications to listing for heart transplant,' explained the devastating letter. 'As we discussed today with Anthony’s mother, we will not place Anthony on the heart transplant waiting list at this time due to this decision,' the letter continues. While the transplant list does have specific criteria for who qualifies for transplants, family and friends of Anthony allege that his low school grades and prior brushes with the law are the real reason he has been ruled out. 'The non-compliance is fabricating, because they don’t want to give him a heart,” said family friend Mack Major to WSBTV.com. 'This is unacceptable because he must lose his life because of a non-compliance.' Diagnosis: Anthony Stokes will die within six months if he does not get the heart transplant according to his doctors in Atlanta, Georgia . The hospital has refuted any claims of mismanagement in a statement in which they repeat their claims of careful management of the transplant list. 'The well-being of our patients is always our first priority. We are continuing to work with this family and looking at all options regarding this patient's health care,' said Children's Healthcare of Atlanta spokeswoman Patty Gregory. 'We follow very specific criteria in determining eligibility for a transplant of any kind.' Anthony's mother described the moment she was told by the hospital her son would not be getting the transplant he needs to live. Children¿s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston wrote Anthony Stokes a letter informing him that his history of 'non-compliance' is the reason why he is not being considered for a heart transplant . Support: The teen surrounded by his friends and family - he will be released from hospital soon - with only medication to keep him healthy . 'Doctor came in and said he's not a candidate. He's not a candidate for a heart transplant,' said Hamilton. Family members said that the hospital explained that they fear that Anthony won't follow the strict plan of medication and follow-up treatments necessary for the transplant to succeed. It is not clear what evidence of 'non-compliance' the hospital is basing their decision on. 'We must save Anthony's life. We don't have a lot of time to do it, but it's something that must be done,' said Mack Major, Stokes' mentor.","Anthony Stokes, 15, was diagnosed with an enlarged heart last month and has been given six months to live .

'District 9' was something of a phenomenon: a relatively low-budget science-fiction film from a first-time, South African director that made over $210million worldwide and landed four Academy Awards nominations, including best picture. Like 'District 9,' 'Elysium' is rife with allegory, a futuristic tale heavy with contemporary themes of wealth discrepancy, health care and immigration. But it was also made with more than three times the budget of 'District 9' and added stars Damon and Jodie Foster. Rory Bruer, head of distribution for Sony said the studio was proud to release an ambitious film like 'Elysium' and said that it would be 'very profitable' for Sony. The film launched internationally in a handful of markets, including Russia, taking in $10.9million overseas. With the added star power of Damon and Foster, 'Elysium' should be a bigger draw than 'District 9' was abroad. 'International is going to be the big, big win on this film for us,' said Bruer. The weekend was enough to push the box office just past the pace of last year, which means that despite several spectacular flops this summer, Hollywood's 2013 is currently equal to its 2012. The year-to-date gross of $7billion is even with last year, although attendance is down 2.9 percent. Socialism or fantasy world?: 'Elysium' predicts future where the one per cent lives on luxury space colony and earth is just overcrowded slum . 'Yes, there's been some high-profile failures,' said Chris Aronson, head of distribution for Fox. 'But the summer's been fantastic despite the gloom and doom some in the media have portrayed.' The market was crowded with family films, including new releases 'Percy Jackson' and 'Planes,' as well as holdovers like Sony's 'Smurfs 2' ($9.5million in its second week) and Fox's 'Turbo' ($2.3million in its fourth week). With the box office led by two R-rated films, it made for a diverse weekend of movie-going. 'It used to be called the dog days of August - and you still get some junk thrown in to August,' said Paul Dergarabedian, analyst for box-office tracker Hollywood.com. 'But it can also be the land of opportunity for films that aren't cookie-cutter for audiences that are burned out by blockbusters.'

Final domestic figures will be released on Monday. According to Hollywood.com .

Mexican border crossings are being overwhelmed by a surge in immigrants who are claiming asylum  from drug violence in Latin America. The thousands of asylum-seekers - reportedly 200 in a single day at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry in California - are forcing the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to pay for hotels rooms for hundreds of  immigrants while they wait for an immigration judge to decide whether they can stay in the country. Thousands more are reportedly released into the country with promises that they will appear at asylum hearings. Federal authorities say those promises are almost never kept and the immigrants remain in the country illegally. Standing in line: Hundreds of immigrants are awaiting asylum hearings at the Otay Mesa Border Crossing in Southern California . Fox News reports that 200 immigrants claimed asylum at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry near San Diego, California, in just one day last week. Of those, 30 where taken to a hotel, where they were put up in rooms that cost $99 a night, according to Fox. Seventy were released into the United States and ordered to appear for asylum hearings at a later date. The rest were held at the overflowing Otay Mesa processing center and one at nearby San Ysidro. Nearly all of the asylum-seekers used special 'code words' that force federal immigration officials to allow them to stay in the country long enough to have an asylum hearing. The top phrase is 'credible fear' - the immigrants say they have a 'credible fear' of the drug cartels in Mexico. Hundreds of immigrants are being housed in a $99-a-night hotel while they wait for a judge to rule on whether they can be granted asylum . 'This clearly has to have been orchestrated by somebody,' former U.S. Attorney for Southern California Peter Nunez told Fox News. 'It's beyond belief that dozens or hundreds or thousands of people would simultaneously decide that they should go to the U.S. and make this claim.' The attempts are nearly always futile. About 91percent of asylum claims from Mexico are denied. The immigrants are kept at a hotel until their asylum pleas can be heard by a judge. Fox News documented one hotel, whose name the news outlet did not report for security reasons, where Customs vans arrived several times a week carrying immigrant families seeking asylum. Armed Customs agents guard guard the door and other escort the new families inside.","Thousands of Mexican immigrants are claiming they must be allowed into the U.S. to receive asylum from the drug cartels .

Kevin Lewis, both of them, were awarded a $1million prize after the Horseshoe Casino, in Cincinnati, OH., Saturday called their name as the winners of a promotion and failed to immediately realize the wrong Kevin Lewis' life was changed . After realizing the wrong Kevin Lewis had claimed the prize, the casino decided to ‘do the right thing’ and pay both men. And the winner is...: Kevin Lewis! Just, not this one, the other one . The real Kevin Lewis: This Kevin Lewis is the real winner, but the casino paid both men the prize . ‘This was our blunder,’ Kevin Kline, casino senior vice president and general manager said in a statement. ‘So, consistent with our commitment to do the right thing for our guests, Horseshoe awarded a $1 million prize to each of the men.’ Awarded as part of a $3million Summer Giveaway promotion, when Kevin Lewis’ name was called and he appeared on-stage, he was awarded a giant check and took a picture with casino staff. Only when going through a more detailed verification did Horseshoe realize the mistake. ‘A gentleman whose named they called, Kevin Lewis, was in the crowd, came forward and was given his jumbo check,’ spokesperson Jennifer Kulczycki told ABC News. ‘Then as the local leadership team moved on to do the secondary verification process, the team realized it had made a blunder.’ Is the next winner among them?: Patrons fill the gaming floor at Horseshoe Casino Cincinnati, OH., the final prize will be awarded in September . The ‘real’ Kevin Lewis was also the same age, also engaged, a casino regular and a city resident, Kulczycki told ABC, declining to comment on the verification. ‘There were a lot of similarities between the two gentlemen that led to confusion on our end,’ Kulczycki told the Cincinnati Enquirer. Contestants entered the promotion by swiping loyalty cards each day at a kiosk inside the casino, according to the Enquirer, which added that additional entries could be made through points built up by gambling. Both winners have declined to do media interviews, and an attempt by MailOnline to reach a Horseshoe Casino spokesperson was unsuccessful. The final $1million prize will be awarded September 1, according to reports.","Both Kevin Lewises are in their early 50s, engaged, lifelong Cincinnati residents and casino regulars .

Al Qaeda militants pillaged British taxpayer-funded aid worth almost £500,000, the Department for International Development has admitted. The Government said that a Somali-based cell of Al Qaeda, known as al-Shabaab, plundered the vital humanitarian aid and equipment from approved contractors. The loss was hidden in the small print of a recent set of Department for International Development (DfID) accounts which revealed ‘the theft’ of supplies worth £480,000 between November 2011 and February 2012. Loss: It is believed the supplies were stolen by Al-Shabaab, the Somali-based cell of Al Qaeda, and burnt . It is understood that the supplies were stolen or destroyed in November 2011 when al-Shabaab went on the rampage through an area where some of DFiD’s local partners had a warehouse. The report singles out al-Shabaab for blame and states: ‘DfID partners had no prior warning of the confiscations being carried out and therefore had no time to prevent the loss.’ A DfID spokesman added: ‘We work in some of the most dangerous places in the world, including Somalia, because tackling the root causes of poverty and instability there ensures a safer world. 'Working in conflict-affected and fragile states carries inherent risk. DfID does all it can to mitigate against this but, on occasion, losses will occur.’ Questions: Aid workers struggled to deliver supplies to thousands of Somali refugees during the humanitarian crisis in 2011 . More than 13 million people were reliant on humanitarian aid during the Horn of Africa crisis in November 2011. Starving people were dying of malaria and cholera and heavy rains made it impossible for aid workers to deliver supplies. The disclosure that so much material went missing will raise fears that the Government is not doing enough to protect aid supplies. Ministers have been under increasing pressure to justify a decision to protect overseas aid from spending cuts. British aid is due to reach about £11 billion by 2015 to meet the Government’s promise that spending should be 0.7 per cent of gross national income. Critics say the 0.7 per cent figure encourages wasteful spending to meet the target. Last night DfID was not able to confirm what sort of supplies had been lost in Somalia but suggested that they were burned by al-Shabaab rather than stolen.","'Theft' of aid and equipment hidden in recent set of Government accounts .

"By . Ryan Gorman . PUBLISHED: . 11:08 EST, 12 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:53 EST, 12 August 2013 . Clever immigrants have found a new way across the US - Mexico border. Droves of Mexican migrants have been able to cross the border by using key words and specific phrases that compel US Customs and Border Patrol agents to let them into the country as refugees. This strategy is new and appears to be well-organized, according to ABC 10. Loophole: Mexicans are gaining entry to the US by the hundreds using key words and phrases . At least 199 Mexicans were allowed through the Otay crossing in San Diego and into the US just on August 5, according to a border agent who spoke with the station. ‘They are being told if they come across, when they come up to the border and they say certain words, they will be allowed into the country,’ the border agent said, adding ‘we are being overwhelmed’ to the point overflows were being shipped by van to nearby San Ysidro station. The latest strategy by immigrants to gain entry to the US appears to be quite successful. 'This appears to be a well-orchestrated attempt by whoever that makes our system even more ridiculous than it has been in the past,’ immigration expert Pete Nunez told the station. Devastated: Interior states are overrun with violence, causing regular citizens - like these in Michoacan, who wear masks for their safety - to form armed patrols to guard their loved ones against drug cartels . Families and groups of immigrants have been telling border agents they come from central Mexican areas ravaged by drug cartel violence – such as Michoacan or Sinaloa – and saying ‘cartels are ripping their state apart,’ the ‘credible fear’ affords them special treatment, according to the station. The groups are given a court date to prove their claim and bonded into the local community, a source told the station, but they never return. ‘There are no detention facilities for families so the family would have to be split up. We don't want to split families up, so we end up releasing people out into the community on bond, on bail,’ Nunez said, calling the tactic a ‘huge loop hole.’ Even more incredibly, the station found evidence of immigrants being coached from within Mexico on how to sell the ruse, exactly what to say and how to act, as well as a $300 video instructing immigrants on the ins and outs of fooling agents. Military rule: Military convoy are often seen driving through downtown Morelia, in violent Michoacan . A black-market for selling the scheme has sprung up almost overnight, according to the station. Multiple efforts by MailOnline to contact different spokespersons with the CBP were unsuccessful, but a US Citizenship and Immigration Services official explained to ABC 10 why immigrants are allowed into the country based on a credible fear claim. ‘Any individual who asserts a fear of persecution or torture or an intention to seek asylum during the course of the expedited removal process is referred to an USCIS asylum officer for an interview to determine if the individual has a credible fear of persecution or torture,’ Christopher Bentley told the station. ‘The USCIS officer must find that a ‘significant possibility’ exists that the individual may be found eligible for asylum or withholding of removal,’ Bentley added, ‘if the credible fear threshold is met, the individual is placed into removal proceedings in Immigration Court, where the individual may apply for relief from removal, including asylum’ and be allowed into the country while awaiting their court date. A border agent told the station that ‘there has to be a policy change, something implemented, an emergency implication that will stop this, or otherwise we will have thousands coming in, into the United States.’ It is not known if immigrants are using this strategy at border crossings in other states.","Hundreds have gained entry to the US with specific words and phrases .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:40 EST, 12 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:41 EST, 12 August 2013 . A California prison inmate has killed himself by drinking too much water just days after he was taken off suicide watch. Guards at Monroe Detention Center in Woodland found Todd Alexander Phillips in his cell struggling to breathe on May 18 and rushed him to hospital where he later died. At first it was unclear why Phillips, who was in custody awaiting trial at the time, became sick. But the Yolo County coroner recently announced the 29-year-old's death was triggered by 'significant intentional liquid consumption.' This fluid overload led to acute hyponatremia – abnormally low sodium in the blood - and eventually caused his brain cells to swell and burst. However, coroner's officials on Monday deemed the manner of death 'undetermined' rather than suicide as they couldn't tell for sure whether he intended to kill himself by drinking so much water or if it was an accident.

The newspaper reported that Phillips suffered schizophrenia and battled drug abuse.UC Davis biochemistry professor George A. Kaysen told The Bee schizophrenics and those suffering certain other mental illnesses are prone to drink water compulsively, potentially to the point of death. But the coroner's report said Phillips had no known history of the disorder and had never attempted to take his life in that manner. Phillips' suicide watch was lifted in the days before his death, according to the report. On the day of his death, jailers found Phillips in his bunk 'agitated and upset' at around 12:49 p.m. and he was having difficulty breathing. His cell, which  contained a sink and toilet, was wet. Sheriff's officials said Phillips was placed in restraints as a safety measure and rushed to Woodland Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.","Todd Alexander Phillips, 29, was found in his cell struggling to breathe on May 18 and later died in hospital .
