"Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- More than 37 million people visit Las Vegas each year for its glitz, glamour and lure of hitting a jackpot. Yet few tourists ever see the dingy world beneath the bright lights: tunnel dwellings that have become home to those down on their luck. Steve Dommer and his girlfriend, Kathryn, live in the depths below the Vegas Strip. They created an elaborate 400-square-foot space, complete with a living room, bedroom, kitchen and workshop to fix bicycles. Everything is elevated off the floor with wooden pallets or milk crates because of potential flooding. Their prized possession is a queen-sized bed, found in a Dumpster near the Palms Casino Resort. ""I like to be able to come back and sleep as comfortably as possible,"" Dommer said, patting his bed. By day, he scrounges for change above ground. He's been living down below for two years. He lost his construction job because of an addiction to speed and heroin. The couple is not alone in the city's tunnels. ""Hundreds of people live in these tunnels,"" says journalist Matthew O'Brien. O'Brien has become an expert on the more than 300 miles of underground flood channels and its tunnel dwellers. O'Brien brought the homeless to light, first in articles for the alternative weekly newspaper, Las Vegas CityLife, and then in a book titled ""Beneath the Neon: Life and Death in the Tunnels of Las Vegas."" O'Brien noted the irony of one tunnel entrance near the famous ""Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas"" neon sign. ""I just think the history of Vegas PR is to ignore the bad issues,"" he said. ""The instinct of the city -- and the county -- is to ignore stuff that can be construed as negative press and kind of highlight other things about the city."" The number of those living in the storm drains varies by the season, O'Brien said. The tunnels become damp and cold in the winter, but hundreds flock into them during the summer to escape the 100-degree desert temperatures. ""It's much cooler than outside, about 20-25 degrees cooler, and that's one reason why someone would live or hang out in these tunnels,"" O'Brien said. Armed with a black metal flashlight, O'Brien took CNN on a tour of four tunnels. Each tunnel was different; their heights ranged from 4 to 12 feet. Some intersected underground; others had small openings to access parallel tunnels. It was pitch black much of the time. ""After you've done it a few hundred times like I have, you can walk down here without any light at all,"" said tunnel dweller Steve Dommer. O'Brien said he's always ""a little bit on edge"" when he climbs into the underground world. ""You never know what to expect or what you're going to find down here,"" he said. If legend is to be believed, a troll armed with a crowbar combs the tunnels. Even if it's not true, O'Brien said, it still haunts him. ""A lot of the people ... have their own ghost stories about a friend who was murdered in the tunnels or someone who drowned and they hear their voices late at night,"" O'Brien said. ""It is true that you do hear some weird noises down here because of the acoustics."" Some of the channel floors are covered with dust, others mud, and, in one section, a foot of stagnant water. There are sleeping bags and mattresses, some with makeshift canopies, but they seemed outnumbered by the trash, scraps of food, cockroaches and graffiti. Upon hearing our footsteps, some vagrants scattered from their makeshift shelters, not knowing if we were marauders or the police who sometimes come through to chase the homeless out. O'Brien introduced us to a man known in these parts as ""Iron,"" who has lived in the flood channel system for six years. Iron had sun-baked skin and wore a cap reading ""Jackpot!"" The recovering alcoholic said he makes ends meet receiving tips for pumping gas or cleaning windshields at a nearby service station. He lives near the entrance of a tunnel across the highway from the Excalibur and Luxor hotel-casinos. ""You'd be surprised at night the view you have right here,"" Iron said. ""People pay a lot of money in the suites to have views of the Strip. I get it every night for free."" He sleeps about 10 feet from the entrance of a four-foot high tunnel. It doesn't rain often. But when it does, the floodwaters carry away anything in its path. ""I live pretty simple now after replacing things for six years."" Over in another Vegas flood channel, a homeless man named Michael sat with his bags packed ready to leave his tunnel dwelling, about 200 feet from the entrance. The 52-year-old said police came through two days earlier encouraging people to leave. He sat on a mattress wearing khaki pants and a short-sleeve collared shirt. He said crack cocaine abuse led him on a dark path into the storm drains. He's hoping to leave soon. ""After 30 years of wasting time and money, 30 years of drug use, I want my life back,"" he said. ""I want to get up and lead a productive life again."" To that end, O'Brien is helping. That was one of his goals when he began his journey -- to find a way to help the tunnel dwellers. He became partners with the charitable outreach organization HELP of Southern Nevada to form the ""Shine A Light"" foundation. O'Brien escorts social workers into the storm drains twice a month to offer assistance to the homeless. They provide blankets, food, water and counseling. According to O'Brien, more than a dozen people who were living within the tunnels received housing in the past six months thanks to the partnership. But O'Brien said he thinks Sin City could do much more to help. ""I've always thought more should be done,"" he said. Iron, the homeless man with a city view, believes the city tolerates the tunnel dwellers because ""we're not hurting anybody."" ""The only thing getting hurt down here is ourselves and nobody else."" CNN's Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report.","Homeless population of Las Vegas turn to storm drains for shelter .

"(CNN) -- As hosts of the largest carnival in world football, the pressure is on for South Africa's national football team to ignite the imagination of local fans by performing well at the 2010 World Cup. If Bafana Bafana is to succeed in their mission, conventional wisdom would be that coach Carlos Alberto Parreira will turn to his best players to deliver results. However, despite firing in 31 goals in 77 appearances to become South Africa's all-time record goal scorer, Benni McCarthy has had question marks hanging over his participation for his country come June. The prolific striker, who plays for English Premier League side Blackburn Rovers, has only recently returned from a period of international exile, just the latest incident in a stormy history with his country's football team. He first angered Bafana Bafana fans by going into international retirement in 2002 aged just 25. The reason? Traveling to international games was hampering his ability to play European football for Celta Vigo and, later, Porto. ""The whole pattern was killing my career, that's why I quit international football,"" he told British newspaper The Independent in 2004. ""African football needs the same calendar as Europe otherwise its best players are going to suffer."" He was talked into returning, only to quit again after the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations when the president of the South African FA, Mubarak Mahomad, made an uncomplimentary comment about his performance. That period of self-imposed exile lasted 20 months, until new coach Carlos Alberto Parreira flew to Great Britain to talk to McCarthy, who was now at Blackburn Rovers. But after Parreira quit to care for his sick wife, McCarthy fell out with replacement boss Joel Santana after he refused to play in two warm up matches last March. Despite pleas from South African President Jacob Zuma, Santana refused to pick him. But a run of eight defeats in nine games, which saw the team slump to 86th on the FIFA rankings, Santana was sacked. With goals being South Africa's biggest problem, it was no surprise that returning coach Parreira made persuading McCarthy to return, for a second time, his top priority. Sure enough, McCarthy returned to the fray last month against Japan. The 32-year-old told local press: ""I want to start afresh and help Bafana do well in the World Cup finals. It is every player's dream to play for his country... and I have matured."" ""In the past I was a loose cannon and I apologize if I was wrong [but] I am still the best at what I do - and that is scoring goals,"" he added. Few could argue with McCarthy's record. Born in Hanover Park, an impoverished township in Cape Town known for its high unemployment, poverty and gang-related violence, McCarthy escaped to become one of Africa's most successful football exports. McCarthy started his career in 1995 aged 18 with Seven Stars of Cape Town, where 27 goals in 29 games earned him a move to Cape Town Spurs who soon merged with Ajax Cape Town, a feeder side to their famous Dutch namesake. McCarthy's potential was enough for Ajax Amsterdam to sign him. Joining in 1997 he scored nine goals to help them win the Eredivisie in his first year, which eventually attracted the attentions of Spain's Celta Vigo. Although it didn't work out in Spain, his move to Portugal's FC Porto was a roaring success. In the 2003/04 season he helped Jose Mourinho's side win the UEFA Champions League with McCarthy memorably grabbing two goals in the second round defeat of Manchester United. McCarthy moved to Premier League outfit Blackburn Rovers in 2006 and scored plenty of goals - he was in the top three league scorers in his debut season - but first-team opportunities have been limited of late. Yet ever since McCarthy made his international debut in a 2-0 home defeat to Holland 1997, South Africa has been a different side with him in it. Gloom has followed South Africa's footballing exploits before this summer's World Cup. But after his most recent 'comeback', Bafana Bafana fans will hope that McCarthy can help put the dark days under Joel Santana firmly behind them.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- It isn't clear whether the United States will ever be able to declare victory in Iraq, the top U.S. commander there said Thursday. Army Gen. Ray Odierno speaks to reporters at the Pentagon  on Thursday. ""I'm not sure we will ever see anyone declare victory in Iraq, because first off, I'm not sure we'll know for 10 years or five years,"" Army Gen. Ray Odierno told reporters at the Pentagon. About 123,000 U.S. troops are in Iraq now, and President Obama says all combat forces will be gone by the end of August 2010, leaving as many as 50,000 noncombat troops to advise and train Iraqi forces before leaving by the end of 2011. Odierno has said he wants to draw down the U.S. forces at a faster rate than planned if the security situation allows it. On Thursday, he said he expected the number of U.S. troops to drop to 120,000 by the end of October, and to as few as 110,000 by the end of 2009. ""What we've done here is we're giving Iraq an opportunity in the long term to be a strategic partner of the United States, but more importantly, be a partner in providing regional stability inside of the Middle East,"" Odierno said. Odierno also highlighted continuing security issues inside the country, saying Iraqi security forces have recently seized several ""very large"" caches of Iranian-made rockets and armor-piercing munitions known as explosively formed penetrators, or EFPs. ""If you're training people ... in Iran to come back into Iraq, and you're providing them rockets and other things, I call that significant because it still enables people to conduct attacks not only on U.S. forces but on Iraqi civilians,"" Odierno said. At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Odierno said the main threat to stability in Iraq are Arab-Kurd tensions, adding there has been difficulty bringing the two sides together for possible joint patrols. ""We've had some very good meetings,"" he said. ""But we still have some ways to go on that.""","U.S. Army Gen. Ray Odierno makes remark to reporters at Pentagon .

"(CNN) -- The mid-Atlantic region continued digging out Monday from the weekend's record blizzard, but snow-weary residents learned of a new winter storm due in the area on Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning, with predictions of another 10 to 20 inches of snow, for northern Virginia and eastern Maryland, including the District of Columbia, beginning Tuesday afternoon and continuing through Wednesday. ""A winter storm warning means significant amounts of snow are expected or occurring,"" said the statement from the weather service facility in Sterling, Virginia. ""The combination of snow and strong winds will make travel very hazardous."" If as severe as predicted, the new storm would be the third major snowfall to hit the nation's capital and surrounding region in just over seven weeks. In last weekend's blizzard, a record 32.4 inches of snow fell on Washington's Dulles International Airport over two days, breaking a January 7-8, 1996, record of 23.2 inches. Federal workers in Washington, with the exception of emergency employees, stayed home Monday and students in most schools in the nation's capital got a snow day. Many residents who spent the weekend playfully making snowmen and hurling snowballs also grumbled as they shoveled hip-high snow from driveways. ""The streets are pretty well covered,"" Kingsley Barreto said Sunday about his subdivision in Gaithersburg, Maryland. ""No cars coming in or out of here. Hopefully everyone in the community has enough supplies to last them for a little while, because it doesn't look like we're going anywhere anytime soon,"" Barreto said in a post he submitted to iReport, a CNN Web site that allows people to submit information, pictures and videos. Watch Barreto's iReport on his neighborhood . Crews worked around the clock to clear roads and repair power lines, warning that it might take days to restore electricity to some customers from Pennsylvania to Virginia. Two of Dulles' four runways were open Monday morning, and officials hoped to have a third open later in the day, said Courtney Mickalonis of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. The situation there is ""getting back to normal,"" Mickalonis said. But airport officials asked travelers not to go there without confirmed flights. Reagan National Airport was scheduled to reopen at 10 a.m.  Monday, with flights resuming on a limited basis, the airport authority said. Travelers were urged to check with airlines on flight schedules before heading to the airport. Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport was open Monday, with limited service, spokesman Jonathan Dean said. One of the two runways opened Sunday night, and some flights landed, Dean said. However, airport authorities expect carrier delays and cancellations because of the backlog. Are you there? Share your winter weather photos, video . Airport crews were dealing with a refreeze from overnight, but officials intended to have both runways open by the end of Monday. Amtrak canceled several trains Sunday after trees and power lines fell on tracks, the train service said. Dozens of Greyhound bus trips in mid-Atlantic states also were canceled, the company said on its Web site. And officials across the region advised drivers to stay off slick roads. ""Everybody's just trying to clean up and get a little bit ahead of the game before the next round comes,"" said Michelle Timberlake, who lives on a farm in Boyce, Virginia, about two hours west of Washington. The interior designer found herself running through a mountain of snow when about 40 cows escaped from the pasture on her husband's farm in search of food and shelter. ""This was not what I imagined for myself,"" she said Sunday, laughing about the experience.

"(CNN) -- The space shuttle Discovery landed in California on Friday evening after bad weather near Kennedy Space Center forced it to wave off a landing in Florida. Discovery landed at Edwards Air Force Base after a 13-day mission to the international space station. ""Welcome home Discovery,"" mission control said after the shuttle landed. ""Congratulations on an extremely successful mission, stepping up science to a new level on the international space station."" The shuttle touched down at 8:53 p.m. ET at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert, where NASA described the weather as ""pristine."" This may be the last California shuttle landing, because there are only six missions remaining on the NASA schedule, unless Congress gives the space agency more money. Flight controllers prefer landings at Kennedy Space Center because of cost and schedule. A California landing adds a week to the turnaround time before the shuttle can be ready for another mission. NASA has estimated it costs about $1.7 million to bring a shuttle home to Kennedy Space Center from California. It rides cross-country piggy-back on a Boeing 747. Discovery was initially scheduled to return to Earth on Thursday, but poor weather in central Florida forced a delay.  Watch the shuttle land in California » . Both Florida landing opportunities Friday were canceled by ""a very deep moisture system that descended over the Florida spaceport,"" a NASA spokesman said. The seven astronauts are wrapping up a 13-day mission to the international space station, where the crew made repairs and delivered supplies. The crew executed three spacewalks and dropped off the Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill, or COLBERT treadmill, named after comedian Stephen Colbert. Colbert won an online poll conducted by NASA to name the newest space station compartment. Instead, Colbert and the space agency worked together to give the moniker to the treadmill. The new compartment was given the name Tranquility. While in space, mission specialists Danny Olivas and Christer Fuglesang installed an ammonia tank on the international space station. The depleted tank assembly is being returned to Earth in the shuttle's cargo bay. The tank is part of a cooling system that cycles 600 pounds of ammonia through the space station to ""get rid of excess heat generated by the station's systems,"" NASA said. Astronaut Nicole Stott remained at the space station as a flight engineer, replacing astronaut Timothy Kopra, who returned home aboard Discovery as a mission specialist, according to NASA's Web site. Another space icon is also coming home aboard the shuttle -- Buzz Lightyear. The 12-inch Disney/Pixar action figure has been aboard the space station for more than a year, according to NASA. The action figure went into space aboard Discovery in May 2008 as part of a joint initiative between Disney and NASA to encourage students to study math, science and technology. Weather and technical problems delayed Discovery's launch three times before the mission began.","NEW: Mission control says mission took ""science to a new level"" on space station .

"(CNN) -- About 11.6 million Africans have been forced from their homes by wars and other conflicts, according to the United Nations. Next week in Uganda, leaders from across the continent will converge to tackle the issue. Somali women at a camp for displaced persons. Nearly half of the displaced people in the world are found in Africa, according to the United Nations. ""Africa is the continent most affected by the scourge and tragedy of forced displacement,"" the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said in a statement. ""While refugee populations have declined in recent years, internal displacement continues to rise and the number of people uprooted from their homes is mounting."" During the weeklong African Union summit that will start Monday in the capital, Kampala, the leaders are expected to sign a pledge to help the displaced across the continent, according to the U.N. agency for refugee issues. The agreement ""would be the first legally binding international instrument on internal displacement having such broad regional scope,"" the agency said. Aid agencies have blasted some African countries for failing refugees and internally displaced people. Last month, Oxfam International released an explosive report accusing Kenya and Ethiopia of housing Somali refugees in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. It said the Somali government also is abandoning its internally displaced. ""Somalis flee one of the world's most brutal conflicts and a desperate drought, only to end up in unimaginable conditions in camps that are barely fit for humans,"" said Robbert Van den Berg, a spokesman for Oxfam International in the Horn of Africa. ""Hundreds of thousands of children are affected, and the world is abandoning the next generation of Somalis when they most need our help."" On a visit to a refugee camp in northern Kenya that houses Somalis, actress and U.N. goodwill ambassador Angelina Jolie called it ""one of the most dire"" she had ever seen. The camp -- which has facilities for about 90,000 -- houses 280,000 refugees. ""The toilets are already overflowing,"" Jolie said last month. ""There is not even enough space for trash dumps, so people are living amongst the garbage."" Kenyan officials have said they are working on a solution. In neighboring Uganda, a government spokesman said it had taken steps to ensure displaced people and refugees have access to resources to become self-sufficient. ""The numbers of displaced have drastically gone down,"" Fred Opolot said. ""The government offers them relocation packages, including planting seeds, cooking items and building materials."" The east African nation has followed international protocol, Opolot said, noting that it was chosen to host the African Union summit on refugees. ""Uganda does not just set up camps; it builds facilities for them,"" Opolot said. ""There may well be some African countries that have not followed protocols. ... The summit will reassess the challenges they have and set up steps to ensure they follow international protocol.""","African leaders converge to tackle problem of conflict-displaced people .

"(CNN) -- For the first time in decades, the hunting of the gray wolf is legal again in the United States. And that's a good thing for ranchers like Cindy Siddoway of Terreton, Idaho, whose sheep are threatened every day by wolves. Gray wolves were taken off the endangered species list after their population rebounded. ""We have worked very hard to protect what we have, and it's not very successful,"" she said. ""It is devastating for us to put all of the money and the time and the genetics and work to produce a great product and then just have it half-eaten and left to die."" But wolf hunting isn't popular with everybody. It has become a controversy in Idaho, where the hunt began Tuesday, and in Montana, where it is scheduled to start September 15. Environmental and animal rights groups are upset by a federal decision this year to remove gray wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains from the endangered species list, a move that opened the door to permitting the hunts. They are seeking an injunction in U.S. District Court in Montana to stop the hunts. Judge Donald Molloy is reviewing the case, and it's unclear when he will rule. After their population dwindled in the Rockies last century, in part because of practices like trapping, gray wolves were put on the endangered species list. But the population has rebounded, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service delisted the animals and determined that the populations would be healthy enough for hunts to be permitted in Idaho and Montana, which manage the wolf populations. There are also gray wolves in Wyoming, but hunts are not permitted there because of the state's weak wildlife management, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. Opponents of the hunt say the population is not large and healthy enough to allow hunting. Melanie Stein, a Sierra Club spokeswoman, said that the wolf populations ""are just on the cusp of recovery and that we are almost there."" But she says the hunts represent ""a step backward and away from recovery"" of the wolf populations. Defenders of Wildlife, one of several groups urging the court to stop the hunt, detailed the ecological role of the wolves on its Web site. ""In what is known as the cascade effect, wolves are exerting influence over a multitude of species within the park's ecosystem. Elk, wary of the reintroduced top predator, have altered their grazing behavior. ""With less grazing pressure from elk, streambed vegetation such as willow and aspen is regenerating after decades of overbrowsing. As the trees are restored, they create better habitat for native birds and fish, beaver and other species."" Siddoway doesn't think the hunt will make much of a difference right now because it is hard to kill the animals. But the wolf attacks take their toll. For example, the wolves will kill Great Pyrenees guard dogs used to protect the herds. When that happens, ""then we're open to prey from bears and everything else,"" Siddoway said. ""We know that it's a problem, and we want to make sure ranchers can continue on with their livelihood,"" Stein said. ""But there has to be some co-existence between wolves and other species."" Currently, ranchers and farmers can legally shoot a wolf they see attacking their livestock, said Ed Bangs, wolf recovery coordinator with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. There are also tools used to counter wolf attacks without hunting, he said. They include scare tactics, like shooting firecrackers out of a shotgun, or proper fencing. ""All that stuff works for a little while in some instances for a short period of time and in some situations can be helpful. But it isn't the silver bullet for wolf depredation,"" he said. He said these techniques work ""in conjunction with killing wolves."" There are state and private programs compensating ranchers who lose livestock because of attacks, but the money represents only part of what the livestock and the time dealing with the problem is worth. ""The ranchers got the short end of the stick,"" Bangs said. Officials say that up to 330 wolves in the states of Idaho and Montana may be killed during this public hunt. In Idaho, the limit is 220 wolves, and in Montana, it would be 75. Members of the Nez Perce tribe in Idaho can kill up to 35 wolves. Ed Mitchell, spokesman for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, said three wolves have been taken in Idaho since the hunting season began. There are more than 1,600 gray wolves in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. But Siddoway says ""there will never be enough"" for environmental groups to agree to the hunts. CNN's Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Environmentalists, animal rights groups protest decision .

"(CNN)  -- Professional basketball star Shaquille O'Neal paid for the funeral of a 5-year-old North Carolina girl whose body was found last week, O'Neal's team confirmed Thursday. Authorities believe the child, Shaniya Davis, was kidnapped, raped and murdered after being reported missing November 10. Her body was found six days later on a roadside about 30 miles from her hometown of Fayetteville, North Carolina. Her funeral was Sunday. O'Neal said in a statement released by his team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, that he was touched after seeing Davis' story on CNN sister network HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" show. ""What happened to her was tragic. I wanted her to have a funeral that would be as beautiful as she was,"" O'Neal said in the statement. Corey Breece, of Rogers and Breece Funeral Home, told the Fayetteville Observer he wouldn't discuss the cost of the child's service, but he noted a child's funeral ""averages around $4,500."" The girl's father, Bradley Lockhart, and his family had set up a trust fund to help raise money to pay for the service, according to the Fayetteville Observer. Family friend Vaughn Eason told the paper any remaining money would be used for groups and charities working to assist abused and neglected children. Police have charged Mario Andrette McNeill with kidnapping and said he also will face murder and child rape charges. Preliminary autopsy results indicated the child was asphyxiated, Fayetteville Police Chief Tom Bergamine told reporters last week, as authorities awaited final autopsy reports. Davis' mother, Antionette Nicole Davis, has been charged with human trafficking and other offenses. Police have said they believe she was prostituting the girl. O'Neal, as a volunteer for law enforcement agencies in recent years, has been active in causes that deal with domestic violence issues, mainly child-abuse cases.","Star paid for funeral of Shaniya Davis, who was kidnapped, raped and murdered .

"New York (CNN) -- To the delight of fans back home in Tokyo, Hideki Matsui drove in six of the New York Yankees' seven runs in their World Series-winning victory Wednesday and became the first Japanese-born player to win a series Most Valuable Player award. For much of his career, Matsui was a star player for the Tokyo Giants. Matsui's key role in the series highlights the close ties between American and Japanese baseball. Playing in the Yankees' new stadium, the successor to the ""House that Ruth Built,"" Matsui's performance brought to mind the key role that Babe Ruth played in the development of professional baseball in Japan, according to Robert Fitts, author of several books on Japanese baseball. Fitts became a student of Japanese baseball in 1993, when his wife, an attorney, was transferred to Japan. Fitts, then working on his Ph.D. in archaeology from Brown University, was looking for something to get him immersed in Japanese culture. He wrote to 30 of the greatest Japanese ballplayers and was surprised to hear back from nearly all of them, with some sending gifts. He's the author of ""Remembering Japanese Baseball: An Oral History of the Game"" and of ""Wally Yonamine,"" a biography of the first Japanese-American to play professional football and the first American to play professional baseball in Japan. ""He was called the Jackie Robinson of Japan,"" Fitts said. Yonamine led the Japanese league in batting twice and won the MVP award as a center fielder for the Tokyo Giants. CNN spoke with Fitts, who is based in New York, on Thursday. CNN: What are your thoughts on Matsui's key role in the Yankees' victory? Fitts: It's wonderful for Japanese baseball, of course. I would say that five years ago, maybe seven years ago, it would have been incredible, because people in America and in Japan weren't sure about the status of Japanese professional baseball. Many Americans and some in Japan thought that Japanese baseball wasn't as good as American baseball. ... Since then, Ichiro [Suzuki] came over, and he set numerous Major League Baseball records. ... And then Japan won both of the World Baseball Classics. So Japan's baseball has already proven itself to be of high caliber. Most Americans, even if they don't know the history of Japanese baseball, recognize now that they play a very good game. CNN: In Japan, how significant is baseball? Fitts: It's the Japanese national sport. It's been so since the 1890s. Japan had no native team sports. In the 1870s. American and British teachers introduced team sports to Japan. Cricket was introduced, along with rugby and baseball. Baseball is the one that became the most popular. In the 1890s, a Japanese high school team beat a team of American adults from the Yokohama Country Club. They beat them in three straight games. It took on national importance. Japan, of course, was opened up to Westerners in the 1850s by Commodore Perry. The Western nations were far more advanced in technology, and Japan did a rapid modernization. By 1890, Japan felt it was ready to join modern nations as an equal, but the Western powers weren't ready to accept Japan. CNN: How did the game develop after that? Fitts: The biggest change came with two tours. The first was in 1931, an American all-star team whose big star was Lou Gehrig, and the bigger tour came in 1934. Both of these tours were sponsored by the Yomiuri newspaper. In 1934, they brought over what at the time was considered the greatest baseball team ever. It included Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Charlie Gehringer, Earl Averill, Lefty Gomez, Connie Mack was the manager, and we can't forget Mo Berg, the future spy [for the United States in World War II]. The '34 tour was significant for two reasons: The first is that relations between Japan and the U.S. were really rocky at that point. There was a very significant treaty, the naval treaty, which limited the size of the major powers' navies. For every five warships the U.S. and Britain could have, Japan was only allowed three. Japan found this quite insulting, even though they had agreed to it in the 1920s. When the all-star team went over there, the Japanese people went crazy. Half a million people turned out on November 2 for a welcoming parade in Tokyo for the American baseball team. The tour really did create a great deal of goodwill. However, that ended quickly. Within a month of the tour ending, Japan announced that it would not renew the naval treaty. Several months later, in February 1935, an ultranationalist group tried to assassinate the president of the Yomiuri newspaper because he brought over the American team. He was wounded very seriously but survived. CNN: What was the importance of the tour for Japanese baseball? Fitts: The Yomiuri newspaper used the enthusiasm generated by the tour to start their own professional league. The first team they created -- to play the American visitors -- was a Japanese all-star team called All-Nippon. After the tour, the All-Nippon team transformed into the Yomiuri [Tokyo] Giants. CNN: What was Babe Ruth's role? Fitts: Babe Ruth was credited as the man who helped start Japanese [professional] baseball. He was just Babe Ruth. He sold out every game. He had just been released by the Yankees prior to the tour. He hit over .300; he led the Americans and Japanese for most home runs. CNN: How did Hideki Matsui become a baseball star in Japan? Fitts: He was signed right after high school. He was the hero of the annual high school tournament. His rookie year was 1993 with the Yomiuri Giants. He spent much of '93 in the minors. By 1994, he became a true star, and he was the face of the team from '94 till he came over to the Yankees in 2003. CNN: How did people feel about Matsui coming to the Yankees? Fitts: The vast majority of people were very happy for him. There was no sense of betrayal except for the true Giants fans. This was very exciting news. I was there when it happened. This was a chance for Japan's most popular player to prove himself in the major leagues. The Yankees are a special team in Japan just like they are in the U.S. They're probably the most popular American team in Japan. When [Hideo] Nomo first came over in 1995, I found my Japanese friends only cared about how the Japanese players did. They were a fan of the Dodgers one day when Nomo pitched; they were a fan of the Angels when [Shigetoshi] Hasegawa pitched, but over time the Japanese fans became fans of different major league teams as they watched more major league baseball on TV. CNN: What have been the differences between the American and Japanese games? Fitts: There were real substantial differences from the 1940s even through the early 1990s. ... The Japanese would sacrifice bunt far more than the Americans (they still do but less than they used to). Players didn't go first to third on singles often. They would play line drives on hops rather than trying to make a shoestring catch and risk giving up more bases. It was a very conservative brand of baseball. Since the ties have become closer, Japan's baseball has become more aggressive, more exciting, in my opinion. There are still differences. The Japanese really focus on practice and perfection of the technique. That's something American players can learn from, and I think it helps explain the success of Hideki Matsui and Ichiro. They're both dedicated players who practice many, many hours. If you watch Matsui at the plate, he's a very disciplined hitter. His swing is very compact, very practiced, almost perfect. He rarely makes mental mistakes when he's playing the field or running the bases. CNN: How do you think people view the fact that he's going to be a free agent and might not stay with the Yankees? Fitts: I think the Japanese people would be very disappointed if he doesn't remain a Yankee ... and I think most New Yorkers would be very disappointed, too. He's an extremely classy player and a classy individual. CNN: Were you rooting for the Yankees? Fitts: I'm a Phillies fan. I grew up in Philadelphia. I'm in mourning this morning, but at least it was Matsui who did the damage.","Japanese baseball book author says Babe Ruth sparked professional game in Japan .

"New York (CNN) -- State police in Florida planned Monday to further investigate a single-vehicle crash involving pro golfer Tiger Woods, they said. That followed a police announcement Sunday that Woods had canceled a third interview with investigators. Woods suffered minor injuries in the accident, which occurred early Friday in his luxury neighborhood near Orlando. In a statement issued Sunday afternoon on his Web site, Woods offered no details of his wreck, except to say he had cuts and bruises and was ""pretty sore."" ""This situation is my fault, and it's obviously embarrassing to my family and me,"" he said. ""I'm human, and I'm not perfect. I will certainly make sure this doesn't happen again."" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin spoke about why Tiger Woods might be delaying talking to police. CNN: Why do you think Tiger Woods has canceled three interviews with police? Jeffrey Toobin:  Tiger Woods is under no legal obligation to speak with police. The Fifth Amendment gives everyone an absolute right to refuse to talk to them. He may be counting on the fact that if no new news emerges, everybody will move on. CNN: Can the police do anything about it if Woods continues to refuse to talk to them? Toobin: The police don't have a lot of options.  If someone doesn't want to talk to you, you as a police officer can't do anything about it.  In theory, they could get a search warrant, but you need probable cause that a crime took place, and at this point, I don't see anything that would justify it. CNN: The Florida Highway Patrol says the delay is surprising because the accident is so minor. What does Tiger Woods gain by not talking to them?  Toobin:  Woods may not talk to them because there is possibly something unpleasant and embarrassing that he doesn't want to share with them, and he has that right.  Based on what is publicly known, Woods has a public relations problem much more than a legal problem. He's arguably the most famous athlete in the world, and his team's overall strategy is a gamble that his general statement of responsibility won't be overtaken by events or other disclosures. CNN:  Tiger Woods said today that he won't be attending his golf tournament in California this week because of injuries sustained in the car crash, and has cancelled his scheduled press conference as host of the event. Does this fit in with the strategy you think his team has adopted?  Toobin:  I think the decision not to attend the tournament shows how serious this event is, in Tiger's life as well as his work.  Again, this is more a personal and business problem than a legal problem, but he needs to figure out a way to show the public what happened, or explain why he won't be talking about what happened. Obviously he doesn't have that answer yet. CNN: A story in last week's National Enquirer alleged that Woods has been seeing a New York night club hostess. The woman has denied any affair with Woods to The Associated Press. She's also apparently retained attorney Gloria Allred. Why do you think she's retained an attorney? Toobin:  The woman may go public to repeat ... what she's said to the AP and publicly deny the affair, or perhaps to say that she was libeled by the Enquirer. Gloria Allred's clients tend not to disappear from the news media.","Tiger Woods is under no legal obligation to speak with police, CNN senior legal analyst says .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Alaska were working Friday to ensure public safety after a woman was mauled to death by animals -- most likely wolves. The victim, Candice Berner, 32, was found dead Monday in the village of Chignik Lake, authorities said. If the attack is confirmed, it would be the first fatal encounter with wolves on record in Alaska, said Megan Peters, spokeswoman for the Alaska State Troopers. If officials determine which animals were responsible, authorities will try to find them and destroy them, Peters said. An investigation determined the death was ""non-criminal in nature,"" the troopers said in a news release, adding that ""it has been concluded that the animals most likely responsible for the attack are wolves."" Troopers were working with the Department of Fish and Game ""as it addresses public safety concerns regarding wolf activity close to the community of Chignik Lake,"" the troopers said. Berner, a Pennsylvania native, moved to Alaska last year. Chignik Lake is in the southwest part of the state, part of the Alaska Peninsula that shoots out from the mainland. The community of about 105 residents is about 475 miles southwest of Anchorage. Several Chignik Lake residents have reported recent encounters with wolves, some of them threatening, Peters said. Authorities saw a bloody trail where Berner had been dragged off a road and wolf tracks near the body, Peters said. ""It's hard. It's really hard. I feel horrible, you know, empty,"" her father, Robert Berner, told KTUU-TV in Anchorage, Alaska. ""They said Candice put up a good fight,"" he said, ""and there must have been two, maybe three of them."" Berner described his daughter as ""small and mighty,"" a woman who liked to box, lift weights and run, according to a dispatch in the Slippery Rock Herald, the newspaper in her Pennsylvania hometown. She was training for a race and could get into a meditative state when running, her father said. Foul play has been ruled out, Peters said. Berner was an itinerant special education teacher, according to CNN affiliate WTAE-TV of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Authorities listed her address as Perryville, Alaska, around 30 miles from where her body was found. She had arrived in Chignik this week to work at the school there, the Slippery Rock Herald said. Berner had been with the Lake and Peninsula Borough School District since August, schools official Rick Luthi said. Her co-workers last saw her alive at the end of the workday Monday, Luthi told the newspaper. ""She had made the comment that she wanted to get out and get some fresh air,"" Luthi said. ""We assumed that that meant a run for Candice, because she had a habit of doing that whenever she could."" Her father was a professor and taught her first special education class, KTUU-TV said. ""I felt like it was work worth doing, and I've always felt that way,"" Robert Berner said. ""I thought Candice would be able to handle it well, because she has a tremendous tolerance for those who are different."" Residents in Berner's hometown recalled an adventurous woman who loved the outdoors and longed to live in Alaska, WTAE said. Patrick Grant, of Slippery Rock University's Special Education Department, told the station that Berner returned home for grad school and that he last saw her about 18 months ago. ""She cared about other people,"" Grant told WTAE. ""She cared about kids. She cared about how she'd make a difference in the world. That's why she was there. She wanted to make a difference in the world."" Berner was featured in Slippery Rock's winter 2010 journal, where she talked about life in Alaska without television and having her groceries flown in. She also wrote a blog called ""Adventures of an Alaskan Bush Teacher,"" posting photos on it and writing about the wildlife -- particularly the wolves that lurked in the wilderness. ""This tragedy affects all of us. We're all deeply crushed by it,"" Grant said. ""We're all deeply concerned about someone so young reaching such a tragic death, and we're all asking ourselves, 'What can we do?' And I don't know what the answer is."" CNN's Greg Morrison and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Authorities work in response to ""public safety concerns"" about wolves .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Kurdish lawmakers announced Monday they would submit their resignations from Parliament, three days after Turkey's highest court banned their political party on charges that it was a ""focal point for terrorism."" Ahmet Turk, the co-chairman of the now-defunct Democratic Society Party --  known by its initials in Turkish, DTP --  made the announcement in a statement to the media Monday evening in the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir. Last Friday's closure by the Constitutional Court stripped Turk and fellow co-chair, Aysel Tugluk, of their parliamentary seats and banned them both from politics for the next five years. The announcement that the remaining 19 elected lawmakers from their party would now resign in protest may exacerbate simmering tensions between the state and Turkey's minority of some 12 million ethnic Kurds. ""The decision of the constitutional court might deprive a significant segment of Turkish voters from political representation,"" said a spokesman for the European Commission, in a dispatch from the French news agency AFP. Earlier Friday, Ahmet Turk denounced the court ban in a speech before a crowd of some 10,000 supporters in Diyarbakir, the unofficial political capital of Turkey's Kurds. ""I know the mentality of the state and the politicians of this country,"" he said. ""We did not expect anything different because they cannot tolerate the existence of the Kurds. They cannot tolerate our identity. They cannot tolerate our language."" After the speech, several hundred Kurds took to the streets, throwing stones and clashing with Turkish riot police, who retaliated by firing tear gas and water cannons. The banning of the DTP came after more then a week of riots and clashes between police and Kurdish protesters in cities and towns across Turkey. Tensions have rapidly escalated, amid reports that the jailed leader of the Kurdish separatist movement -- the Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the PKK -- was moved to a smaller prison cell, and after the PKK claimed responsibility for a deadly ambush last week that killed seven Turkish soldiers. In Istanbul on Sunday, Kurdish protesters threw rocks and Molotov cocktails and clashed with police in a central commercial district. At one point, gun- and club-wielding Turkish ultranationalists joined the fray. Explosions of ethnic anger were not limited to Turkey's largest city. In the eastern Turkish town of Malatya, Turkish nationalists were filmed scuffling with Kurdish demonstrators Sunday. Police struggled to keep the two groups apart as they kicked and cursed at each other in the street. Clashes also erupted on Monday in the coastal city of Adana and in the border town of Dogubayazit, Turkey's official Anatolian news agency reported. Anatolian reported that nine demonstrators were detained and that one demonstrator and five police officers were injured in the Dogubayazit clash. Signs identifying the now-defunct DTP have been removed from the front of the 19th-century, four-story building where the party's Istanbul headquarters is located. Two prior incarnations of the DTP have been shut down by the Turkish state within the last decade. Mustafa Avci, the chairman of the party's Istanbul branch, said the Turkish state is forcing conflict on the country's Kurdish minority. ""They are forcing this on us,"" Avci said in an interview with CNN on Monday. ""Therefore, they are the ones who practice terrorism, not us. ...Those who want war are terrorists.""","NEW: Kurdish lawmakers say they'll resign seats, days after court banned their party .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The autopsy on Corey Haim revealed the actor's heart was enlarged and his lungs were filled with water when he died, Haim's manager said. The Los Angeles County coroner told Haim's mother that her son suffered from pulmonary congestion, manager Mark Heaslip said. Heaslip said this was evidence that Haim's death was not caused by a drug overdose, but Brian Elias with the coroner's office said they are waiting for toxicology tests before deciding what killed Haim. The 1980s teen movie actor, who struggled for decades with drug addiction, died early Wednesday after collapsing in the Los Angeles apartment he shared with his mother, authorities said. Longtime friend and frequent co-star Corey Feldman asked Wednesday that people not ""jump the gun"" to conclude a drug overdose killed Haim. Heaslip, manager to both Feldman and Haim, said he seemed to be winning his battle against drug abuse in the weeks before his death. Haim, 38, was taken to Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, early Wednesday, where he was pronounced dead at 2:15 a.m. PT (5:15 a.m. ET), said Ed Winter, Los Angeles County deputy coroner. Haim was in the apartment he shared with his mother, Judy Haim, when he ""became a little dizzy, he kind of went to his knees in the bedroom,"" Winter said. ""His mom assisted him in the bed. He became unresponsive."" His mother called paramedics to the apartment, which is between Hollywood Hills and Burbank, he said. Haim had suffered from flulike symptoms for two days, the deputy coroner said. ""We found no illicit drugs. However, we did recover four of his prescription meds at the location,"" Winter said, adding he does not know what those drugs were. Haim was ""weaned down to literally zero medications"" in the past two weeks by an addiction specialist, Heaslip said on HLN's ""Issues With Jane Velez-Mitchell"" on Wednesday. The doctor ""put him on a new line of medications,"" Feldman said on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Wednesday. Feldman pleaded with people not to draw conclusions that Haim died from a drug overdose. He said that until the autopsy report is issued, ""nobody knows and nobody's going to know."" Watch Corey Feldman talk about his friend's death on ""Larry King Live"" ""I know that there were symptoms that he was showing that expressed it could be a number of things,"" Feldman said. ""This could have been a kidney failure. This could have been a heart failure."" Heaslip that said Haim's mother, Judy, told him ""there were no signs of him overdosing."" His death came as his career was picking up, with Haim booking ""movie after movie,"" Heaslip said. His latest film is set for release soon, he said. Haim ""really became a man"" in recent months as he helped his mother in her battle with cancer, Feldman said. ""He's been there for her, taking care of her, being responsible,"" he said. Feldman said he was angry about how Haim has been snubbed in recent years by the entertainment industry. He was broke, without a car and living in a month-to-month rental apartment with his mother, he said. ""We build people up as children, we put them on pedestals and then when we decide that they are not marketable anymore, we walk away from them,"" he said. Haim's most famous role was in the 1987 movie ""The Lost Boys,"" in which he appeared with Feldman. Haim played the role of a fresh-faced teenager whose brother becomes a vampire. In later years, the two friends -- who appeared in eight movies together -- struggled with drug abuse and went their separate ways. They reunited for a reality show, ""The Two Coreys,"" in 2007, but A&E Network canceled the program after slightly more than a year. In a 2007 interview on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" Haim and Feldman discussed their battle with drugs. Feldman told King that he had gotten clean, but it took Haim longer. Haim called himself ""a chronic relapser for the rest of my life."" ""I think I have an addiction to pretty much everything,"" he said. ""I mean, I have to be very careful with myself as far as that goes, which is why I have a support group around me consistently."" In 2008, Feldman told People magazine that he would no longer speak to Haim until his former co-star got sober. In a clip from ""The Two Coreys,"" Feldman and his wife, along with two other former teen stars, called on Haim in an effort to get him to admit he needed help, the magazine said. The meeting followed an incident in which Haim, scheduled to film a cameo appearance in a direct-to-DVD sequel to ""The Lost Boys,"" appeared on the set ""clearly under the influence,"" People reported. Feldman told King on Wednesday that he renewed his contact with Haim in the past year because of the progress he made against his addiction. Haim was born December 23, 1971, in Toronto, Ontario, according to a biography on his Web site. He made his first television appearance in 1982 on the Canadian series ""The Edison Twins."" His first film role was in the 1984 movie ""First Born."" Haim also won rave reviews for his title role in the 1986 film ""Lucas."" Film critic Roger Ebert said of him at the time, ""If he continues to act this well, he will never become a half-forgotten child star, but will continue to grow into an important actor."" Following ""The Lost Boys,"" Haim and Feldman appeared in ""License to Drive"" and ""Dream a Little Dream."" CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.","Corey Haim's manager: Autopsy showed actor's heart was enlarged when he died .

"Washington (CNN)  -- It feels like it went by in the blink of an eye. Tai Shan, the giant panda cub so many people have come to know and love, is about to board a flight to China. ""It's very bittersweet. We love him. We love having him here,"" said Erika Bauer, curator at the National Zoo in Washington. Tai Shan was born in the nation's capital, so you can confidently call him a Washingtonian. But he is to be sent to China, under an agreement between the two nations, to help replenish the endangered species' numbers in the wild. At 4½ years old, Tai Shan is more of a panda adolescent than a cub, but to Tai Shan fans, he will always be their baby. ""We watched him as he grew up and it's kind of sad to see him go,"" said Kathleen Ryland of Highland, Maryland. Ryland brought her two children to say their goodbyes to Tai Shan at a farewell party at the National Zoo Saturday. Despite the snow falling on the panda exhibit, there were plenty of warm and fuzzy feelings about Tai Shan. ""He's so cute. I'll miss him,"" said Claire Ryland, 7. It's often said that a visit to Washington is not complete without a stop at the zoo to see Tai Shan. Over the years, some have even gone as far to say that Tai Shan was Washington's No. 1 resident -- even getting top billing over the president. Tai Shan will leave for China on Thursday via the ""FedEx Panda Express."" He'll be joined by Mei Lan - a 3-year-old panda born at Zoo Atlanta in Georgia. Eventually, they will take part in a breeding program aimed at increasing the panda population. Giant pandas are currently on the endangered list. The National Zoo estimates that about 1,600 giant pandas are currently in the wild. Bauer says that's all the more reason to say goodbye to Tai Shan. ""It's very important to get Tai Shan into the breeding population to help conserve the species in general. This is a very good day for him,"" she said.","Tai Shan, a 4-year-old giant panda, is to be delivered to China next week .

"(CNN)  -- Get out the coats, boots, and shovels; people in some parts of the country are in for it this winter, according to the Farmer's Almanac. Break out your winter gear -- the Farmers' Almanac is predicting a rough winter for large parts of the U.S. The longtime periodical, published since 1818 and famous for its long-range weather predictions, is out with its annual winter forecast, which says Old Man Winter is really going to hammer folks in the Midwest and upper Great Lakes region with very cold and very snowy conditions. The almanac puts it this way: . ""A large area of numbingly cold temperatures will predominate from roughly east of the Continental Divide to west of the Appalachians. The coldest temperatures will be over the northern Great Lakes and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. ""But acting almost like the bread of a sandwich, to this swath of unseasonable cold will be two regions with temperatures that will average closer to normal -- the West Coast and the East Coast."" But don't let your guard down if you live along the East or West coasts. Farmer's Almanac managing editor Sandi Duncan says no one will be immune to the rough weather this winter. ""Even the areas that we say are going to be like the bread of the ice-cold sandwich are going to have bouts of stormy conditions. There's no way it's going to be that mild of a winter,"" she says. Nasty weather is also in the forecast for late in the season as winter moves toward spring. ""We're actually predicting a possible blizzard in the northeast to the mid-Atlantic states sometime in February,"" Duncan says. ""And it does look like the cool temperatures to the cold temperatures are going to hang on. And spring does look kind of rainy."" The Farmers' Almanac gets pretty specific about that late-season blizzard forecast. According to Duncan, ""February 12th-15th looks very stormy with blizzard conditions possible especially in New England but also going down to the mid-Atlantic coast."" The periodical says, ""While three-quarters of the country is predicted to see near- or below-average precipitation this winter, that doesn't mean there won't be any winter storms! On the contrary, significant snowfalls are forecast for parts of every zone.""

"(CNN) -- Kimberley Locke knows a thing or two about singing competitions. ""American Idol"" finalist Kimberley Locke is the new co-host of ""Gospel Dream."" Having placed third during season two of ""American Idol"" -- just behind winner Ruben Studdard and runner-up Clay Aiken -- the singer is back in reality show action as the new co-host of ""Gospel Dream."" The Gospel Music Channel's talent search is going into its fourth season, and Locke joins fellow host Mike Kasem (son of Casey Kasem) and the judges -- gospel artist J. Moss, Destiny's Child member Michelle Williams and industry executive Mitchell Solarek -- on the show. Locke has worked steadily since she first burst onto the ""Idol"" scene in 2003. She has modeled, served as a spokesperson for plus-sized clothier Lane Bryant and Jenny Craig and appeared on VH1's ""Celebrity Fit Club."" All the while, she has continued to pursue her music. Her ""8th World Wonder"" was a big hit, making the Top 10 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary charts. She's had three dance chart No. 1s. Locke recently spoke with CNN about the ""Gospel Dream,"" life after ""American Idol"" and the one reality show she really wants to appear on next. CNN: How did you get involved with ""Gospel Dream?"" Kimberley Locke: Funny enough, I've been wanting to do more hosting, and I had been talking to my manager about it. They contacted me out of the blue, and I was like ""Oh, I put it out to the universe, and here it is."" CNN: Are you a gospel music fan? Locke: I am a gospel music fan. Of course I grew up in the church singing gospel music. I don't listen to as much as I used to, but I used to sing in a girl a cappella group and that's how we started, performing in church. CNN: Why do you think so many performers in the music industry come out of the church? Locke: I think a lot of people become stars in their church. ... The church environment is so supportive. When you are first starting out and learning how to sing in front of an audience, that's the kind of audience you want to be in front of. Even if you mess up and you sound horrible, they kind of let you stand there and collect yourself while the pianist keeps playing. Then they plow through it with you. That's a part of the business, a professionalism that really comes in handy when you get to this level. CNN: You've had some experiences with singing competitions. How is ""Gospel Dream"" different? Locke: It's different in that the contestants are very focused on where they want to be and the type of music they want to sing. When you are on ""Idol,"" you are forced to fit into all of these different genres you may or may not want to do and you may or may not even be familiar with them. The ""Gospel Dream"" contestants' direction is really clear and defined, so they are picking songs that really speak to them on a personal level.  Watch Locke talk about the show » . CNN: How has life been for you post-""Idol?"" Locke: Life has been great post-""Idol."" So many opportunities, so many things I would have never imagined. Things that I didn't even associate with singing, like modeling, hosting, being a spokesperson, owning a restaurant. It just opened so many doors. CNN: You were a plus-sized model and spokesperson for Lane Bryant, but now you are way too small to do that. Locke: That really opened me up to bond with my fans. I tell people I'm still a big girl at heart. CNN: When is your next album coming out? Locke: I just started working on the next album. We are in the very preliminary stages of putting together the concept of the record and we just compiled a bunch of songs to start listening to. CNN: Are you planning on doing any other reality shows? Locke: I'm not really a big reality show fan. I did ""Celebrity Fit Club"" because there was a purpose behind that in my wanting to lose weight. There is only one reality show I really, really want to do, and that's ""Dancing With the Stars."" I want to be on that show because then I'd lose the extra 10 to 15 pounds I want to lose.","Singer Kimberley Locke finished third during season two of ""American Idol""

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- Golfer Tiger Woods will be issued a careless driving citation for the crash outside his home last week, but he will not face criminal charges, the Florida Highway Patrol said Tuesday. Woods, 33, struck a fire hydrant and a tree with his 2009 Cadillac SUV in his luxury neighborhood near Windermere, Florida, early Friday, police said. Upon conviction of careless driving, a moving violation, Woods faces a $164 fine and four points on his license, Maj. Cindy Williams of the Florida Highway Patrol said. ""Mr. Woods' status in no way impacted our investigation or conclusion,"" Williams said. ""The investigation has determined that Mr. Woods is at fault in the crash."" Woods satisfied the requirements of Florida law regarding motor vehicle accidents by providing his driver's license, registration and proof of insurance to authorities, Williams said. ""With the issuance of this citation, the Florida Highway Patrol has completed its investigation into this matter,"" she said. There was insufficient evidence to request a subpoena for medical information in the case, said Sgt. Kim Montes, an FHP spokeswoman. There were no claims of domestic abuse. Authorities have said they don't have details on why Woods was driving away from his home around 2:25 a.m. Friday. State troopers three times have asked to question him about the accident, but he has declined, the highway patrol has said. What do you think about the Tiger Woods saga? Police have said the accident was not alcohol-related. Woods canceled plans to attend the Chevron World Challenge in Southern California ""due to injuries sustained in a one-car accident last week,"" according to a statement Monday from the golfer. In a statement issued Sunday afternoon on his Web site, Woods offered no details of his accident except to say he had cuts and bruises and was ""pretty sore."" ""This situation is my fault, and it's obviously embarrassing to my family and me,"" he said. ""I'm human and I'm not perfect. I will certainly make sure this doesn't happen again."" Woods is a four-time winner of the tournament. A knee injury kept him from competing last year. ""I am extremely disappointed that I will not be at my tournament this week,"" Woods said. ""I am certain it will be an outstanding event, and I'm very sorry that I can't be there."" People holding tickets for the event -- which runs Wednesday through Sunday -- can apply for full refunds starting next Monday, tournament officials said. Ticketholders who do not ask for refunds can get a 20 percent discount when buying 2010 tickets, they said. The annual charity event, which Woods hosts in Thousand Oaks, California, is a major fundraiser for the Tiger Woods Foundation, but it was not immediately clear how much money it would lose because of Woods' cancellation. The incident has ended Woods' golf appearances until next season, according to a statement posted on his Web site. The PGA Tour has ended for the year, but the first tournament of the 2010 season is just five weeks away. At least one other charity event is scheduled, but it is not clear if Woods had planned to attend. Woods has won the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament four times each, as well as three U.S. Open Championships. Last week, a story in the National Enquirer alleged that Woods has been seeing a New York nightclub hostess. The woman denied having an affair with Woods when contacted by The Associated Press. The woman in question has retained Los Angeles lawyer Gloria Allred, who is know for handling high-profile cases, to represent her. Allred told CNN there were no immediate plans for a news conference, although she may soon release a written statement. Windermere's mayor called on the news media to back away from the story, saying, ""Our residents would like to put this behind us."" ""It's time to move on,"" Mayor Gary Bruhn said. ""Let the man recover if he is injured, and let him get back to his life, and let our residents get back to normalcy."" Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, said the Florida Highway Patrol informed them that further discussion with them is both voluntary and optional. ""Although Tiger realizes that there is a great deal of public curiosity, it has been conveyed to FHP that he simply has nothing more to add and wishes to protect the privacy of his family."" Under Florida law, Woods is not obligated to give a statement about the crash. His attorney, Mark NeJame, handed over the required documents to the troopers Sunday at Woods' home, Montes said. Investigators had sought possible surveillance tapes of the accident from neighbors, but none were found, she said. In his statement, Woods praised his wife, Elin Nordegren, who he said ""acted courageously when she saw I was hurt and in trouble."" Nordegren told police she used a golf club to break out the rear window of the vehicle, and then pulled Woods from the SUV after she heard the accident from inside their home. But Woods said, ""This is a private matter, and I want to keep it that way."" And, he added, ""The only person responsible for the accident is me."" Woods and his wife have two children, a 2-year-old and a baby born in February.

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Toyota has added the brake systems of the latest Lexus hybrid vehicles to a growing list of problems with various models, the company said Friday. The company said it was checking the brakes on the Lexus vehicle model HS250h -- as well as a Japanese model called the Sai -- because they use the same system as that used on the 2010 Toyota Prius. Toyota has announced no recall of these vehicles, however, and said it has not received any complaints about the brakes from consumers. But the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced Thursday it is opening a formal investigation into problems with the Prius, Toyota's fourth-best selling model in the United States and the best-selling model in Japan. The company has acknowledged a software glitch that is causing problems with its braking. It said it is looking further at the best way to repair the problem. On Thursday, Ford announced that it was changing the software in the braking system for its Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrids to correct an occasion glitch in the old software. Ford said no injuries had been reported involving the problem. The Fusion/Milan's issue seemed less serious than that of the Prius, said David Champion, the head of auto testing at Consumer Reports. The NHTSA investigation involves only 2010 model year Prius hybrids, which went on sale in the middle of last year. There are only 37,000 of those vehicles on the road, according to the agency. The Prius, which is built in Japan, is not one of the eight models affected by two recent recalls -- covering several million vehicles -- to fix problems with sticking gas pedals. All of those models were built at North American plants. NHTSA said its Office of Defects investigation has received 124 reports from consumers about problems with the Prius brakes, including four reports that involved crashes and two that resulted in injuries. No fatalities have been reported. Investigators have spoken with consumers and conducted preliminary field work. Late Wednesday, Toyota President Akio Toyoda spoke with U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, reassuring him that Toyota takes U.S. safety concerns seriously and puts safety at the top of the company's priorities, according to NHTSA's statement. Toyota had only limited comment on the probe. ""We have heard about NHTSA's intention to begin an investigation. Toyota will cooperate fully with NHTSA's investigation,"" the company said in a statement. Even if the solution ends up being a relatively simple and inexpensive software adjustment, the Prius braking problems come at a bad time for Toyota, which has seen its prized reputation for quality and safety badly damaged by the recalls and the news attention given to them. The company has estimated that the problem with the gas pedals will cost it about 100,000 sales this year and $2 billion in repair costs and lost revenue. Other experts say the problem could be more long-lasting if consumers who once trusted the Toyota brand decide to shop elsewhere. The Prius problem is a ""disconnect"" in the vehicle's complex anti-lock brake system that causes less than a one-second lag before the brakes start to work, Toyota said Thursday. At 60 mph, though, a vehicle will have traveled nearly another 90 feet before the brakes begin to take hold. The company also said it changed the braking system software in January for vehicles built since then. But it has yet to determine how to fix the brakes of vehicles already on the road. CNN's Kyung Lah and CNNMoney.com's Peter Valdes-Dapena and Chris Isidore contributed to this report.","Toyota has admitted to a software glitch that is causing problems with braking .

"(CNN) -- Environmental saviors can turn up in the most unexpected places. For the answer to our global waste management crisis, we need only look as far as our back gardens, for example. Forty million manure worms are being put to use in Sydney to treat its sewage. That's what proponents of vermicomposting will tell us, anyway. Vermicomposting is the art of composting using worms -- and it is worms, apparently, who could save us yet. Worms are nature's waste disposal units. Or rather, it is more accurate to call them waste renewal units, as they don't simply consume the waste -- they turn it into something far more useful: nutrient-rich compost. Earthworms are by any definition incredible creatures -- particularly, in this context: The Eisenia foetida and Lumbricus rubellus, which are the two breeds of worm commonly used in vermicomposting, according to CityFarmer.org. Not only can they eat their own body weight in organic waste every day, but they actually remove -- or neutralize -- many of the toxins in that waste in the process, according to The Ecologist. There are a lot of them, too. You will find as many as 1 million earthworms in just 1 acre of land, according to NatureWatch, their population doubling in size every one-two months. And they work hard -- 1 million worms will get through 10 tons of leaves, stems and dead roots in one year, ploughing 40 tons of soil in the process. What they end up producing is ready-to-go plant soluble nutrients. According to NatureWatch, earthworm castings have five times as much nitrogen, seven times as much phosphorous, 11 times as much potassium and 1,000 times more ""beneficial bacteria"" than the stuff the worm consumes in the first place. Literally speaking, what goes in is far less valuable than what comes out. Utilizing 'black gold' It is no surprise why these worms' byproducts are often referred to as ""black gold,"" this knowledge being particularly pertinent at a time when nearly 40 percent of the world's agricultural soil has become ""seriously degraded,"" according to the UK Soil Association. Worm compost: . Just one pound of worms can turn 1.3 million pounds of raw manure into high quality fertilizer in around 60 days, according to ScienceDaily. And plants love it. Research has shown that plant yields experience a significant boost from vermicomposting, by as much as 40 percent for broccoli, 80 percent for tomatoes and as much as 259 percent for carrots, according to The Ecologist. According to the World Waste Survey, compiled by Veolia Environmental Services, we generated at least 1.2 billion metric tons of municipal waste in 2004. And a high proportion of that waste was organic matter which could have been composted. Around 32 percent of the European Union's annual municipal waste (around 120 million tons) is food and garden waste, according to Waste Management World. And 30 percent of U.S. waste could have been composted in 2000, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -- representing 92 million tons of organic waste that otherwise sat rotting on a landfill, emitting methane into the atmosphere. As local governments and companies grapple with the issue of how to safely dispose of waste, vermicomposting is finding new fans -- some in unusual places. In Hong Kong, none other than fast-food chain McDonald's has signed up to a vermicomposting program that will have 80 million worms feasting on between 50 and 200 tons of organic waste a day, according to the Reuters news service. McDonald's aims to decrease the amount of waste it sends to Hong Kong's rapidly filling landfills by 80 percent, Reuters reports. Other companies to have experimented with worm composting include Ikea in the U.S. state of Illinois, where, according to Treehugger.com, it is conducting vermicomposting trials. If all goes well, it aims to use worm composting to boost its 70 percent recycling rates to 90 percent, the site says. As it happens, we have had this knowledge for centuries. Aristotle himself was even said to have called worms the ""intestines of the soil,"" according to The New York Times, which also points out that Cleopatra was another devotee, bestowing sacred status on them and ordering them protected. Charles Darwin admired their land-tilling abilities so much that he wrote a book on them. ""It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world as have these lowly organized creatures,"" he mused, according to The New York Times. Greenhouse gas emitters . What Darwin, Cleopatra or Aristotle could not have known however, is that worms could also have the potential to save us from toxic waste. Scientists in India have found that worms' digestive systems and regenerative abilities are so remarkable that they can actually absorb toxic materials yet expel toxic-free manure. According to the Indian newspaper, India Together, researchers in Gujarat have found that worms can ""detox"" the organic parts of the industrial sludge which results from the effluent treatment of industrial or hazardous waste. The method is ideal for industries -- such as paper, food processing, oil, textiles, dairy, distilleries and agro-chemicals -- where there is large enough organic components in the industrial sludge, Indian researchers say. But even with vermicomposting, something that looks like one of the most environmentally sound ideas around, there's a downside -- and it's a rather large one. It turns out that worms used in composting emit a greenhouse gas -- nitrous oxide -- which is hundreds of times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Unfortunately, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, large-scale composting plants could be just as damaging to the environment as landfills of the same size, reports the UK's Telegraph newspaper. ""The emissions that come from these worms can actually be 290 times more potent than carbon dioxide and 20 times more potent than methane,"" the Telegraph quotes Jim Frederickson, an Open University research fellow.

"Washington (CNN) -- The cost of the Pentagon's newest fighter jet will be more than double the original price, solidifying the F-35 joint strike fighter as the most expensive Pentagon weapons program ever. At a Capitol Hill hearing on Thursday, the Pentagon's chief weapons buyers said numerous problems over the almost 10-year program have forced the cost of the aircraft to go from $50 million a jet in 2001 to about $113 million. That cost overrun has also forced the Pentagon to justify the program to Congress. Outrage about the cost among the Senate panel was expected, including that from the chairman of the Armed Service Committee, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan. ""This committee has been a strong supporter of the JSF program from the beginning, however, people should not conclude that we're going to be willing to continue that strong support without regard to increased costs coming from poor program management,"" Levin said. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, the ranking member, had been pushing for a hearing on the program. ""The taxpayers are a little tired of this, and I can't say that I can blame them,"" McCain said. ""It's a bit frustrating to hear the secretary of defense as short a time ago as last August to tell us that everything is OK,"" McCain said. McCain was referring to a visit to the joint strike fighter assembly plant last year where Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said most of the high risk elements associated with JSF's developmental program were largely in the past, according to McCain. The Pentagon wants to buy more than 2,400 of the technologically advanced aircraft. The F-35 program has had numerous technical problems, delays and slow productivity over the years, including an entire program restructuring in an attempt to reduce the skyrocketing cost. Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition Ashton Carter told the Senate panel that the program has fallen short on performance in the past few years. ""That is unacceptable,"" he said. Despite that, the fighter jet program still enjoys strong support from service chiefs and congressional members because it touches numerous states. The F-35 program cost overrun triggered the Nunn-McCurdy law, which requires the Pentagon to tell Congress of significant cost increases. The law forces the Pentagon to justify continuing with the program. The Pentagon's director of cost assessment and program evaluation, Christine Fox, told the senators she expects the Pentagon will officially notify Congress under the Nunn-McCurdy regulation by April 1. The plane was designed to be the next generation fighter for the military and would have three variants. The Navy would have one for its carrier fleet, the Marines would use it to replace their aging Harrier jump jet fleet and the Air Force would use it as the service phases out the F-16 and F-15 fighter jets. The planes are being built by Lockheed Martin, and the program also has international partners who have been building parts for the aircraft. More than 700 of them would be sold to those partner countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Denmark, Norway and Australia. The fighter is the largest weapons program ever and Gates has been counting on it, as there are no immediate alternative programs to the F-35. Even with the delays and cost overruns, the first planes are expected to be put into service as early as 2012 for the Marine Corps. But the Air Force and Navy are expecting their first aircraft to be delivered by 2016, a two year delay for the Navy and a three year delay for the Air Force, according to Pentagon officials. Even as the program tries to field an aircraft in less than two years, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) official testified at the hearing that there are still no final costs associated with the program through its projected life ending in 2034. ""To date, the department does not have a full, comprehensive cost estimate for completing the program,"" said Michael Sullivan, director of the acquisition and sourcing management team for the GAO.","The cost of the F-35 aircraft has gone from $50 million a jet in 2001 to about $113 million .

"(CNN) -- The wife of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid underwent neck surgery Friday after being injured with their daughter in a four-vehicle wreck in suburban Washington a day earlier, her surgeon said. Since the surgery, Landra Reid, 69, has been able ""to get out of bed, her pain is well-controlled and she's able to swallow some,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Franco of Inova Fairfax Hospital. She can move her arms and legs, but is expected to go through physical therapy before being released in a few days, Franco said. Reid's wife broke her neck, a vertebra in her lower back and her nose, the doctor said. The couple's adult daughter, Lana Reid Barringer of McLean, Virginia, suffered a neck injury and facial lacerations, the senator's spokesman, Jon Summers, said Thursday. Lana Reid was released from the hospital Thursday night. The wreck occurred in the northbound lanes of Interstate 95 in Fairfax County at 1:10 p.m., when the 2005 Honda Odyssey driven by the daughter began braking in stop-and-go traffic and was rear-ended by a tractor-trailer, according to a Virginia State Police report. ""The impact forced the Honda Odyssey to rear-end the vehicle in front of it, a 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee,"" it says. ""The Jeep Grand Cherokee was then forced into the next lane over where it struck a 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt."" The drivers of the Jeep and the Chevrolet also were taken to Inova Fairfax Hospital. Their injuries were not considered life-threatening. The driver of the truck, Allan W. Snader, 59, of Ohio, was charged with reckless driving, the police report said. He was not injured in the crash. The tractor-trailer was carrying rolls of plastic. The 70-year-old senator visited his wife and daughter shortly after hearing of the accident at 2:15 p.m., then returned to his office in the Capitol to work on health care legislation, said Reid spokesman Jim Manley. He was back at the hospital later in the afternoon and stayed until midnight, then returned early Friday to be there for his wife's surgery, Summers said. Summers told reporters Landra Reid's recovery is the senator's top priority, but ""his plans have not changed at all"" in Congress. ""Landra and I have been married for 50 years -- she is the love of my life,"" Reid said in a statement read by Summers at a news conference. ""And I look forward to her making a quick recovery as soon as possible."" Reid met his wife at Basic High School in Henderson, Nevada, during the mid-1950s. They married in 1959 and had their first child, Lana, two years later. Three boys followed. The couple has 16 grandchildren. CNN Congressional Producer Ted Barrett and Brianna Keilar contributed to this report.","Landra Reid, 69, was involved in a car accident on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- James Cameron unveiled his much-hyped, wildly-anticipated 3D sci-fi epic ""Avatar"" to audiences in full in London Thursday. Here's what the critics are saying about the Oscar-winner's first outing since ""Titanic,"" the most successful film of modern times. Todd McCarthy, Variety: The King of the World sets his sights on creating another world entirely in ""Avatar,"" and it's very much a place worth visiting. ...delivers unique spectacle, breathtaking sights, narrative excitement and an overarching anti-imperialist, back-to-nature theme that will play very well around the world..."" Mike Goodridge, Screen International: ...once again takes cinema to a new level of remarkable spectacle ... An epic film born entirely of Cameron's imagination, ""Avatar"" uses tailor-made technology to create the most astonishing visual effects yet seen on screen and blends them seamlessly into a mythical sci-fi story about an ancient alien civilization fighting the encroaching human menace. It's an unprecedented marriage of technology and storytelling which is on the whole remarkably successful. Chris Hewitt, Empire: It's been twelve years since ""Titanic,"" but the King of the World has returned with a flawed but fantastic tour de force that, taken on its merits as a film, especially in two dimensions, warrants four stars. However, if you can wrap a pair of 3D glasses round your peepers, this becomes a transcendent, full-on five-star experience that's the closest we'll ever come to setting foot on a strange new world. Wendy Ide, The Times: ""Avatar"" is an overwhelming, immersive spectacle. The state-of-the-art 3D technology draws us in, but it is the vivid weirdness of Cameron's luridly imagined tropical otherworld that keeps us fascinated. At times it verges on the tacky, like a futuristic air freshener advertisement with the color contrast turned up to the max. The ethically accented orchestral score certainly doesn't help matters. But mostly, it's a place of wonder full of exotically freakish animal composites -- iridescent lizard birds, hammer-headed rhinos -- and sentient vegetation. ""Avatar:"" We shouldn't really be telling you this -- but it's good. Mark Brown, The Guardian: Perhaps most surprising was the politics.

"(CNN) -- Australian Open champion Serena Williams has pulled out of next week's Paris Indoor Open due to a leg injury. The world No. 1 picked up the problem on the way to winning the opening Grand Slam tournament for the fifth time last month, the French event's organizers said on Saturday. Seventh-ranked Elena Dementieva will take the American's place as top seed, with Italian No. 12 Flavia Pennetta second and Yanina Wickmayer of Belgium third. Williams has won the Paris title twice, beating former world No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo in the final both times. The Frenchwoman won it for a record third time last year but has now retired. Meanwhile, last year's losing finalists the United States made a strong start without Williams in their Fed Cup first-round clash with France in Lievin on Saturday. Bethanie Mattek-Sands defeated Alize Cornet 7-6 (9-7) 7-5 for her first singles win in the women's teams tournament, while Melanie Oudin beat debutant Pauline Parmentier 6-4 6-4 in the second rubber. The winner of the tie will play either Serbia or Russia in the semifinals, with reverse singles on Sunday before the possibly decisive doubles. Svetlana Kuznetsova gave Russia, beaten by Italy in last year's semifinals, a 1-0 lead when she defeated former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic 6-1 6-4. But Jelena Jankovic, another ex top-ranked player, came from behind to level the tie by beating Alisa Kleybanova 4-6 6-4 6-0 as she won the last 11 games in a match lasting two hours and 18 minutes. Pennetta helped defending champions Italy to end the day level 1-1 with Ukraine, beating Kateryna Bondarenko 7-5 6-3 after Francesca Schiavone lost the opening match 6-1 6-4 to the elder Bondarenko sister Alona in Kharkiv. Alona's win was the Ukraine's first at World Group level. The winner of the tie will face either the Czech Republic or Germany in the last four, with that clash also tied at 1-1. Anna-Lena Groenefeld put Germany ahead in Brno with a 6-2 6-2 victory over Lucie Safarova, but Petra Kvitova leveled for the hosts with a 6-4 6-4 win against Andrea Petkovic.","World No. 1 Serena Williams pulls out of next week's Paris Indoor Open .

Sindh provincial health minister, Dr. Saghir Ahmed said that along with the 12 dead, 30 people were injured in the first blast. The second blast happened in front of the emergency room at Jinnah Hospital, where doctors treated people from the first attack and people on stretchers were waiting to be taken in to the crowded facility.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The prosecution cannot argue that sex was a motivation for doctors to give Anna Nicole Smith the drugs that may have led to her death, a judge ruled Thursday. Howard K. Stern, right, companion of Anna Nicole Smith, is one of three people charged in the case. ""I'm just not buying that,"" Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry said. The ruling came on the third day of a preliminary hearing for Howard K. Stern -- Smith's lawyer and companion -- and co-defendants Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor, on charges stemming from the Playboy model and reality TV star's death. Larry Birkhead, the father of Smith's now 3-year-old daughter, is set to testify Friday. Deputy District Attorney Renee Rose told Judge Perry she wanted to present evidence that Eroshevich, a woman, had a sexual relationship with Smith, which was the doctor's ""motivation to continue providing excess medications"" to her. The prosecution planned to present an expert witness who would say such a sexual relationship between a doctor and an addicted patient could compromise the care, Assistant District Attorney Sean Carney said. Court documents released last month said investigators found photos of Eroshevich and Smith ""naked in the bathtub in intimate embraces,"" according to one sworn statement. One affidavit referenced a video clip of Kapoor ""kissing and snuggling"" with Smith ""in a reclined position in a nightclub setting."" The three defendants are charged with an illegal conspiracy to prescribe, administer and dispense controlled substances to an addict. Stern faces 11 felony counts, while the doctors were charged with six each. Smith's death in a Hollywood, Florida, hotel on February 8, 2007, was ruled to be from ""acute combined drug intoxication,"" the Broward County, Florida, medical examiner said. Her death came five months after the birth of her daughter, Dannielynn, on September 7, 2006, and the sudden death of her 20-year-old son, Daniel, three days later. Smith's part-time body guard, Maurice Brighthaupt, was testifying Thursday morning when Rose brought up the possibility of a sexual relationship. Brighthaupt, a full-time south Florida paramedic, said he was rarely paid for his bodyguard services ""because they told me they didn't have much money at the time."" He helped Smith because she was like a sister, he said. Brighthaupt testified that he had seen Stern giving Smith illegal drugs, which contradicted public statements he made in the months after Smith's death. He said he changed his story after having time to think about the events, but defense lawyer Steve Sadow suggested it was for money and revenge on Stern for an accusation he made against Brighthaupt. Brighthaupt acknowledged that he was paid at least $150,000 for interviews by the ""Entertainment Tonight"" and ""Access Hollywood"" TV shows. Sadow pointed to an October 10, 2007, interview by CNN's Larry King in which Stern accused Brighthaupt of stealing photos of Smith and selling them to tabloids. Brighthaupt began cooperating with the lead investigator, who he said he had been ""ducking,"" only days after Stern's CNN appearance. But he denied revenge was his motivation. Before her son's death, Smith was a happy, normal person, Brighthaupt said. ""She knew she was the 'it',"" Brighthaupt said. But in the five months after her son's death and until her own death, Smith was ""very weak"" and ""zombie-like,"" he said. ""She just didn't want to deal with life after the death of her son,"" Brighthaupt said. Anytime she was able to sleep, she would dream of her son and wake up crying, he said. Nannies stayed with her infant around the clock at her home in the Bahamas, while Smith slept through most of the days. She would sometimes get up late at night and stumble around her house cursing, he said. ""Someone had to always keep an eye on her because she was very, very depressed,"" he said. Other than medications, the only relief she got from her pain was her daughter, he said. ""The times when she'd get really depressed, that's when we'd bring Dannielynn to her to let her see the baby,"" he said. Smith would constantly read what was written about her on the Internet, using a ""Google Alert"" to let her know when a story was published about her, he said. Brighthaupt described Smith as ""manipulative"" when she wanted something. ""She manipulated Dr. Eroshevich,"" he said. Eroshevich, a Los Angeles psychiatrist, traveled to the Bahamas five or six times in 2006 to attend to Smith, he said. They had a mother-daughter friendship, not a doctor-patient relationship, he said. The doctor sometimes substituted placebos for the tray full of pills Smith regularly took for her complaints of pain and depression, he said. ""She was very concerned that we needed to wean [Smith] off the medications,"" Brighthaupt said. In earlier testimony, California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement Special Agent Danny Santiago testified investigators found 12 different prescription drugs, including dangerous opiates, in Smith's hotel room after her death. Seven of them were prescribed using Stern's name, although spelled ""Stearn,"" Santiago said. A series of affidavits used by state investigators to obtain search warrants in their 2½-year inquiry was unsealed last month, revealing many details of the prosecution's case.","Judge refuses to allow argument that sex motivated Anna Nicole Smith's doctor .

"(The Frisky) -- Valentine's Day can be one of the most depressing days of the year for singles, especially if you just went through a breakup. It can be torture to watch couples exchange stuffed bears, chocolates and kisses. So keep your heart on the mend by avoiding these seven spots couples flock to on Valentine's Day. 1. Movie theaters: Please don't make yourself sit through the latest rom-com. If you must see a flick, go to something unsentimental, like an action film that involves fighting and guns. Though even those often have romantic secondary storylines. 2.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: You are in the homestretch -- just a few weeks left to go before the holiday break. And we'll help get you there. I'm Carl Azuz; this is CNN Student News. First Up: Troops in Afghanistan . AZUZ: Big announcement scheduled for tomorrow night: what President Obama plans to do about Afghanistan. There are 68,000 U.S. troops there right now. And you know the president's been meeting with advisors for weeks, trying to figure out how the U.S. should approach the war there. He says he wants to get the decision right, but he's been criticized for taking too much time to make it. There is one thing that some critics and supporters of the president seem to agree on, though: that he needs to talk about the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. SEN. RICHARD LUGAR, (R), INDIANA: The president needs to start by outlining the war we are in. Now by that, I mean, the war not against the Taliban, Al Qaida, but what is, at least, the objective of continuing in Afghanistan or in any place? That is basic. SEN. JACK REED, (D), RHODE ISLAND: The president has to speak to the American people, remind them why we're there, and also lay out a strategy, not just the reflexive response to a recommendation, but a strategy that involves protecting the homeland from Al Qaida. Cyber Monday . AZUZ: Good news and bad news about Black Friday, that super shop-off right after Thanksgiving. More Americans showed up in stores than last year -- good for business. But they were spending less money on average -- not good for business. Still, online sales were on the up and up this year, and that could be a good sign heading into Cyber Monday, explained now by Errol Barnett. (BEGIN VIDEO) ERROL BARNETT, CNN CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA: Over the past decade Cyber Monday has become one of the biggest online shopping days of the year. We typically see this on the Monday following Thanksgiving or in the days leading up to Christmas. Huge spikes in online retail sales. People want to avoid those long lines in-store so they head online to snap up some of the bargains. So exactly how much are people spending? Well take a look at the numbers here. After last year's financial collapse, $536 million was spent online in the U.S. on the Friday after Thanksgiving. On the following Monday, you see it there, online sales swelled to $846 million and this year's numbers, they're still coming in, but you can expect them to go higher. You see, even though a 1% drop in overall retail sales are predicted this year, comScore expects a 3% rise in online retail revenue for the months of November and December. That's over last year, which should amount to almost $29 billion of retail sales. Now that's good news, but it's not great news. Typically we see at least a 20% jump for holiday retail sales. From the CNN Center in Atlanta, I'm Errol Barnett. (END VIDEO) Shoutout . Time for the Shoutout! You're looking at a map of Central America. Which of these countries is Honduras? Is it A, B, C or D? You've got three seconds--GO! Honduras is between Guatemala and Nicaragua, and it touches both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Honduras Voting . AZUZ: Sunday's vote was no ordinary election in Honduras. Things there, still at a political standstill, months after President Manuel Zelaya was forced out of office in June. He was accused of trying to illegally change Honduras' constitution. The country's Supreme Court says Zelaya can't get power back until he stands trial. But Honduras' current leader, Roberto Micheletti, is hoping Sunday's vote will settle everything. The U.S. also hopes it does; Argentina and Brazil say it won't. Defying Demands . AZUZ: Iran is doing exactly what other countries don't want it to. The Middle Eastern nation is moving forward on building ten, new, nuclear facilities. And the international community is afraid these things are gonna be used to make illegal, nuclear weapons. Iran argues they're only for nuclear power -- the Iranian Cabinet voting to approve construction just two days after the International Atomic Energy Agency demanded that Iran stop working on another nuclear facility that it had kept secret. Dubai Debt Crisis . AZUZ: Dubai: Part of the United Arab Emirates: known for some of the most extravagant communities on the planet, could be in trouble. A major developer there is in deep debt and wants more time to pay it off. And some are wondering if some lavish property could become a white elephant, something that's more trouble than it's worth for Dubai. Morgan Neill describes how all this could affect places far from the Middle East. (BEGIN VIDEO) MORGAN NEILL, CNN CORRESPONDENT, DUBAI: The party to open Dubai's Atlantis Hotel just over a year ago now seems like a mirage. At an estimated cost of $20 million it boasted a guest list of the world's rich and famous. Just two months after the Lehman shock, the dazzling extravagance seemed to say Dubai is immune, but it never was. Dubai World, which owns Nakheel, the developer of the man-made tree-shaped Palm Jumeirah Island, has now requested a suspension of debt payments. The move threatens to undermine confidence in a recent property recovery, and celebrities who bought homes there may find their property is suddenly worth a lot less. Author Jim Krane says that while established developments should be fine, Dubai's other artificial island projects, The World and Palm Deira, could be in trouble. JIM KRANE, AUTHOR, ""DUBAI CITY OF GOLD"": It will take a special kind of investor and probably, you know, more robust economy for anybody to really build on one of those places. I mean there is a lot more practical places to build than on one of these little islands in the world, so that could be a white elephant for a long time. NEILL: One of the firms, which has bought into the World, has confidence in Dubai's long-term story. GILES BESWICK, SELECT PROPERTY: I would disagree that it would be a white elephant. I think it will be part of the continuing development of Dubai as a city, and a tourism center, and an investment center for many years to come. NEILL: But in the short term, Dubai World's announcement has brought uncertainty and the prospect of a fire sale of assets to raise cash. Whatever the fate of investments abroad, hopes that Dubai's inflated portfolio of luxury property was beginning to recover have been dashed. Morgan Neill, CNN, London.

ERIC SUNDBACK, CHRISTMAS TREE GROWER: You're helping make a Christmas for the whole country. LOTHIAN: The West Virginia couple, both in their 80s, have grown four presidential Christmas trees - one for Jimmy Carter, two for Ronald Reagan and now this 18 1/2 foot Douglas fir destined for the Obama White House. E. SUNDBACK: What we really like this year is that it's going to a family. The children are there. The family is well knit. LOTHIAN: To provide the White House tree, a farmer has to be crowned by the National Christmas Tree Association. Then White House officials make a visit. GLORIA SUNDBACK: They're looking for trees that have good form and for trees that have stronger branches because they use a lot of decorations. LOTHIAN: And it takes a lot of hard work to grow that perfect presidential tree. Careful pruning, experimenting to get the right mix of characteristics, and a little tough love. E. SUNDBACK: She had a word when she would get up in the morning and say, well, fellas, you want to be a Christmas tree now or are you going to wait until later and be toilet paper? That gets the tree growing. LOTHIAN: These college sweethearts who have been growing trees for 50 years are hoping to shake the Obama's hands when they drop off this holiday gift but then it's back to work. E. SUNDBACK: You don't want to let it go to your head because you have to come back out and work again. G. SUNDBACK: That's right. LOTHIAN: But they say they're happy knowing their gift will bring joy to the first family. E. SUNDBACK: We hope they enjoy it as much as we've enjoyed Christmas as kids so if the tree is good and they enjoy it, that's what it's about. (END VIDEO) Before We Go .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Corey Haim's death is linked to an ""illegal and massive prescription-drug ring,"" California Attorney General Jerry Brown said Friday. Brown's office is investigating ""an unauthorized prescription under the former child star's name that was found during an ongoing investigation of fraudulent prescription-drug pads ordered from a vendor in San Diego."" ""These prescriptions are very recent, and it involves Oxycontin and we're not talking just 40 pills, more than that,"" Brown said in an interview Friday with CNN Radio. The announcement comes before the coroner has ruled on what killed Haim, the 1980s teen movie actor who struggled for decades with drug addiction. Haim, 38, died early Wednesday after collapsing in the Los Angeles apartment he shared with his mother, authorities said. ""Corey Haim's death is yet another tragedy linked to the growing problem of prescription-drug abuse,"" Brown said. ""This problem is increasingly linked to criminal organizations, like the illegal and massive prescription-drug ring under investigation."" Brown said the ring uses stolen doctor's identities to order prescription-drug pads that are used to write counterfeit prescriptions. ""The doctor whose name is printed on the form is usually unaware that his or her identity has been stolen for this purpose,"" Brown said. Haim got two powerful drugs from a pharmacy 11 days before his death, according to a source with knowledge of the transaction. His primary-care doctor did not know about the prescriptions and called the pharmacy two days later to find out what Haim had been given, the source said. Brown's announcement did not specify whether any of the prescription drugs found in Haim's apartment after his death were illegally obtained. Several prescription-drug bottles were taken from Haim's apartment, Los Angeles County Deputy Coroner Ed Winter said Friday. Although the bottles indicated the drugs included Vicodin, Valium and Soma, no tests have been done to confirm what they are, he said. Haim had a prescription for the muscle relaxer Soma and the narcotic pain reliever Norco filled at a pharmacy on February 26, a source with knowledge of the transaction said. Two days after Haim personally picked up the drugs, his primary-care doctor called the San Fernando Valley pharmacy to ask about the prescriptions, the source said. The doctor said that ""Haim was not feeling well"" and he needed to know what drugs had been prescribed for the actor, the source said. The source, who worked at the pharmacy, asked not to be identified because his employer had not authorized him to talk. Haim's manager, Mark Heaslip, and close friend Corey Feldman both said Haim began seeing an addiction specialist two weeks before his death. Tiffany Shepis, who was engaged to be married to Haim last May, said on HLN's ""Issues With Jane Velez-Mitchell"" that he was taking large amounts of Valium and Vicodin during their yearlong relationship. ""You're talking about a person that, at the time when I knew him, you know, was ingesting 40 some-odd pills a day,"" Shepis said. Although the autopsy showed Haim's heart was enlarged and he had fluid in his lungs, the coroner's chief investigator said a drug overdose has not been ruled out as the cause of the actor's death. ""You can have somebody with an enlarged heart and some other medical conditions, but you don't know if the actual cause of death is from illegal substances, medication or heart failure,"" Los Angeles County Deputy Coroner Ed Winter said Friday. Heaslip said the enlarged heart was evidence that Haim's death was not caused by a drug overdose, but Winter disputed that. ""There were some preliminary findings and we agreed to let the mother know what those were,"" Winter said. ""It was explained to her that even though this is some preliminary findings that the doctor observed, there wouldn't be a final cause of death until the final toxicology tests are back."" The cause of death may not be determined for another six weeks, Winter said. Feldman, a longtime friend and frequent co-star, asked Wednesday that people not ""jump the gun"" to conclude a drug overdose killed Haim. Heaslip, manager to both Feldman and Haim, said Haim had seemed to be winning his battle against drug abuse in the weeks before his death. Haim was ""weaned down to literally zero medications"" by an addiction specialist in the two weeks before his death, Heaslip said. The doctor ""put him on a new line of medications,"" Feldman said on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" Wednesday. Haim's death came as his career was picking up, with Haim booking ""movie after movie,"" Heaslip said. His latest film is set for release soon, he said. Haim's most famous role was in the 1987 movie ""The Lost Boys,"" in which he appeared with Feldman. Haim played the role of a fresh-faced teenager whose brother becomes a vampire. In later years, the two friends, who appeared in eight movies together, struggled with drug abuse and went their separate ways. They reunited for a reality show, ""The Two Coreys,"" in 2007, but A&E Network canceled the program after slightly more than a year. In a 2007 interview on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" Haim and Feldman discussed their battles with drugs. Feldman told King that he had gotten clean, but it took Haim longer. Haim called himself ""a chronic relapser for the rest of my life."" ""I think I have an addiction to pretty much everything,"" he said. ""I mean, I have to be very careful with myself as far as that goes, which is why I have a support group around me consistently."" Haim was born December 23, 1971, in Toronto, Ontario, according to a biography on his Web site. He made his first television appearance in 1982 on the Canadian series ""The Edison Twins."" His first film role was in the 1984 American movie ""First Born."" Haim also won rave reviews for his title role in the 1986 film ""Lucas."" Film critic Roger Ebert said of him at the time, ""If he continues to act this well, he will never become a half-forgotten child star, but will continue to grow into an important actor."" After ""The Lost Boys,"" Haim and Feldman appeared in ""License to Drive"" and ""Dream a Little Dream."" CNN's Brittany Kaplan and Jack Hannah contributed to this report.","Unauthorized prescriptions found in Haim's name during investigation, official says .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama paid tribute Friday to seven CIA officers killed in Afghanistan in December, calling them ""American patriots who loved their country and gave their lives to defend it."" Obama delivered the remarks during a memorial service at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. The service was closed to the media to protect the identities of undercover officers in attendance. A transcript of Obama's speech was provided to members of the press. ""There are no words that can ease the ache in your hearts,"" Obama told families, friends and co-workers of the seven officers. ""But to their colleagues and all who served with them -- those here today, those still recovering, those watching around the world, I say: Let their sacrifice be a summons. To carry on their work. To complete this mission. To win this war and to keep our country safe."" A suicide bomber killed the CIA officers and contractors, as well as a Jordanian intelligence official, on December 30 at a U.S. base in Khost, in southeastern Afghanistan. The bomber was within seconds of being searched by security contractors when he detonated his explosives, a former intelligence official with knowledge of the incident said in January. Two of those killed were contractors with private security firm Xe, formerly known as Blackwater, a former intelligence official said. The CIA considers contractors to be officers. Former CIA official Robert Richer called the bombing the greatest loss of life for the agency since the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, which killed eight agents. ""These remarkable men and women are the story of America,"" CIA Director Leon Panetta said at Friday's service, according to the transcript. ""They are the heart and soul of this great country. Their devotion to duty is the foundation of our country."" U.S. and Jordanian officials say the bomber, Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, had been recruited as a counterterrorism intelligence agent, despite concerns over his extremist views, and was being used in the hunt for a senior al Qaeda figure. The suicide bombing was ""a huge blow, symbolically and tactically,"" because it eliminated so many CIA officers, who can take years to become ingrained in the region, said Reva Bhalla, director of analysis for Stratfor, an international intelligence company. In addition, she said, the attack showed the ability of the Taliban to penetrate perhaps the most difficult of targets: a CIA base. But Panetta issued a strong statement at the service Friday, assuring those in attendance that ""we will carry this fight to the enemy."" ""Our resolve is unbroken, our energy undiminished and our dedication to each other and to our nation unshakable,"" Panetta said.","""Let their sacrifice be a summons,"" Obama says .

"New York (CNN) -- South Carolina's first lady, Jenny Sanford, said Monday that writing her much-anticipated memoir of her husband's affair was a ""cathartic"" and ""cleansing"" experience. In an interview on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" Sanford called ""Staying True"" -- which hit bookstores Friday -- ""an honest account of the values I hold dear."" It was her husband Gov. Mark Sanford's loss of values that she blames on his much-publicized affair with an Argentine woman that was exposed by reporters after he disappeared for several days last summer. Staffers said he was hiking the Appalachian Trail, but he later admitted he was actually visiting his mistress in Argentina. ""It saddens me because I believed in him and a number of people believed in him,"" Jenny Sanford said Monday. ""I still believe he was a good person. ... Somewhere along the lines, he got off track,"" she said. ""He can get back on track, but it's too late for the marriage."" Jenny Sanford, who filed for divorce in December, said the divorce could be final as early as the end of this month. She said she found out about the affair in January 2009 when she discovered a letter her husband had written to his mistress. ""It was awful,"" she said. ""I literally was in shock. My stomach felt gut-punched."" She said there had been warning signs, but she ""never expected anything like this."" ""I felt in some respects that we had lost something that we would never get back,"" even as she initially considered staying with him, she said. ""Nobody takes a 20-year marriage and decides in [a] snap minute to throw it away,"" she said. ""I came to the decision very prayerfully and carefully over a number of months."" Sanford, 47, moved out of the governor's mansion with their four boys in June. She has said through the entire ordeal that her priority is her children. ""The kids are resilient, and we're back at home settling into a new, normal routine,"" she said of her sons, ages 11-17. ""I feel like they're going to do great."" Asked whether she knows whether her husband is still seeing the Argentine woman, Jenny Sanford says she doesn't know and doesn't want to ask. ""I'm just moving on,"" she said. ""I want to stay happy and positive and raise the kids to the best of my ability.""","South Carolina first lady Jenny Sanford appears Monday on CNN's ""Larry King Live""

"(CNN) -- The fallout from Adam Lambert's risqué American Music Awards performance keeps coming with ""Good Morning America"" canceling the singer's live performance scheduled for Wednesday morning. ABC was flooded with more than 1,500 complaints, and the network sent an e-mail to potential concert goers letting them know that Lambert would not be performing on Wednesday. ""Given Adam Lambert's controversial live performance on the AMAs, we were concerned about airing a similar concert so early in the morning,"" a spokesperson for the network said. ""The Early Show"" on rival network CBS was quick to announce that they have booked Lambert to perform and discuss the controversy on Wednesday morning. Lambert shocked viewers with his sexually suggestive dance sequence that included simulated oral sex as well as Lambert kissing his male keyboardist. The Parents Television Council, a Media watchdog group, also attacked the show as vulgar and urged its members on Monday to contact ABC, Dick Clark Productions and the show's advertisers with complaints about the content. ""Last night's 'American Music Awards' broadcast was nothing short of tasteless and vulgar. Adam Lambert, the second-place finisher in last season's 'American Idol' competition, chose to treat American families to simulated oral sex and other demeaning behavior,"" the PTC posted on its Web site. Melissa Henson, director of communications and public education for the PTC, said the council wasn't concerned about Lambert's gay kiss. Its issue and focus are on the simulated oral sex, she said. ""The gender has nothing to do with it,"" Henson said. ""It would be true if it had been a woman's face that was thrust into his crotch."" Henson also noted that this is not an anti-Adam Lambert campaign and said the council would have had no problem with Lambert performing live on ""Good Morning America.""

"(CNN) -- Internet attacks shut down the social networking site Twitter for about two hours on Thursday morning and caused glitches in other sites like Facebook and LiveJournal, a blogging site. Some Twitter users expressed near-panic that the site was not working properly Thursday. It's unclear if the attacks were coordinated against the social media sites. Twitter says its site's blackout was caused by a ""denial of service attack,"" which likely means a hacker used a herd of infected computers to send bad information to the site to overwhelmed it. A post to Twitter's blog said its Web site was back online before noon ET, but the site's users still were reporting problems. ""We are continuing to defend against and recover from this attack,"" the message from the company says. Facebook and other social networking sites appeared to be affected by Twitter's shut-down, too. Twitter runs applications through those sites and there was speculation that the glitches were related. ""Earlier this morning, we encountered issues within our network that resulted in a short period of degraded site experience for some visitors,"" said Facebook spokeswoman Kathleen Loughlin. ""No user data was at risk, and the matter is now resolved for the majority of users. We're monitoring the situation to ensure that users continue to have the fast and reliable experience they've come to expect from Facebook,"" she said. Twitter's site went down around 9:30 a.m. ET on Thursday and was back online by about 11:30 a.m. It's unclear who plotted the attack against Twitter and what their motives may have been. Internet attacks sometimes hit Web sites as they become popular. Security experts say financial motives often are behind modern cyber-attacks. Watch Mashable's Adam Ostrow on the Twitter outage . Twitter -- a micro-blogging site where users post 140-character messages to their followers -- has soared in popularity in recent months. According to comScore, a Web tracking firm, the site had 44 million unique visitors in June. Thursday's incident highlights the degree to which people depend on online social networks to feel connected to the world. Some Twitter and Facebook users expressed near-panic that the sites were not working properly. Others reacted with ambivalence. This is not the first time Twitter has been hit with a cyber-attack. Last month, a hacker broke into the personal Google accounts of Twitter employees, stealing personal information and company financial reports and posting them online. In an e-mail to CNN.com, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone said that incident is not related to Thursday's security breach. ""There's no indication that this attack is related to any previous activities. We are currently the target of a denial of service attack,"" Stone said in the e-mail. ""Attacks such as this are malicious efforts orchestrated to disrupt and make unavailable services such as online banks, credit card payment gateways, and in this case, Twitter for intended customers or users. We are defending against this attack now and will continue to update our status blog as we defend and later investigate."" Don DeBolt, director of threat research at CA, a computer security company, said it's too early to tell who or what may be behind the Twitter attack. But he said denial-of-service attacks target specific Web sites. ""To be effective, [these attacks] need to be focused on a Web site or a series of Web sites,"" he said. ""It's not going to be something where malware (harmful software) is going to be deployed and then randomly attacks Web sites."" John Harrison, a researcher with Web security firm Symantec, said it is very difficult to learn the identity of the attacker, or attackers, as they could be anywhere on Earth and the infected network could span several countries. Logging on to sites such as Twitter while they are under attack only makes the situation worse because it adds to the overloading of the system, he said. The U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team says it's impossible for Web developers to fully prevent such attacks. But everyday computer users can ensure that their machines aren't used in a coordinated attack like the one seen Thursday. To protect their computers, consumers should update anti-virus software, create passwords that are difficult to crack and maintain computer firewalls, the agency says.","Twitter, Facebook, LiveJournal hit Thursday morning with denial-of-service attacks .

"Washington (CNN) -- Despite the bruising battle over their proposals to overhaul health care, congressional Democrats have maintained an advantage over their Republican counterparts on one key measure, according to a new national poll. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday indicates that a bare majority of Americans, 51 percent, believe that the Democrats' policies are good for the country, with 46 percent saying that those policies would take the U.S. in the wrong direction. Fifty-three percent of people questioned in the poll said the GOP's polices would move the nation in the wrong direction, with 42 percent saying Republican policies are good for the country. ""The numbers for both parties are virtually unchanged since late August, just before President Barack Obama's health care speech to Congress opened the latest round of debate on this divisive issue,"" said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director. Democrats will be defending their large majorities in Congress next year when all 435 House seats and more than a third of the Senate seats are up for grabs. ""This advantage on policy could be an important edge for the Democrats heading into the 2010 midterm elections,"" Holland added. ""But independents will be the key to the midterms, and the numbers among independents spell bad news for both parties among that important group."" In an August survey, independent voters' views of GOP policies were evenly divided. But a majority of independents now say Republicans would move the country in the wrong direction. Nonetheless, the number of independents who dislike Democratic policies, now at 57 percent, is higher than the 52 percent who hold a negative view of Republican policies. The survey suggests that Sen. Joe Lieberman is taking a hit in popularity due to his opposition to a major element in the health care bill. The Connecticut independent, who caucuses with the Democrats to give the party a 60-vote filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, threatened to undermine the bill unless compromises were made. Lieberman opposed the creation of a government-run public insurance option and the expansion of Medicare to individuals as young as 55. Both of those proposals were dropped from the bill this month, enraging many liberals. According to the poll, Lieberman's favorable rating has dropped 9 percentage points, from 40 percent to 31 percent, from early December. His unfavorable rating has risen 6 percentage points, from 28 percent to 34 percent. ""Lieberman's biggest decline -- a 14-point drop -- came among independents,"" Holland said. ""Only Republicans continue to like Lieberman."" The survey also indicates that just one in five Americans trust the federal government always or most of the time, down 4 percentage points from a year ago. The CNN/Opinion Research poll was conducted December 16 through Sunday, with 1,160 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. CNN deputy political director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Poll: Fifty-one percent believe Democratic policies are good for the country .

"New York (CNN)  -- In the schoolyard of American politics, President Obama is the big, smart kid with all of the test answers who's being bullied by a bunch of Neanderthal ankle-biters from all sides. Meanwhile, all the teachers are wondering, ""Why does he take this crap? He's bigger and smarter than all the other kids."" It's no surprise the Glenn Becks of the world have been attacking Obama since the moment he stepped into the Oval Office. Beck and his blathering buddies on the right -- you know, the stinky kids in the coatroom who eat their own boogers. Always pick on the kids least likely to fight back. That being said -- we did elect President Obama to change things, and so far the only thing he seems to be changing are his faux-patriotic lapel pins ... and his mind. With the public option in the public toilet, not asking or telling about ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the Gitmo Hilton still entertaining guests, and same-sex marriage so far off Obama's radar that it's now on his sonar, seeds of doubt have been planted in the left's collective mind. If this guy can't get his own party to step in line on health care reform, they wonder, then how the hell will he get other countries to do what he wants them to do? Although in some ways, that might be easier then dealing with these Blue Dogs who hump your leg ... and not in a good way. It's a valid concern. However, we can't expect him to accomplish all this sweeping change in less than a year. It's important that he lay the groundwork instead of just going all ""Decider"" on everyone and making gut choices. But he can't just be ""The Thinker,"" either. Last time I looked, ""The Thinker,"" by Rodin, had been sitting on his butt in the exact same place, for years. Unfortunately, laying groundwork doesn't win you any fans -- well, besides a few Nordic voters on the Nobel panel. Flexing muscles, now that wins you fans. Just ask the Governator. That's why the Financial Times said it's time for President Obama to pick a fight and win it in a knockout. But instead of working on that knockout, President Obama and his White House cronies are feuding with Fox News. While I'm loving this Fox hunt, the White House's strategy boggles my mind. This is not a war of necessity. Picking a fight with them is kinda like going to a biker bar after midnight -- as my mother used to say, ""Nothing good can happen."" That is, unless this heavyweight bout keeps escalating and we actually get to see Glenn Beck prancing around in a pair of sequined boxing shorts. When you disregard the action against Fox News, Obama seems to be paralyzed, like a frog that's had it stomach rubbed -- which may the reason he's got problems on both sides of the lily pad. Admittedly, I might be overreacting just a bit. The majority of the country is behind Obama. The situation just seems worse than it is because we're not used to this new era, in which you can actually criticize the president without being shouted down as an unpatriotic, Socialist, traitorous, granny-killing, freedom hater. After eight years of a presidency shrouded in darkness, we're not used to seeing the president's supporters, of all people, shining a light on his shortcomings. Back to the schoolyard, where Barry Obama is being bullied. You know what? He's big, he can take it. You know why? Because not only is he right in his beliefs, but he knows that if push comes to shove, he can lay out the rest of these runts with a couple of good smacks of his presidential pen. It's not time to panic, but President Obama needs to size up one of these twerps, cock back his arm, and take a swing soon, because the Democratic majorities in Congress won't last forever. President Obama won 53 percent of the vote last November, so we know he has it in him to win the big battles. We know he has a lot on his plate. But we just want one decisive victory. That's all we're asking for. A show of strength. Something to grow on. Show these class clowns who they're messing with. You don't have to be ""The Decider."" Just the president.

"Washington (CNN) -- Flights transporting critically injured Haitians to the United States are set to resume Monday morning, according to a spokeswoman for a University of Miami team of volunteers in Port-au-Prince. The flights are scheduled to resume at 11 a.m. Monday, said Nery Ynclan, a spokeswoman for the university's R. Barth Green, who is leading the team. The flights were temporarily suspended because of logistical issues including space to care for the injured, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Saturday. ""Having received assurances that additional capacity exists both here and among our international partners, we determined that we can resume these critical flights,"" he said in a statement Sunday. The statement, released Sunday afternoon, said flights would resume ""in the next 12 hours."" The evacuated patients are those whose medical needs could not be met by doctors working in Haiti. Nearly 23,000 people have been seen by U.S. personnel since the January 12 earthquake, Vietor said. The missing, the found, the victims . Airlifts stopped after there were ""concerns about the strain on domestic health capacity,"" Vietor said. But officials have increased the ability to care for patients through a network of nonprofits and U.S. hospitals, he said. Earlier reports also cited questions over who would pay for patients' care. The flights stopped Wednesday when some states refused to allow entry to Haitians needing care, according to Navy Capt. Kevin Aandahl, a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Command. He would not say which states objected. In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius obtained by CNN, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist asked that the federal government activate the National Disaster Medical System to provide reimbursement to Florida and other states for taking in the patients, who have no insurance.

"(CNN) -- The Archdiocese of Dublin and other Catholic Church authorities in Ireland covered up clerical child abuse until the mid-1990s, according to a government-commissioned report released Thursday. The Dublin Archdiocese Commission of Investigation's 720-page report said that it has ""no doubt that clerical child sexual abuse was covered up"" from January 1975 to May 2004, the time covered by the report. ""The Dublin Archdiocese's pre-occupations in dealing with cases of child sexual abuse, at least until the mid 1990s, were the maintenance of secrecy, the avoidance of scandal, the protection of the reputation of the Church, and the preservation of its assets,"" the report said. ""The welfare of children, which should have been the first priority, was not even a factor to be considered in the early stages,"" it said. ""Instead the focus was on the avoidance of scandal and the preservation of the good name, status and assets of the institution and of what the institution regarded as its most important members -- the priests."" Archbishop Diarmuid Martin apologized Thursday in a news conference. ""No words of apology can ever be sufficient,"" he said. And Dermot Ahern, Ireland's justice minister, said he felt a ""a growing sense of revulsion and anger"" as he read the report. ""Bottom line is this: A collar will protect no villain,"" he said. The commission was set up in March 2006 to look into allegations of child sexual abuse made against clergy in the Irish capital. Its report was completed in July. Although the commission said it was not its place to ""establish whether or not abuse occurred ... it is abundantly clear ... that child sexual abuse by clerics was widespread throughout the period."" One victim, Marie Collins, said those who covered up the abuse were just as guilty as the perpetrators of the crimes. ""How many people accused of abuse are still sitting in parishes today?"" she asked in a Thursday news conference. The commission examined the histories of 46 priests, who were picked as a sample from 102 who had had complaints or suspicions of child abuse raised against them. Complaints from more than 320 children were leveled against the 46, the report said. But it said that the number of children abused likely exceeded that. ""One priest admitted to sexually abusing over 100 children, while another accepted that he had abused on a fortnightly basis during the currency of his ministry which lasted for over 25 years,"" the report said. ""The total number of documented complaints recorded against those two priests is only just over 70."" In its analysis of the 46 priests, the commission said that all four archbishops -- Archbishops John Charles McQuaid, Dermot Ryan, Kevin McNamara, and Desmond Connell -- who served during the time period covered by the report handled the child sexual abuse complaints ""badly."" ""Not one of them reported his knowledge of child sexual abuse to the Gardai (the Irish police force) throughout the 1960s, 1970s, or 1980s,"" the report said. The commission did credit Connell, who took over the archdiocese in 1988, with giving Irish authorities in 1995 the names of 17 priests against whom complaints had been made -- although it called the number incomplete, saying that there was ""knowledge within the Archdiocese of at least 28 priests against whom there had been complaints."" They said he was ""slow to recognize the seriousness of the situation."" Connell also gave authorities permission to access the archdiocesan files in 2002. Connell, a cardinal, apologized in a written statement. ""I wish to express without reservation my bitter regret that failures on my part contributed to the suffering of victims in any form,"" he said. ""Although I am all too aware that such apologies and expressions of regret can never be adequate as a response to so much hurt and violation and, in any case, lose their value through repetition, I apologize again now from my heart and ask the forgiveness of those who have been so shamefully harmed."" The report named 11 priests who had pleaded guilty to or were convicted of sexual assaults on children. Of the other 35, it gave pseudonyms to 33 of them and redacted the names of two. The report shot down the notion that church leadership was unaware of the problem. ""The Archdiocese of Dublin and other Church authorities have repeatedly claimed to have been, prior to the late 1990s, 'on a learning curve' in relation to the matter,"" it said. However, it said McNamara, Ryan and McQuaid had information on complaints against at least 17 priests when the Archdiocese took out insurance in 1987 to cover future compensation claims and lawsuits related to sexual abuse allegations. ""The taking out of insurance was an act proving knowledge of child sexual abuse as a potential major cost to the Archdiocese and is inconsistent with the view that Archdiocesan officials were still 'on a learning curve' at a much later date, or were lacking in an appreciation of the phenomenon of clerical child sex abuse,"" it said. The report also said church officials perpetuated the problem by ignoring allegations and in some cases simply moved an alleged abuser on to another parish -- leaving him free to abuse another group of children. Thursday's findings follow a report that came out in May, detailing allegations of child abuse in various institutions across Ireland from the 1940s to the present. Though both reports deal with child abuse, they are not related, having been written by two separate commissions investigating two different subjects. The May report looked at child abuse in lay institutions, including reformatories, hospitals, orphanages, children's homes and industrial schools across the country. Some of those institutions were linked to religious orders, but none were strictly religious schools. Speaking last month after the Irish High Court cleared the way for Thursday's report to be made public, Irish Justice Minister Dermot Ahern said he was pleased the information would not be kept private. ""I have always made it clear that I have been anxious to put the report into the public domain as quickly as possible, while at the same time not wishing to do anything which would prejudice the chances of any of the people involved in these evil deeds being brought to justice,"" Ahern said in a statement. CNN's Atika Shubert contributed to this report.","New report examines abuse abuse between January 1975 and May 2004 .

"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- Hong Kong police said they had arrested two men in connection with an acid attack that injured six people last month. The pair -- ages 18 and 23 -- were taken into custody on Wednesday for questioning in the attack, which involved corrosive fluid being thrown from a building in the Causeway Bay shopping area. A man and five women were injured in the attack, according to police. By Thursday, the younger man was released on bail, while the other was still detained, said Michael Kwan, information officer for the Hong Kong police. Authorities did not say whether the two were being investigated in other similar attacks in Hong Kong, and it was not clear whether the attacks involved a group, individuals or copycats. Police are offering rewards totaling HKD $1.7 million ($219,000) for information leading to arrests in recent acid attacks in five areas of Hong Kong, including the shopping district of Mong Kok. Hong Kong Security Secretary Ambrose Lee on Wednesday said that if an object is dropped from a building and injures someone in public, the culprit could face six months in jail and a HK $10,000 ($1,300) fine. The throwing of corrosive fluid or manslaughter could result in life imprisonment, he added.","Two men arrested in connection with Hong Kong acid attack last month .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A blast hit near a building housing Pakistan's intelligence service, ISI, in the eastern city of Multan on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and wounding 20 others, police said. The explosion took place at a security checkpoint, said Jamshed Akram of the city police. Four soldiers and four children were among the dead, said Dr. Kaleem Ullah of Multan's emergency services. Pakistan has blamed the violence on Islamic militants who have vowed to avenge a intense military offensive to rout them from their haven along the country's border with Afghanistan. The nation has come under increasingly frequent attacks. On Monday, a blast at a crowded market in Lahore killed 54 and wounded more than 150 people. The same day two other bombing attacks -- in Peshawar and Quetta -- killed at least 11 and wounded at least 41. The attacks came three days after militants armed with guns and grenades stormed a mosque in Rawalpindi frequented by military personnel. At least 36 were killed and 75 wounded. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the mosque bombing, but there were no immediately claims for Monday's attacks. In an e-mail to CNN about the mosque attack, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan said: ""We reconfirmed it, that the TTP has done it, and will do more which are already planned. We once again mention that we are not against the innocent people and the state of Pakistan but against those officers and ministers who are American by hearts and minds and Pakistani just by faces."" The United States has pressed Pakistan to rout out Taliban militants. Fighting the war in Afghanistan is ""inextricably linked to our partnership with Pakistan,"" President Barack Obama said Tuesday of U.S. strategy. ""We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country,"" he said in a speech at West Point. ""But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border."" The United States says Pakistan looms large because Taliban and al Qaeda militants operating in Afghanistan also have had a presence in Pakistan's northwestern region near the Afghan border and have threatened the governments and troops in both countries.","NEW: Four soldiers, four children among the dead, a doctor says .

"Colorado Springs, Colorado (CNN) -- If you come to a neighborhood park in Colorado Springs, plan on bringing your own trash bags. To save money, the city has removed the trash cans. Need to catch a bus? Don't try on evenings or weekends. The city has cut that service, too. And when the sun goes down, Colorado Springs is going to look a little bit dimmer. Crews are removing a third of the city's streetlight to save money on electricity and light bulbs. Watch city's PSA on streetlight deactivation . It's this conservative city's way of closing a $28.5 million budget gap. ""You can cry about the fiscal situation ... or you can take it as an opportunity to change, reinvent yourself and innovate and that's what were going to do in Colorado Springs,"" City Councilman Sean Paige said. Other governments are considering higher taxes to avoid such cutbacks, but in the state of Colorado, there is a taxpayers' bill of rights. It prevents state and city governments from raising taxes unless such a measure is approved by the voters. ""We put it on the ballot last fall, and they said 'no,' "" said Paige, a Republican. ""They declined to write the city a blank check, and they said, 'City, tighten your belts. We're tightening ours. You need to do the same.' ""We're going to respect that,"" he added. ""I'm not going to cry about that."" It's not a new concept in Colorado Springs, touted on some Web sites as a ""libertarian paradise."" The city's garbage collection, zoo and philharmonic are all privately funded. The city is even auctioning off its police helicopters on the Internet. Want to place a bid? The latest budget cuts could be felt at community centers like Meadows Park, which is bustling with after-school programs for kids, as well as exercise classes and hot meals for seniors. Unless the center can find private funding, Colorado Springs is slated to shut it down at the end of March. ""I'm hoping that some sort of a miracle will happen so we can keep the centers open,"" said Sheryle Nix, 56. Every day, Nix eats a $2 lunch at the center because she can't afford to eat in a restaurant and has trouble preparing her own food. ""I have a traumatic brain injury, so this really helps keep me on schedule to eat lunch,"" she explained. Jeanie Schweitzer, 55, returned to Colorado Springs to take care of her grandmother Elsie, who suffered a stroke. She brings Elsie to the center to get her out of the house. ""I don't think they should be shutting it down. There should be enough money,"" Schweizer said. ""It's not that much in the big picture to keep it open."" The center is a lifeline for parents who work and cannot pick their kids up after school ends in the afternoon. Lindon Jackson, who is 13, has been coming to the Meadows Park after-school program since she was 3. When asked what she'll do if the center shuts down, she said, ""Nothing."" ""I'd just be home doing nothing."" Whether the government should continue funding Meadows Park and other community centers like it strikes at the heart of the political argument over the role of government, particularly during an economic downturn. ""The model of governments, from the federal government down to municipal governments, don't work anymore,"" according to Chuck Fowler, chairman of City Committee, an alliance of local businesspeople set up by Paige. ""They don't take in as much money. They can't possibly provide the same amount of services, pay their employees, pay their pensions. Something's got to give."" Fowler believes that the solution may be in weaning people off of government services. ""The larger the government is, the more conditioning with certain people that they don't need to take personal responsibility of their life,"" he said. The budget cuts, according to Fowler, ""could really recondition people's ideas about what government should be doing."" ""Should it be doing all of these things, or should it really be focused on the vital things that clearly have a public interest?"" But Brian Kates, who runs Meadows Park Community Center, says the people affected by the government cutbacks ""are pawns in the game."" ""These aren't people trying to be lazy and live off the system,"" Kates said. ""These are hard-working, intelligent and bright [people], and they're not asking for much. We're giving them just the very basics.""","Colorado Springs faces nearly $30 million budget hole .

"Washington (CNN) -- The push to overhaul health care received a major boost Thursday as the American Medical Association and AARP endorsed legislation drafted by top House Democrats. The AARP, the nation's largest organization of older Americans, is a nonpartisan group that advocates for people 50 and older. The AMA, historically an opponent of health care reform, is considered one the nation's most influential doctors' advocacy groups. ""I want to thank both organizations again for their support, and I urge Congress to listen to AARP, listen to the AMA and pass this reform for hundreds of millions of Americans who will benefit from it,"" President Obama said at the White House. The backing of those two groups comes as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, oversees final changes to the $1.1 trillion health care bill. The measure likely will come to a final vote Saturday. Read the House health care bill (PDF) A 42-page manager's amendment on the health care legislation posted Tuesday night made mostly technical changes in the nearly 2,000-page bill compiled from three Democratic proposals passed by three House committees. By making the changes public Tuesday, House Democratic leaders could open floor debate on the bill Friday, while fulfilling their pledge to allow 72 hours of review before bringing the measure to the full chamber. Pelosi insisted Thursday she will have the 218 votes necessary to pass the bill. Meanwhile, President Obama is set to huddle Saturday with congressional Democrats on Capitol Hill to review the legislation. Check out the key parts of the bill . In a statement, AARP CEO Barry Rand said, ""We started this debate more than two years ago with the twin goals of making coverage affordable to our younger members and protecting Medicare for seniors. ""We can say with confidence that [the House bill] meets those goals with improved benefits for people in Medicare and needed health insurance market reforms to help ensure every American can purchase affordable health coverage."" The AMA's president, Dr. J. James Rohack, told reporters Thursday that the legislation is ""not a perfect representation of our views"" but is close enough to warrant his group's support and keep the reform process moving forward. Rohack said the bill needs to be accompanied by legislation reversing scheduled Medicare reimbursement payment reductions to physicians. Responding to the AMA endorsement, Obama said the doctors' group is ""supporting reform because [its members have] seen firsthand what's broken about our health care system,"" Obama said. ""They would not be supporting it if they really believed that it would lead to government bureaucrats making decisions that are best left to doctors."" Watch Obama say health care reform is moving forward . Meanwhile, House Republicans on Thursday continued to signal their opposition to the measure. GOP leaders held a rally on Capitol Hill along with ""Tea Party"" movement protesters and other activists to warn that the House legislation would translate into a full-blown government takeover of the health care system. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Thursday that Democrats had forgotten the lessons of August's town hall meetings when angry conservatives criticized health care legislation. ""I think what we're going to see is the town hall coming to Washington, D.C., just to remind members of Congress [that] we're the ones we would like you to pay attention to, not lobbyists. And we don't want the government to own our health care,"" Bachmann said. Speaking at Thursday's opposition rally, actor John Ratzenberger, who played Cliff on the sitcom ""Cheers,"" slammed the Democratic bill as a form of socialism. ""These are Woodstock Democrats,"" Ratzenberger said. ""We have to remember where their philosophy comes. It doesn't come from America. It comes from overseas. It comes from socialism. And socialism is a philosophy of failure."" House Democrats have rejected an alternative $60 billion Republican plan as inadequate for meeting the goals of expanding health coverage to most of the nation's 46 million uninsured while bringing down costs and ending controversial industry practices such as denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Pelosi's bill would extend insurance coverage to 36 million uncovered Americans and guarantee that 96 percent of Americans have coverage, according to the Democratic leadership. The claim is based on an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Among other things, the bill would subsidize insurance for poorer Americans and create health insurance exchanges to make it easier for small groups and individuals to purchase coverage. It also would cap annual out-of-pocket expenses and prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Pelosi's office has said the bill would cut the federal deficit by roughly $30 billion over the next decade. The measure is financed through a combination of a tax surcharge on wealthy Americans and spending constraints in Medicare and Medicaid. Specifically, individuals with annual incomes more than $500,000 -- as well as families earning more than $1 million -- would face a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge. Growth in Medicare expenditures would be cut by 1.3 percent annually. The House bill also includes a government-run public option. Under the House plan, health care providers would be allowed to negotiate reimbursement rates with the federal government. Pelosi and other liberal Democrats had argued for a more ""robust"" public option that would tie reimbursement rates for providers and hospitals to Medicare rates plus a 5 percent increase. Several Democrats representing rural areas, however, killed the proposal after complaining that doctors and hospitals in their districts would be shortchanged under such a formula. One thorny issue yet to be resolved among House Democrats is the bill's final language on abortion. Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, has been pushing leaders to add stronger language prohibiting the use of federal money to pay for abortions under the health care overhaul. Stupak has vowed that if he isn't allowed a vote on the issue, a group of 40 anti-abortion Democrats will work to block the bill from getting to the House floor. The House bill differs from legislation the Senate is considering in a number of critical ways. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, also favors a public option but would allow individual states to opt out of the plan. An $829 billion bill recently passed by the Senate Finance Committee does not include a tax surcharge on the wealthy but would impose a new tax on high-end health care policies, which critics have dubbed ""Cadillac"" plans. A large number of House Democrats are opposed to taxing those policies, arguing that such a move would hurt union members who traded higher salaries for more generous benefits. Individuals under the $829 billion Finance Committee plan would be required to purchase health insurance coverage or face a fine of up to $750. The House bill imposes a more stringent fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual's income. Both versions include a hardship exemption for poorer Americans. The Finance Committee bill would require large companies to contribute to the health care costs of lower income workers if those workers received a government subsidy for insurance. The House legislation would require larger companies to provide employee insurance for everyone or pay a penalty of up to 8 percent of total revenue. Democratic leaders in both chambers agree on establishing nonprofit health care cooperatives and stripping insurance companies of an anti-trust exemption that has been in place since the end of World War II. Reid refused earlier this week to predict when the chamber would pass a health care bill, possibly signaling difficulty in generating support from his entire Democratic caucus.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Bernice King, the youngest child of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., has been elected president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a spokeswoman for the group said Friday. King, 46, was elected as the SCLC's first female president, said Renee Richardson. King's father was SCLC's first president.  The organization was founded in 1957. The other finalist for the post was former Arkansas Court of Appeals Judge Wendell Griffen, 57, who lost his recent bid for re-election. Griffen, of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, is also pastor of New Millennium Church in Little Rock. King is a minister at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Lithonia, Georgia. She also is a motivational speaker and author. ""It is a destiny call,"" she told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week. ""It is part of my father and mother's legacy and a continuation of the legacy he started in the '50s and '60s through this organization. I believe that the hand of God is leading me."" Her brother, Martin Luther King III, was president of SCLC from 1997 to 2004. They and sibling Dexter King were locked in a bitter legal battle over their parents' estates until late September, when a judge ordered them to begin negotiations. The three were able to reach a settlement. King succeeds the Rev. Byron Clay, who has been interim president since the Rev. Charles Steele Jr. resigned earlier this year. The Rev. Joseph E. Lowery led the group from 1977 until 1997. The Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy was president from 1968 to 1977. Ralph Luker, a retired history professor at Morehouse College and co-editor of the first two volumes of ""The Papers of Martin Luther King,"" says SCLC's challenge going forward is giving the organization a sense of mission. ""There's been ... no real vision, and that's a dramatic change from its early years,"" he said. ""For too long it's been a program here, had a cause there, but the group's rationale for being hasn't been clear.""

"(CNN) -- The two people who died Thursday night when their helicopter crashed into a mountain in the Dominican Republic were friends who had left their homes and family in Florida this week to help deliver aid to the people of Haiti, a son of one of the victims said Friday. The accident occurred about 7 p.m. in Dajabon, just east of the border with Haiti, said Rosani Zapata, a spokeswoman for the Dominican Civil Aviation Institute. The helicopter had filed a flight plan from Santiago to Jimani in the Dominican Republic, then on to Port-au-Prince in Haiti. It was en route back to Santiago when the crash occurred, she said. Aboard were pilot John Ward of Fort Myers, Florida, and James Jalovec, a 53-year-old Naples, Florida, businessman who owned Sweetwater Environmental Inc., a sewage company based in Sebring. Mark Jalovec, 21, told CNN in a telephone interview that his father began discussing the prospect of helping out a couple of days after the January 12 earthquake that devastated Haiti. ""It kind of caught everybody off guard,"" he said, noting that his father had never done anything similar. Still, he said, his father saw a fit. ""I got a helicopter; these people are in desperate need -- he kind of decided it with Mr. Ward that they were going to do it, and that's what they did."" He said his father last called him Monday, after he and Ward had flown doctors from an orphanage outside Port-au-Prince to the Dominican Republic. Spencer Steadman, vice president and general manager of Sweetwater Environmental, described Ward as an experienced pilot who had long flown Jalovec to his business interests, which spanned the state. ""They had an engine failure on one here about three months ago,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""He done a reverse autorotation and set that thing down. No injuries. Four people, they walked away. He was a very good pilot."" The helicopter that crashed Thursday, a Robinson R44, was two weeks old, he said. Steadman said he was not surprised when Jalovec called him Saturday night and said he was planning to depart Sunday morning for a week in the region. ""He seen a need, and it was a challenge, and that's Jim,"" Steadman said. ""He was hard-core business. When he done business, he done business. That's what he liked doing. He was very aggressive. ... If it was worth doing, he'd do it.""

"(CNN) -- Joann Killeen is president of the Killeen Furtney Group, the Los Angeles, California-based public relations firm that represented octuplet mom Nadya Suleman. Nadya Suleman had her octuplets through fertility treatments. Suleman, who underwent fertility treatment, gave birth to six boys and two girls January 26 in Bellflower, California. She already had six children at home. The Killeen Furtney Group recently stopped representing Suleman because of death threats that came in to the firm's office, Killeen said Monday on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" Following is an edited transcript of Killeen's conversation with King: . Larry King: When you did this show February 3, you were representing her. Now you're not. Why not? Joann Killeen: Well, Larry, the number of death threats that came into our office, both by e-mail and voice mail, we had to make a decision about what was in the best interests of our own personal safety and that of our firm. So we met with the police department on Friday. We filed a criminal report. We provided them with all the information with all the threats. And they told us that we should take this very seriously.  Watch Killeen describe receiving threats » . King: Why you and not her? Killeen: Well, they've also threatened her. But the majority of the threats are coming to our office. I mean, Nadya doesn't have an e-mail account. She doesn't have a computer. So there's no way to reach her. So the closest thing they can do is come after me. And they have -- and just in painful, painful ways. King: How would do you characterize the nature of the threats? Killeen: Well, they've said to me that I should be put down like an old dog, I should be paralyzed, my client's uterus should be ripped out, she should be put on an island. I mean, Larry, I don't know what's happened with America, but they are really, really angry and letting me know what they think about this issue. King: Do you take special security precautions? Killeen: Yes, I do. Yes, I do. We have extra patrols on our street. ... We're very conscious. The police department has been absolutely wonderful to work with. They've given me a special number to call if anybody stakes out my house, as they have before. I've been followed by paparazzi. I'm not a celebrity, so it's a different position for me to be in. King: How did you inform Nadya that you were no longer. ... Killeen: Well, we talked on Friday. And she's had death threats, and I've had death threats. And she's very upset that someone would come after us and come after her. I mean she says: ""I'm just a mom. I don't know why everybody is so upset. I'm just a mom trying to do the best job that I possibly can.""  Watch Killeen explain that no money has been made off the publicity » . King: Why do you think people are so angry -- crazy enough, angry to threaten killing? Killeen: Well, I think they are frustrated by a lot of things. When the news came out that Nadya was receiving some state disability from an injury and that she was trying to rehab and find a new career and go to school and she also had children at the same time, I think the taxpayers just absolutely flipped out and said, you know, we're paying for this and we're not getting our own fair share of government services. We pay a lot of taxes, the economy is bad, there's no jobs. They're angry. King: If you're getting threats, what do you imagine she's getting? Killeen: Well, and I've seen them, because, again, there's no e- mail account. So they're sending them to me. ... People will call my office and just say profanity on the phone. And with caller ID, I know exactly who they are. Others have sent handwritten notes to me with horrible words that I never would repeat on the air, Larry. And they even put their return address on them so -- as if I'm going to return that call. King: What about the stories that she's obsessed with Angelina Jolie -- even had work done on her face to look like her more? Killeen: You know, I asked her about that. And she just laughed. She said remember, with the octuplets, I put on 100 pounds -- a hundred pounds of extra body weight for my babies. So of course things are going to look a little different than they did when I first started. King: She does look like her. Killeen: Well, I think hair and makeup, you could probably look like anybody you'd want to look like. She has said to me she has not had plastic surgery of any kind. And so I have to believe what my client tells me to be factually correct. King: So the only reason you're out of this is threats on you and the firm, not because of any qualms with her? Killeen: Oh, no. Not at all. Larry, I just can't run my business and continue to do the things that I need to do for my clients with constant death threats and phone calls and interruptions. You know, I took on this account because I'm a mom and a grandma, and I wanted to help someone who needs help with the media. I did this pro bono. I've made no money. I have no intention of getting any money. And I think people need to realize I just did this out of the goodness of my heart to help a woman who didn't know how to work with the media. King: Does she keep in touch with the father? Killeen: The sperm donor? King: Yes. Killeen: They have a very limited relationship. He's not active in their life at all. King: Why are we mad at her? Killeen: That's a good question to ask America. If you look at the e-mails that are coming into my office, they're saying they think that she's worked the system. They think that she's been able to stay home and live off of the taxpayers and have these multiple children. She's not organized. She doesn't have any kind of structure, you know; isn't six children enough? She intentionally went out to get eight children. And, you know, remember, Larry, she worked with the same doctor for every [in vitro fertilization] attempt. Based on her history of six embryos implanted, she got one child. The doctor told her the most this last attempt would be would be either one baby or twins, at the most. So she was shocked, he was shocked. Nobody expected eight children. That's the big -- big misnomer here. Everybody thinks she went and ordered eight and she got eight. She didn't. King: Where does she go from here? Killeen: Well, I'm confident, as we continue to talk, that there are resources that are available to her, and she will collaborate with, you know, church leaders in her area. And hopefully the American public can get beyond their anger about her choices and her decisions and think about those eight little kids, Larry. You know, it's all about those kids. That's the whole reason why I took on this account, was to help the mom with those eight little kids.","President of PR agency says people have made death threats by phone, e-mail .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani soldiers and militants battled Saturday in the country's vast tribal region, with more than a dozen insurgents killed in airstrikes, at least four soldiers slain in skirmishes and a key village seized by troops, the military said. A Pakistani soldier pictured during operations against militants in June. The fatalities come hours after Pakistani troops launched a massive ground offensive backed up by air power targeting the Taliban in South Waziristan, a refuge and a power base for insurgents operating in Pakistan and along the Pakistani-Afghan border. The highly anticipated offensive, which comes after a wave of suicide attacks in Pakistan, also has prompted the exodus of tens of thousands of civilians, the U.N. refugee agency said. One military official said Pakistani troops seized control of Kotkai, where Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud has lived with fellow commander Qari Hussein, the mastermind behind some of Pakistan's deadliest suicide attacks.  Watch how the offensive began » . Another military official said the airstrikes from jet fighters and helicopter gunships targeted militant hideouts in Kotkai and the villages of Badar, Barwand and Khisur, all strongholds of the Taliban and their late leader Baitullah Mehsud. The official asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media. There have been confrontations throughout the day between soldiers and militants. Along with the four slain soldiers, 12 have been wounded, the military said. Gen. Athar Abbas, the Pakistan military spokesman, said the ground offensive in South Waziristan was launched shortly after midnight after the military received clearance from the government. He said the region's eight entry and exit points have been sealed by troops. Pakistani officials say that about 10,000 to 15,000 militants linked to the Taliban or to al Qaeda operate in South Waziristan, a harsh terrain familiar to militants but difficult for others to navigate. About 28,000 Pakistani soldiers have moved into the epicenter of Taliban activity in the region to counter their activities, officials said. Elsewhere in Pakistan's tribal region, in the Mohmand Agency, at least eight militants and one soldier were killed Saturday when they exchanged gunfire near a military checkpoint, the military said. For months, the military had been targeting militant hideouts in South Waziristan and other hot spots in Pakistan's tribal areas. This year, troops launched a large operation targeting militants in the Swat Valley, in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province. But despite these efforts, insurgents have continued to strike with relative impunity inside Pakistan, brazenly targeting government, police and security locations. The latest attack occurred Friday in the northern city of Peshawar, when a suicide car bomber detonated near a police station, killing 13 people, most of them civilians. The recent wave of deadly attacks has raised concerns about the ability of Pakistan's security forces to maintain control. The attacks heightened internal and international pressure on the government to take swift and effective action. In a high-level meeting Friday, army chief Gen. Ashfaq Kayani ""gave a detailed briefing on the prevailing national security situation and its ramifications in the future,"" according to a statement from the prime minister's office. Those who attended the meeting condemned the recent attacks and ""agreed that these elements pose a serious threat to the sovereignty and integrity of the state,"" the statement said. The attacks show ""once again that the militants in Pakistan threaten both Pakistan and the United States,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton said. On Thursday, President Obama approved an additional $7.5 billion in assistance to Pakistan over the next five years.","NEW: Official says troops take village of Kotkai .

"(CNN)  -- Tiger Woods apologized on Wednesday for ""transgressions"" that ""let his family down."" ""I have let my family down and I regret those transgressions with all of my heart. I have not been true to my values and the behavior my family deserves,"" he said in a statement on his official Web site. ""I am not without faults and I am far short of perfect. I am dealing with my behavior and personal failings behind closed doors with my family. Those feelings should be shared by us alone."" Woods made the comments in a statement posted on his Web site the same day that a gossip magazine published a story alleging that Woods had an affair with a 24-year-old New York cocktail waitress. The nightclub hostess, identified by a supermarket tabloid as Tiger Woods' mistress had called allegations that she is romantically involved with the golf superstar false and ""ridiculous."" In an interview published Tuesday, Rachel Uchitel told The New York Post that a disgruntled acquaintance sold the story to the National Enquirer and that ""not a word of it is true."" ""I work in clubs, and I am a businesswoman,"" Uchitel said. ""I do not have sex with celebrities, and I have not had an affair with Tiger Woods."" Speculation has swirled around Woods since a wreck outside his Florida home early Friday left him with minor injuries and a citation for careless driving. The Florida Highway Patrol said Tuesday that its citation closes its investigation of the crash. Woods was not required to talk to state police about the wreck and did not sit for an interview with investigators. He issued a statement Sunday saying he alone was responsible for the crash and denouncing ""the many false, unfounded and malicious rumors that are currently circulating about my family and me."" Opinion: Woods is only human . The 33-year-old golf phenomenon has won the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament each four times, as well as three U.S. Open titles. Investigators have said they don't have details on why Woods was driving away from his home at such an early hour. A police report says the wreck was not alcohol-related. Uchitel said she has met Woods twice, once in her capacity as the VIP director at a club in Manhattan's trendy Meatpacking District and another time through a mutual friend. ""That's my job: to know these people, to have a relationship with them, to hang out with them,"" she told the Post. ""It doesn't mean I am having sex with them or an affair with them."" She said the allegations ""must feel horrible"" to Woods' wife, Elin Nordegren. ""The worst part of it, it's not true,"" Uchitel said.","NEW:  Tiger Woods apologizes for ""transgressions"" that let his family down .

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Latin America's first same-sex marriage, set to be held in Argentina on Tuesday, appeared derailed after a judge filed an injunction to stop the union until the issue can be reviewed further. Judge Marta Gomez Alsina's ruling blocks an earlier holding by another judge that found city laws banning same-sex marriage unconstitutional, the court said in a statement. Alex Freyre and Jose Maria di Bello had planned to make their marriage official at a civil ceremony and chose December 1 because it is World AIDS Day. The registrar responsible for the civil marriages in Buenos Aires has been notified of the ruling, the court said. The couple would attempt to get their wedding license anyway, the official Telam news agency reported. ""We're continuing with the preparations because we, as planners, nor the couple itself, have not been notified"" of the injunction, said Maria Rachid, president of the Argentine Federation for Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transsexuals, according to the news agency. Gomez Alsina's injunction could not overturn the earlier ruling because she is a trial-level judge and not an appellate judge, Rachid said. The original ruling was made on November 10 by another trial-level judge, Gabriela Seijas, who responded to a petition made by Freyre and di Bello. Seijas ruled that the ban on same-sex marriage was illegal and ordered the proper authorities to grant the couple a marriage license if they applied for one. The court's decision applied only to Buenos Aires. Same-sex unions in most of Argentina remain illegal. ""The law should treat each person with equal respect in relation to each person's singularities without the need to understand or regulate them,"" Seijas said in her ruling. Buenos Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri said after the ruling that his government would not appeal the decision. Monday's ruling was a temporary measure to postpone the marriage until Seijas' original ruling could be reviewed in depth, presumably by an appeals court or the supreme court, the court statement said . Countries in Latin America, a region strongly identified with the Catholic Church, have recently given more attention to gay rights. In September Uruguay became the first Latin American country to allow same-sex adoption. Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador are also addressing the issue of same-sex civil unions.","Freyre and Di Bello's marriage was to coincide with World AIDS Day on Tuesday .

"Berlin, Germany (CNN) -- Thousands of people joined world leaders in the German capital Monday to remember the night 20 years ago when a euphoric wave of people power swept away the Berlin Wall and consigned the Cold War to history. In scenes calmly mirroring the events of November 9, 1989, crowds thronged through the center of the once-divided city, joining German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a symbolic re-enactment of the first crossing of the breached Wall. ""It was worth fighting for,"" Merkel said, after crossing the Bösebrücker bridge on Bornholmer Strasse, the checkpoint where people first poured across the frontier. Merkel, the first former East German to lead the reunified country, was accompanied by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Polish ex-president Lech Walesa as she kicked off events to celebrate the demise of the iconic structure and remember the darker sides of the communist regimes behind it. ""It is not only a day of celebration for Germans. It is a day of celebration for the whole of Europe,"" Merkel said. Merkel was joined by Britain's Gordon Brown, France's Nicolas Sarkozy and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in a series of events, including solemn tributes and boisterous music concerts. At the climax, a line of 1,000 giant dominoes was knocked over along a 2-kilometer strip where the Wall once stood --representing the domino effect the structure's collapse had in ending communism across Eastern Europe. Memorials were to be held for the 136 lives lost of those who tried to eascape through the barrier that cut Berlin in two -- many in the so-called ""death strip"" at the heart of the Wall's fortifications. Read more in our Autumn of Change special report . Thousands of people gathered at the Brandenburg Gate, the symbol of reunified Germany which once stood at the center of the no man's land between East and West Berlin. Rock acts including Bon Jovi joined the festivities, echoing the popular music of the late 80s which soundtracked the cold night when rigid communist control gave way to an exhilarating tide of people clamoring for freedom. Testament to the powerful legacy of the Wall's collapse have been the vivid memories recounted by many of the dramatic and emotional events before and after the fall. ""It was a circus-like atmosphere, people were enthused and exuberant and thrilled to see the Wall coming down,"" said David Paul Noel of Maryland, who was working for the U.S. State Department in Germany at the time. Former CNN correspondent Richard Blystone, who watched the Wall collapse was struck by the difference in appearance of each side of the Wall . ""On the west side, there was all this graffiti and dirty words, and names of rock groups and 'down with that' -- all the chaos of a pluralistic society,"" he said. ""On the eastern side, it was clean and white, just so sterile."" Though dominated by nostalgia, Monday was also an opportunity to assess progress in a reunified Germany and democratized Eastern Europe, with many airing concerns that the world still has lessons to learn from the events of 1989. With many in Germany feeling the economic, social and psychological divisions once demarcated by the Wall, Merkel said Monday that the country had yet to fulfil promises made when East and West reunited in 1990. ""Germany unity is not yet complete,"" Merkel told public broadcaster ARD earlier. At an event in Berlin on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for renewed global action to liberate those still living under repressive regimes. ""Our history did not end the night the Wall came down,"" Clinton said. ""It began anew. And this matters not only to tens of millions of Europeans, and to the United States, but to people everywhere."" She added: ""To expand freedom to more people, we cannot accept that freedom does not belong to all people. We cannot allow oppression, defined and justified by religion or tribe to replace that of ideology. ""We have a responsibility to address conditions everywhere that undermine the potential of boys and girls and men and women that sap human dignity and threaten global progress.""

"PARIS, France (CNN)  -- French Culture Minister Frederic Mitterrand said Thursday he will not resign over accounts in a book he wrote in 2005 about paying to have sex with ""boys"" in Thailand. Frederic Mitterrand admitted to paying for sex with  ""boys"" in his 2005 autobiography, ""The Bad Life."" In an interview with French television network TF1, Mitterrand said he ""absolutely condemn[s] sexual tourism, which is a disgrace, and ... pedophilia,"" in which he insisted he has never participated. Despite the use of the French word ""garcon"" in his 2005 book ""The Bad Life,"" Mitterrand, 62, has previously said the term did not mean ""little boys."" He said the males he paid for sex were his age, or maybe five years younger, but not underage -- and the relations were consensual. ""Anyway, you can recognize someone who's 40 years old ..."" he told TF1. A 40-year-old man ""doesn't look like a minor,"" he added, suggesting that his partners were middle-aged men. His actions, Mitterrand said, were ""without a doubt, an error,"" but ""a crime, no,"" he said in the interview. Despite recent calls to resign from the far-right National Front and the left-leaning Socialist Party, Mitterrand, who is openly gay, vowed to stay in his job. He said he met Thursday morning with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and that the president supports him. In a July interview with the weekly French news magazine Le Nouvel Observateur, Sarkozy said he had read Mitterrand's book, and found it ""courageous and talented."" The controversy over the revelations in his book -- which he called neither autobiography nor memoir -- erupted anew after Mitterrand deplored the arrest last week of filmmaker Roman Polanski, who fled the United States in 1977 after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old girl. The culture minister told TF1 that he was ""too emotional"" when he denounced the filmmaker's arrest in Switzerland as ""horrifying."" ""To see him thrown to the lions for an old story that really has no meaning, and to see him alone, imprisoned, when he was going to attend a ceremony where he was to be honored, that is to say, he was trapped, it's absolutely horrifying,"" he said October 4, according to Agence France Presse. The far-right National Front organized an anti-Mitterrand demonstration in Paris on Thursday evening. ""Send this message on to everyone who will not put up with this indecency!"" the party's Web site said. The party's vice president, Marine Le Pen, has demanded Mitterrand's resignation for what she termed his sexually deviant acts. Mitterrand responded, saying, ""It's an honor to be dragged through the mud by the National Front."" Mitterrand's acts of ""sexual tourism"" have left ""a dark smudge"" on the government, Le Pen said. The group is also gathering signatures on a petition, online and on paper, from those who want Mitterrand to step down. ""We really hope he will resign,"" National Front communications director Julien Sanchez told CNN. ""It's an embarrassment for our country, that our culture minister has done this. It affects our international image. It's not right,"" he added.  Watch report on the controversy surrounding French Culture Minister Frederic Mitterand » . On the other side of the political spectrum, the left-leaning Socialist Party suggested Sarkozy should consider Mitterrand's position. ""It's up to President Sarkozy to decide whether or not we can be involved in the fight against child prostitution and sexual tourism, and whether or not the acts written in an autobiography -- written by a minister -- are acts of sexual commerce,"" said party spokesman Benoit Hamon. ""If everything is relative and Mr. Mitterrand can be excused because he's famous, well, I don't excuse his behavior,"" Hamon said. Martine Aubry, the leader of the Socialist Party, said she would wait until she had read the book before making any judgment. Mitterrand said on TF1 that he had had sexual relations with boys -- using the French word ""garcons"" -- but added, ""you must not confuse pedophilia with homosexuality."" He also described his book as a mixture of his life and the life of others, and denied accusations that it was a glorification of sexual tourism. The minister said he never had sex with ""young boys"" and denounced those who accused him of such acts, saying that maybe they were confusing their own fantasies with what the book was really about. Mitterrand told an interviewer in 2005 that assertions that he liked ""little boys"" were untrue. ""It's because when people say 'boys' we imagine 'little boys,'"" he said then. ""How to explain that? It belongs to this general puritanism which surrounds us, which always makes us paint a black picture of the situation. It has nothing to do with that."" Mitterrand was a television personality, not a government minister, when the book was published. It caused a stir upon its publication, as well, and has been the subject of heated debate several times since then. In one passage, published by the French newspaper Le Monde on Thursday, Mitterrand describes in detail a sexual encounter with a ""boy"" he said was called Bird. ""My boy didn't say a word, he stood before me, immobile, his eyes still straight ahead and a half-smile on his lips. I wanted him so badly I was trembling,"" he wrote. Mitterrand also wrote about visiting clubs to choose young male prostitutes in Thailand -- where prostitution is illegal and sexual intercourse with a minor is statutory rape and is punishable by imprisonment. ""Most of them are young, handsome and apparently unaware of the devastation that their activities could bring them. I would learn later that they didn't come every night, that they were often students, had a girlfriend and sometimes even lived with their families, who pretended not to know the source of their breadwinner's earnings,"" the book said. ""Some of them were older and there was also a small contingent of heavier bruisers, who also had their fans. It was the artistic side of the exposition: Their presence made the youthful charm of the others stand out."" He also wrote that while he had read reports and seen documentaries on the evils of ""le commerce des garcons"" (the boy trade) -- the misery, the piles of money from which ""les gosses"" (the kids) got only a few crumbs, the ravages of drugs -- ""all of these rituals of the fair of the youths, the slave market, excited me enormously."" ""The profusion of very attractive boys, immediately available, put me in a state of desire that I no longer had to restrain or conceal."" Mitterrand -- the nephew of the Socialist former president Francois Mitterrand -- joined Sarkozy's center-right government this summer. Wikipedia, the user-edited online reference Web site, has locked down Mitterrand's entry, preventing changes to it, in a possible sign of the intensity of the debate surrounding him. CNN's Jen Carswell in Paris, France and Alanne Orjoux in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","Culture minister condemns sexual tourism, denies he is a pedophile .

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Israel on Monday restated its long-standing policy regarding Iran after Russia's president indicated that Israel had taken the military option off the table. The Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, says, ""Israel has the right to defend itself."" ""Contrary to reports, all options [are] on the table on the issue of preventing Iranian nuclear weapons capability,"" Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon posted on his Twitter account. The Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, also weighed in, telling Israel Army Radio that ""Israel has the right to defend itself, and all options are open."" ""The IDF's working premise is that we have to be prepared for that possibility, and that is exactly what we are doing,"" he said. The issue stems from reports that Israel may have struck a deal with Russia regarding Iran and its controversial nuclear program. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told CNN's Fareed Zakaria last week that Israeli President Shimon Peres told him in a recent visit to the Russian leader's vacation home that ""Israel doesn't intend to deliver any strike against Iran."" ""[Peres] said we are a peaceful country, we will not deal such a blow,"" Medvedev said in the interview, broadcast Sunday on ""Fareed Zakaria GPS."" ""Therefore any deliveries of systems -- defensive systems -- which are aimed at protecting cannot increase danger, they should reduce it."" Medvedev was referring to Russia's agreement to sell Iran its S-300 anti-aircraft missile system, which he said is in keeping with international law. The Israeli newspaper Maariv reported Monday that Peres used his influence to persuade Washington to abandon its plans to base a missile defense shield system in Poland and the Czech Republic, a proposal that had rankled Moscow. In exchange, Moscow agreed to support ""imposing sanctions on Iran,"" Maariv reported. The United States and Russia have disagreed over Iran and over possible steps the U.N. Security Council may take -- including imposing sanctions -- to push Tehran to comply with U.N. demands concerning its nuclear program. President Obama told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that his objective in revamping the U.S. defense shield plan ""was not to negotiate with the Russians."" ""The Russians don't make determinations about what our defense posture is,"" Obama said in the CBS interview shown Sunday. ""If the byproduct of it is that the Russians feel a little less paranoid and are now willing to work more effectively with us to deal with threats like ballistic missiles from Iran or the nuclear development in Iran, you know, then that's a bonus.""

"New York (CNN) -- After the Alzheimer's came, my mother could not know how shadows fell across our once ebullient family: our solidarity fractured, our tempers flaring in furious incomprehension, hearts breaking in mute despair. None of us knew how to watch this woman disappear, her features slowly masked with blankness, her supple body rigid and wooden, her absolute vividness obliterated by the heavy fog of her disease. As those of us touched in some way by Alzheimer's know too well, the emotional, social and economic burden of this disease is nearly unbearable -- for individuals, for families and for our country: . • 5.3 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease; a new case develops every 70 seconds. • One in eight people aged 65 and older has the disease, and the risk is even higher for those over 85. • Today, 9.9 million people are caring for a family member with Alzheimer's. • Alzheimer's and other dementias cost Medicare, Medicaid and businesses $148 billion annually, a number that will grow quickly and substantially as baby boomers reach age 65. Prevention. Cure. Hope. These are words seldom associated with Alzheimer's disease. But groundbreaking scientific research and an opportunity for powerful collaborations could lead to discovery of the ultimate cure for Alzheimer's disease: its prevention. I know this is so because my friend Dr. Karen Hsiao Ashe, an internationally renowned Alzheimer's disease researcher at the University of Minnesota, has developed a research road map that calls for bringing together a group of the world's foremost laboratory and clinical investigators in the field to make prevention a reality by 2020. This achievable goal adds ""hope"" to the vocabulary of Alzheimer's disease and holds the promise that my children and yours will never suffer its hardship. My son, Alec, is an artist like his late grandmother. His paintings are large and uncompromising, stunning in texture, original in design. He's got the real thing. He's got ""it,"" just as she had. But what if he also has something else, like the APOE-e4 gene, known to increase the risk of Alzheimer's? What if he is in line to inherit this devastating disease? What I could barely endure happening to my mother, I know I could not possibly endure happening to my son. So, like my friend Karen, I embrace prevention as the ultimate cure for Alzheimer's disease. Anything short of that is too risky. Karen is identifying the biological processes that occur in the earliest stages of the disease -- long before symptoms appear -- to develop cost-effective, widely available interventions. She compares Alzheimer's disease prevention to the polio vaccine: ""Had a vaccine not been developed for polio, hospital wards today would be filled with people needing artificial ventilators to breathe. Similarly, not only is treatment of Alzheimer's likely to be less effective than prevention, it's also likely to be 10 to 10,000 times more expensive,"" she recently told Twin Cities Business magazine. Karen and her colleagues are homing in on a promising possibility: a pill containing the molecular compound that could block the chemical chain reaction in the brain that leads to Alzheimer's. So what's the holdup? Well, money, of course, and attitude, perhaps. Finding a treatment within the next 10 years that will prevent Alzheimer's disease will require a major national investment to bring together the scientists to develop an effective, safe and affordable way to block the disease. According to Harry Johns, president and CEO of the Alzheimer's Association, ""No other disease causes so much suffering, is so certainly fatal, affects so many and drives so much cost with so little spent to overcome it."" Why is that? Johns names ignorance, age discrimination, stigma and denial as likely explanations. My plea is deeply personal, but by 2050, Alzheimer's will affect as many as 16 million Americans, and none of us will be able to deny the reality. We must fight mightily now to prevent the shadow of this disease from darkening the lives of our children and grandchildren. We must invest today in research that will most swiftly lead to the ultimate cure: prevention.

"(CNN)  -- Five people were killed and 10 critically injured Saturday when a minivan crashed on I-10 near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, state police said. Fifteen people were in the minivan, said Trooper Russell Graham, and only two were wearing seat belts. Among the dead were children as young as 3 years old, he said. ""The minivan blew out a tire and the driver lost control,"" Graham said. The vehicle ""sideswiped a box truck and then ran off the road into the left median, overturned multiple times and finally came to rest upright on the eastbound side of I-10,"" Graham said. The one person in the truck was not injured. The accident shut down I-10 in both directions shortly after 12:15 p.m. (1:15 p.m. ET); one lane in each direction was opened about two hours later. Alcohol and drugs were not suspected factors in the crash, but blood was drawn from the driver -- one of the fatalities -- to confirm, Graham said. The accident came soon after the Louisiana Legislature passed a law requiring riders in every seat to be buckled up. ""This is an example of why we implemented that law,"" Graham said. ""It's very frustrating for us to come out here and see children dead,"" he said.","State police: 15 people were in the minivan, only two in seatbelts .

"(CNN)  -- Sales of Michael Jackson's albums have gone through the roof since the news of his death. Michael Jackson's albums took the top 15 slots on Amazon.com's top 50 album downloads. On Friday, the late singer was enjoying the commercial revival that had been eluding him in recent years, due to a lack of new material and public interest. Michael Jackson albums took top 15 slots on Amazon.com top 50 album downloads. The story was the same on iTunes where the late singer's albums dominated seven out of the ten top slots on the site. The 25th anniversary reissue of Jackson's 1982 album, ""Thriller,"" which is the top selling album of all time, is at the top spot on Amazon.com. It was followed by a special reissue of 1979 album ""Off the Wall"" and 1987 album ""Bad."" His last studio album ""Invincible,"" which he released in 2001 came in at number 10, perhaps reflecting the public's preference for Jackson's earlier work. On European online music retailer Play.com sales of Jackson's 10 most popular albums increased by a staggering 7,860 percent. Meanwhile, searches on Michael Jackson are up 8,900 percent and total downloads on the site have increased 5,167 percent. The public's unprecedented rush to buy Jackson's albums has been likened to the the reaction when other music icons like Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra died. ""There are an awful lot of people that think his contribution to music was huge, and as an artist he was so talented -- even though he was such a complicated artist, particularly towards the end of his life,"" Stuart Rowe Chief Operating Officer of Play.com told CNN. ""People want some kind of memento. They want to appreciate and listen to his music again, and mark his passing by listening to it all again."" According to Rowe because of their quality, many of Jackson's albums are perennial bestsellers, and while there was also some increase in interest in his music because of his sold out 50-date London tour which was scheduled to kick off in mid-July. ""But nothing like the effect of the news,"" said. ""It's taken this for his music to be brought to a whole new generation of people."" Five of Jackson's solo albums -- ""Off the Wall,"" ""Thriller,"" ""Bad,"" ""Dangerous"" and ""HIStory,"" are among the top-sellers of all time, according to Jackson's label Sony Music. During his career, Jackson sold an estimated 750 million records worldwide, released 13 No.1 singles. ""There's the whole sort of grieving of a superstar which the general public will go through worldwide,"" said Rowe.

"(CNN) -- A second runner missing since Monday was found alive near a ravine on a rugged mountain trail in Southern California hours after her running partner was found, an Orange County Sheriff's spokesman told CNN. Runner Maria ""Gina"" Natera-Armenta, 34, is severely dehydrated and in serious condition, officials said. Authorities and fellow runners had been looking for Maria ""Gina"" Natera-Armenta, 34, and her brother-in-law, Fidel Diaz, 50, since Monday. Diaz was found about 1 p.m. ET Wednesday, but the search for Natera-Armenta continued as police questioned him. Orange County Sheriff's officials, searching the area by helicopter, eventually spotted Natera-Armenta waving from the ravine, which was about five miles from the sheriff's command post, Orange County Sheriff spokesman Lt. Jim Amormino. ""She was lying in the shady area,"" Amormino said. ""She did see the helicopter before, but didn't have enough energy to get up."" Natera-Armenta is in serious condition, and was severely dehydrated when she was found, Amormino said. She is currently in the intensive care unit at Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo, California. The pair had set out at 5:30 a.m. Sunday. According to their spouses, they planned to do an eight- to 10-hour run on a remote mountain trail in the Cleveland National Forest near San Diego. But it wasn't until Monday night that their spouses individually reported to police that the two were missing. Natera-Armenta and Diaz are ultrarunners, devotees of an endurance sport in which it's common to trek and run for many hours over rugged terrain.  Natera-Armenta is an experienced ultrarunner and was a top finisher at a 100-mile race in San Diego.","NEW: Official: Second ultrarunner found in serious condition with severe dehydration .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- An Italian mafia boss used his pet crocodile to threaten people and extort money, authorities said. The caiman was 1.1 meters long (3.6 feet), the Italian Forest Service said. Antonio Cristofaro kept the 40-kilogram (88-pound) reptile on a terrace of his home near Naples and fed it live rats and rabbits, according to LAV, an Italian animal rights group. Authorities discovered the animal during a search for weapons at Cristofaro's home, LAV said. The crocodile was found on September 18 but the news was only made public Wednesday, the group said. The crocodile was 1.1 meters long (3.6 feet), the Italian Forest Service said, and was capable of pulling off a man's limb with one bite. It lived atop Cristofaro's condominium in Caserta, less than an hour northeast of Naples, the Forest Service said. Cristofaro used the crocodile to intimidate people, notably entrepreneurs, to pay him more money, Italy's ANSA news agency reported. The crocodile is of a type known as a caiman, commonly found in Latin America. It is protected under the Washington Convention, which regulates the international trade of endangered animals, and is considered too dangerous to own as a pet, the Forest Service said. Police charged Cristofaro with illegal possession of animals, ANSA said. It was not clear whether he had been arrested. The Forest Service is now holding the reptile at an animal center near Rome, ANSA reported. Cristofaro, who the Forest Service said comes from a mafia family, already had a criminal record for weapons-related charges, resisting police, and extortion, ANSA reported. Authorities found a flak jacket during a search of Cristofaro's house, the Forest Service said. It was not the first time the Forest Service discovered an illegal crocodile at someone's home, the Forest Service said. In August 2008 in Naples, authorities found a 2-meter-long (6.5-foot-long) crocodile at the home of a man known for drug dealing, they said. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","Italian mafia boss kept 40-kg reptile at his home near Naples to threaten people .

"(CNN) -- An eight-hour hostage standoff ended late Wednesday when an armed, disabled man wheeled himself out of a Virginia post office and was taken into custody, according to the mayor of Wytheville. Initially, authorities reported five people -- three postal workers and two customers -- were taken hostage after a man entered a Wytheville, Virginia, post office about 2:30 p.m. and fired a gun. But Mayor Trent Crewe said police later believed the gunman was holding fewer than five people and that they have accounted for people they thought could have been inside. ""Apparently they ran as it was unfolding and we didn't know that for a while,"" Crewe said. An unidentified witness told CNN affiliate WDBJ that he, a fellow window clerk and the postmaster were in the building when the gunman entered, but they quickly fled. He added that his supervisor was one of the hostages. WDBJ reports on standoff . Crewe said he did not know exactly how many hostages had been in the building. No one was reported hurt, Crewe said. The gunman is disabled, Crewe said, adding that police told him the gunman entered the post office pushing a wheelchair. It was unclear what the purpose of the wheelchair is, Crewe said. There were reports the man had a ""device,"" and it appeared that his car, parked outside the office, was equipped with some type of device as well, Crewe said. He did not elaborate on what the device could be. ""The police authorities have told me they are acting on the assumption there is an explosive device of some kind in some location,"" Crewe said. ""There is a bomb squad, in fact more than one bomb squad on site, but we cannot confirm any explosives."" The surrounding area of downtown Wytheville has been evacuated within a three- to four-block radius, Crewe said. The suspect asked for pizza but made no other demands, U.S. Postal Inspection Service spokesman Peter Rendina said. The gunman's motive was unclear, Crewe said. He had not identified himself but he has told police he has a military background, Crewe said. Police have yet to confirm whether the gunman has military training, Crewe said. Agents with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were also on scene, Crewe said. Wytheville is a small town in southwestern Virginia in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It has a population of just over 8,000.

"London, England (CNN) -- The United Kingdom will send an additional 500 troops to Afghanistan in early December, bringing the British contingent there to more than 9,500, Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced Monday. ""We must address the terrorist threat at its source,"" Brown told lawmakers, adding: ""Our task is to prevent the Taliban from giving al Qaeda ... safe haven. ""Instability in Afghanistan can only increase the risk of conflagration where the rest of the world can least afford it."" Brown regularly links British security to events in Afghanistan and Pakistan, saying attacks on London and other British targets have been planned in South Asia. He announced in October the decision in principle to boost force levels, but said certain conditions -- including proper equipment for the British troops and more troop commitments from other countries -- had to be met first. The United Kingdom has the largest contingent in Afghanistan after the United States. The figure of 9,500 does not include special forces, said Brown, who declined to say exactly how many are there, but indicated it is more than 500. Brown's announcement coincided with the news that a British soldier was killed by an explosion in Afghanistan's Helmand province, where troops have been entrenched in heavy combat with Taliban insurgents since July 2006. The soldier, from the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards, died as a result of injuries sustained in the Babaji area, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement. Britain has lost more than 200 service personnel in Afghanistan since the start of fighting in 2001. More than 100 were lost in the past year.","British contingent in Afghanistan will be increased to 9,500, UK's Brown says .

"(CNN) -- Virender Sehwag plundered the second-fastest Test double hundred as India piled on an incredible 443-1 off just 79 overs on the second day of the deciding third match against Sri Lanka in Mumbai. The opener reached 284 off only 239 balls at stumps on Thursday -- the third-highest individual score in one day's play -- for his sixth double ton, a record for India, and is poised to become the first player to complete three triple-centuries. India, seeking a victory which would take the No. 1 Test ranking above South Africa and seal a 2-0 series victory over second-placed Sri Lanka, have already achieved a first-innings lead of 50 runs. The tourists had resumed on 366-8 with Angelo Mathews unbeaten on 86, but the all-rounder fell one run short of his maiden Test century when he was run out by the narrowest of margins following a throw by Sachin Tendulkar. When wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni lodged the bails, replays showed that Mathews' bat was over the line -- but not grounded -- thus he departed as ninth man out for 99 off 131 balls. Young left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha then claimed his third wicket to go with the four that his senior partner Harbhajan Singh claimed on Monday as Sri Lanka were all out for 393, 27 minutes into the day's play. That brought Sehwag and inexperienced opener Murali Vijay to the crease, and they launched a blistering attack on the Sri Lankan bowlers putting on 221 in just 39 overs. Vijay, playing only his second Test, was finally trapped leg before wicket by spinner Rangana Herath, having made 87 off 121 deliveries, with 10 fours and a six. The explosive Sehwag, who made 131 in India's innings victory in Kanpur, then found another solid partner in Rahul Dravid, who calmly fed him the strike in his patient 62 off 121 balls. Sehwag passed three figures from 101 deliveries and then raced to his second century off just 67 -- the only man to pass that milestone quicker is New Zealand's Nathan Astle, who took 153 balls against England in 2002. ""I missed out on a double-century in the last Test in Kanpur and I wanted to make amends,"" Sehwag told reporters. ""I batted the best way I thought was possible. ""I was cautious at the start because I did not want to give the opposition any chances as I had done in the two previous matches. I thought I would bide my time, see off the new ball and then take my chances."" Sehwag hit 40 boundaries and seven sixes, and was particularly hard on Sri Lanka's veteran world record-holder Muttiah Muralitharan, who has struggled all series. The 37-year-old, who has taken 788 Test wickets, conceded 119 runs off his 20 overs. ""Muralitharan is a big challenge and when playing a quality bowler like him you have to attack early, otherwise he will dominate,"" Sehwag said. ""I thought rather than let him dominate, I would attack him from the start and keep him on the back foot."" Meanwhile, Pakistan stumbled to 161-6 on a shortened first day of the second Test against New Zealand in Wellington. Daryl Tuffey celebrated his comeback after a five-year absence with two wickets as he replaced injured strike bowler Shane Bond, while captain Daniel Vettori took 3-42 with his left-arm spin as bad light ended play early. Imran Farhat and Salman Butt put on 60 for the first wicket but then fell in quick succession along with captain Mohammad Yousuf as Vettori snared two wickets in three balls. Australia fast bowler Brett Lee has had elbow surgery in a bid to save his career. The 33-year-old needed an operation to correct a damaged ligament after twice breaking down this year amid fears he would have to retire, and is not expected to be fit again before March. The player, who missed the Ashes defeat to England, has taken 310 Test wickets in 76 matches and 324 one-day scalps in 186 appearances.","Virender Sehwag plunders 284 not out as India pile on 443-1 off just 79 overs .

"(CNN) -- A mysterious X-shaped pattern of space debris seen by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope was probably two asteroids that collided, scientists said Tuesday. The object, called P/2010 A2, was discovered in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research sky survey, or LINEAR, on January 6, NASA said. The shape, and the streamers of dust shooting off of it, were photographed by Hubble on January 25 and 29, according to NASA. Astronomers have long thought the asteroid belt is being ground down because of collisions, but such a head-on crash had never been seen before. ""If this interpretation is correct, two small and previously unknown asteroids recently collided, creating a shower of debris that is being swept back into a tail from the collision site by the pressure of sunlight,"" said principal investigator David Jewitt, from the University of California at Los Angeles. At first, astronomers thought what they saw might be a main belt comet, a rare case of a comet orbiting while in the asteroid belt. But the images taken by Hubble revealed the complex X-pattern of filamentary structures near the object's nucleus. Jewitt said the filaments are made of dust and gravel. Some of them are being swept back by radiation pressure from sunlight, creating the long, straight dust streaks, he said. The nucleus of the presumed boom is 460 feet in diameter, NASA said. Asteroid collisions happen fast, with an average impact speed of more than 11,000 mph, or five times faster than a rifle bullet.","NASA says LINEAR survey saw apparent crash, Hubble telescope photographed it .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- The Dominican consul general Wednesday rejected the claim from an American church leader that she thought her paperwork was in order when she attempted to take 33 Haitian children out of the country, saying he had told her it was not. ""I warned her, I said as soon as you get there without the proper documents, you are going to get into trouble, because they are going to accuse you, because you have the intent to pass the border without the proper papers and they are going to accuse you with kids trafficking,"" Carlos Castillo said he told the group's leader, Laura Silsby, during a meeting Friday. Four hours later, Silsby and nine other Americans were turned back from the border. They were arrested and taken to a jail in Port-au-Prince. ""This woman knew what she was trying to do was not legal,"" Castillo said. A CNN reporter attempted to get reaction to Castillo's comment from the jailed Americans, but they would not discuss the matter, responding to questions by singing ""Amazing Grace"" and praying. Told earlier that many of the children had living parents, Silsby said, ""I did not know that."" She added, ""In our hearts, our intention was to help children that had been orphaned or abandoned by their parents."" But the interpreters the group had used said the conversations between Silsby and the parents in the Haitian town of Calebasse made clear to them that Silsby must have been aware of the children's status. Full coverage of Haiti earthquake aftermath . SOS Children's Villages, an Austrian charity, said that it has determined that at least two-thirds of the children are not orphans. Authorities on Wednesday questioned a Haitian police officer who works at the Dominican Embassy about whether he provided illegal paperwork to Silsby and the other Americans to facilitate their efforts as alleged by interpreters who had translated for the Americans. The interpreters told CNN the Americans met at least twice last week with the officer, at the embassy and consulate. ""He told them that he could help, and he was helping them with some paper,"" said interpreter Steve Adrien. ""We did not meet him in a police station, but in the street in a car."" The Americans met again with the man in Port-au-Prince on Thursday, near the Dominican Embassy, the translator said. Isaac Adrien, Steve's brother and another of the interpreters, said the group came away from the meeting with a document from the embassy that the Americans took with them to the border Friday in their unsuccessful attempt to cross. iReport: How you can help . A Haitian lawyer representing the Americans told reporters that the arrests themselves were illegal and that their clients had only been trying to help. They are to appear Thursday before the attorney general. The group, New Life Children's Refuge, said it was rescuing abandoned children by moving them to the Dominican Republic, where it was building an orphanage. At least some of the group are members of the Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, Idaho. Several residents of the village of Calebasse, more than an hour from Port-au-Prince, told CNN they voluntarily handed over their children after Silsby told them she would give them a better life. Pastor Jean Sainvil told CNN he rounded up 20 children from a camp in the Delmas neighborhood of the capital. ""I just got the word out that I am going to look for some children to be going with a group of missionaries,"" he said. Some of those who responded apparently included parents. ""One of them turned five children over,"" he said. He said no money changed hands. The group has no experience running an orphanage, has not registered as an international adoption agency and has not filed with the U.S. government as a nonprofit. Church pastor Clint Henry was unfazed. ""I believe that the kind of knowledge that it takes to begin an organization that works that way was in place,"" he told CNN. ""The kind of employees that it takes to successfully run an orphanage, those were going to be hired."" The matter drew attention Wednesday from U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ""It was unfortunate that, whatever the motivation, that this group of Americans took matters into their own hands,"" she said. The number of Haitian orphans taken to the United States -- those whose approval and paperwork had been in the bureaucratic pipeline at the time of the disaster -- stands at 578, with 44 others processed and awaiting transportation, said U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Samar Saed Abdullah's entire body trembles as she speaks about her impending execution. She thinks of the gallows room, the noose around her neck and that moment when she will take her final breath. Samar Saed Abdullah is sentenced to die by hanging in connection with the killing of three relatives. ""My life is meaningless,"" she said, choking on her tears. ""I can't think of anything else. The other women, we try to help each other, but we cannot escape the reality that we are on death row and they can take us at any second."" The 27-year-old Iraqi woman is sentenced to die in connection with the slayings of three relatives in January 2005. She looks pale and frail, her face sallow, her eyes bloodshot. She shakes with each sob, anxiously twisting a tissue in her hands. We first met Samar in spring 2007, at al-Kadhimiya Women's Prison in Baghdad. She had been on death row for about two years, and she was terrified.  Watch a tearful plea from death row » . ""I don't sleep at all on Wednesdays,"" she said then. ""I stay up from morning until night, because that's the day they pick for executions."" Samar was sentenced to death by hanging for being an accessory to murder in the killings of her uncle, aunt and cousin -- slayings that she says were carried out at their home by her husband-to-be, who remains on the loose. She maintains that she is innocent, and there are disturbing questions about her conviction. Samar has now been moved a step closer to death: to Baghdad's maximum-security prison, where there are more than 500 prisoners waiting to be executed. It's the same facility where Saddam Hussein was hanged in December 2006. CNN was not allowed to film her face inside the prison. During the interview, the wardens also seemed to make motions to try to stop CNN from broaching the subject of her allegation that she had only confessed under torture. The day of the killings is seared into her mind. ""I think about it every day, every hour. I wake up with it in my head,"" she said. ""It's the reason I am here."" There was a point in time when Samar was happy, when her life had meaning and joy. She had a fiancé, Saif Ali Nur, in winter 2004. ""I was so happy at the time, when he asked for my hand in marriage,"" she remembered bitterly. ""I thought that he was honest, that he did not lie to me. It all happened in just two months."" At first, her family didn't approve of the romance, but they eventually relented. One day, she says, Saif duped her into taking him to her wealthy uncle's house. He locked her in the kitchen and, she says, shot her uncle, aunt and cousin. Then, he turned the gun on her. Samar says he stole less than $1,000 after threatening to kill Samar and her family if she went to the authorities. The Iraqi police picked Samar up the next day, after Saif dumped her in front of her house and disappeared. ""There was nothing that made me suspect that this was a guy who would do something like this,"" she said. She's filled with regret that she fell in love with him. ""And now I am here in prison, and he is out on the streets, happy."" Her parents sold everything to pay for her defense. They swear she's innocent. She says she was tortured by the police into confessing that she went to her uncle's house with the intent to steal. ""They kept beating me, and they told me, 'Say whatever we want you to say, and do not say anything else, and say yes, I was an accomplice to this crime.' Although I had nothing to do with it. Finally, they made me sign a blank piece of paper, and they filled it out afterwards."" She was tried and convicted in a single day: August 15, 2005. Court documents obtained by CNN read that ""the court discussed the case file with her and she said that all that she had confessed came as a result of duress and torture."" Under Iraqi law, the court should have investigated her claim that she confessed under torture. But it did not. After learning of Samar's case from CNN, former Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih said Tuesday he spoke with the Iraqi Presidency Council, which promised to look into the matter. He also said he had spoken separately with top Iraqi officials, including Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, and urged for a new trial. Human rights groups say Samar's case is just one of many in which justice has failed. And they say that what makes implementing capital punishment even more disturbing is that the Iraqi judicial system does not guarantee a fair trial. Amnesty International issued a report Tuesday saying that at least 1,000 prisoners sit on Iraq's death row and that Iraq now has one of the highest execution rates in the world. The report says Iraq's court system does not meet international standards and that authorities ""provide very little information on executions, and some have been carried out secretly."" According to a Western official with in-depth knowledge of the Iraqi judicial system, Iraq's judicial failures are ""rooted in the legal culture rather than the law. ... The entire legal culture remains heavily confession-based, a situation exacerbated by the frequently imperfect investigative skills of the police, judicial investigators and investigative judges."" In his years in Iraq, this official says he observed judges taking payments in exchange for certain decisions and the physical abuse of suspects, either as an end in itself or to ""encourage"" confessions. ""It is my firmly held opinion that Iraq should immediately reinstate the moratorium on executions,"" the official said. ""There are serious problems plaguing the administration of justice in Iraq in criminal cases, and this fact is widely acknowledged by the Iraq judges, prosecutors and defense counsel."" The U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority abolished capital punishment in Iraq after Saddam Hussein was toppled in 2003. But the death penalty was reinstated in August 2004, shortly after the government was handed back to Iraqis. Iraq's Ministry of Justice maintains that the judicial system is ""fair and just."" Local organizations like the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq have for years been fighting to get the death penalty abolished in Iraq, especially when it comes to flawed trials and women being put to death. But they struggle against a government that turns a deaf ear. ""I wish there was some kind of response. But the response is totally passive. We've reached a degree of despair,"" said Yanar Mohammed, founder of the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq. ""As a human rights organization in Iraq, we find that we need some backup from abroad to put pressure on our government as a first step to stop the executions of these women, some of whom we know are innocent."" But even as doubts surface about many convictions in Iraq, there are signs that the pace of executions is picking up. Over the past two months, Mohammed's group says, between two and four women were executed. ""They were taken out of the extreme-protection prison,"" Mohammed said. ""It is a very scary story for us, because if it starts with a few women in a jail cell ... it could happen to hundreds, thousands of people later on."" As for Samar, she doesn't sleep, haunted by the image of her body that could be hanging lifeless -- plagued by the gut-wrenching fear of death that consumes her nights and most of her days. ""Every night, I stay up thinking that if tomorrow comes, who will be next? Me? Or my friend sitting next to me?"" She sobbed. ""I will never trust a man again. I will never love anyone again. I just want to stay with my parents."" Samar feels betrayed, both by the man she once loved and by a judicial system that is about to send her to her death. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Woman sobs about impending execution: ""I can't think of anything else""

"Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- Nearly 10 years ago, Maurice Clemmons pledged to make a fresh start. ""I come from a very good Christian family and I was raised much better than my actions speak,"" Clemmons said in a clemency application brief to then-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in 2000. ""I'm still ashamed to this day for the shame my stupid involvement in these crimes brought upon my family's name."" Clemmons was 27. He'd spent the past 11 years in an Arkansas prison, convicted of offenses including robbery, burglary, theft and taking a gun to school. He was facing a 95-year sentence. A decade later, Clemmons is the subject of an intense manhunt in Washington state, suspected in the deaths of four Lakewood, Washington, police officers who were shot to death Sunday as they met in a coffee shop before starting their shifts. Authorities have said Clemmons is believed to have entered the Forza Coffee Company and opened fire on the officers with no warning. Police tracked Clemmons to an east Seattle home Sunday night, but after a standoff that stretched to nearly 12 hours, they entered the home and found that he was not there. In 2000, Clemmons told Huckabee that the crimes occurred when he was 16, had just moved to Arkansas from Seattle and had fallen in with the wrong crowd. ""Where once stood a young 16-year-old misguided fool ... now stands a 27-year-old man, who has learned through the 'school of hard knocks' to appreciate and respect the rights of others,"" his petition to Huckabee said. Huckabee commuted Clemmons' sentence in 2000, citing his young age at the time of sentencing, making him eligible for parole. It was granted in July 2000, after he told Arkansas parole officials that he ""just wants the opportunity"" and ""is not the same person he was when he came in,"" the documents said. ""It was not something I was pleased with at the time,"" said Larry Jegley, who prosecuted Clemmons for aggravated robbery and other charges in Pulaski County, Arkansas, regarding the commutation. ""I would be most distressed if this is the same guy."" In 1989, as he was being prosecuted, Clemmons demonstrated violent behavior; he hid a piece of metal in his sock at a pretrial hearing, and before the start of another hearing he grabbed a padlock off his holding cell and threw it at a court bailiff. He missed and instead struck his mother, who had come to bring him clothes. In his 2000 brief to Huckabee, Clemmons said his mother had died while he had been in prison, providing him with further motivation to turn his life around. ""I have never done anything good for God, but I've prayed for him to grant me in his compassion the grace to make a start,"" he said. ""Now, I'm humbly appealing to you for a brand new start."" But after receiving a second chance, Clemmons was apparently unable to stay on the right side of the law, according to documents and authorities in Arkansas and Washington. Arkansas parole board documents show that he was back in prison by September 2001. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that he was arrested for aggravated robbery and theft and taken back to prison on a parole violation. The paper said he was not served with the new arrest warrants for the robbery and theft charges until he was paroled three years later in 2004. His attorney argued that the charges should be dismissed because too much time had passed, and prosecutors complied. Huckabee went on to become a 2008 Republican presidential candidate and has not ruled out a second try for the White House in 2012. In a statement Sunday night, his office said Clemmons' commutation was based on the recommendation of the parole board that determined that he met the conditions for early release. Read the clemency documents for Clemmons . ""He was arrested later for parole violation and taken back to prison to serve his full term, but prosecutors dropped the charges that would have held him,"" the statement said. ""Should he be found responsible for this horrible tragedy, it will be the result of a series of failures in the criminal justice system in both Arkansas and Washington state."" During his candidacy, Huckabee faced criticism in the case of convicted rapist Wayne DuMond, who was paroled in 1999. He had been sentenced to life for raping a 17-year-old girl. In his first term as governor, Huckabee expressed support for DuMond's release in a letter to him. Less than a year after his release, DuMond was accused of raping and murdering Carol Shields of Kansas City, Missouri. DuMond was convicted in 2003 and died in prison in 2005. Shields' mother, Lois Davidson, said in 2007 that she planned to campaign against Huckabee. Clemmons is believed to have moved to Washington in 2004. The Pierce County Sheriff's Department said in a statement that he was recently charged in the assault of a police officer and rape of a child. County court records posted online show that he spent several months in jail and was released on $150,000 bail Tuesday, days before the shootings. For a while after moving to Washington, Clemmons ran a pressure-washing and landscaping business. The license for the business expired last month, according to the secretary of state, with whom businesses have to register. In recent months, Clemmons has displayed increasingly erratic behavior, the Seattle Times reported. In May, he punched a sheriff's deputy in the face, the paper said. In another incident, he had relatives undress, telling them that families need to be ""naked for at least five minutes on Sunday,"" the newspaper said, citing a sheriff's department incident report. Clemmons also believed that he was Jesus and could fly, a deputy wrote, based on conversations with family members. The night before the shootings, Clemmons had threatened to kill police officers, but authorities did not learn of the threats until after the shooting, Pierce County sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer told ""Good Morning America."" ""There's not going to be a big motive other than he was upset about being incarcerated and was going to go gunning after cops in general,"" Troyer said.

"(CNN) -- A magnitude 8.0 earthquake struck the Pacific near American Samoa, triggering towering tsunami waves that gushed over the island and leaving at least 22 people dead. The tsunami wave hit right in the middle of the harbor of Pago Pago, the capital. American Samoa Gov. Togiola Tulafono, speaking from Hawaii, said Tuesday's quake ranked ""right up there with some of the worst"" disasters on the island. He said about 50 people had been treated for injuries so far but he expected that number to rise. The quake hit the small cluster of South Pacific islands early Tuesday morning. By evening, Laumoli, standing outside the LBJ Tropical Medican Center morgue in the capital of Pago Pago, confirmed 22 deaths. ""I thought it was the end of the world,"" said Dr. Salamo Laumoli, director of health services. ""I have never felt an earthquake like that before."" Laumoli feared more fatalities would turn up as rescue workers were still trying to access parts of the island severed by damaged infrastructure. Laumoli said people in outlying villages on one end of the main island have been cut off because the main bridge was washed away. ""Two or three villages have been badly damaged,"" he told CNN International.  Listen to Laumoli speak about the impact of the quake and tsunami » . Tulafono cited extensive damage to roads, buildings and homes, and said he had spoken to the military about mobilizing reserve forces for assistance. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Ewa Beach, Hawaii, canceled tsunami watches and warnings for American Samoa about four hours after the earthquake hit. However, a tsunami advisory is still in effect for for the coastal areas of California and Oregon.  Watch report on end of tsunami warning » . The Japan Meteorological Agency also activated a tsunami advisory along its eastern coast. The precautionary alert means that the height of a possible tsunami wave would be less than a foot and a half. President Barack Obama ""declared a major disaster exists in the Territory of American Samoa"" late Tuesday and ordered federal aid to supplement local efforts. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals. The tsunami waves hit right in the middle of the Pago Pago harbor, the capital, said Cinta Brown, an American Samoa homeland security official working at the island's emergency operations center. The water devastated the village of Leone.  Watch a resident talk about what happened » . ""The wave came onshore and washed out people's homes,"" Brown said. The same happened on the hard-hit east and west sides of American Samoa, she said. The quake generated three separate tsunami waves, the largest measuring 5.1 feet from sea level height, said Vindell Hsu, a geophysicist with the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Preliminary data had originally reported a larger tsunami. Officials in the U.S. territory issued a clear call and were focusing on assessing the damage, Brown said. Reports of damage were still emerging, but a bulletin from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the waves ""may have been destructive along coasts near the earthquake epicenter and could also be a threat to more distant coasts. Authorities should take appropriate action in response to this possibility."" Tulafono, the governor, was on his way back home Tuesday night on one of two U.S. Coast Guard C-130 transport planes flying to American Samoa with aid. The Coast Guard also will transport more than 20 officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to American Samoa, said John Hamill, external affairs officer for FEMA in Oakland, California. The FEMA team will include a variety of debris experts, housing experts, members of the Corps of Engineers, and other disaster relief specialists, Hamill said. Tulafono told reporters Tuesday that it was hard being away from home when disaster came calling. It was a time, he said, for families to be together. Those who experienced the massive quake described it as a terrifying event. Brown was standing in a parking lot when her sports utility vehicle began rocking left and right. ""You could hear the rattling of the metal"" of a large chain link fence around the lot, Brown said. ""It shakes you because you know something else is coming,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- A Georgia man accused of screaming racial slurs while beating an African-American female Army reservist outside a restaurant was released from jail on bail Wednesday, Clayton County, Georgia, authorities said. They said Troy Dale West Jr. was released on a $320,000 bond. Attorney Kip Jones, who represents alleged victim Tashawnea Hill, said a judge Tuesday ordered West placed under house arrest, and he was fitted with an ankle monitor. He also was told to surrender his passport, have no contact with Hill and stay out of Clayton County, where Hill lives, the lawyer said. West, of Poulan, Georgia, faces one count of aggravated assault, two counts of battery, two counts of disorderly conduct, false imprisonment and cruelty to children for allegedly beating Hill outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant September 9, according to a Clayton County Court online docket. Hill was with her 7-year-old daughter when the alleged incident occurred at the entrance to the restaurant, which is in Morrow, Georgia. West, 47, was arrested on misdemeanor charges after the incident, but Clayton County District Attorney Tracy Graham Lawson took the case to a grand jury asking for more serious charges. Hill, 35, said the attack occurred after she warned West to be careful, after almost hitting her daughter with the restaurant door as she was leaving. West, according to a police report, admitted striking Hill ""after she spit on me and accused me of trying to hit her daughter with a door."" Hill denied the accusations, saying she did nothing to provoke the alleged attack. Hill told police that West, who is white, yelled racial epithets at her during the attack. Police said witnesses confirmed her account. Morrow is a racially diverse city in the southeast suburbs of Atlanta, with a population of about 4,900, according to the 2000 census.

"(CNN) -- President Obama on Thursday called on business leaders from the private sector to generate ideas that will ""accelerate job creation"" and stimulate investment in the United States. ""While I believe that government has a critical role in creating the conditions for economic growth, ultimately, true economic recovery is only going to come from the private sector,"" Obama told attendees of the at the White House Forum on Jobs and Economic Growth. More than 100 CEOs, small-business owners, business leaders, mayors and academics attended. ""We don't have enough public dollars to fill the hole of private dollars that was created as a consequence of the crisis. It is only when the private sector starts to reinvest again; only when our businesses start hiring again and people start spending again and families start seeing improvement in their own lives again, that we're going to have the kind of economy that we want,"" Obama said. The summit took place amid allegations from members of Obama's own party that the White House and the Democratic congressional leadership are not doing enough to help the unemployed. Critics called the summit nothing more than a publicity stunt, and some are threatening to organize a march on Washington of jobless Americans if efforts to get more aid fail. ""Obviously, there's something that's not getting through to them,"" said Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Illinois. ""We'll get the American people involved. You know, I can see a day, unless we get some real cooperation and real help, I can really see a day where there will be a jobless march on Washington."" Rush and Reps. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, and Candice Miller, R-Michigan, chair the new congressional Jobs Now Caucus, which is made up of 112 Democrats and 17 Republicans. Proposals being floated by members of the caucus include redirecting stimulus and TARP money to jobs programs and pressing for a new jobs bill, which they're careful not to call a ""stimulus."" The summit also fell on the eve of the release of the government's November unemployment report. The nation is expected to have lost another 114,000 jobs, with unemployment remaining at 10.2 percent, the highest in 26 years, according to a survey by economists. Yet Obama projected a positive tone as he recounted some of the day's discussions, on topics from clean energy and tax incentives to the export market, and the overlap among them. ""When we were in the infrastructure session, there was a strong emphasis on needing to plan not just for existing road projects, but also, how do we think about the fact that, in the future, we need a cleaner transportation industry?"" he said. ""When we were in the clean energy session, there was an emphasis on how do we get small businesses and small contractors to get certified and get the financing needed to move forward and take advantage of these clean energy sector opportunities,"" he said. ""There's a lot of overlap between all these different breakout sessions that we engaged in,"" he said. ""We're going to have to figure out how to break out of these silos and integrate these strategies if we're going to be able to get the most bang for the buck."" Coinciding with the jobs forum, organized labor and religious leaders in several cities sponsored events featuring unemployed and underemployed people to raise the public profile of the issue. Events were held in Dayton, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; and Sacramento, California, on Wednesday, and in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday.

"(CNN) -- The pilot and co-pilot of a small cargo jet were killed when their aircraft crashed short of the runway while landing at an airport in suburban Chicago, Illinois, local authorities said. The Learjet 35A was on its final approach into Chicago Executive Airport in Wheeling, Illinois, when it went down about 1:30 p.m., the Federal Aviation Administration reported. The plane crashed into a forest preserve about a mile south of the runway and ended up in a river, said Jay Reardon, the head of a multi-agency firefighting task force that responded to the crash. The two-man crew was found dead at the scene, Reardon said. No emergency was declared before the crash. ""To our knowledge, everything appeared normal up until the aircraft was reported down by the tower at Chicago Executive Airport,"" Reardon said. The National Transportation Safety Board has begun its investigation of the crash. There was no immediate indication of the cause, NTSB senior investigator Pam Sullivan said. ""It's way too early to even start narrowing down what could or could not happen,"" she said. The flight was operated by Royal Air Cargo, a Waterford, Michigan-based carrier that operates a fleet of small jets to deliver ""time-sensitive"" freight, airport spokesman Michael Standard said. Reardon said the jet appeared to be empty when it went down. The downed plane was en route to Atlanta, Georgia, from Pontiac, Michigan, with a stop in Chicago, according to private Web sites that track air travel.

"(CNN) -- From anti-apartheid activist to climate change champion, Kumi Naidoo is a man born to make a change. He's the new International Executive Director of environmental action group Greenpeace, and he takes on his role on the eve of the critical climate talks in Copenhagen. The 44 year-old grew up in Johannesburg and had an early introduction to the world of activism. ""I was defiantly the product of the society I was born in, which was apartheid South Africa...I do think that many of us who might have exceptional or out-of-the-ordinary backgrounds are not because we ourselves are exceptional people but because we were born in context of adversity and been able to somehow rise above that adversity,"" he told CNN. Naidoo was arrested numerous times for civil disobedience against the apartheid regime during the 1980s. He eventually left for the UK in 1987 and earned a doctorate in political sociology at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. After Nelson Mandela was released in 1990, Kumi returned to South Africa and worked with and founded a number of civil society NGOs. Until last year Naidoo was for 10 years the General Secretary of CIVICUS: World Alliance for Citizen Participation. One of the first high profile campaigns Naidoo worked on was Make Poverty History in 2005 that gained widespread coverage and a number of celebrity supporters. After several years in the anti-poverty movement, Naidoo has come to see that struggle against poverty and combating climate change are two-sides of same coin. Since becoming head of Greenpeace in November, Naidoo is focused on using his skills as an activist to move issues from the fringes into the mainstream. ""[Another] feature of activism is being able to choose the right tools and tactics for the right moment... If you can win through dialogue and engagement then that's great but sadly those with power in both government and business do not have the propensity to do the right thing unless they are pushed and that's why you have to have tools like non-violent direct action,"" he told CNN. Connecting individuals to ideas and in turn connecting those ideas to a greater audience is one of the things Naidoo is hoping to achieve in Copenhagen. ""I don't want history to judge us as sleepwalking into a crisis when all the scientific evidence is saying that we have to stop and take notice of the way that we are living on this planet. ""I feel that right now we are all at risk and being severely judged by future generation.""

"London, England (CNN) -- The relatives of five British sailors whose boat apparently drifted into Iranian territorial waters last week voiced relief Wednesday as their sons arrived at a yacht club in Dubai. David Young, father of sailor Oliver Young, said the families met briefly Wednesday morning with Britain's foreign secretary and his staff, who earlier told relatives that Iran was releasing the men. ""We did say to everybody in there, and to people in Bahrain, and to people in Tehran who have been working on this how much we appreciated their efforts, how well they've handled the situation and how glad we are to see our boys home,"" Young said. The parents appeared at a news conference held in front of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London. Young had said he was able to speak to his son briefly Monday on a cell phone belonging to one of the other men. The father said he was reassured that the men were being treated well. The British government identified the other sailors as Olly Smith, Sam Usher, Luke Porter and Dave Bloomer. The Times of London said Young and Porter are 21 years old, Usher is 26, Smith is 31, and Bloomer is believed to be in his 60s. Bloomer is from Dublin, Ireland, the paper said, and apparently has dual citizenship. Iran's navy detained the men November 25 as their racing yacht traveled from Bahrain to Dubai for a competition. Iranian authorities said they released the men after determining that they had accidentally wandered into the country's waters, the semi-official Fars news agency said. The sailors had told relatives that their boat became disabled and was hard to steer. Young said his son told him the group was tense when the Iranians first picked them up, but then everything was ""cool."" Another sailor said they were temporarily blindfolded. The men and their yacht were towed into international waters Wednesday, and representatives from the company that owns the boat, Sail Bahrain, met them to bring them ashore in Dubai. Early Wednesday, after receiving the call that his son, Luke, and his crewmates were going to be freed, Charles Porter spoke informally to reporters near his home. ""It was all fairly nerve-racking last night,"" the father said. He said the Foreign Office awakened the family at 5:30 a.m. to tell them the news. Watch the Porters describe getting the call . ""We've spoken to Luke,"" Porter said. ""He's very, very tired. He's been through a lot. He said that particularly the first couple of days were upsetting."" ""He got the feeling after a couple of days that they realized they weren't dealing with anything sinister,"" the father added. Luke Porter's twin sister, Jess, said she was ""absolutely over the moon [and] relieved to hear his voice. We're such a close family."" British authorities on Tuesday had asked for a speedy resolution in the case, after an Iranian official said the sailors could be dealt with severely if it was determined they had ill intentions. Young said it probably helped that the incident was kept low-key, without a lot of media fanfare. Andrew Pindar, Sail Bahrain chairman, said Tuesday evening that the men had had problems with the boat's propeller and that that might have caused them to drift into Iranian waters. The father of one sailor said the propeller had fallen off. Assuming that the five men might see Wednesday's news conference, one reporter asked the parents what they would say to their son. ""I would say don't get lost on your way to Dubai,"" Young said.","Sailors' parents hold news conference to thank all involved in release .

"(CNN) -- On February 12, 2009, Christopher Savoie received an e-mail from his ex-wife that he had feared would come. Christopher Savoie is in jail in Japan after trying to get back his son, Isaac, and daughter, Rebecca. About a month after their bitter divorce, in which Noriko Savoie promised as part of the agreement she wouldn't return to Japan with their children to live, she threatened to do just that. ""It's very difficult to watch kids becoming American and losing Japanese identity,'' Noriko Savoie wrote her ex-husband in the e-mail, according to Tennessee court documents. ""I am at the edge of the cliff. I cannot hold it anymore if you keep bothering me.'' Now she is in Japan with the children. Christopher Savoie sits in a Japanese jail accused of trying to kidnap them. He practically predicted it would end this way. The couple, citizens of the United States and Japan, were married for 14 years and lived in Japan. But they came to the United States with 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca. They divorced in January 2009 after Christopher Savoie was unfaithful. Noriko Savoie was given custody of the children and agreed to remain in the United States. During the divorce, Christopher Savoie was concerned that his ex-wife would move to Japan with the children. After receiving the threatening e-mail, he went to court to try to prevent that. He pleaded with a judge in March to stop Noriko Savoie from being able to travel to Japan for summer vacation. He knew if she took the children to Japan to live the deck would be stacked against him. Japanese law would recognize Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian and he might never see his children again. Noriko Savoie told a judge the words in her e-mail were in the heat of the moment; she was angry that her ex-husband had just married the woman who caused their marriage to end. ""I was very, very -- at the peak of my frustration ..."" Noriko Savoie told a judge, according to court transcripts. ""He actually married three days before that e-mail. He remarried the person -- a woman whom he was having affair [with], so I was very depressed and -- but also angry."" Noriko Savoie was asked repeatedly in court if she would try to take the children and flee to Japan. Her answer was always no. ""I have never thought about taking children away from their father, never,"" she told the judge. Christopher Savoie didn't believe her. Their divorce had been rocky, both of them said. The court documents reveal bitter fights and mediations during the divorce. The two accused each other of sending harassing e-mails. They also fought over sending the kids to baseball, Scouts and other activities. Noriko Savoie accused him of not giving her enough money to take English language lessons or go to school so she could get a job. He accused her of not trying hard enough to enroll or find a place to live.  Dad paid ex-wife $800K in divorce » . Despite those issues, Christopher Savoie said his only concern was making sure he wouldn't be separated from his children. He knew trying to get the kids back would be ""a futile effort"" if Noriko Savoie did flee with the children, according to court documents. He laid out in court a scenario similar to what he is facing. ""If she were to go to Japan with the children and with primary custodial rights, there's pretty much no doubt that I would have a very difficult time enforcing my rights to visitation should Noriko decide not to let the children see me,"" he said. He said he'd have a hard time paying expensive legal fees because most of his money was tied up in his house, car and 401(k) after he gave Noriko Savoie more than $700,000 as part of the divorce settlement. With that money, he feared she'd be able to move and hide the children from him. When appointed parental coordinators asked her if she planned to take the children to Japan, she hesitated and simply answered ""I think the kids will be happy if I'm happy."" The judge asked Noriko Savoie rhetorically whether she would be willing to put up money, essentially a bond, to ensure she'd return from Japan. She agreed, but was never asked to do so. Judge James G. Martin III warned Noriko Savoie she would lose her alimony, education funds and other money if she fled with the children, before ruling that he believed she wouldn't abscond with them and allowed her to travel to Japan. Noriko Savoie followed the court's rules and took the children on vacation and returned during the required time to the United States. But days later, she took the children back to Japan. The court in the United States granted Christopher Savoie full custody after Noriko Savoie fled the country. But that court order means nothing in Japan, where courts generally favor mothers in custody disputes. The couple is also still considered married in Japan, because they never divorced there, Japanese police said Wednesday. And, police said, the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports. A 1980 Hague Convention standardized laws on international child abduction, but Japan is not a party to that agreement. Christopher Savoie knew all this when he decided this week to go to Japan to get his children back. He took the children as Noriko Savoie walked them to school Monday in Yanagawa, a rural town in southern Japan. He headed for the nearest U.S. consulate, in the city of Fukuoka on the Southern island of Kyushu, to try to obtain passports for the children, screaming at the guards to let him in the compound. He was steps away from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil when he was arrested. Christopher Savoie, who will be in jail for the next 10 days while Japanese officials sort out the situation, told CNN's Kyung Lah that he was scared and just wanted to see his children. ""I love you, Isaac, Rebecca,"" he said. ""Your daddy loves you forever. I'll be patient and strong until the day comes that I can see you both again. I am very sorry that I can't be with you."" Though he had warned everyone this was going to happen, this time he could speak in certainties. He said that though he knows it might be a tough battle, it's one he will continue to vocalize. ""I want Americans to know what's happening to me,"" Christopher Savoie said in Japanese. ""I didn't do anything wrong.""","After bitter divorce, Noriko Savoie threatened in e-mail to take kids back to Japan .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Four militants armed with guns and grenades stormed a mosque in Rawalpindi frequented by military personnel, killing dozens of people Friday -- most of them children, the military said. The attack is the latest to shake the garrison city since this year's launch of strong military offensives against Taliban insurgents in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan. Rawalpindi is the headquarters of the Pakistani army. Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said Friday's assault killed 36 people and wounded 75. Among the dead were 17 children, according to the military's Web site. Also killed were an army general and eight other military officials, six of them of senior rank. The remaining fatalities were adults. ""As soon as the mosque's security staff checked me, there was a blast and then a finger hit me, then there was another,"" Ishtiaq, a driver for a military officer, told GEO TV. Ishtiaq, who uses only one name, was attending midday prayers. Rawalpindi is near Islamabad, and the mosque is near national army headquarters. It is located inside a walled residential compound where many military families have homes. A witness told GEO TV there were up to 300 worshippers at the mosque at the time of the attack. The militants hurled grenades before opening fire, Rawalpindi Police Chief Aslam Tareen told CNN. He said all the militants died, but he doesn't know how. ""These are not militants,"" Abbas said. ""These are terrorists who killed innocent worshippers."" Retired Gen. Muhammad Yousaf was killed in the attack, said Col. Baseer Haider, a military spokesman. He said Yousaf was a former vice chief of army staff who was second in command during the administration of President Pervez Musharraf. Abbas said two of the attackers were suicide bombers who blew themselves up inside the Parade Lane mosque; the other two were shot and killed by security forces outside the mosque. Several explosions were heard inside the mosque around 1:30 p.m. (3:30 a.m. ET), followed by gunfire, Abbas said. The militants entered the compound by climbing over a wall, Tareen said. This is the first attack in Rawalpindi since a suicide bomber targeted a bank on November 2. On October 10, militants stormed army headquarters in Rawalpindi, taking several people hostage before security forces killed them.

"Romulus, Michigan (CNN) -- A Nigerian man is ""talking a lot"" to the FBI, said a senior U.S. official, after what the United States believes was an attempted terrorist attack on an inbound international flight. The initial impression is that the suspect was acting alone and did not have any formal connections to organized terrorist groups, said the senior official who is familiar with the investigation. The suspect, identified by a U.S. government official as 23-year-old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, ignited a small explosive device Friday, shortly before a Northwest flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, made its landing in Detroit, Michigan. With the aid of the cabin crew, another passenger quickly helped subdue and isolate Abdulmutallab, passenger Syed Jafry told CNN. Abdulmutallab, was placed in custody and is being treated for second- and third-degree burns on his thighs, according to federal law enforcement and airline security sources. The sources told CNN that the suspect flew into Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam on a KLM flight from Lagos, Nigeria, and is not believed to be on any ""no fly"" list, although his name does appear in a U.S. database of people with suspect connections. He did not undergo secondary security screening in Amsterdam, an administration official said. The administration official said there was no evidence that Abdulmutallab was a hard-core, trained member of al Qaeda. Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian national, claimed to have extremist ties and said the explosive device ""was acquired in Yemen along with instructions as to when it should be used,"" a federal security bulletin obtained by CNN said. The remains of the device used are being sent to an FBI explosives lab in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis, security sources said. U.S. President Barack Obama, who is spending the holidays in his home state of Hawaii, was briefed on the incident during a secure phone call with aides, and instructed in a subsequent discussion with security advisers ""that all appropriate measures be taken to increase security for air travel,"" White House spokesman Bill Burton told CNN. The president made no changes to his schedule, Burton said. The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement Friday saying that air passengers ""may notice additional screening measures put into place to ensure the safety of the traveling public on domestic and international flights."" Passengers described the brief moments of panic on board, as screams erupted and flight attendants ran for fire extinguishers. Jafry, who was sitting in seat 16G, said the plane was just beginning to descend when passengers heard a pop. ""Everybody got a little bit startled,"" he said. ""After a few seconds or so ... there was ... kind of a flamish light and there was fire"" and people around the immediate area began to panic. One woman told CNN affiliate WDIV that a man threw a blanket over Abdulmutallab's legs to help put out the small fire. ""It was terrifying,"" Richelle Keepman said. ""I think we all thought we weren't going to land, we weren't going to make it."" Passenger Elias Fawaz told WDIV that the explosion sounded ""like a balloon being popped"" and said he could smell smoke. Jafry said the incident was under control within minutes, crediting the crew and nearby passengers for the rapid response. One person was taken to the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, hospital spokeswoman Tracy Justice said. ""All passengers have deplaned and out of an abundance of caution, the plane was moved to a remote area,"" where the plane and baggage were rescreened, the Transportation Security Administration said in a statement. Passengers were interviewed by law enforcement authorities before being allowed to leave the airport. No other suspicious materials were found on the plane or in luggage, the law enforcement and airline security sources said. The suspect had only carry-on luggage. Another passenger on the Northwest flight transferred from the same KLM flight in Amsterdam but officials found no connection between the two, the sources said. The plane, an Airbus 330, landed shortly before noon ET. It was carrying 278 passengers. Delta is the parent company of Northwest.

"Santiago, Chile (CNN) -- Three strong earthquakes rocked Chile on Thursday, causing significant damage in at least one city, the country's newly inaugurated president said Thursday. A 6.9-magnitude earthquake hit at 11:39 a.m. local time (9:39 a.m. ET), followed by a 6.7-magnitude quake 16 minutes later, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. A third, measured at magnitude 6.0, came 27 minutes later. They were the strongest aftershocks to rattle Chile since a February 27 earthquake on the country's west coast that toppled buildings and spawned a tsunami, killing several hundred people. Thursday's quakes shook the ground near Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins near the coast just as Chile prepared to inaugurate a new president, Sebastian Pinera. The central Chilean city of Rancagua was affected, Pinera said. ""There is significant damage in Rancagua,"" the new president said. ""We're going to send the necessary armed forces to guarantee citizens' safety."" Rancagua Mayor Eduardo Soto said that no fatalities were immediately reported and that the biggest worry was damage to homes, CNN Chile reported. After his inauguration Thursday, Pinera visited Rancagua, where he confirmed there were no initial reports of fatalities. He said that no curfew would be imposed for now and reiterated his call for calm. A priority is for the school year to start as scheduled next week, he said. He also said Thursday afternoon that he would declare the area a catastrophe zone. The country's national emergency authorities also put in place a tsunami alert for the coastal area near where the earthquakes hit, and authorities ordered evacuations of some coastal areas. ""I don't want to alarm anyone, [the alert] is solely precautionary, but we have to take precautions when there are human lives at risk,"" Pinera said. The epicenter of Thursday's first quake was about 95 miles (152 km) south-southwest of the capital, Santiago, and about 90 miles (145 km) away from Valparaiso, where Pinera was to be inaugurated. Television footage showed the inauguration proceeding without a hitch. A second earthquake -- with an initial magnitude of 6.9 -- struck moments later. It was about 89 miles (143 km) southwest of Santiago, the USGS said. The third was about 86 miles (138 km) southwest of Santiago. Rolando Santos, senior vice president and general manager of CNN Chile, said he and his colleagues felt one of the quakes. ""I can tell you within our newsroom in Santiago, which is state of the art in terms of seismic construction, it shook for more than 45 seconds,"" he said. He said that he told staffers to get under desks and that three people burst into tears. In the last two days, people had kind of gotten used to aftershocks, but ""there was no question this one got everyone's attention,"" he said. Are you there? Send pictures . Pinera, a conservative billionaire businessman, became the Chilean president about 12:15 p.m. local time, roughly 20 minutes after the second quake. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said in a statement that ""a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami is not expected"" as a result of the quakes, and that there is no tsunami threat to Hawaii. However, the center also said that ""earthquakes of this size sometimes generate local tsunamis that can be destructive along coasts located within"" about 62 miles (100 km) of the epicenter. Hundreds of people were killed when the magnitude-8.8 earthquake struck Chile's west coast February 27. That quake also triggered a tsunami that toppled buildings, especially in the coastal Maule region. How to help: Impact Your World . Authorities this week released the names of 279 people whose bodies had been identified in the quake, but officials said the new tally does not include hundreds of unidentified victims. The February 27 earthquake was violent enough to move the Chilean city of Concepcion at least 10 feet to the west and Santiago about 11 inches to the west-southwest, researchers said.","NEW: President Sebastian Pinera says there's no curfew for now and reiterates call for calm .

"Santiago, Chile (CNN) -- Sebastian Pinera was sworn in Thursday as president of Chile, taking over a country battered by a recent earthquake but with a strong economy and stable social institutions. Pinera, 60, succeeded Michelle Bachelet, a popular president who steered the country through the global economic downturn and promoted progressive social reforms. Pinera, a billionaire, is the first conservative to lead Chile since the fall of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's military dictatorship in 1990. Educated in Chile and at Harvard University in the United States, Pinera is an economist, investor, businessman and former senator. Bachelet, a liberal, defeated Pinera in the presidential elections in 2005. She endorsed Pinera's opponent in a runoff election in January. But Pinera said recently that responding to the earthquake requires the country to transcend partisan differences. ""These are times when we have to act with a sense of national unity,"" he said. ""It is not the time for conflict between government and opposition."" The 8.8-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami February 27 killed more than 500 people and affected up to 2 million. A 7.2-magnitude temblor struck Thursday as dignitaries were filing into the congressional hall in Valparaiso for the transfer of presidential power. Under Chile's constitutional term limits, Bachelet could not run for a second consecutive four-year term. ""I leave sad because of the pain of our people but with my head held high,"" a teary-eyed Bachelet said in a brief farewell address from the La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago, Chile's capital. ""I leave proud of what we have been able to build as a nation, of the role we have played. ""I leave, above everything else, very proud of the country we are.""","Sebastian Pinera, 60, succeeds Michelle Bachelet .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House said it had no comment Monday in response to the upcoming release of a new Michelle Obama action-figure doll. The Michelle Obama doll is available in three outfits, all of which show off her trademark bare arms. The 6-inch doll is made by New York toymaker Jailbreak Toys and is set for release on November 20, but the company began work on the new product six or seven months ago, according to Jason Feinberg, Jailbreak Toys' 32-year-old founder. ""The entire political scene was a little rosier at the time,"" Feinberg said in a phone interview, ""But what was really apparent was the country, and really the world at large, were very enamored of this lady."" Feinberg, whose company began selling a Barack Obama action-figure doll in mid-2008, said that Michelle Obama's ""energy"" was ""muted, subdued, classy"" coming out of last year's campaign while her husband's image was much more like that of a superhero. The new Michelle Obama doll is available in three outfits: the purple dress worn when the Obamas shared their famous fist bump during the campaign, the red and black dress she wore on Election Night and the black-and-white floral dress she wore during an appearance on ""The View."" All three dolls show Michelle Obama in a sheath dress and with bare arms, attributes that have become personal trademarks during her tenure as first lady. Feinberg said his target audience for the new doll is not children but adults ""who collected toys as a child, who haven't lost that kind of whimsical enthusiasm."" Like Jailbreak's Barack Obama doll, the new Michelle Obama doll will retail for $12.99, according to Feinberg. Katie McCormick Lelyveld, a spokeswoman for the first lady, said in an e-mail to CNN that the White House had no comment on the new doll. When the company behind Beanie Babies began selling dolls named ""Marvelous Malia and Sweet Sasha"" soon after Inauguration Day, the White House had a swift and strong reaction. ""We feel it is inappropriate to use young private citizens for marketing purposes,"" the first lady's spokeswoman said at the time.","The 6-inch doll is made by New York toymaker Jailbreak Toys .

"Barcelona's recent defensive problems have increased further with the news that French international Eric Abidal faces up to two months out of action because of an injury to his left leg. Abidal collected an abductor muscle problem in training, meaning he joins fellow-defenders Rafael Marquez, Dani Alves, Gerard Pique and midfielder Yaya Toure on the sidelines for the Primera Liga trip to Atletico Madrid this weekend. Barcelona confirmed the news on their official Web site, with a statement adding: ""After medical tests, which were carried out in Barcelona, the medical team confirmed that Abidal was suffering a disinsertion of the adductor in his left leg."" As well as Saturday's match, Abidal will be absent from both legs of the Champions League last 16 showdown against Stuttgart, while he will also miss a host of key Spanish league fixtures. Marquez and Pique are banned this weekend after their recent dismissals against Getafe, while Alves is suffering from a calf injury. Toure is sometimes deployed by Barca coach Pep Guardiola as an emergency defender, but the Ivory Coast international has a leg injury which will rule him out of action for two weeks.","French defender Eric Abidal faces two months out because of a left leg injury .

"(CNN) -- Archie Manning: Super Bowl XLIV is Sunday in Miami, Florida. The New Orleans Saints will face the Indianapolis Colts, and it's the first time the Saints have been in the Super Bowl in the team's four-decade history. Archie Manning is in an interesting situation. The quarterback was drafted by the Saints in 1971, and was hands-down the most famous and revered Saint, staying with them for ten years. He still has a home in New Orleans, Louisiana. Now his son, Peyton Manning, quarterback of the Colts, will face his father's old team, the team he grew up rooting for. Archie Manning and his wife, Olivia, raised three football-playing sons. Cooper, an all-state high school wide receiver and now a partner in an investment firm; Eli, who led the New York Giants to their Super Bowl win two years ago; and Peyton, who did the same for the Colts the year before that. Eli and Peyton both won MVP awards. A few weeks ago, Mike Chappell in the Indianapolis Star reported that Archie Manning said he plans to root for the Colts. ""I'm going to pull for my son,"" Archie said. ""(Saints coach) Sean Payton knows that. He's a great friend of mine. (Saints quarterback) Drew Brees knows that. That's just the way it is. Anybody who thinks it's different must not have children."" Indy Star: Saints legend Archie Manning pulling for son, Colts . Robert Park: North Korea said Friday it was releasing the Korean-American missionary detained after reportedly illegally entering the country in December, state-run media reported. Tyong Park, Robert Park's father, said in San Diego, California, that he was ""so excited"" by the news but had no other information about his son's release. Robert Park told relatives before Christmas that he was trying to sneak into the isolated communist state to bring a message of ""Christ's love and forgiveness"" to North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. After an investigation, North Korean authorities ""decided to leniently forgive and release him, taking his admission and sincere repentance of his wrong doings into consideration,"" the state-run Korea Central News Agency said. During an interview with North Korean authorities, Park reportedly told investigators that ""he was taken in by the false rumor spread by the West and committed a criminal act in the end."" Park said he heard stories of concentration camps and of mass killings, prompting him to go to North Korea to help, the news agency said. A South Korean Web site in December posted a copy of the letter it said Park was trying to deliver to Kim, urging the North Korean leader to free political prisoners and ""open your borders so that we may bring food, provisions, medicine, necessities, and assistance to those who are struggling to survive."" But according to the North Korean news agency, once Park was in North Korea he said he was treated well and allowed to attend church and pray freely. CNN: N. Korea says it is releasing U.S. citizen . Joe Lombardi: He's the grandson of legendary New York Giants and Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi. The Los Angeles Times reports that Joe Lombardi, 38, never met his famous grandfather; he was born a year after his death in 1970. Lombardi, the quarterbacks coach for the New Orleans Saints, told the newspaper that he had seen a quote from his grandfather saying he wished he had never said ""Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing,"" and that he feels Vince was misinterpreted. ""I think his point was that certainly your goal is to win, but it's the process that you take in order to get there, the will to win, the will to prepare -- doing everything in your control in order to put yourself in position to win at anything. And I think that's what his point was, more so than win at all costs, even if you've got to cheat or cut corners,"" Joe Lombardi told the Los Angeles Times. L.A. Times: Saints have a Lombardi, and now they want a trophy . Jenny Sanford: ""Staying True"" by Sanford, who in December filed for divorce from South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, will be available in bookstores Friday. Reporters exposed the governor's affair with an Argentine woman after he disappeared for several days last summer. Staffers said he was hiking the Appalachian Trail. Sanford later admitted he was actually in Argentina with his mistress. Rather than standing by their men, wives of morally challenged politicians are now publicly opting to let their husbands clean up their own messes. That is one reason why former investment banker Jenny Sanford wrote her book, publisher Ballantine Books says on its Web site. ""She chose to let Mark Sanford deal with the embarrassment and political fallout from his own actions while focusing her own efforts privately on raising their children to be men of character, even in the face of the lies their father has told,"" says the synopsis of her book on the site. CNN: Silent no more, wives go public about husbands' affairs . D.A. Powell: Claremont Graduate University in Southern California announced this week that D.A. Powell has won the $100,000 Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award for his book ""Chronic."" Powell teaches at the University of San Francisco and lives in the Bay Area of California. According to the Poetry Foundation, Powell was born in 1963 in Albany, Georgia. When he was teaching at Sonoma State, he noticed that many of his students wrote poems that somehow fit the size of the page they were working on, so he began experimenting with his students. What difference would it make if words were written on a candlestick or a roll of toilet paper? When he wrote the first poem for his book, ""Tea,"" he turned his legal pad sideways and began writing longer lines of poetry. Powell receives his prize this April. Here's an excerpt from his poem, ""Chronic:"" I carry the same baffled heart I have always carried / a bit more battered than before, a bit less joy / for I see the difficult charge of living in this declining sphere / by the open air, I swore out my list of pleasures: / sprig of lilac, scent of pine / the sparrows bathing in the drainage ditch...""

There are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news. Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story. But every day, there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character, how they reached their decision, how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in. They arouse our curiosity. We hear about them and want to know more. What they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country. At times, there is even a mystery about them. What they have done may be unique, heroic, cowardly or ghastly, but they capture our imaginations. We want to know what makes them tick, why they believe what they do, and why they did what they did.

"Rome, Italy (CNN)  -- The Italian government plans to participate in the international troop buildup in Afghanistan by sending 1,000 more troops there next year. The Italian Defense Ministry confirmed the troops would be deployed in the second half of 2010, a complement to the nearly 2,800 Italians already in the western part of the country. Italy is one of 43 countries serving under the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. Based in Herat, the Italian military is the lead nation in ISAF's Regional Command West. 22 Italian service members have been killed in the Afghan conflict. The Italian escalation would be part of the troop buildup of 5,000 extra non-U.S. service members ISAF intends to commit to the country. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has said that new troop pledges could be announced at a conference of NATO foreign ministers Thursday and Friday in Brussels, Belgium, where the alliance is based. There are currently 42,000 non-U.S. NATO troops in Afghanistan at present. 28 NATO allies and 15 non-NATO members are contributing to the U.S.-led coalition. The added NATO troop deployment would complement the nearly 100,000 Americans expected to be in the fight once the 30,000 troops U.S. President Barack Obama announced Tuesday night are in place.","Italy is one of 43 countries serving under the NATO-led ISAF contingent .

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- A defense lawyer for Amanda Knox -- accused in Italy of killing her roommate -- on Tuesday said the prosecution's theory doesn't fit the facts of the case and there is not sufficient evidence to find her guilty. Calling Knox a victim herself, Carlo della Vedova portrayed the Seattle, Washington, native as someone who fell victim to a rush to judgment by police following the murder, and who had to fend off a myriad of false media reports regarding the crime. Police declared ""case closed"" after an investigator saw Knox and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito sharing a ""flirtatious gesture"" at the crime scene. And in the months following the murder, della Vedova argued a slew of leaks to the media made things even worse. The lawyer showed photos of the crime scene that were published in the media that weren't authentic -- including a photo of the bathroom -- and said false allegations and rumors about Knox's character created a bias from the get-go. Della Vedova also questioned the change in what prosecutor Giuliano Mignini's said was the motive for the murder. In preliminary hearings he argued Knox, Sollecito and Rudy Guede slashed Kercher's throat during a sexual misadventure as the two men vied for Knox's attention. In recent days, della Vedova said Mignini focused more on what he says was a hatred between the two roommates. Defense lawyers have staunchly disagreed, claiming the two girls were friends. They argued that Guede, who was convicted in a separate fast-track trial and is currently appealing his conviction, was the sole killer and argued there is no evidence that ties the three people together or shows proof they planned her murder. Della Vedova also fixated during closings on the lack of evidence tying Knox to the crime scene. As defense lawyers have throughout the entire trial, he cast doubt on DNA evidence prosecutors claim shows Knox's DNA on the handle of the alleged murder weapon. The defense has claimed the knife doesn't match Kercher's wounds or an imprint of the knife left on a bed sheet. They also claimed the DNA sample is too small to attribute. Besides the knife, della Vedova claimed if there really was a struggle or argument in Kercher's room, then Knox's DNA would be all over the room. Citing forensic testimony from the trial, he argued that while traces of DNA from  other people were found in the room, not a single sample that can be traced back to Knox was found. He stressed too, that Sollecito and Knox are not the kind of people they have been portrayed as, noting that the couple met at a classical music concert and aren't the typical ""sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll"" couple they have been labeled. During the first day of closings for Knox's lawyers, della Vedova stressed to the eight-member jury that they should also keep church law in mind as they decide whether to find Knox and Sollecito guilty or not guilty. He told the jury they needed to be ""morally certain of their decision."" ""If you have the minimum of doubts, you must absolve this young girl,"" he said. ""A girl that is merely 22 years old."" Knox and Sollecito, who both deny any role in the murder, have been jailed for more than two years since they were arrested on charges of murder and sexual violence. Prosecutors have asked they be sentenced to life in prison if they are found guilty. Knox's other lawyer, Luciano Ghirga, will continue closings on Wednesday and the jury is expected to begin deliberations on Friday. CNN's Mallory Simon contributed to this report.","Carlo della Vedova questions evidence in case, says Amanda Knox should be found not guilty .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A Kurdish member of Iraq's parliament said Monday that the United States is pressuring the ""highest levels of the Kurdish leadership"" to accept a compromise that would dictate how national elections would be held in January. Mahmoud Othman said the United States urged the Kurdish majority in the northern oil-rich province of Kirkuk to agree to a proposal that would settle issues about the law that spells out how the election will be carried out. Vice President Joe Biden broached the issue of elections in telephone calls Sunday with Iraqi Kurdistan President Massoud Barzani and Speaker of the Parliament Ayad al-Samarrai'e, said Biden spokesman Jay Carney. ""In both calls, the vice president echoed the president's position that timely elections are important and that we urge all parties to do their part to make them happen,"" he said. A secure environment and political stability during and after the polls will be key as the United States looks to withdraw combat troops by August, leaving 50,000 in advisory roles, and then withdraw all U.S. forces by the end of 2011. Some Kurds have complained that the U.S. proposals would favor the province's Arabs and Turkmen, though it was not clear on what they based that assertion. Kurds have long regarded Kirkuk as an integral part of Kurdistan, and many want to be part of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region. Arabs and Turkmen have their claims to the city, and all the groups want their voices and votes to be fairly represented in the political system. Provincial elections that were to have been held in January were postponed indefinitely because officials there could not agree on how to apportion seats among the ethnic groups. Last week, the Kurds threatened to boycott voting on the election law, thereby threatening to delay the election itself, which is scheduled to take place January 16. The constitution would allow for a delay, but not past January 31. Iraq's election commission has said it needs at least 90 days after passage of any election law to prepare to carry out elections, which U.S. and Iraqi government officials call a vital step in Iraqi efforts to solidify a democratic system in the post-Saddam Hussein era. The head of Iraq's Independent High Electoral Commission, Judge Qassim Aboodi, said Monday that if the law is not passed within a few days, the elections could be threatened altogether. Othman described the U.S. efforts at pushing forward a compromise to the Kurds as being ""counterproductive"" and ""making things worse."" Though the proposal was submitted by the United Nations, Othman said, ""the U.S. is behind this."" He said the U.S.-backed plan was not fair and urged that U.S. officials remain neutral. Under Saddam's regime, Kurds were kicked out of Kirkuk, and many Arabs moved in, a policy called Arabization. But Kurds returned to the city in droves after the regime was toppled. Sharp disagreements exist over which voter registries should be used in the elections, with the Kurds wanting a current one and the Arabs and Turkmen wanting registries from several years ago. As for the lists, politicians disagree over the use of open lists that name candidates and closed lists that name parties. The law used in the 2005 election calls for a closed list. U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Christopher Hill and Gen. Ray Odierno, the top U.S. officials in Iraq, issued a statement Thursday urging lawmakers to decide that ""rules, procedures, and decisions"" for the election apply only to that vote. They argue that it should not set precedent ""for future political settlements related to Article 140, demographic change, disputed boundaries, or other contested issues,"" a specific reference to the Kirkuk question. Article 140 is the section of the country's constitution referencing the issue. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this story from Baghdad, Iraq.","Member of parliament says U.S. pushing for agreement on election law .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Another strong earthquake rocked Indonesia early Thursday as the Southeast Asian nation was reeling from an earlier jolt that killed more than 200 people. A resident stands next to building that collapsed onto a car in Padang, Indonesia, on Wednesday. The 6.8 magnitude quake Thursday hit southern Sumatra at 8:52 a.m. local time (0152 GMT), the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. Wednesday's earlier quake was 7.6 magnitude. At least 236 people are dead and more than 500 injured, the Indonesian Social Ministry's Crisis Center said Thursday. It said it had little information on the missing and feared the death toll would climb into the thousands. The second quake was on a smaller scale than the first, said meteorology official Fauzi, who uses only one name. There were no damage reports yet. Indonesian Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari expected ""the casualties and the damage of this earthquake to be bigger than the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake, given the intensity and the spread of the damage."" The magnitude-6.3 Yogyakarta quake in central Java in May 2006 killed more than 5,000 people, triggered fears of an eruption of a nearby volcano and caused significant damage to a 9th century Prambanan temple. Thousands may be trapped by collapsed buildings and houses, Rustam Pakaya, the head of the Health Ministry's crisis center, told CNN on Wednesday. State-run Antara news agency cited Pakaya as saying he had received reports that part of a hospital had collapsed and that people were buried under the debris. The temblor struck around 5 p.m., about 33 miles (53 kilometers) from Padang, the capital city of West Sumatra and home to more than 800,000 people. The quake caused widespread power and phone outages, making it difficult to assess damage. Aid agencies kicked into gear to help those in need. ""We had aid ready because this area of Indonesia is susceptible to this type of tragedy,"" said Jane Cocking, humanitarian director for Oxfam. ""Communications with the quake-zone are difficult and we are hoping for the best but having to plan for the worst."" ""The situation is quite devastating,"" said Amelia Merrick, the operations director for World Vision Indonesia. ""Bridges have gone down, phone lines are in total disrepair. It's difficult for us to assess the situation,"" she said. The organization had said it would send assessment teams to the area Thursday morning. ""We know there's no electricity tonight... many of the families will be spending the night outdoors, in pitch black. I'm very afraid of what might happen next,"" she said, referring to the possibility of aftershocks. Hundreds of houses have been damaged, Wayne Ulrich, the Red Cross disaster management coordinator in Indonesia, told CNN. ""We do not know the [exact] numbers."" ""We have concerns that a hospital has been partially damaged, a market has caught on fire, the airport was closed down for inspection because of the fear if they landed any planes,"" it might cause problems, Ulrich said.  Watch Ulrich discuss the rescue efforts » . Access to the affected areas was obstructed in parts, he added. It's ""blocked by all kinds of problems: frightened people out in the streets, cars, and people trying to get out of the city."" The earthquake was felt in nearby cities, such as Medan and Bengkulu, where people panicked and ran outside in search of higher ground, fearing a tsunami. But it was also felt as far away as Singapore and Malaysia. ""I did feel the tremor in office today somewhere between 5 - 6 p.m.,"" said Ratna Osman, who works in a single-story office building in Petaling Jaya, just outside Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur. ""I asked [a co-worker] if there's an earthquake somewhere -- either that or I was hallucinating."" ""At first, I thought the chair I was sitting on had a screw loose or something,"" Osman said. The region is accustomed to earthquakes, and locals have been taught to identify safe places in case of a tsunami, according to Sean Granville-Ross, the Mercy Corps country director for Indonesia. ""We hope that preparation is now paying off,"" he said. But if many homes have been destroyed, people may be spending the night with no shelter, he said. Earlier this month, an earthquake in West Java killed 57 people. Several buildings were damaged, Metro TV reported, and people were seen running out of their homes and toward the hills. One employee of a private company in Jalan Ahmad Yani, told Antara news agency that ""everybody panicked with some shouting 'earthquake.'"" TVOne pictures from the scene showed people milling around outside in the city. Phone lines were apparently down in many parts of Padang. Indonesia's Tempo Interactive, a media outlet based in Jakarta, had trouble reaching its correspondent in the West Sumatra city, according to journalist Purwani Diyah Prabandari. ""I hope it's just the cell phone connection,"" Prabandari told CNN. Indonesians trying to find out more about the quake flooded the Internet, including Twitter. Some expressed concern for relatives and friends in Padang. ""Dear God, please send down your angels to hug and protect my grandpa in Padang,"" said one Twitter post. The Web site for one of Indonesia's main newspapers, The Jakarta Globe, crashed for a while, partly as a result of the heavy traffic from people trying to find out about the quake, the paper said in a Twitter post. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued a tsunami watch for Indonesia, India, Thailand and Malaysia, but canceled it soon after. The temblor did generate a tsunami just under one foot high, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said.

The U.S. Geological Survey declined to say whether the two quakes were linked. ""The simple answer is we can't speculate on a connection,"" Carrieann Bedwell of the USGS told CNN.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An English-language immersion class failed Miriam Flores, her mother contended. A divided Supreme Court dismissed on Thursday a 17-year-old suit filed on behalf of English-deficient students. After two years of instruction in her native Spanish, Miriam entered the Nogales, Arizona schools' English Language Learner program as a third-grader. However, she continued to lag behind her classmates and was cited as a disruptive influence in the classroom because she often had to ask a fellow student for help. The girl's mother, also named Miram Flores, and other minority parents claimed school officials in Nogales, a border town about 70 miles south of Tucson, did not provide enough money to get English-deficient students up to speed in writing and reading comprehension. In 2000, a federal judge agreed, concluding Arizona violated the Equal Educational Opportunities Act, and ordering the state to rework its plan and increase funding. The English Language Learner (ELL) program was then placed under federal oversight. On Thursday, a divided Supreme Court dismissed the 17-year-old lawsuit, but ordered a federal judge to review whether Nogales officials are ""providing equal opportunities"" to mainly Spanish-speaking students in the community. Arizona maintained the federal court injunction delayed its plans to fix the system. It maintained it has provided enough resources to improve its ELL program, allowing it to end federal oversight. ""Injunctions of this sort bind state and local officials to the policy preferences of their predecessors,"" wrote Justice Samuel Alito for the majority. Some legislators claim a 2006 state law essentially eliminated long-standing funding inequities. But parents say officials continue to drag their feet when it comes to complying with an appropriate classroom model for non-English-speaking students. Arizona says it increased more than twofold the amount of money it spends per non-English-speaking pupil, and that it has complied with the No Child Left Behind Act, the sweeping public classroom accountability act passed in 2002 that ties federal education funding to improvements in measurable student achievement. The current dispute has pitted the GOP-led state legislature and the school superintendent against the Democratic governor and attorney general, along with civil rights and teacher groups. Alito said a federal law guaranteeing equal opportunity in public schools ""is a vitally important one, and our decision will not in any way undermine efforts to achieve that goal."" He added that if state officials ultimately prevail in their reform efforts, ""it will be because they have shown that the Nogales School District is doing exactly what this statute requires -- taking appropriate action to teach English to students who grew up speaking another language."" Alito was backed by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. But in a lengthy dissent -- parts of which were read from the bench -- Justice Stephen Breyer said the ruling was ""misguided,"" calling it ""a mistaken effort to drive a wedge between review of funding plan changes and review of changes that would bring the state into compliance with federal law."" He was backed by Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David Souter. The divided court seemed poised to issue a narrow ruling, fact-specific to the ELL plan in Nogales. But groups on both sides of the issue asked the high court for broader guidance on settling state-federal conflicts involving institutional reform mandates, especially those involving disadvantaged groups. Such political turf battles often end up in the courts, and can lead to decades of federal oversight, such as the fight over school desegregation beginning in the 1950s. Against that backdrop is the continuing fight over immigration and the responsibility of states to fund the education of illegal immigrants and their children. Miriam Flores is now an adult and a student at the University of Arizona. The cases are Horne v. Flores (08-289) and Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives v. Flores (08-294).","Supreme Court dismisses case that claimed schools failed English-deficient kids .

"(CNN)  -- A massive search and rescue mission continued late Friday for nine people who may have plunged into chilly Pacific water off the Southern California coast after a Coast Guard plane and a Marine helicopter collided. ""We're still in the search and rescue phase. We are not standing down from that at this point,"" Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Farris told reporters at a news conference. ""We have every hope that we'll be able to find survivors."" The search will continue, he said, ""Until I stop."" The Coast Guard plans to continue the search at least throughout Friday night and Saturday morning, Petty Officer Henry Dunphy of the San Diego Coast Guard told CNN. The Coast Guard C-130 plane and its seven crew members had been searching for a missing person when it collided Thursday with the Marine AH-1 Cobra helicopter, with a two-person crew, on a military training exercise, Farris said. None of the names of those on either aircraft has been released. A pilot reported seeing a fireball about 7:10 p.m. Thursday near the crash site. The crash occurred about 16 nautical miles (18 miles) off the coast, near San Clemente Island, said Cpl. Michael Stevens of U.S. Marine Air Station Miramar in San Diego. Helicopters, cutters and patrol boats, aided by the Navy, were scanning a 644-square-mile area for survivors, said Coast Guard Rear Adm. Joseph Castillo. Castillo earlier said an investigation ""to determine what exactly happened"" was beginning. The investigation will be done in ""lockstep"" with the Marine Corps, he said. A large debris field has been located, and debris has been collected, he said. ""The debris is what you'd expect, I think, from a midair collision,"" he said. The two Marines on the Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton chopper were one of four helicopter crews involved in the training exercise, Stevens said. The Coast Guard plane had been on a search mission for a couple of days before Thursday's crash. ""They were searching for a possible person in the water who was reported to have gotten in a dinghy and attempted to row to Catalina [Island],"" Farris said. ""We were searching in that area because of the drift that would have naturally occurred after that event."" With water temperatures in the 60s, Farris earlier Friday estimated survivability could be up to 20 hours. The missing person the Coast Guard members were searching for prior to the collision is still missing, Farris said. CNN's Sonya Hamasaki and Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","NEW: Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Farris: ""We're still in the search and rescue phase""

"(CNN) -- Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood was released on bail Thursday after being arrested on suspicion of domestic assault. The 62-year-old was arrested near his home in southern England on Wednesday and spent the night in police custody before being released. ""I can confirm that there was an incident last night and that Ronnie Wood was arrested,"" a spokesman for the musician said, adding that he did not have any further details. As the case is under investigation, police have said little. They have not stated who filed the assault complaint . Wood will face police questioning again in January. The assault charge follows Wood's highly publicized divorce last month from his wife of 24 years, Jo, on grounds of adultery. The divorce settlement set Wood back an estimated £6.5 million ($10.7 million). He and Jo have two children. Wood has reportedly been dating a 20-year-old Russian cocktail waitress, Ekaterina Ivanova, for a year.","Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood arrested Wednesday, accused of assault .

"West Point, New York (CNN) -- President Obama said Tuesday that the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan is part of a strategy to reverse the Taliban's momentum and stabilize the country's government. ""There is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the Taliban has gained momentum,"" Obama said at the U.S. Military Academy. ""Al Qaeda has not re-emerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9/11, but they retain their safe-havens along the border. ""And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population. ... In short, the status quo is not sustainable."" Obama said he'd begin sending the additional troops ""at the fastest pace possible"" starting in early 2010 ""with a goal of starting to withdraw forces from the country in July 2011."" The president said additional U.S. forces bolstered by NATO troops ""will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces."" Senior administration officials said Tuesday that Obama has a goal of withdrawing most U.S. forces by the end of his current term, which ends in January 2013. Watch what the new troops will do in Afghanistan . It will be the second increase of U.S. forces in the war-torn Islamic country ordered by Obama since he took office in January. In his speech Tuesday, Obama said his strategy had three objectives: . • Deny al Qaeda a safe haven . • Reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow Afghanistan's government . • Strengthen Afghanistan's security forces and government . The additional troops was one way to achieve these, he said. Other strategies will include holding Afghan government leaders accountable for corruption, focus assistance on areas that could help the lives of Afghans, and securing the country's border with Pakistan. ""We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border,"" Obama said. The president said he rejected the option of committing more forces for an undefined mission of nation-building without any deadlines. ""I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests,"" Obama said. ""Furthermore, the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan."" Obama rejected analogies with the war in Vietnam that divided America in the 1960s and 1970s. ""Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action,"" Obama said. ""Unlike Vietnam, we are not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border."" Obama said the U.S. has no interest in occupying Afghanistan. ""We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens,"" Obama said. ""And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate those who destroy; to strengthen those who build; to hasten the day when our troops will leave; and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner, and never your patron."" Obama spoke to an audience of West Point cadets, staff and guests in outlining his strategy that he has deliberated for months, meeting several times with his national security team. He recognized that some in the audience had fought in Afghanistan, and some would be deployed in the future. ""As your commander in chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of your service,"" he said. The additional U.S. forces ""will increase our ability to train competent Afghan security forces, and to partner with them so that more Afghans can get into the fight,"" Obama said. ""And they will help create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans."" Obama also said he is asking NATO allies to provide more troops, and that he is ""confident that there will be further contributions in the days ahead."" ""Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""Now, we must come together to end this war successfully. For what's at stake is not simply a test of NATO's credibility -- what's at stake is the security of our allies, and the common security of the world."" The new troop deployment would increase the total U.S. commitment to roughly 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, bolstered by more than 40,000 NATO forces. Obama, whom Republicans had accused of ""dithering"" over the decision, concluded the deployment needs to be accelerated to knock back the Taliban, the senior officials said. The push for a speedy deployment is surprising because White House officials who defended Obama's slow pace of coming to a decision had said the Pentagon wouldn't be able to get new troops to Afghanistan that quickly. A Pentagon official noted that, under the new strategy, Obama is ""trying to do it faster"" than the 12-month timeline initially requested by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan. McChrystal wrote in a report in August that a ""failure to gain the initiative and reverse insurgent momentum in the near-term (next 12 months) -- while Afghan security capacity matures -- risks an outcome where defeating the insurgency is no longer possible."" The Pentagon official said Obama's six-month timeline for sending the new troops is ""very aggressive"" and will be challenging for the military to fulfill. The official expressed confidence, however, that the military would successfully carry out the order. Opponents of an increased U.S. troop deployment complain that the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai is corrupt and an unreliable partner. Obama spoke to Karzai for an hour by videoconference Tuesday to discuss the deployment decision, according to a White House statement. ""The president also emphasized that U.S. and international efforts in Afghanistan are not open-ended and must be evaluated toward measurable and achievable goals within the next 18 to 24 months,"" the statement said. Share your views on Obama's Afghanistan decision . The decision to send the troops carries significant political risk for Obama, who will announce it nine days before he travels to Oslo, Norway, to accept the Nobel Peace Prize. His liberal base, which helped him win last year's presidential election, opposes another troop deployment to Afghanistan. In addition, the deployment, expected to cost an extra $30 billion a year, comes amid high unemployment as the economy emerges from a recession. That concerns Democrats and Republicans faced with competing domestic priorities such as health care reform and job creation. U.S.-led troops first invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network's September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The invasion overthrew the ruling Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory, but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught. Taliban fighters have since regrouped in the mountainous region along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other. Al Qaeda's top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region. The conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops.","30,000 troops to be deployed within six months, President Obama says .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- When the earth started to shake on January 12, Rocher Joseph-Michelet was in his tiny, one-room apartment, composing lyrics for the upcoming Carnivale in Port-au-Prince. He ran out the door to find an entire two-story building, crumbling and falling in his direction. ""They break down. I fell down, I was on my back,"" he said. In heavily-accented English, peppered with American slang, Joseph-Michelet described how he was all-but buried under the rubble... and then rescued by members of his hip-hop group. ""Thanks to God, thanks to my friends,"" he said. ""I'm so proud it's them come to save me."" Joseph-Michelet is better known by his stage name ""MRJ."" He is a member of a neighborhood hip-hop group called Sekte Atis Lib, or S.A.L. They are six childhood friends from the same poor neighborhood who rap in Creole. MRJ escaped the earthquake with minor injuries. Many other residents of his neighborhood weren't so fortunate. ""Two days after the disaster, we [carried] 39 dead bodies... from here to the central cemetery,"" said Gaby Guerrier, the manager of the band. He spoke while standing on a rooftop which offered a view of a devastated urban landscape of collapsed and dangerously sagging cinderblock apartment buildings. The members of S.A.L. have been forced to abandon their homes in this tightly-packed community of concrete houses and narrow alleyways. ""It's too dangerous, nobody wants to live in the houses again,"" said Guerrier's younger brother Panarothy, also known as the rapper named ""Next."" He led CNN on a tour, past a large wall mural showing S.A.L.'s name in jagged graffiti, to the sprawling, fetid camp where the band, their families, and some 4,500 other displaced Haitians now live. The artists have helped each other build crude shacks out of plywood and rusting metal sheeting, along a winding dirt alleyway they have playfully nick-named ""Big Man Street."" Twenty-one year old Geffrard Jonel, a.k.a. Fame, has already decorated the walls of his hut with posters of soccer teams and music groups. He said he and three others slept in the tiny room, along with some unwanted visitors. ""Rats!"" he yelled, to peals of laughter from the rest of the group. Despite the unbearable conditions, spirits among the band's members appeared remarkably high. ""If you get angry with it, you get angry at God,"" said the manager, Gaby Guerrier. ""We are not more important than those people who are dead. God just leave us alive. We thank him for that."" Perhaps because of this infectious optimism, 25-year-old ""Next"" has been appointed the leader of a camp association, representing all 4,500 residents. ""If I have a problem, I'll come to him,"" said one resident named Levi Lazard. ""Because he is the one that can make the people listen to him."" On the day CNN visited, Next and about ten other colleagues had just completed construction of a sandbag platform to house a large water bladder and distribution system donated by Irish aid organization Concern. Residents with buckets and jugs were already lining up for a taste of fresh water. ""We want to make the people, the survivors live better,"" Next explained. He then issued an appeal for other aid organizations to come and help the community. ""We need something else specially for the children,"" he said. ""We need to make a place for the children for education. There's no school. It's destroyed."" Three weeks after the earthquake, residents of this camp were stripping away vegetation and small trees from the surrounding area, and the air was thick with the sound of hammers and saws as people worked to construct new ramshackle homes. Before the earthquake, only one member of S.A.L. had a full-time job, working at a juice factory. The others were unemployed artists, filming music videos on shoe-string budgets, all victims of Haiti's impoverished economy. Since the disaster, these young men have carried corpses, cared for wounded friends and relatives, and become leaders of their displaced and desperate community. They are also trying write new lyrics, to explain this life-changing ordeal. ""This is a revolution of nature,"" said MRJ, who survived the two-story building collapse. MRJ and his colleagues then delivered a memorable a cappella performance amid shelters made of bed sheets and sticks where hungry children wailed. ""All the parks have become home to most,"" he chanted in Creole, as the sun set over smoking campfires. ""We have to mobilize to overcome this crisis. Hopefully now the system will reboot. The time for the people has come. Solving the problems will take time. But we're not going anywhere. We need to deal with this crisis at the grass roots.""","Members of rap group S.A.L. tell of life amid the rubble of Haiti .

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- A defense lawyer for Amanda Knox made an impassioned plea to the jury Wednesday as the high-profile case neared its conclusion. Knox is the American student accused of killing her British roommate, Meredith Kercher, at the villa they shared in Italy. ""We suffer at the memory of Meredith. But we look at the future of Amanda,"" Luciano Ghirga said in his defense summation. ""Meredith was my friend,"" he quoted Knox as saying, rejecting the notion that she hated her roommate, who was fatally stabbed in November 2007. Prosecutors say Kercher died during a twisted sex game in which Knox taunted Kercher, and two men -- Knox's then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 26, and acquaintance Rudy Guede -- sexually assaulted her. The prosecution says a knife found in Sollecito's house had Knox's DNA on the handle and Kercher's on the blade, among other pieces of evidence. But Ghirga rejected the accusations against Knox on Wednesday. He attacked the way police and prosecutors had treated the defendant, giving them a symbolic ""red card"" -- a referee's sign in soccer that a player is being expelled from the game for breaking the rules. Ghirga concluded an emotional oration -- sobbing as he came to the end -- by asking the judge and jury to acquit Knox, because her mother asked him to request it, because her family asked it. Knox's father, Curt, said Wednesday she had been a victim of ""character assassination,"" and expressed hope she would be found not guilty. Members of Kercher's family have declined repeated CNN requests for comment on the case. But prosecutor Giuliano Mignini accused the defense of ""lynching"" the Italian police who worked on the case. He defended the work of the police and the credibility of the prosecution witnesses as he responded to Ghirga's arguments Wednesday. And he called again for life sentences for Knox and Sollecito if they are found guilty. Italy does not have the death penalty. The jury is expected to begin deliberations on Friday, after the prosecution completes its summary. Another Knox attorney on Tuesday said the prosecution's theory doesn't fit the facts of the case and there is not sufficient evidence to find her guilty. Calling Knox a victim herself, Carlo della Vedova said the police had rushed to judgment following the murder, leaving Knox to fend off a myriad of false media reports regarding the crime. The lawyer showed photos published in the media, purportedly showing the crime scene, that weren't authentic -- including a photo of the bathroom -- and said false allegations and rumors about Knox's character created a bias from the start. Della Vedova also questioned the change in what prosecutor Mignini said was the motive for the murder. In preliminary hearings, Mignini argued Knox, Sollecito and Guede slashed Kercher's throat during a sexual misadventure as the two men vied for Knox's attention. In recent days, Mignini has focused more on what he says was a hatred between the two roommates. Defense lawyers have staunchly disagreed, claiming the two women were friends. Ghirga on Wednesday said the two had gone to a chocolate festival together days before Kercher was killed. The defense has argued that Guede, who was convicted in a separate fast-track trial and is currently appealing his conviction, was the sole killer.  The defense has said there is no evidence tying the three suspects together or proving they planned Kercher's murder. Della Vedova also focused during closing arguments on the lack of evidence tying Knox to the crime scene. As defense lawyers have throughout the entire trial, he cast doubt on DNA evidence that prosecutors claim shows Knox's DNA on the handle of the alleged murder weapon. The defense has said the knife doesn't match Kercher's wounds or an imprint of the knife left on a bedsheet, and the DNA sample is too small to be conclusive. During the first day of closing arguments for Knox's lawyers, della Vedova stressed to the eight-member jury that they should also keep church law in mind as they decide whether to find Knox and Sollecito guilty or not guilty. He told the jury they needed to be ""morally certain of their decision."" ""If you have the minimum of doubts, you must absolve this young girl -- a girl that is merely 22 years old,"" he said. Knox and Sollecito, who both deny any role in the murder, have been jailed for more than two years since they were arrested on charges of murder and sexual violence. Their trial began in January.

"(CNN) -- I asked a knowledgeable environmentalist earlier this week: ""How big a story is the CRU scandal in your community?"" ""The what?"" ""The e-mails hacked at the Climate Research Unit at [the British] East Anglia University?"" ""Ah."" He smiled. ""It says something that I didn't immediately recognize what you were talking about. I suppose on my side we'd take the same view that the Pentagon took of Abu Ghraib: a few bad apples on the night shift."" Meanwhile, on the right, the story is the biggest scandal since the leak of the Pentagon Papers. Seemingly unperturbed by the CRU embarrassment, President Obama will shortly jet to Copenhagen to pledge reductions in U.S. carbon emissions. The Democratic majority in Congress continues to work on a cap-and-trade bill. At the same time, Gallup has recorded an amazing 20 point drop since summer 2008 in the number of Republicans who believe that global warming is occurring. Among Republican conservatives, the drop is slightly smaller -- 13 points -- but that's because so few of them believed in the reality of global warming in the first place. It used to be said that we were all entitled to our own opinions, but not entitled to our own facts. No more. In modern America, we choose our facts to fit our opinions. Michael Barone drove this point home in a 2008 column for the magazine of the American Enterprise Institute: . Americans' views of the economy are increasingly a function of voting behavior or party loyalty, rather than the other way around. In early 2006, a time of vibrant economic growth, 56 percent of Republicans said the economy was excellent or good, while only 28 percent of independents and 23 percent of Democrats agreed. Maybe Republicans were just doing better than Democrats? No -- the partisan divergence held true among Republicans and Democrats even of the same income level. The same effect showed up in reverse in the 1990s. Under President Clinton, Democrats were more likely to assess the economy positively than were Republicans of the same income level. Media critics often blame cable, talk radio and blogs for isolating the public into self-satisfied information communities. And for sure, Fox News, MSNBC, Rush Limbaugh and the Daily Show have done good business serving niche markets. But it's a real question: What is cause and what is effect? Maybe customers always wanted to have their pre-existing opinions confirmed. Notice how often 19th century newspapers had names like the ""Clay County Whig"" or the ""Jacksonville Democrat."" What were these old county papers if not the Fox News and MSNBC of their day? The whole global warming debate has been distorted from the start by intellectual self-ghettoization. Suffused by self-righteousness, the East Anglian scientists felt entitled to twist the evidence and delete the counter-evidence.   iReport: Share your thoughts on climate change . But it also helped that they felt sure they would not be caught. They had defined their community in a way that excluded skepticism, that defined skeptics as the enemy, as liars, as Holocaust deniers. Private e-mails and documents allegedly from the servers at the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit, a world-renowned center on the study of climate change, are thought to have been leaked by hackers. Everything important about global warming remains disputed: . How fast is it happening? How much of it is attributable to human activity? How dangerous is it? How much should we pay to avert or mitigate it? Who should do the paying? How are to begin to reach conclusions if we cannot even agree on the rules of discussion? The most famous public document on global warming calls itself ""An Inconvenient Truth"" -- and yet that document itself is filled with untruths, on every subject from sea levels to polar bears. (The bears are doing fine, populations at record levels in the Canadian Arctic.) In his first book, ""Earth in the Balance,"" former Vice President Al Gore wrote that human consciousness itself may be the most important obstacle to environmental improvement. He spoke more accurately than he knew. The global warming controversy has been pervaded from the start by the human instinct to divide the world into ""us"" and ""them"" -- and then believe only the news we hear from ""us."" Global warming advocates can see this weakness in their opponents. It was the same weakness in themselves that led the advocates themselves to cheat and twist and betray scientific standards and public trust. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum says the global warming debate has been distorted by intellectual self-ghettoization .

"(CNN) -- An Australian pilot landed a company plane in the ocean off Darwin on Friday, in a water landing that prompted comparisons to last month's landing of a US Airways jet in New York's Hudson River. The Australian pilot has been compared to U.S. hero Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger, pictured above. The Australian pilot also encountered problems shortly after takeoff. The twin-propeller plane was carrying the pilot and five passengers when it went down shortly after leaving Darwin International Airport, said Neville Blyth, a senior transport safety investigator with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. All those aboard were unhurt and managed to walk to shore, he said. Pictures showed the men from the plane soaked and carrying bags and equipment as they walked through the water. ""It's essentially a good story,"" Blyth said. The ATSB is deciding whether to investigate, he said, and the cause of the incident is still unknown. The Piper Chieftain plane was on its way to the town of Maningrida, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Darwin, according to its owner, Australian information technology company CSG. Watch the plane ditch in Darwin Harbor » . ""We would like to congratulate the pilot following all emergency landing and evacuation procedures and his very professional handling of the situation,"" a CSG statement said. Darwin is in Australia's Northern Territory, on the coast of the Timor Sea. The city's airport is near the water. The plane's trajectory took it over the water, giving the pilot limited opportunities to ditch the plane on land, Blyth said. He said the ocean was a safer option for landing than the beach, where the firmness of the sand was unknown. ""Personally, I think the decision was appropriate,"" Blyth said.

"(CNN) -- The ""pregnant man"" who gave birth to a daughter earlier this year says he is expecting a second child. Thomas Beatie, a married man who used to be a woman, has told America's ABC News that after giving birth to Susan on June 29 he did not go back on the male hormone testosterone so he could have another baby. ""I feel good,"" he told ABC News' Barbara Walters. ""I had my checkups ... And everything is right on track."" Beatie, who lives with his wife Nancy in Bend, Oregon, said the baby is due on June 12. Beatie was born a woman but underwent hormone therapy before he was legally declared a man. He had a mastectomy but kept his female reproductive organs when he underwent a sex change in the late 1990s. He and Nancy decided they wanted to start a family and he underwent artificial insemination late last year. Walters said on her television talkshow, ""The View,"" that Beatie had revealed his second pregnancy to her during an interview for a documentary to air on U.S. television Friday night. Beatie spoke to Walters about Susan's birth, which was not via Caesarean section. Prior to her birth, he released a photo showing his bearded face and pregnant belly. It sparked a worldwide media frenzy.","""Pregnant man"" who gave birth to a daughter is expecting a second child .

"Washington (CNN) -- All Cedric wanted was lunch. A 14-year old student in a special education classroom in Texas, Cedric was living with a foster family because of a history of neglect, including malnutrition. But on this day in 2002, his teacher tried to punish him by withholding food, despite the abuse he had suffered as a young child. Cedric's teacher delayed his lunch for hours to discipline him for refusing to do his work. When he wouldn't comply, his teacher put him in a face down restraint and sat on him in front of his classmates. Cedric said repeatedly that he could not breathe. He died minutes later on the classroom floor. Cedric's tragic story isn't an isolated case in America's schools today. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, over the last 20 years there have been hundreds of allegations of school personnel using restraint and seclusion in abusive ways on children. It's happening disproportionately to students with disabilities, often at the hands of untrained staff. Many of these students bear haunting physical and emotional scars. And in a number of cases, students have died. It's difficult to believe, but there are no federal laws to prevent this from happening. Local newspapers recount bone-chilling stories of schoolchildren tied to chairs, or with their mouths taped shut, sometimes locked in dark closets, or pinned to the floor for hours at a time. If parents treat their kids this way, it's considered a criminal offense. But unlike in hospitals and other institutions that receive federal taxpayer funding, there are no federal protections against these abusive practices when they happen in schools. The Children's Health Act of 2000 regulates how and when restraint and seclusion can be used in medical settings and community facilities. But classrooms, where students spend the majority of their day, are exempt. In the absence of a federal standard, state protections for kids are all over the map. Many states have no regulations whatsoever. Children are left vulnerable and staff untrained. Restraint and seclusion techniques should be used only as a last resort, when someone is in imminent danger of physical injury and there are no alternatives. Without proper training, staff can be hurt and students, especially small children, are at risk. Yet the GAO and news reports confirm that these practices are used frequently, often as discipline, when students aren't physically aggressive. While there is no centralized reporting, data from the few states that do track incidents paints a troubling picture. In the 2007-2008 school year in California alone, the GAO reports, there were more than 14,300 cases of restraint, seclusion and other ""emergency interventions."" We don't know how many of these merited real emergencies. In one California case, Paige, a young girl with Asperger's syndrome, was restrained in class because she was wiggling her loose tooth. Her mother, who had never consented to physical interventions, had no idea restraint was regularly imposed until her daughter came home with bruises. As parents, when we send our children to school, we expect they will be safe from danger. And when the very people we entrust with our children's well-being inflict this type of abuse, it's not just the victims and their families who suffer. It hurts their classmates, who witness these terrifying events. It undermines the vast majority of teachers and staff who are trying to give students a quality education. It's a nightmare for everyone involved. The easy answer here would be to blame teachers. But it would be the wrong one. Ultimately, the root of this problem has been our system-wide failure to provide direction and enforcement. As long as school systems continue to lack the tools they need to create good policies and properly train staff, these incidents will continue. The solution is a balanced approach to make classrooms safe for students and teachers. With that goal in mind, on Wednesday we are introducing legislation to finally ensure that schools in every state have the resources they need to prevent inappropriate restraint and seclusion. Our bill would set minimum safety standards in schools, similar to the protections children already receive in other institutions, so that states can ensure appropriate school district policies. It would limit physical restraints or locked seclusion to situations involving imminent danger, and require staff to be trained in administering these practices. It would outlaw mechanical restraints, such as strapping kids to chairs, and prohibit restraints that restrict breathing. It will increase transparency and oversight, so we will finally know just how widespread these practices are, and provide the Secretary of Education with tools to enforce the law. And it would give schools the support they need to equip their staff to handle difficult situations in the most positive manner possible. In a time of deep partisan divide, some may wonder what prompted strange bedfellows -- a member of Democratic leadership and a member of Republican leadership -- to team up. It's as simple as this: Schools are places for our children to learn, grow, and thrive. As a nation we must do better. It's time to ensure that no child in this country suffers the same fate as Cedric. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of U.S. Reps. George Miller and Cathy McMorris Rodgers.","Reps. Miller and McMorris Rodgers say kids sometimes restrained abusively in schools .

"(CNN) -- Deposed Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya will not be reinstated as head of state, an overwhelming majority of the Honduran congress voted Wednesday. In an hours-long process, 111 lawmakers voted in favor of a motion not to return Zelaya to office. A majority of 65 votes in the 128-member body was required to reject his reinstatement. Zelaya was removed from office in a military-led coup on June 28 and replaced by congressional leader Roberto Micheletti. On Wednesday, lawmakers voted one by one and addressed the chamber as they cast their vote, making for a slow process. The vote was a key part of a U.S.-brokered pact that representatives for Zelaya and Micheletti signed October 29, giving Congress the power to decide Zelaya's fate. The United States expressed disappointment Thursday over the latest rebuff to its diplomatic efforts to end the political crisis in Honduras. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Arturo Valenzuela continued to call on the Honduran government to allow Zelaya's return and to create a unity government in the interim period before the new president takes office next month. ""We are disappointed by this decision since the United States had hoped the [Honduran] Congress would have approved his return,"" Valenzuela said in a conference call with journalists in Washington. ""Our policy since June 28 has been consistently principled. It has condemned the coup d'etat and continued to accept President Zelaya as the democratically elected and legitimate leader of Honduras throughout this political crisis."" The United States continues to call for Honduras to engage in national reconciliation and creation of a truth commission to investigate the crisis, in addition to the unity government. ""The absence of democratic, constitutional order is the unacceptable status quo,"" a senior U.S. administration official said on the conference call, remaining anonymous under the ground rules of the call and because of the sensitivity of the situation. ""The election is a step toward a day where Honduras will have an electorally legitimate government in place."" Zelaya, who says he does not recognize the election, also has said he would not accept the post even if Congress voted him back in. Accepting the job, he said, would legitimize the coup. Many nations said before the Sunday's election they would withhold recognition if Zelaya were not returned to power. Some countries, such as the United States, Colombia and Costa Rica, have said they will recognize Lobo. Others, such as Argentina, Brazil and Spain, have said they will not. Despite the diplomatic pressure from abroad, lawmakers were voting the will of the people, Congressman Juan Angel Rivera Tabora said. ""History will judge us, and I'm certain it will judge us positively,"" he said. ""Congress didn't make this problem. The problem came to us."" Those voting against Zelaya echoed those sentiments. After the coup, the same body voted to install Micheletti as interim president. Wednesday vote only happened because the agreement between the two sides called for it, many lawmakers repeated. Zelaya's supporters argued that the coup was an illegal act that only restitution could heal. Congress sought opinions from the nation's Supreme Court and other bodies before holding the vote. The court ruled last week that Zelaya cannot return to office without facing trial on charges that he acted unconstitutionally when he tried to hold a vote that could have led to the removal of presidential term limits. The Supreme Court ruled before the coup that the vote was illegal and Congress had forbidden it. The coup came on the day the term-limits vote was to have been held. Micheletti and his supporters have insisted that Zelaya's removal was a constitutional transfer of power, not a coup. But the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the European Union and most nations -- including the United States -- condemned the coup and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated immediately. He wasn't. Zelaya, who was flown out of the country while still in his pajamas on the day of the coup, has been staying at the Brazilian Embassy in Honduras' capital since secretly returning to the country September 21.","111 of 128 lawmakers vote against reinstating ousted leader Jose Manuel Zelaya .

"(CNN) -- The H1N1 virus has been confirmed in a sample taken from a pig that was displayed at the Minnesota State Fair, the first time the virus has been found in a U.S. pig, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday. The Department of Agriculture quickly issued a statement saying the food supply is safe. ""We have fully engaged our trading partners to remind them that several international organizations, including the World Organization for Animal Health, have advised that there is no scientific basis to restrict trade in pork and pork products,"" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in the statement. ""People cannot get this flu from eating pork or pork products. Pork is safe to eat."" The announcement came three days after health officials announced that three pigs that were displayed during the fair had tested positive in a preliminary test for the H1N1 flu virus. Final results on the other two pigs have not been announced. ""This, of course, may be the first indication that it is present in some swine here in the United States,"" Gene Hugoson, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, told reporters in a conference call on Friday. The U.S. Department of Agriculture National veterinary services laboratories conducted the confirmatory testing on the sample collected at the fair, held in Saint Paul, Minnesota, between August 26 and September 1. Further testing is ongoing. The pigs sampled showed no signs of sickness and were apparently healthy, the officials said. The samples collected were part of a joint University of Iowa and University of Minnesota research project funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine whether animals at such events had the infection. ""Like people, swine routinely get sick or contract influenza viruses,"" Vilsack said. The misconception that the virus, sometimes called the swine flu, could be contracted through eating pork has hurt sales of the meat in the wake of the expanding pandemic. This year's crowd of 1.79 million attendees was a record. Though an outbreak of H1N1 was reported among a group of 4-H'ers who had attended the fair, officials said it was unlikely they contracted the virus from the animals, since few of them had contact with the pigs. The report came as no surprise to experts, since herds in other countries, including Argentina, Canada, Ireland and Norway, have been infected with H1N1. Pigs that do get sick with H1N1 typically recover from it, the officials said. The officials said the display animals likely were sent to slaughter. Even if they were slaughtered while still infected, that would not be an issue for anyone eating the meat, said Dr. Jeff Bender, co-director of the University of Minnesota Center for Animal Health and Food Safety. ""This virus is not in muscle tissue, so if these animals were slaughtered or processed there would be no risk to the public."" A vaccine to protect swine from H1N1 is under development but is not yet commercially available, one official said.","First time the virus has been found in a U.S. pig, Department of Agriculture says .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- A 19-year-old prostitute working in an apartment that doubles as a brothel said she has up to eight clients a day. A woman awaits customers at a Beijing barber shop in 2008. Sex workers also ply their trade in barber shops. Working in the southern boom city of Shenzhen, a special economic zone just north of Hong Kong, she told CNN she worries about getting AIDS, but has her own prevention measures. ""I always use condoms or take an injection. The medicine can prevent sexually transmitted diseases,"" she said. ""Some girls do not use prevention measures, but we don't talk about that in public."" This young woman, who would not give her name, is part of a group that Chinese and international health authorities are concerned could potentially spread HIV and AIDS in the world's most populated country, so officials have stepped up efforts to educate them about the virus and dispel misconceptions about so-called ""injections"" that can prevent infection. ""I think sex work is probably one of the most important factors for the potential of HIV spreading in Asia and also in China. There is no doubt about it,"" said Bernhard Schwartlander, UNAIDS China Country Coordinator. ""One of the things that we have seen in China is that knowledge about HIV/AIDS is very low in the general population and certainly also in the sex work industry. That is a big, big problem,"" Schwartlander said. It is estimated that some 700,000 people are living with HIV in China and there are about 50,000 new infections every year, according to the Chinese government and UNAIDS. The U.N. agency believes a significant number of those new infections include sex workers. Prostitution is officially illegal in China, but very loosely addressed by the government. It is estimated that there are between two and four million sex workers in China. As the country's economy has boomed, so has the sex industry, especially in prosperous cities like Shenzhen. Many clients flock there from Hong Kong which is just an hour away, some of them businessmen with money to spend. Condom use in China can range anywhere from about 20 percent to 80 percent, according to UNAIDS. ""There are misconceptions. People think that they can avoid HIV infections by taking a pill. People think that they are not at risk for HIV infections because they don't know anybody (who has it), because you can't see it, you can't touch it. And clearly, this is something that we have to change very rapidly,"" Schwartlander said. Historically, HIV and AIDS have been taboo topics in China, another reason awareness can be so low. Prevention in the gay community has also been difficult because of traditional stigmas against homosexuality. But the Chinese government is now conducting educational campaigns to inform higher risk groups, including sex workers, about how to prevent the transmission of HIV. ""After years of these campaigns, we found out through survey that condom use is constantly increasing, especially in urban areas, the condom use can reach 70 percent or even up to 80 percent,"" said Hao Yang, Deputy Bureau Chief of the Chinese Health Ministry's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau. But other areas are proving difficult. In rural parts of the country, the proportion of condom use among sex workers is less than 50 percent, Hao said. ""When we go to investigate in rural areas, the proportion of people with this knowledge (of AIDS prevention) is still very low,"" he said. ""In addition to that, the proportion of change in their activities is also very low, which means that the condom use rate is still low."" About one in 200 sex workers nationwide currently has HIV, Schwartlander said. But in one part of Yunnan province in the country's far southwest, seven percent of the sex workers -- or as many as 14 in every 200 -- have HIV, according to UNAIDS. ""The sex workers living in remote areas and rural areas have played an important role in AIDS spreading. We do not have a precise figure for the proportion that sex workers make up in it (the spread of AIDS), but we can say that they are making up a significant proportion,"" Hao said. The government has a long-term plan to educate the general public and to strengthen intervention in the high-risk populations, particularly sex workers, Hao said. When HIV initially began to spread in China, infections were concentrated among people who injected drugs, Schwartlander said. Campaigns among this group have been effective, while infections among other groups have risen. One of those groups, Hao said, was men having sex with men, which accounts for 5.9 percent of infections, according to the Chinese Health Ministry. A majority of the infections are concentrated among drug users, men having sex with men, and sex workers and their clients, Schwartlander said. ""Society and communities have been able to curb the spread of HIV, also in sex work, and that is what we have to do,"" Schwartlander said. As China's economy grows, it is likely the sex industry will as well. Current estimates show that some 30 to 50 million people are at significant risk for HIV infection, Schwartlander said. ""China is a society which is in quite a significant transition. There is a huge increase in disparity of income between the rich and the poor, and all these are very well-known factors that drive the sex industry forward,"" Schwartlander said. ""Clearly, in China, I think that the sex industry is a rising industry. We will see an increase in the number of sex workers due to these factors in the future."" A 22-year-old prostitute in Shenzhen, who did not want to give her name, said she knows the risk but needs the work. ""AIDS is the number one killer for my job. I cannot let this disease destroy my life. This is only a short-term business. I don't have any relatives in Shenzhen and can't borrow any money. I can only rely on myself.""","Some people in China believe injections or a pill can prevent infection .

"Mecca, Saudi Arabia (CNN)  -- The Hajj, an obligatory pilgrimage for Muslims, began this year on Wednesday with two twists: thinner crowds and heavy rain. A rare rainstorm inundated pilgrims in the city of Mina, flooding tents and making conditions miserable for the 2.5 million pilgrims performing the ancient rituals, according to Isha Sesay, CNN's correspondent there. The tents, where pilgrims plan to spend the night in prayer and contemplation, were leaking and flooding, giving rise to fears of disease, Sesay reported. She said, however, that the several hours of rain was not likely to stop any of the pilgrims from performing the rituals. ""They've saved for years to get here,"" Sesay reported. ""This is a blessing. They're not going to let rain get in the way."" iReporter witnesses heavy rain near his home . She said no incidents had been reported among the dimished number of pilgrims. Officials said the swine flu could be keeping pilgrims from the fifth pillar of Islam, which requires devotees to journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in their lifetime. Saudi's Hajj Ministry said Wednesday that 40 percent fewer Saudi pilgrims are participating in the ancient rituals this year, largely due to fears of disease, though a greater number of international visitors had come. ""Concerns about the spread of H1N1 may have affected the turnout but we are confident of all measures in place to increase monitoring of cases and awareness about how one can protect himself or herself,"" said Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabbeeah, the Saudi health minister. A teenager and three elderly people have died of the H1N1 flu virus at the Hajj. The victims were a 17-year-old Nigerian female and a Sudanese man, an Indian man and a Moroccan woman who each were 75 years old. Many of the 2 million pilgrims have been arriving days and weeks ahead of the Hajj, which coincides with flu season. The rituals of the five-day event began Wednesday. But with fewer visitors, businesses are feeling the pinch this year. Shopkeeper Fahmi al-Rashidi said he has slashed prices of the gold he sells in Mecca's Al-Ghaza market. ""Business is lower than last year,"" he said. ""I think swine flu fears combined with high gold prices are turning people away from spending."" Another merchant, Fahd al-Qraishi, said a normal 20 percent profit has dropped to 5 percent. Hajj observed in Second Life . The Hajj Ministry reported, however, a 17 percent increase in the number of international pilgrims, some of whom are enjoying discounted rates at hotels including the Hilton Makkah. Then there was the real damper. Mecca resident Khaled Nemary said he had not seen so much rain in a quarter-century. And the forecast? Showers through Friday.

"(CNN) -- The father of a 6-year-old girl, one of four relatives who police say were killed by another family member on Thanksgiving Day, said it was ""unbelievable"" how a tip from a television viewer brought about the arrest of the suspect. ""Before the show even came on, Paul was being surrounded by the people behind me,"" Jim Sitton said Tuesday in Jupiter, Florida, standing in front of police officers. Paul M. Merhige is accused of fatally shooting his twin sisters, Sitton's 6-year-old daughter Makayla -- Merhige's cousin -- and a 79-year-old aunt at a family home in Jupiter, Florida, on November 26. One of his sisters was pregnant. Police said Merhige also wounded two other family members during the shooting rampage. A viewer of the television show ""America's Most Wanted"" recognized descriptions of Merhige and his car and called police. Officers responded to the tip late Saturday, surrounding a small motel in the Florida Keys and taking Merhige into custody. Sitton said the tip came in from a promotional announcement before the show aired, not the show itself. The couple at the hotel who called police went outside and lifted a tarp to look at Merhige's license plate and verify it was the vehicle sought, he said. ""So many people don't make the call, and they made the call,"" Sitton said. ""The monster's in a cage and now we can get out of protective mode and begin the process of healing."" He said he's not ""jumping for joy"" at the arrest, ""because our daughter's room is still empty. There's dresses and shoes in there that will never be worn again."" While the arrest won't bring his daughter back, he said, ""this is the first step toward justice. ... If there's anyone that deserves the death penalty, it would be someone who would go and execute my 6-year-old daughter while she is sleeping in her bed."" Merhige made a first appearance in court on Sunday. He is charged with four counts of premeditated murder and attempted first-degree murder. His next court appearance is February 1. He is being held without bond at the Palm Beach County jail. ""America's Most Wanted"" host John Walsh told reporters he got involved in the case after his wife called him and told him she had been seeing news reports on it, and pushed him to air information on the suspect, who had been at large since Thanksgiving. ""I really believed that the public would make the difference,"" said Walsh, who met with the Sittons on Tuesday, according to the AMW Web site. He said Sitton's home had been under police protection and Sitton had patrolled his home nights with a shotgun since the incident. Walsh also said Merhige deserves the death penalty. ""He killed four people, including a pregnant woman. He needs to pay."" He cautioned the media to be gentle with the Sittons, saying, ""these are decent, wonderful, good people that are getting ready to go through hell."" Walsh has been involved in assisting crime victims since his 6-year-old son, Adam, was abducted and killed in 1981. According to its Web site, ""America's Most Wanted"" has helped find more than 1,050 fugitives and bring home more than 50 missing children in its 22 years on the air.","Dad of slain girl, 6, says arrest of relative is first step towards justice .

"(CNN) -- A memorial cruise is scheduled to set sail 100 years after the sinking of the Titanic, following the same trans-Atlantic route as the ill-fated ship, according to organizers. A list of first class passengers for the R.M.S. Titanic is one of the artifacts that remains after the sinking. The Titanic Memorial Cruise is to set sail in April 2012, departing from Southampton, England, on April 8, just as the Titanic did. On April 15, the ship -- the Balmoral -- will arrive at the spot in the North Atlantic where the Titanic sank after it collided with an iceberg. Passengers on the 2012 cruise will take part in a memorial service at the site, according to organizer Miles Morgan Travel. Artifacts from the Titanic and a piece of the ship's hull have been recovered, but most of the wreckage remains where the luxury cruise liner sank. The 12-night memorial cruise will then take passengers to Halifax in Nova Scotia, Canada, so they can visit cemeteries where some of the Titanic victims are buried. The trip will end in New York, where the Titanic was headed. Prices for the trip start at $3,900. Millvina Dean, thought to be the last survivor of the Titanic, died in June 2009 at age 97, according to friends. Dean was an infant when the Titanic -- publicized as ""practically unsinkable"" and as the largest passenger steamship at the time -- struck an iceberg on the night of April 14, 1912, during its maiden voyage from Southampton in southern England to New York. The ship sank less than three hours later, killing more than 1,500 people. Dean's brother and mother also survived the sinking.","The Titanic Memorial Cruise is to set sail in April 2012, 100 years after the sinking .

"(CNN) -- Half a million homes remained without power across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic region on Sunday, as rain continued to pound states from West Virginia to Connecticut for a second day. The rain caused flooding and airport delays across the region, even as Saturday's high winds -- reaching hurricane force in some areas -- waned dramatically on Sunday. ""High winds are over, but the rain and flood threat remain in Mid-Atlantic and Northeast,"" CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said. ""There are major travel delays -- and more expected on Monday."" Some coastal areas have received up to six inches of rain since Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. Flood warnings remained in effect in parts of the Eastern Seaboard into Sunday night, including much of New England. Flooding in West Virginia caused one death there, authorities said. Con Edison reported more than 100,000 customers without power in New York City and Westchester County on Sunday, while the Long Island Power Authority said that 150,000 of its customers were without electricity. ""The ground is so wet from all the snow we've had this winter, it's helping the trees to topple over, as well as our utility poles,"" said Long Island Power Authority president and CEO Kevin Law. ""The conditions are still too terrible to get crews out there."" Law said that some customers will likely go without power until early in the week. Roughly 100,000 New Jersey customers saw their electricity restored Sunday, along with 30,000 PPL Electric Utilities customers in Pennsylvania. But tens of thousands of other homes in New Jersey and Connecticut were still without power on Sunday. iReport: Share photos, video of storm damage . The outages were mostly due to power lines downed by Saturday's winds, which toppled trees and utility polls. Wind speeds reached 75 miles per hour at New York's JFK International Airport -- as strong as a Category 1 hurricane -- and 72 miles per hour in Atlantic City, New Jersey. New York-area airports reported delays of at least two hours on Sunday, while Boston's Logan International Airport averaged 40 minute delays. In the Midwest, meanwhile, flooding continued on Sunday because of snow melt, rains and ice jams. Farther west, North Dakota's Red River is expected to reach major flood stage around Fargo and Moorhead on Tuesday.","Half a million homes remained without power across Northeast, mid-Atlantic region .

"(CNN)  -- Arjen Robben proved the difference for the second time in four days as Bayern Munich came from behind to beat Freiburg 2-1 to leapfrog Schalke at the top of the Bundesliga. The brilliant Dutchman put the Bavarian giants into the quarterfinals of the Champions League with his stunning strike against Fiorentina on Tuesday and worked his magic again at the Allianz Arena. Cedric Makiadi had put struggling Freiburg ahead in the 31st minute, but Robben equalized in the 76th and then converted a 83rd-minute penalty to give Bayern an invaluable three points. It leaves them two points clear of Schalke, who went temporarily top after a 2-1 lead against Stuttgart. Makiada's fine strike left Hans Joerg-Butt with no chance and a shock looked on the cards as Louis van Gaal's men appeared jaded after their midweek heroics. But Robben cropped up to drill home his ninth of the season and his 10th came after Thomas Mueller was fouled to win a penalty. Earlier on Saturday, Borussia Dortmund moved up to fourth spot with a 4-1 win at Bochum with Argentina star Lucas Barrios scoring twice in three minutes in the second half to seal victory. Defending champions VfL Wolfsburg picked up their fourth-straight Bundesliga win under caretaker coach Lorenz-Guenther Koestner as they beat Borussia Moenchengladbach 4-0 to move up to eighth. But basement side Hertha Berlin look certain for the drop after a 2-1 home defeat to fellow strugglers Nuremberg, who followed up their shock win 3-2 at Bayer Leverkusen with another fine victory. It lifts them to 15th. Third-placed Leverkusen play Hamburg on Sunday in a bid to get their title challenge back on track after Nuremberg ended their record unbeaten run. In other action around Europe on Saturday, on-loan Robbie Keane scored a hat-trick as Celtic won 3-0 at Kilmarnock to reach the semifinals of the Scottish Cup, their last realistic hope of silverware this season. In the French League, Lyon struggled after their midweek heroics against Real Madrid and were held to a 1-1 draw at home to local rivals St. Etienne. A first half goal from Emmanuel Riviere put struggling St. Etienne ahead with Lyon getting an 80th minute equalizer from Argentinian Lisandro Lopez. With leaders Bordeaux held to a goalless draw at Monaco and fellow challengers Montpellier and Auxerre playing out a 1-1 draw, Lyon's draw was a missed opportunity. Bordeaux are top with 53 points from 27 games, with a game in hand on Montpellier, who also have 53, with Auxerre just a point behind in third. Lyon are fourth with 50 points after 28 games.","Arjen Robben hits a second half double to give Bayern Munich 2-1 win over Freiburg .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- An Internet that gives people the information they want virtually as soon as it's created is getting closer, according to Internet professionals. But before real-time Web becomes a reality, developers say they need to figure out how to protect people's privacy while blasting out as much information as they can, as fast as they can. ""A lot of this data that people would like to make available, they wouldn't necessarily want to make available to everyone,"" said Jack Moffitt, chief technical officer for Collecta, a search engine that aims to give real-time results. ""I think we'll be wrestling with privacy issues around real-time data for a long time."" The idea behind a real-time Web is to create technology that doesn't require an Internet user to actively seek out something they're interested in. That could mean anything from getting pinged when an article about your favorite sports team is posted to an alert when you're mentioned in someone's blog. Moffitt and others speaking at the South By Southwest Interactive Festival on Saturday said there's not yet fully developed technology that would both give people all the real-time info they want and let people who put their information on the Internet select who sees it -- or even take it back. ""It's kind of in our best interest, being selfish, if everyone was completely open with their data,"" said Scott Raymond, founder of Austin-based Gowalla, a location-based mobile app. ""From the user's perspective, it's kind of the opposite -- it's probably better to just stay selfish with your own data but consume everyone else's. ""There's a whole lot of work that needs to be done on this and it hasn't been solved yet."" For example, if people on Twitter all set their feed to private, the popular trending-topics feature wouldn't work. Recently, Twitter, on which most users make their information open to everyone, hit a major milestone -- its 10 billionth tweet. Unfortunately, that tweet was by a user whose settings are private, so the curious will never know what the landmark message was. Brett Slatkin, a software developer with Google, said a real-time Web would create numerous new opportunities -- among them, giving small, local retailers a chance to catch up with major online stores that capitalize on convenience. ""If my corner store can say [to a customer online], 'Yes, I just got five rickshaw bags in stock and you wanted one -- you can just walk down here and get it,' it's a chance to change competition and commerce,"" he said. On sites like Twitter, Gowalla and Foursquare, Google Buzz and Facebook, status updates already exist as elements of a real-time Web. Developers note that the speed with which information travels on the Internet is already dramatically faster than it was just a couple of years ago -- before Twitter and location-based apps existed and before Facebook became a worldwide phenomenon. ""This creates lots of interesting social scenarios,"" said Dare Obasanjo, of Microsoft. ""In the 'old days,' you would have written a blog post about something you did and I'd be like, 'Crap, I was in the next room.' "" Multiple players, at both major Internet companies and new startups, are working on an Internet platform to ""real time"" the rest of the Web. That starts with faster searching. Current search engines ""crawl"" around the Internet -- adding the material they find to their databases. But that can sometimes take awhile, particularly on smaller Web sites. Then, there needs to be a universal system for pushing that information to the right people. Obasanjo suggested there may eventually be a way for every new page of data on the Internet to have hashtags (#) similar to the ones used on Twitter to denote that a post is about a particular topic. On the issue of privacy, Slatkin said developers could roll out a way for a person to set their online privacy settings in one place then have those settings apply on every Web site. ""We're going to see a definition, at the technical level, of what sharing means,"" Slatkin said. ""I think we're going to solve it on the technical level first. Once we solve it technically, it'll be about how to actually implement it for users.""","Idea behind real-time Web is to create technology that doesn't require user to seek out info .

"(CNN)  -- Congressional auditors have uncovered widespread abuse of techniques used to restrain or discipline special-education students in U.S. schools, with some deaths linked to the practices, a top congressman says. Investigators in Utah say a teacher left Garrett Peck in an isolation cubicle for at least two and a half hours. The findings are among those expected from a Government Accountability Office report scheduled to be released Tuesday. The report documented serious problems with the way children with disabilities are being treated in public schools, including cases of children being held face-down on the ground. The GAO report was prepared for the House Education and Labor Committee, which is considering new laws governing what actions teachers can take to rein in disruptive special-needs students. ""I think what we're going to hear from the GAO is that very often, special-need children are subjected to the policies of seclusion and policies of restraint that have turned out to be lethal in a number of circumstances,"" said Rep. George Miller, D-California, the committee's chairman. In other cases, children as young as 6 have been locked away ""for hours at a time,"" Miller said. ""What the GAO is telling us is that that policy is fairly widespread,"" he said. ""The state regulations about how to handle these incidents don't exist in about half the states, and in other states you have kind of a patchwork of regulations."" The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, found that state laws governing the treatment of the more than 6 million children classified as having ""special needs"" -- conditions including autism and Down syndrome -- are patchy at best. Teachers and school staff frequently lack training in correct restraint methods, and in some cases, where improper restraints led to injuries, teachers often kept their jobs. Only five states keep track of incidents where special-needs students are separated or restrained. Parents contacted by CNN commonly said they were not told their child was being disciplined until he or she began to behave badly at home -- a sign of trouble at school. When confronted with complaints, school systems sometimes sought to minimize or deny the allegations, even after public investigations found the charges to be true. And parents told CNN that when they got into a dispute with the teacher, their child was made to suffer as retribution. Some of the most disturbing reports concerned the use of seclusion rooms. Experts have long recommended that children should only be isolated when they pose an immediate threat to themselves or others. But CNN found that isolation was often used as a punishment by teachers to compel the students to follow instructions. State investigators in Utah found a teacher left 7-year-old Garrett Peck in an isolation cubicle for at least two and a half hours after the teacher said he told her to ""shut up."" While the boy was in the cubicle, the teacher taunted him by playing his favorite video and telling him what he was missing. His parents, Joshua and Becca Peck, said the child has an attention span of about 10 minutes, and they believe that after the first few minutes, he had no idea why he was in the cubicle. ""It was so sad. We felt it was a form of torture for him but he, being autistic, he had no way to express it,"" Joshua Peck said. ""He couldn't tell."" And Becca Peck said her son had been left in the cubicle with nothing but a magic marker -- which he used to scrawl all over himself. When she came to school to pick him up, ""He was covered in marker -- on his eyelids, on his hair, face, clothes, arms, eyelids -- everywhere."" ""I started thinking, 'What was he thinking?' Was he thinking, 'Why is my mom letting this person do this to me? Why am I here? I trust no one now.' "" In Garrett's case, like others cited by the GAO, the teacher remains on the job. And what frustrates experts is that efforts to force unruly children to comply don't actually work. At one school in Pennsylvania, however, teachers appear to have better results using sharply different methods. The Centennial School at Lehigh University serves severely emotionally disturbed children that have been passed from school to school, and even from juvenile justice centers. When school director Michael George came to Centennial in 1999, the school had documented more than 1,000 cases of restraint and seclusion that year. After the school revamped its approach, no such incidents were reported. When they get to Centennial, students can be violent and aggressive. But instead of trying to force a change in behavior, the school teaches the children new skills to get what they need. Children who might be violent because they are desperate to escape an uncomfortable task or environment learn to communicate their discomfort in nonviolent ways. Children who need to move frequently -- a common trait with conditions such as autism -- are permitted to do so, then re-directed to the task at hand. Staff are forbidden from saying anything negative about the children, parents or other teachers, even among themselves. And when a child acts violently, the staff is trained to step aside, rather than immediately attempt a potentially dangerous restraint. On a recent visit to the school, all students appeared to be calm and receptive to teachers. The school's philosophy can be summed up in a question George likes to ask teachers interviewing for jobs there: Which teacher you remember most from your own childhood? ""No one ever mentions the person who yelled at them, who screamed at them, who told them to write a phrase a hundred times, who slammed them into closets, who was abrupt, who made them feel stupid. No one ever mentions those people,"" said George. ""Our job is to teach. Sometimes the children we are teaching here present extraordinary challenges; it can be very, very difficult. But that's the job we chose to do.""","GAO report uncovers abuse of techniques used to restrain or discipline children .

"(CNN) -- Bayer Leverkusen moved to within three points of German Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich after a comfortable 4-2 home victory over Hamburg on Sunday. A double from Stefan Kiessling helped Leverkusen on their way to another three points, leaving them clear in third, a point behind second-placed Schalke, with the top three now pulling away in the race for the title with just eight games left. Kiessling opened the scoring after running onto Tranquillo Barnetta's through-ball and out-pacing two defenders before firing past goalkeeper Frank Rost. But Ze Roberto volleyed home a 33rd-minute equalizer for Hamburg after a defensive mix-up involving Sami Hyppia and goalkeeper Rene Adler. Eren Derdiyok restored Leverkusen's lead in the 55th-minute when heading home Daniel Schwaab's ball into the box -- and Kiessling quickly added a third with a simple tap-in after some great work from Renato Augusto. Czech defender David Rozehnal gave Hamburg some brief hope when converting an 83rd minute Piotr Trochowski free-kick but the victory was confirmed just a minute later when Gonzalo Casto fired home from just inside the area. Meanwhile, in the day's other match, Claudio Pizarro scored his 11th league goal of the season to give Werder Bremen a 1-0 home win over Hoffenheim. The Peruvian striker lobbed goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand with just nine minutes remaining to leave Werder sixth in the table, one point away from a place in Europe.","Bayer Leverkusen move to within three points of German leaders Bayern Munich .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- ""In Afghanistan, the sacrifice in the political game is women and children,"" female Afghan parliamentarian Fawzia Koofi said. Critics say they fear that Afghanistan's new Shiite law will set the nation backward. Koofi says that is exactly what happened when the Afghan parliament recently passed a bill intended to give the minority Shia community their own identity. But critics say the latest draft strips Shia women of rights as simple as leaving the house without permission from a male relative and as extreme as allowing a man to have sexual intercourse with his wife even when she says, ""No."" These critics wonder how what amounts to rape in marriage could be passed by parliament and signed into law by President Hamid Karzai. Amid blistering criticism from the West, Karzai addressed the law over the weekend, saying that key elements of the bill were misinterpreted by Western news organizations.  Watch Karzai react to controversial law » . ""We understand the concerns of our allies and the international community. Those concerns may be due to an inappropriate, not-so-good translation of the law, or misinterpretation,"" Karzai told reporters in Kabul. He added that the Minister of Justice will study the ""Shia state law,"" line by line, to make sure it follows the nation's constitution, which requires equal rights to both sexes. ""If there is anything that is of concern to us, then we will definitely take action in consultation with our [religious clerics] and send it back to the parliament. You be assured of that. This is something that we're also serious about and should not allow,"" he said. However, Karzai did not address the most controversial part of the bill, dealing with rape of a wife.  Watch a report on the law » . The Shia state law was debated by 249 members of the lower house, including 68 women, some of whom voted for the bill. It was then sent to the upper house. Even some lawmakers are baffled at the manner in which it passed. ""Most members of the parliament did not know what they were going to vote for,"" Koofi said. ""Even some of my friends, MPs sitting with me, voted in favor without knowing what happened."" U.S. President Obama called the law ""abhorrent"" and said his administration has made it clear to the Karzai government that it objects to the law. Human rights groups and the international community have condemned the law and say it could undermine efforts to support basic human rights in the war-torn nation. ""We very much hope that the draft piece of legislation is to be withdrawn,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said during a NATO summit on Afghanistan over the weekend. ""It is unacceptable if such a law were to be passed in Afghanistan and become a part of Afghan legislation."" According to lawmakers who opposed the bill, conservative legislators are pushing back any progress made for women's rights in Afghanistan after the brutal oppression under the Taliban regime. From 1996 to 2001, under the Sunni fundamentalist government of the Taliban, women were not allowed to leave their homes without being escorted by a male relative, and girls were not allowed to go to school. When women did leave their homes, they were required to wear a blue burqa, which covered their bodies from head to toe. The only opening was a small net that provided an eyehole for the women to see through. Women remember those days with despair. One female teacher, who asked not to be named, said that during the Taliban regime, she was stopped at the market by the Taliban and beaten with a whip. Her crime: She wore a shawl covering her body instead of a burqa. She says she was too poor to purchase a real burqa. After that beating, she was stuck in her home for months until someone was able to give her a used burqa. But even then, she didn't know how to function wearing the suffocating fabric. ""I remember stepping out of a taxi with my son, and my foot was caught inside the burqa, making me fall out of the taxi onto mud. And everyone started laughing. It was humiliating,"" she said. Women in Afghanistan can still be seen wearing burqas. But Koofi says advances have been made for women's rights in recent years. In some cases, it's as simple as putting on makeup and walking down city streets. But she fears that the rights of women and children could slowly be eroded, the ""victims of political games,"" as she puts it. ""I mean, they don't have a gun to fight [with], they cannot create a mess,"" Koofi said. That's a sentiment echoed by rights groups. ""The reported new law on women's rights could be about to seriously undermine women's rights for millions of Afghanistan women,"" Amnesty International said in a statement. The new law was intended to give the minority Shia community its own identity within the predominantly Sunni country. Shias have been practicing their form of Islam for centuries in Afghanistan, but they agree that there needs to be a governing Islamic law for Shias alone, one recognized by the central government. Koofi welcomes international support in fighting the new law, telling CNN that international investments in Afghanistan should go beyond financial donations. ""I don't ask that the international community come and make laws for us, but they have to make the government of Afghanistan accountable for their commitment to women and children ... and basically the human rights situation in this country,"" she said.","Afghan law appears to let a man to have sex with his wife even when she says ""no""

"(CNN) -- After scathing criticism from the son of slain Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, police in Los Angeles, California, have apologized for including the clothes the senator was wearing when killed in an exhibit of high-profile homicide cases. The clothing -- a shirt, tie and jacket, with what appears to be bloodstains on the shirt -- was removed from the exhibit, ""Behind-The-Scenes: The LAPD Homicide Experience,"" at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada. In addition, Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley and Police Chief Charlie Beck, in an open letter Thursday, apologized to any other victims' family members who might have been offended by the other items in the exhibit, running Tuesday through Thursday at the California Homicide Investigators Association's 2010 conference. ""Based on the feedback we have received, it is now clear that a few of the items on display have offended some crime victims' families,"" the letter said. ""We have both been to hundreds of murder scenes in our law enforcement career and we have consoled many family members. It was never our intent to cause grief to victims of crime or their families."" In a statement issued last month, the LAPD had billed the exhibit as ""a glimpse into some of the most notable homicides and critical incidents that occurred in Los Angeles over the past 100 years."" ""It's about the history of Los Angeles, as told through the eyes of homicide investigators of the Los Angeles Police Department,"" Beck said Tuesday on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""This is an opportunity for homicide investigators from all over the country to get together, to share ideas, to share best practices and to talk about some of the most famous cases in Los Angeles history, as well as their current cases."" But in an opinion piece in Wednesday's Los Angeles Times newspaper, Maxwell Taylor Kennedy, son of the late senator, called the display of his father's clothing ""a cheap bid for attention."" ""The chief of police and the district attorney took my father's blood-soaked clothing and displayed it, as part of a macabre publicity stunt,"" he wrote. ""It is almost incomprehensible to imagine what circumstances would have led to a decision to transport these items across state lines to be gawked at by gamblers and tourists. It is demeaning to my family, but just as important, it is demeaning to the trust that citizens place in their law enforcement officers."" The exhibit also features evidence associated with the death of Marilyn Monroe, the 1963 ""onion field"" case in which LAPD Officer Ian Campbell was slain, the O.J. Simpson and Charles Manson cases, and the so-called ""Black Dahlia"" murder, according to the LAPD statement announcing it. Family members of some victims in those cases told ""Larry King Live"" the LAPD should have notified them about the exhibit. ""From my perspective, it's very disturbing,"" said Debra Tate, sister of actress Sharon Tate, slain along with six others in 1969 by the Manson family killers. ""Number 1, I didn't get any notice that this was going to occur. But these are very personal artifacts to me. These are things that bring back horrible memories, not only for myself, but other Manson family victims."" The items include ropes used in the murders of Tate and others, and a fork used to stab one of the victims, said retired LAPD Sgt. Glynn Martin, the curator of the exhibit. ""We certainly try to concern ourselves with the thoughts and concerns of victims, and certainly our hearts go out to them,"" Martin told King. ""... Likewise, we have an obligation, both as a museum and then the bigger one as the police department, to train, educate and inform officers and the public about people that do this particular job of investigating people that have lost their lives."" Debra Tate said she can see the educational value, and might consider seeing the exhibit, but ""I think a little bit of notice for people to prepare themselves would have been very, very nice."" Also featured are the bloody gloves from the Simpson trial and a watch cap collected as evidence, Martin said. Simpson was acquitted in 1995 of killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. ""Had we been given a little bit of notice, it would have been easier to avert your eyes,"" Goldman's sister, Kim, told ""Larry King Live."" ""... I think there is an educational value, and I understand that."" But, she said, ""it just comes back to sensitivity."" ""If we've offended anybody, certainly we extend our apologies to them,"" Martin said. ""But the intent here is to inform and educate, with the idea that we're going to serve a greater public good."" The exhibit opened to the public Wednesday, and ""thousands of guests have stood in lines for up to two hours to glimpse Los Angeles' history,"" said the letter from Cooley and Beck. ""A number of the exhibits show evidence that was collected during various well-known incidents, and they were carefully designed so visitors would gain a better appreciation for the tragedy of murder and the difficult jobs law enforcement detectives have in solving often very complicated cases,"" the letter said. ""Murder is the absolute worst thing one human being can do to another and the displays were designed to provide a unique insight into the sacrifice of victims and their families as well as the emotional toll murder takes on homicide detectives and the district attorneys who prosecute the cases."" ""Homicide is by nature horrific, but the entertainment media often portrays it as sterile and benign,"" the letter said. ""When people see the reality of murder, it becomes an unthinkable act."" The exhibit ""was designed to be educational and show the public how murder cases are very carefully investigated,"" the letter said. Kennedy was a New York senator running for president when he was shot to death in June 1968 at Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel, shortly after declaring victory in California's Democratic presidential primary. His killer, Sirhan Sirhan, is serving a life sentence at a California prison. In his op-ed, Maxwell Kennedy said that he had contacted Beck and that he was pleased the chief had agreed to remove the items. ""When I called to express my surprise and disappointment, the chief maintained to me that hanging my dad's bloody shirt from a mannequin in a casino was part of an effort to train detectives,"" he wrote. ""Perhaps he believes that, but to me it seems like a cheap bid for attention. It is almost like a traffic cop inviting motorists to slow down and take a good look as they go past a tragedy."" The California Constitution guarantees crime victims and their families will be treated with dignity and respect, he wrote. And as a former assistant district attorney, Maxwell Kennedy said, ""I understand that proper storage of property and legal evidence is a critical part of the judicial process."" He said he requested the return of his father's clothing nearly 10 years ago, and the district attorney's office refused, but he was promised the items would be treated with care and kept out of the public view. Beck, he wrote, should remember that ""such items are personal property, entrusted to the state's care, not to be exploited. He relies on crime victims to prosecute virtually every criminal. He cannot long succeed if he continues to put victims' pain on display for publicity.""","LAPD apologizes after son of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy objects to Las Vegas display .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Michael Jackson has officially become the most popular person on Facebook, with more than 7 million fans on the social networking site. The Michael Jackson Facebook page is now the most popular on the social networking site. Previously, the most popular person on Facebook, with just over 6 million fans, was U.S. President Obama. Over the past week, Jackson's page has grown from 80,000 fans to just over 7 million, generating the largest response on a Facebook page, the social networking site says. He has continued to gain about 20 fans per second and even more during peak traffic hours, said social media commentator Nick O'Neill, founder of the Social Times Web site. By comparison, actor Ashton Kutcher recently entered a race to beat CNN's Larry King to 1 million followers on Twitter. Kutcher won and remains the most popular person on Twitter -- but still has only 2.6 million followers. During his memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, all 10 trending topics on Twitter.com were Jackson-related. Jackson's popularity and the viral nature of Facebook fan pages are the primary reasons for the huge fan base, O'Neill explained. He said, ""It's simply his popularity. Also, as users become fans, the page gets recommended to others, driving the viral growth of the page. ""Michael Jackson is simply the largest celebrity in the world. While he was a controversial figure, he clearly attracts the attention of the global media,"" he continued. The Facebook page has become an online memorial to Jackson, with thousands of comments from around the world; dozens appear every minute. Free virtual versions of Jackson's famous glove are the most popular gift on the site, with more than 800,000 sent to members. The huge following leaves the singer's heirs (and his record label) with a massive network to communicate with fans and continue the massive resurgence of interest in Jackson's music, O'Neill said. ""While Sony has not heavily engaged the fan base on Michael Jackson's page, they at least have a presence. If your fans are there, you should be there. ""This also provided an ongoing promotional channel for any future products that are released. It's simply not an option and will become a component of all marketing strategies."" There have been 2.6 million downloads of Jackson's music since his death. He has the top two albums on iTunes, as well as three of the top 10 singles. In the United Kingdom, Jackson held 11 of the top 200 album positions and 43 of the top 200 singles, based on sales monitored by the Official Charts Co. for the week ended June 27. His ""Number Ones"" album topped the OCC album chart after selling 46,400 physical copies and 10,000 downloads. The surge for demand in Jackson's music looks likely to continue for several months: The fan page has a music player with some of Jackson's hits and an option to buy them through Amazon.","Michael Jackson is most popular person on Facebook with nearly 7 million fans .

"MANCHESTER, Tennessee (CNN) -- When Bela Fleck told us he had been missing something in his life musically, he caught us off guard. Bela Fleck traveled to Africa to immerse himself in banjo-related culture. Keep in mind: Fleck is considered by many to be the premier banjo player in the world. He's won Grammy awards. He's collaborated with bluegrass musicians, jazz players, classical performers and any number of other talented artists. But Fleck said he wanted to make himself uncomfortable. Earlier this year, he released the documentary ""Throw Down Your Heart,"" for which he traveled to Uganda, Tanzania, Mali, and Gambia to explore the African roots of the banjo. CNN caught up with him backstage at the Bonnaroo music festival last month, where he played with African kora player Toumani Diabate, to discuss his film and experience in Africa and what prompted him to go. The following is an edited version of the interview.  Watch Fleck at Bonnaroo » . CNN: What gave you the inspiration to go to Africa to trace the roots of the banjo and make ""Throw Down Your Heart?"" Bela Fleck: Well, I have loved the banjo since I first heard it when I was a little kid, and after I started to learn to play it I discovered that it came from Africa originally, and that doesn't seem to be common knowledge. There are a lot of people who have forgotten over the years where the banjo comes from. I've always wanted to go back to Africa and hear what's going on there and find the instruments that still exist that are the roots of the banjo and play music with them. So that's what this trip and the film and the record were all about --going to Uganda, Tanzania, Mali and Gambia and finding musicians and filming interactions with them and recording it all. CNN: What did you learn? Fleck: That's a common question. Everybody wants some kind of epiphany out of a trip like this, and I got it, but it's hard to put it into words. Except that just the experience of playing with these musicians made my life a lot richer, made my worldview a lot bigger, and in a lot of cases I learned music that was so new to me that it's affected the way I play music ever since. CNN: It's clear that learning this music and a new technique on the banjo was a challenge for you. Fleck: Sure. Another important part of the trip for me was putting myself into uncomfortable situations and seeing how I would do, because over the years, as I've gotten more and more successful, I get in control of things, and less and less I was finding myself in situations that were truly risky musically. I liked being unprepared and being forced to come up with it on the spot. It just wasn't happening in my life at the time. So that was another part of going to Africa, throwing myself into completely uncharted waters and trying to do something good and survive. [There was also] the brotherhood of acoustic musicians, 'cause we feel something when we play our instruments and the sounds mingle in the air. I think it's different than playing pop music or electric instruments. CNN: Tell us about your collaboration with Toumani Diabate.  Watch the masters play » . Fleck: I am so lucky to be performing with Toumani. He's the greatest kora player. The kora is a 21-string harp, and he comes from 71 generations from it being taught from father to son, father to son. We improvise together with just the kora and the banjo. CNN: Did you learn how to play the kora? Fleck: No, I haven't sat and tried to play the kora, but he's taught me the notes that he plays, the scales and the patterns that he does, and I taught him some banjo stuff. He's a great collaborator. Playing with musicians who didn't speak English was not a problem, when we started to play together, we always found a way to make music. CNN: Is there a social message about Africa you came back with and want people to know about? Fleck: My reasons for going to Africa were kind of selfish, because I love the banjo, and I really want to play with the musicians. But I think that the film serves in a lot of positive ways. One of the ways is to show people that there are a lot of great things about Africa. Currently there are so many horrible things that are getting press about Africa, and they truly are horrible. But there's a reason we should care about Africa: It's a wonderful place. People are beautiful, and there is an incredible culture and history there, and I think this film sits on the other side. It's not a political statement, but it does point out what is beautiful about Africans.","Bela Fleck, top-rank banjo player, went to Africa to seek instrument's roots .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- The doctor at the center of an investigation into patients' deaths after Hurricane Katrina said everyone must remember the ""magnitude of human suffering"" after the storm to ensure that no health care worker is ever ""falsely accused in a rush to judgment."" Dr. Anna Pou said Tuesday she hopes to return to work doing what she ""loves to do best."" ""Today's events are not a triumph, but a moment of remembrance for those who lost their lives in the storm and a tribute to all of those who stayed at their posts and served people most in need,"" Dr. Anna Pou said after a grand jury decided Tuesday not to pursue criminal charges against her. Pou and two nurses -- Cheri Landry and Lori Budo -- were arrested in July 2006 after a 10-month investigation into the deaths at New Orleans' Memorial Medical Center. Pou's lawyer, Rick Simmons, said she and her patients were ""abandoned"" by all levels of government. ""The certificates of death in these individual patients should read 'abandoned by their government.' That's what happened here,"" he said. Pou said she hopes to return to work doing what she ""loves to do best."" She fought back tears as she thanked those who have stood by her during the past 23 ""challenging and painful"" months. Louisiana Attorney General Charles C. Foti charged the doctor and two nurses with second-degree murder. Landry and Budo were recently given immunity in exchange for their grand jury testimony.  Watch what led up to grand jury's decision » . Pou, Landry and Budo denied the charges, and their attorneys have said they acted heroically, staying to treat patients rather than evacuate. Foti accused the three of involvement in as many as nine deaths at the hospital. The investigation concluded that patients were given a ""lethal cocktail"" of morphine and midazolam hydrochloride, both central nervous system depressants, he said. None of the patients had been prescribed the drugs by their caregivers, and none of the accused treated them before the injections, Foti said. ""This was not euthanasia,"" Foti said at a news conference last summer. ""This was homicide."" Foti said he turned his findings over to Orleans Parish District Attorney Eddie Jordan, who was required by law either to file charges or reject the case. Instead, Jordan impaneled a grand jury and vowed to let it decide what charges, if any, should be sought. Jordan also directed New Orleans Coroner Frank Minyard to hire outside forensic experts to review the case. On Tuesday, Foti acknowledged that ""in our system, justice has been served. The grand jury has made its decision. ... I'm not here to second-guess what the court says."" But he noted that none of the alleged victims' relatives and none of five medical experts who independently concluded the deaths were homicides were called to testify before the grand jury. Asked her feelings about Foti, Pou said, ""I'm really putting Mr. Foti in God's hands,"" adding that she continues to pray for the ability to forgive him. CNN first reported the allegations of euthanasia months after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast and triggered flooding in New Orleans two years ago. Patients, staff and their families rode out Katrina. But four days after the hurricane hit, despair was setting in. The hospital was surrounded by floodwater. There was no power or water, and the heat was stifling. Food was running low, and nurses were forced to fan patients by hand. Simmons said Pou is still facing lawsuits filed by relatives of three of the patients who died. E-mail to a friend .","NEW: Prosecutor: ""Justice has been served. ... I'm not here to second-guess""

"Washington (CNN) -- The House of Representatives voted unanimously Thursday to impeach Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr. of U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, making him the nation's 15th federal judge ever impeached. ""Our investigation found that Judge Porteous participated in a pattern of corrupt conduct for years,"" said U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Task Force on Judicial Impeachment. ""Litigants have the right to expect a judge hearing their case will be fair and impartial, and avoid even the appearance of impropriety. Regrettably, no one can have that expectation in Judge Porteous' courtroom."" After the impeachment vote, Schiff and Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, were named the lead impeachment managers for the Senate trial, which will decide whether to remove Porteous from the bench. ""Today's vote marks only the second time in over 20 years that this has occurred,"" Goodlatte said in a House news release. ""However, when evidence emerges that an individual is abusing his judicial office for his own advantage, the integrity of the entire judicial system becomes compromised."" In a statement, Porteous' lawyer Richard W. Westling said the Justice Department had decided not to prosecute because it did not have credible evidence. ""Unfortunately, the House has decided to disregard the Justice Department's decision and to move forward with impeachment. As a result, we will now turn to the Senate to seek a full and fair hearing of all of the evidence."" In a telephone interview, Westling said he did not know when the Senate trial would be held. ""There are no clear rules that dictate timing,"" he said. Last year, the Task Force on Judicial Impeachment held evidentiary hearings that led to unanimous approval of the four articles of impeachment, citing evidence that Porteous ""intentionally made material false statements and representations under penalty of perjury, engaged in a corrupt kickback scheme, solicited and accepted unlawful gifts, and intentionally misled the Senate during his confirmation proceedings,"" the House release said. Porteous was appointed to the federal bench in 1994. In 2007, after an FBI and federal grand jury investigation, the Justice Department alleged ""pervasive misconduct"" by Porteous and evidence ""that Judge Porteous may have violated federal and state criminal laws, controlling canons of judicial conduct, rules of professional responsibility, and conducted himself in a manner antithetical to the constitutional standard of good behavior required of all federal judges."" The complaint said the department opted not to seek criminal charges for reasons that included issues of statute of limitations and other factors. But Westling said the statute of limitations was not applicable. An Impeachment Task Force held four hearings late last year that focused on allegations of misconduct by Porteous, including: . -- Involvement in a corrupt kickback scheme . -- Failure to recuse himself from a case he was involved in . -- Allegations that Porteous made false and misleading statements, including concealing debts and gambling losses . -- Allegations that Porteous asked for and accepted ""numerous things of value, including meals, trips, home and car repairs, for his personal use and benefit"" while taking official actions on behalf of his benefactors . -- Allegations that Porteous lied about his past to the U.S. Senate and to the FBI about his nomination to the federal bench ""in order to conceal corrupt relationships,"" Schiff said in his floor statement as prepared for delivery . Porteous was invited to testify, but he declined to do so, Schiff said. ""His long-standing pattern of corrupt activity, so utterly lacking in honesty and integrity, demonstrates his unfitness to serve as a United States District Court judge,"" he said. Porteous, 63, has not worked as a judge since he was suspended with pay in the fall of 2008, Westling said. The last federal judge impeachment occurred last year, when Judge Samuel B. Kent of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas resigned after being impeached on charges of sexual assault, obstructing and impeding an official proceeding, and making false and misleading statements, according to the Web site of the Federal Judicial Center. The Senate, sitting as a court of impeachment, dismissed the articles. Before then, Judge Walter L. Nixon of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi was impeached in 1989 on charges of perjury before a federal grand jury. The Senate convicted him and removed him from office that year.","Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr. was impeached by U.S. House of Representatives .

"(CNN) -- Remember ""You're money, baby""? Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau making the L.A. bar scene in ""Swingers"" back in 1996? In the film, couples go to the Eden Resort, which is offering a great package deal on relationship counseling. They were young and hungry then, and there was insolence in their hustle, but at least they pressed their case: They knew they were sharp enough to be players. Since then, Favreau has gone on to direct blockbusters like ""Elf"" and ""Iron Man,"" and his buddy Vaughn has stacked up a string of hits in the company of Frat Packers Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. Well, they're not hungry anymore, and not so young either. Between them (and with an assist from Dana ""What Happens in Vegas"" Fox), they have cooked up ""Couples Retreat,"" a marriage comedy that coincidentally doubles as an enviable excuse for an extended shoot in Bora Bora.  Watch the stars talk about the shoot » . That's the tropical location of the Eden Resort, which is offering a great package deal for married couples looking for relationship counseling. Jason and Cynthia (Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell) want to give it a shot, and persuade their supposedly happily married friends Dave and Ronnie (Vaughn and Malin Akerman), Joey and Lucy (Favreau and Kristin Davis), and Shane and his 20-year-old girlfriend Trudy (Faizon Love and Kali Hawk) to join in the fun. Apparently, nobody has trouble raising the fare, even in these recessionary times. Once there, however, they are dismayed to find Eden is run with iron discipline, and the mandatory therapy sessions soon expose serious cracks in each of the relationships. Directed by Peter ""A Christmas Story"" Billingsley -- another old friend of Vaughn's -- ""Couples Retreat"" can't decide if it's satirizing New Age-y therapies or exploring marital breakdown. So it gives us a little of both, with some sub-Apatow sex humor on the side. As a commercial recipe, that's fine. America's ticket buyers have shown time and again they're desperate for a laugh and willing to overlook widespread mediocrity to get it. But you might hope for something a bit less lazy from this team. And shouldn't a movie with ""Couples"" in the title be less lopsided in its approach to the sexes? I guess in contrast to such boys-will-be-boys romps as ""The Hangover"" and ""Wild Hogs,"" at least this time the wives get to come along, not that any of them has much to say for herself. Trudy wants to party. Lucy has eyes for the yoga instructor (Carlos Ponce). Ronnie wants some romance. And Cynthia ... I don't know what Cynthia wants, but getting away from her control freak husband certainly seems like the way to go. The guys are noticeably chubbier, but equally one-dimensional. It's just that that dimension enjoys rather more screen time as Billingsley indulges Vaughn and Favreau's less-than-inspired improvisational riffs on marital frustration, machismo and middle-age spread. We even have to endure a Guitar Hero duel. For a movie made by a bunch of friends, it's strange that we don't get any sense of how or why these couples hang out together. But so long as there's a pretentious Frenchman to scoff at, an officious Brit and a sexy Hispanic, at least they're united by what they're not. Whether by accident or design, ""Couples Retreat"" does such a good job exposing what selfish, insensitive jerks these guys are, the contrived and conventional ending actually has a feel-bad undertow. You've got to suspect that back home in suburbia, these couples are doomed to live unhappily ever after.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress and animal rights activist Eva Mendes hopes you'll shun fur as you shop for the holidays. ""Even if you buy a fur glove with the little trim, and you think 'Oh, my God, it's just a little trim,' that animal got clubbed,"" Mendes said. Mendes took her clothes off two years ago for the PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) ""Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur"" campaign, but now she wants you to see something less pleasant. She's narrated a video of PETA's latest undercover footage of animals being killed for their fur. ""These animals are beaten to death, they're skinned alive, their throats are slashed while they're still alive,"" she said. ""They're anally electrocuted, just so the fur won't become tainted."" It's unlikely you'll see the 3-minute video on television because of its gruesome nature. But it shouldn't be hard to find it spreading virally online. ""It's not something you want to see,"" she said. ""But it's something you have to see."" Mendes says she's confident that anyone who watches it will eventually ditch furs as fashion. ""Even if you don't do something today, it'll stay in your consciousness and you'll think about it,"" she said. ""That's why these strong images are so necessary for people to see, because they'll stay in your mind, and maybe in your subconscious. They'll stay there and that will really help you make a more evolved decision in the future."" Mendes said her dog, Hugo, ""changed her world"" and convinced her to campaign against fur. ""I've become so much of a more just sensitive, empathetic person towards animals because of him,"" she said. ""Because he's just so precious and I can't imagine wearing him or eating him, and what's really the difference between him or some little raccoon or some bunny or seal?""

"London, England -- Petra Nemcova is a former Victoria's Secret supermodel-turned-philanthropist. Despite her riches, Nemcova, who grew up with few luxuries in communist Czechoslovakia, told CNN that her most important work is her charity, the Happy Hearts Fund. The model set up the foundation after her near-death experience in the 2004 Asian tsunami. While Nemcova survived by clinging to a palm tree for eight hours, her long-term partner did not. Here, Nemcova shows CNN around Prague and tells of her love for the ""Golden City,"" what she learnt from growing up in a communist country and how she keeps smiling -- despite life's setbacks. CNN: Tell us about the first time you came to Prague. Petra Nemcova: The first time was to visit my aunt and even if Prague is in the same country as my town, it felt like a real journey. For us it was like going somewhere very special, far away, because under the Communist regime you didn't travel that much and Prague was ""wow."" I was overwhelmed and amazed by the beauty of Prague and every time I arrive in Prague, even now, I'm still amazed. The lighting at night; the incredible architecture; the details; the history; there was a lot to learn about and a lot to discover. It was a very special experience. The following time I went to Prague was during my early career in the fashion industry and I was traveling once, twice a week from my town to Prague. I would wake up at 5.45 in the morning, take the bus for one hour, then a tram to school. After school I would take a five-hour train to Prague. So it was quite intense at that time, but it was a great experience and it taught me a lot about being independent. CNN: How would you describe Prague, in five words? Petra Nemcova: Prague is a city of romance, of incredible architecture and history. Some people call it the ""golden city,"" some people say it's the heart of Europe -- although maybe the French don't like that very much! Paris is bigger obviously and a bit more hectic and Prague is smaller and has more of a village-y feeling compared to Paris. Prague has more of a calming vibe. It's not rush-rush-rush. I think when people come here they are surprised by the beauty of Prague and also the vivid colors. I think they may imagine Prague more in gray colors because of the communist association. But since then a lot of reconstruction has been done. Before Prague was shades of grey and black, which was quite mysterious, but now it's more happy and pretty. In five words it's historical, inspirational, creative, romantic and beautiful. CNN: What was your childhood like? Petra Nemcova: Growing up in the Czech Republic -- at the time Czechoslovakia -- was a beautiful childhood because I didn't understand the whole concept of communism. I was only 11 when communism fell down and when the Velvet Revolution happened. I had a really beautiful childhood ... I didn't have the great luxury things, we had very little and we counted every penny. But our parents gave us something more valuable than money -- they gave us so much love and that's priceless. We didn't get the opportunity to travel all over the world and were able to travel only within the communist countries. So we went around our country to see different castles, little towns and I loved it. So that made us richer. It also made us appreciate nature because we spent every weekend in nature. And the values you learn there are priceless too. You don't step on flowers, kick on mushrooms, you really respect nature. And the value of appreciation came from not having anything and then having a little bit. Having a clementine for Christmas -- it was an incredible joy and every time I smell a clementine, it brings me back to my childhood. But it was harder for my parents. Because if you weren't part of the system then you didn't get a job and an apartment and it would be really difficult for you. My parents had these passports where every time they would go to these communist meetings they would get a stamp and if you didn't get enough stamps throughout the year, you would get in trouble. CNN: What happened to you in the 2004 tsunami? Petra Nemcova: I lost my partner and physically, my pelvis was broken four times, I was drowning many times throughout the experience. There were hard moments throughout that experience and some sweet ones. Seeing the compassion of other people risking their lives for strangers, there was just a lot of love around in that moment. That's what happens actually if you live through disasters, it brings people together, it shows that we are capable of that compassion, but unfortunately it just goes away after some time. CNN: Tell us about your foundation, Happy Hearts? Petra Nemcova: Happy Hearts is a foundation that I established after the tsunami. It helps children improve their lives after natural disasters through educational and sustainable initiatives. We build or rebuild a school, add computer labs inside and then we build businesses to sustain the school. The education is really a key not just for the children to recover faster from the disaster but also to help them, their families and communities get out of poverty. We help over 23,000 children a year. We give them hope and not just for them but for their parents and communities. The schools elevate the whole community. After the tsunami we went to other countries where disasters happened and one of them was in Indonesia. We work with local partners on the ground and have been able to build 33 kindergartens after the 2005 earthquake and that's something incredible because it really changed so many lives. Our other project is in Peru, where there was an earthquake in 2007 and we have a commitment to build three schools a year. CNN: If you only had 24 hours in Prague, what would you do? Petra Nemcova: First of all I would take my friends and family and I would walk around and go to the Charles Bridge because that is my favorite place. Then I would stop by some exhibitions of some new artist. And then I would go and sit down for some tea perhaps at the Musical House. In the evening I may go to a typical Czech pub and afterwards for a concert because I really love them; they put my mind at ease and inspire me. CNN: How creative is the city? Petra Nemcova: Many people know about Kafka and some of the other famous writers. But there is a lot of interest in music here and in different types of art. That's perhaps because art was suppressed during communist times and you were only allowed to read certain authors. That's why there is such a hunger now for everything that was forbidden. Not just Czech authors but also a lot of American authors because especially anything from U.S. was big taboo and you could not see any movies and you could not listen to any music. I discovered Stevie Wonder seven years ago and I'm still working on learning and seeing more of the great movies. CNN: If Prague were a person, who would it be? Petra Nemcova: I think Prague would be our former president Vaclav Havel. He is a proud person and Prague is a proud city; he's an artist and Prague is artistic; he's an achiever and Prague has achieved so much. He is someone people admire, as they do Prague.","Czech supermodel and philanthropist shows CNN around her ""Golden City,"" Prague .

"(CNN) -- Yume-Hotaru's first novel was a best-seller in Japanese bookstores, and he wrote it entirely with his thumbs. Publishers in Japan were quick to see the potential of putting cellphone novels into print. The 22-year-old who would rather be identified by his pen name than his real one (Yume-Hotaru means ""Dreaming Firefly"" in Japanese) started composing the novel on his cell phone in 2007. Between classes, on the bus or before going to bed at night, he would type single sentences into his phone's tiny keypad, uploading each one straight to the mobile social networking site Mobage-town. The more Yume-Hotaru posted, the more popular his story became. It won a prize and soon publishers approached him, asking if he wanted to turn his digital book into a paper one. By early 2008, his novel ""First Experience,"" a story about love and sex in high school, was a top title in one of Tokyo's biggest bookstores. Since it emerged in Japan nearly a decade ago, the cell phone novel, or keitai shosetsu, has moved from a little-known subgenre to a mainstream literary phenomenon. Keitai shosetsu sites boast billions of monthly users while publishers sell millions of copies of cellular stories taken from phones and turned into paperback. It is even spreading to other countries as other cultures start to take part in a type of composition long considered purely Japanese. As the name suggests, cell phone novels are written entirely on handsets and posted on sites like Maho no i-rando (Magic Island), the first and largest mobile novel portal in Japan. The site has a million titles, 3.5 billion monthly visitors and six million registered users, according to the company. Mobile readers instantly see new chapters as they are added, often adding comments about the direction they think a novel should take. The diary-like stories are written and read mostly by young women in their teens and 20's. Many authors use pen names and claim their stories are at least partially autobiographical. The novels often center on themes that are rarely discussed aloud in Japanese society -- drugs, sex, pregnancy, abortion, rape and disease. ""When they write those novels, they share their secret, personal problems, and when they read by mobile phones, they can hide what they are reading,"" explained Toshie Takahashi, an associate professor of media studies at Rikkyo University in Tokyo. ""They are also involved and engaged with their mobile phones very strongly,"" added Takahashi, noting that 96 percent of high school students own a cell phone in Japan. ""The mobile phone itself is embedded in young people's everyday lives very deeply and also emotionally and physically."" Despite its popularity among young women, a male writer known as Yoshi, widely considered the first cellular novelist, brought the burgeoning genre to light when he self-published ""Deep Love"" in 2002. The story about a prostitute in Tokyo sold nearly 3 million copies and was adapted for film, television and Manga, or Japanese comics. Publishing phenomenon . A struggling Japanese publishing industry was quick to take notice of the growing popularity of keitai shosetsu, especially early works like Yoshi's ""Deep Love."" Many of the popular cell phone novels have since been turned into paperbacks, and bookstores across Japan now have entire sections devoted to the digital-age literary genre. By 2007, half of the country's 10 best-selling novels were written on cell phones, according to book distributor Tohan while last year mobile novels and comics were a $240 million market in Japan, which is over 5 percent of the country's $4.5 billion total mobile content market, according to Japan's Mobile Content Forum. In January 2009, three Japanese mobile phone novel publishers reported collective sales of 1.7 million copies. Publishers, like Goma Books, one of the first to print cell phone novels, have also launched their own keitai shosetsu sites, which they use to sift through for talent whose work will be marketable on bookshelves. Goma's mobile story site Orion carries 20,000 novels and has approximately two million monthly users, according to the company. Goma has also published several top-selling keitai shosetsu, including ""The Red Thread,"" by Mei (also a pen name). Since it was released in 2007, the story, which revolves around the romance of two middle school students, has sold nearly 2 million copies and was adapted for a TV series and movie last December. The publishing house now prints a new mobile novel every month. Some literary purist don't think the cell phone novels constitute real literature, but their popularity is undeniable. ""The sentences may be a bit immature. It doesn't have a major plot line sometimes. It is just love stories of ordinary high school girls, said Aya Tanaka, a spokesperson for Goma. ""But it is kind of like popular comics, it is what the teenagers want to read, and for the publishers, it is quite a big market and it does sell."" Michael Keferl, a trend consultant with Cscout Japan in Tokyo, believes that ""[readers] are participating in the creation of the novel, which is one of the reasons why they buy it afterwards. They are helping to write it and are also witnessing it being written."" Crossing cultures . However some believe the future of keitai shosetsu as one that is quickly following in the footsteps of most teenage fads: A sudden and rapid rise to mass popularity followed by a slow but steady decline to the fringes of the not-so-cool. Last year few mobile novels appeared on best-seller lists while new stories published online have lost their characteristic edginess, said Chiaki Ishihara, a Japanese literature expert at Waseda University in Tokyo who has studied cell phone novels. ""Keitai shosetsu is rapidly declining at this point,"" Ishihara told CNN. ""In a few years, it may not even be considered a subculture."" Others see the cell phone novel moving from an initial boom that peaked around 2007 to a period of market stabilization. ""You are not going to have as many of the big hits as you had before because there are so many titles out,"" said Keferl. ""Things are leveling out now."" While the cell  phone novel market may be cooling in Japan, it is just starting to emerge in other countries, like the United States, where faster networks and cheaper data plans are leading more consumers to use handsets in ways similar to people in Japan. Many companies are starting to launch mobile web sites in the U.S., including DeNA, the Japanese firm that owns Mobage-town, the site where Yume-Hotaru writes his keitai shosetsu. ""What has surprised us is users in America are behaving in a similar way to the Japanese,"" said Dai Watanabe, president of DeNA Global, Inc. ""They are writing about things that are very close to their actual lives. I was surprised to see it is very similar with what is happening in Japan."" Julian Knighten, a 22-year-old who works three jobs, writes his cell phone stories while lying in bed at night in his home outside of Dallas, Texas. He said he had never heard of keitai shosetsu before but likes writing cell phone novels because of the relationship he has with readers and the feedback they give him about his stories. ""It encourages me to write,"" said Knighten. ""And it gives me the chance to escape reality.""","Hugely popular cell phone novels have created new market for publishers in Japan .

"Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- The suspect in Sunday's fatal shooting of four police officers was shot and killed early Tuesday by an officer after the suspect approached him and ""reached into his waist area,"" authorities said in a statement. Although the medical examiner has not formally identified the man shot and killed in south Seattle about 2:45 a.m., detectives recognized him as Maurice Clemmons, sought in the killings of four Lakewood, Washington, police officers shot Sunday at a coffee shop, Seattle police said in the written statement. Pierce County Sheriff's Department spokesman Ed Troyer said earlier Tuesday that Clemmons was carrying a weapon taken from one of the slain officers and had been shot in the abdomen in Sunday's shooting at the Forza Coffee Company in Parkland, Washington. He had had stuffed gauze and cotton into the wound and put duct tape over it, Troyer said Tuesday. Clemmons had been the subject of an intense manhunt for two days. Two people accused of helping Clemmons evade authorities, brothers Eddie and Douglas Davis, appeared in court Tuesday. Both are charged with rendering criminal assistance, a felony. A man who police believe is the getaway car driver was also in custody, along with a second man. Neither has been charged. The men accused of trying to help Clemmons provided medical aid, housing, a cell phone and money and were trying to get him out of the state, Troyer said earlier Tuesday. They also called in false leads to police to divert investigators. Early Tuesday, a patrol officer saw an unoccupied car in south Seattle that was running and had its hood up, police said. He determined the car was stolen and was doing paperwork in his vehicle when he saw a man approach his patrol car from behind on the driver's side, the statement said. The officer got out of the car and ordered the man to stop and show his hands, but the man refused, the statement said. Follow local coverage on CNN affiliate KIRO-TV . ""As the officer was drawing his gun, the suspect reached into his waist area and moved,"" the police statement said. ""The officer fired several times, striking the suspect at least twice."" He was pronounced dead at the scene. The officer is a four-year member of the Seattle police force and is a military veteran, police said. He will be placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure after a shooting involving an officer. Authorities said they regretted the shooting death but are glad the two-day ordeal is over. ""Right now, it's just a feeling of relief,"" said Jim Pugil, the assistant Seattle police chief. ""Another tragic time has come upon us, and we're just happy that it's over."" Additional arrests in the case are likely, Troyer said Tuesday. ""I am thankful the suspect in this horrible crime is no longer a threat to our community,"" Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire said in a statement. ""I hope this provides some closure for the families and colleagues of our fallen officers. ... We should now focus our attention on providing comfort and support to those who have lost a loved one."" Clemmons had made comments before Sunday's shootings that he was going to kill some officers -- comments that were not reported to authorities until after the shootings -- but officials believe he was the lone gunman. ""We don't think anyone helped him plan this murder,"" Troyer said. The manhunt for Clemmons began Sunday after the four Lakewood officers -- three men and a woman -- were gunned down while meeting at the coffee shop before their shifts began. Clemmons was an ex-convict with a long rap sheet in Washington and Arkansas, according to authorities and documents. Clemmons slipped away from a home in Seattle's Leschi neighborhood Sunday night before police surrounded the residence for about 12 hours. He was not found in the home when investigators moved in Monday morning, Seattle police spokesman Jeff Kappel said. Officials said Tuesday that they missed him by mere minutes. Clemmons was accused of child rape and assaulting a police officer in May. He had been released on $150,000 bail five days before the shootings, according to court records. After his arrest, Clemmons' sister told police that he ""had not been himself lately"" and that his behavior was ""unpredictable and erratic."" ""He had said that the Secret Service was coming to get him because he had written a letter to the president,"" an affidavit quoted her as telling investigators. In addition, neighbors had complained that he had been throwing rocks through their windows. Clemmons' wife told deputies that she and her husband had argued over a ""newly discovered child,"" and she suggested that was why he went on his rock-throwing spree, according to an arrest affidavit. In 2000, then-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee commuted a prison sentence for Clemmons, according to documents from the Arkansas Department of Community Correction. Clemmons was sentenced to 95 years, to be served consecutive to time he was already serving from previous convictions, according to the documents. In all, he faced a total of 108 years, Arkansas officials said. He returned to prison in 2001 and was paroled in 2004. Sunday's shooting was the first for the Lakewood Police Department, which was created five years ago for the town of nearly 60,000. The slain officers were identified as Sgt. Mark Renninger, 39; Officer Ronald Owens, 37; Officer Tina Griswold, 40; and Officer Greg Richards, 42. All of them were parents and had been with the department since its inception. ""My worst nightmare has come true,"" said Tiffany Ryan, Griswold's sister. ""I can't tell you how painful it is to lose my sister."" Police said the gunman walked past the officers to the counter as if to order but then pulled a gun out of his coat and began shooting at 8:15 a.m. Two of the officers were ""executed"" as they sat at a table, Troyer said. Another was shot when he stood up, and the fourth was shot after struggling with the gunman all the way out the door, Troyer said. Officials said Tuesday they know which officer shot him but were withholding that information pending conclusive confirmation.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- An elections board certified Kasim Reed on Saturday as the winner of the Atlanta mayoral runoff election by a margin of 620 votes. Barry Garner, director of Fulton County's elections board, told CNN on Saturday that former state senator Reed was declared the winner of last Tuesday's runoff election against City Councilwoman Mary Norwood. Garner said Reed received 42,348 votes compared with Norwood's 41,728. Norwood has until 5 p.m. Tuesday to request a recount, Garner said. He said if a recount is requested, it will begin Wednesday morning. In the initial vote among eight contenders, Norwood received 45 percent of the votes to Kasim Reed's 37 percent. Lisa Borders came in a distant third with 14 percent of the vote, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. A candidate needs 50 percent plus one vote to avert a runoff.

"(CNN) -- Teenagers exchange text messages while driving because, well, they're teenagers and teenagers sometimes do dumb things. But suit-wearing adults who should know better are texting behind the wheel too, driven by grown-up motivations. A sign in San Francisco warns drivers late last year of a new California law prohibiting texting while driving. ""My job has me out on the road for four to five days out of the week,"" Anthony Perry, a director of business development for a Washington-based health care research firm, told CNN in an e-mail sent from his BlackBerry. ""I don't particularly think I am that good at texting while driving but I do it anyway, recognizing the risks."" Those risks are significant. A Virginia Tech Transportation Institute study released this week showed truck drivers are 23 times more likely to be in a crash if they're texting, and several fatal accidents have been blamed on drivers or train operators who were distracted by texting. Nevertheless, for many in business, it seems to be a matter of competitive survival. ""Now with e-mail and with the advent of the BlackBerries and hyper-accessibility, there's this sense that if you don't show that you're always prepared and ready to respond and address an issue, then somehow you're going to be perceived as not being conscientious or not keeping up on things,"" said Tom Britt, a professor of social psychology at Clemson University in South Carolina.  Watch someone attempt to text and drive » . ""I could not imagine doing my job, or living my life, without the aid of a bberry,"" Perry wrote. ""I don't know many who could who are in my line of work."" Entrepreneurs and people in service industries, such as lawyers, may feel the heat more than others, said Dr. Debra Condren, a business psychologist and executive coach with offices in New York and San Francisco, California. ""The constant pressure to be on the grid, especially in this economy -- 'Oh my gosh, has a client called? Has a potential client called? Am I going to lose the job? Am I going to miss an opportunity? -- makes us kind of revert to almost an adolescent mentality in terms of thinking that we're invulnerable [vis a vis] texting and driving,"" she said. But those fears are overblown for most people, she said. ""There's this sense that we're so important that every single moment has to be filled; we can't even pull over or we're going to miss five minutes' driving time or 10 minutes' driving time. The pace is at this breakneck speed,"" said Condren, author of ""Ambition Is Not a Dirty Word,"" a career guide for women. ""The truth is nobody is that important or that in demand that they can't practice safety and good common-sense behaviors."" Condren recently scolded a cabdriver who was trying to program her hotel's address into his GPS device while driving 60 mph. He got a little ""snippy"" with her but put the device down, she said, and she gave him directions to the hotel.  Watch how high the risk really is » . The subject is personal for Condren, whose son Edward was struck four years ago by an SUV whose driver was fishing around on the floor for a dropped cell phone. Edward suffered a broken pelvis and a concussion, but has fully recovered and now is a college student. It's going to take something that drastic to get Mei Lin Walker to quit texting while driving. ""I think the thing that would happen -- this sounds horrible -- that would make me stop texting is if I actually had a wreck or I did run off onto the curb or something crazy like that,"" the Delta Air Lines flight attendant said. ""I try not to do it while I'm driving, but if I'm sitting in traffic and there are a lot of lights I will,"" said Walker, of Decatur, Georgia. ""I do think it is dangerous, and I consciously try not to do it, but then sometimes there's just a text that can't wait."" Walker has never had an accident or even a close call while texting, she said, even though she drives a stick-shift car. Texting is easier than talking on a cell phone, she said, because she can set the device down in mid-text without disrupting the conversation if she needs both hands free for driving. Nevertheless, Walker probably isn't driving as well as she believes she is, Britt said. ""In general, people are overconfident and have a sense that they're capable of doing much more than they really are,"" he said. ""People, especially adults, feel like driving is such an automated skill that basically they could do multiple things in addition to it without performance suffering."" Many drivers do understand the danger and act accordingly. ""It's nearly impossible to text in California while driving,"" said Los Angeles County resident Karen North. ""I can see why they make it a law here for no texting while driving.""  See where laws limit texting while driving » . North said she sends her messages right before heading out. If messages need to be sent en route, she hands her iPhone over to one of her teenage children, who are almost always with her. Both Britt and Condren advocate awareness campaigns based on the Virginia Tech study's findings. It's up to corporate executives to lead the way, Condren said. ""Leaders at the top have to walk their talk and really make it a priority,"" with companywide meetings and periodic reminders, she said. ""It's difficult to change the culture of a particular corporation,"" Britt said. ""That has to start at the top. ... At least have the corporate leadership indicate that if you're actually at the wheel, that responding isn't as important as safety.""","Business people exchange messages while driving despite risk of crashing .

"(CNN) -- David Beckham has promised he will do everything in his power to help England win the bid to stage the 2018 World Cup. The England and LA Galaxy midfielder has been in South Africa with Football Association chief Lord Triesman to promote England's bid ahead of the draw for the 2010 tournament. Beckham was an ambassador for the successful London 2012 Olympic campaign, and now has a similar role in the World Cup bid. The 34-year-old, who was speaking at a Coaching for Hope project in Cape Town, believes ""hard work"" is the key England's bid. ""We can win the campaign with hard work - nothing in life is easy and you have to work for special things to be given to you and we are prepared for that,"" Beckham said. ""Football is in our culture, in our DNA. It's in us from the moment we are brought into this world, from when we are born and that's something we will always have."" Find out all the latest news about the build up to the World Cup in South Africa here. FIFA vice-president Jack Warner, who had previously been critical of England's bid to stage the tournament, said that celebrity appeal can form just as important part of a bid as the quality of the stadiums. ""The stadiums and infrastructure is just one of the things that the bid will be judged on,"" Warner added. ""There is the social responsibility and the legacy that the World Cup leaves and other maters."" ""Celebrities? Of course that will help - isn't that what football is all about?"" FA chief Lord Triesman also appreciates the role that Beckham, who has met with FIFA president Sepp Blatter and Warner while on the trip, can have on charming the relevant parties. ""When he talks to people, even privately, the passion and patriotism shines out of him,"" he said. ""England is one of the few countries with its stadia and its infrastructure that could host a World Cup almost immediately, next week. ""The diversity of cultures around our country is a big thing as well. There are not many countries where you can have Brazil and Portugal and so on coming to our country and for there to be lots of their fans already there. That's a special thing for us.""","David Beckham has promised he will do everything in his power to help England win the bid to stage the 2018 World Cup .

"(CNN)  -- Virgin has secured a partnership with the Brawn Grand Prix team in Formula One racing, Virgin chief Richard Branson announced Saturday. Virgin's sponsorship mark's Richard Branson's first foray into Formula One racing. The move, which had been the subject of speculation, marks Virgin's first foray into F1. Branson made the announcement from Melbourne, where he is attending Saturday's Australian Grand Prix. He announced the news just before the Brawn team secured the first two grid positions after qualifying, with Jenson Button in pole position. ""I have always said I would love to have a Virgin car on the circuit,"" Branson wrote on his blog. ""I am thrilled to be involved with people as skilled as Ross Brawn and his team."" Branson added, ""We are very confident that the Virgin Car driven by Jenson Button and Reubens Barrichello will go from strength to strength this season and look forward to a great future for the Brawn GP team."" Brawn Grand Prix is a newcomer to the F1 world. Run by former Ferrari technical guru Ross Brawn, the group was formed after Honda pulled out of Formula One because of the global economic downturn. Brawn kept the same driver line-up of Brazil's Barrichello, the most experienced driver on the grid, and Button, who has had to play second fiddle following the emergence of world champion and fellow-Briton Lewis Hamilton. Saturday's qualifying positions marked the first time a new team have started their first race from the front row since the 70s, according to Formula1.com. Billionaire Branson is famous for his Virgin brand, which began with music shops and record label now includes airlines and interests in publishing, nightclubs, hotels, and a makeup line. Flight testing is under way for a new Virgin venture, Virgin Galactic, which will launch space tourists into sub orbit. Branson says the service could be ready within two years. Branson, who received a knighthood in 1999, is famous for his daredevil feats, including round-the-world balloon attempts and transatlantic boat races.","Virgin boss Richard Branson announces F1 sponsorship deal with Brawn GP .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- As with many jokes, it started with a small jab at the expense of New Jersey. Talk show host Conan O'Brien is locked in a playful feud with the mayor of Newark, New Jersey. The gags continued Monday night when ""Tonight Show"" host Conan O'Brien ventured into ""the biggest scandal in the country that's now involving a late-night host."" O'Brien was, of course, referring to his continuing comical conflict with the city of Newark, New Jersey, and its mayor, Cory Booker. It all began on September 23, when O'Brien, in his nightly comical spiel, joked that Booker's plan to improve citizens' health care in New Jersey's largest city ""would consist of a bus ticket out of Newark."" The Internet-savvy mayor, who has more than 800,000 followers on Twitter, fired back on YouTube, stating that O'Brien is no longer welcome at Newark International Airport. ""I'm officially putting you on the Newark, NJ, no fly list -- try JFK, buddy,"" Booker quipped. That video has since amassed more than 119,000 hits on YouTube. The verbal melee didn't stop there.  Watch the jousting escalate » . O'Brien retaliated by sarcastically stating that Newark is ""one of America's greatest cities,"" and proceeded to pair its ""thriving arts scene"" with an image of a graffiti-ridden wall and its ""exciting regional cuisine"" with a Dunkin Donuts sign. He then banned Booker from an airport in Burbank, California, near Los Angeles. On October 1, Booker, claiming solidarity with all New Jersey's mayors, retorted by posting another YouTube video outlawing O'Brien from the entire state. ""Now listen, you may like Boardwalk and Park Place, but the only way you're going to get to them is on a Monopoly board,"" the mayor said. O'Brien, forced to pull out the big guns, Friday banished the mayor from California entirely. In his latest barb on Monday, O'Brien revealed that the mayor of a neighboring New Jersey city, Elizabeth, had sent him a letter welcoming him ""with open arms to Elizabeth."" Mayor Chris Bollwage claims that Newark airport's Terminal A actually lies within his municipality and he intends to rename it the Conan O'Brien Terminal if and when the talk show host ever decides to visit. O'Brien then launched a ""campaign to surround and crush"" Newark and the ""drunk on power"" Mayor Booker by making courteous tongue-in-cheek overtures to other adjacent towns, forming a ""geographic toilet seat around the city of Newark."" The charismatic Booker, widely popular in a state often plagued by corrupt politicians, was elected in 2006. He has promoted a sense of urban renewal in Newark, New Jersey's largest city, which has suffered high crime and poverty rates over the past few decades. Booker's office had no statement available early this week regarding the newest swipe at his city. The humorous altercation illustrates a recent shift in the media landscape. ""The Tonight Show,"" catering to a traditional broadcast audience, now competes with the Web's constantly streaming flow of viral videos, which are popular amongst O'Brien's target audience. What will become of the sparring remains to be seen. While O'Brien did invite Booker to be a guest on ""The Tonight Show"" and the mayor extended O'Brien an invitation to Newark, such visits could pose a problem, seeing as how each is banned from the other's state. ""I think we have to meet in neutral territory"" O'Brien said on Friday's show. ""I think we're going to meet in Lebanon, Kansas."" That community is often billed as the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states. On Friday, the dispute was widened by Joe Territo, content director for NJ.com, a Web site affiliated with 13 major New Jersey newspapers. Territo declared through an article on the site that O'Brien is barred from using NJ.com because of his anti-Jersey sentiments. ""Perhaps O'Brien has never been to NJ.com, and perhaps he has never been interested in visiting NJ.com,"" Territo wrote. ""Given the nature of forbidden fruit, no doubt he wants to use NJ.com now, and he cannot, for he is banned."" ""We're hitting Conan hard, and where it hurts most: Right smack in the Internet,"" he said. On Monday's show O'Brien wrapped up his latest Newark segment, but not the feud, by declaring, ""It's your move, Mayor Booker.""","Conan O'Brien has been trading barbs with the mayor of Newark, New Jersey .

"(CNN)  -- World number two Novak Djokovic beat John Isner in a grueling four hour 16 minute encounter to secure Serbia's passage into the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup on Sunday. Serbia led the United States 2-1 overnight in Belgrade with Djokovic favored to beat the giant Isner to clinch the tie, but he was given an almighty scare before winning 7-5 3-6 6-3 6-7 6-4. They will now play Croatia at home on July 9-11 in the quarterfinals of the premier team event in tennis after their first-ever victory in the World Group. Djjokovic, urged on by a partisan home crowd, looked headed for a routine win as he took the opening set, but he was broken twice in the second as Isner leveled. Djokovic returned the compliment in the third set to lead two sets to one, but he could not force home the advantage and he lost a fourth set tiebreak 8-6 as Isner set up a decider. A single break in the first game gave Djokovic a crucial advantage, but his American opponent proceeded to save six match points before finally netting a forehand, the home hero sinking to his knees after an exhausting ordeal. The defeat means Patrick McEnroe's U.S. team face a relegation playoff later this year to maintain their record of playing in the World Group every year. In other ties, defending champions Spain shrugged off the absence of the injured Rafael Nadal to beat Switzerland 4-1 to set-up a quarterfinal clash with France.

"(CNN)  -- Former Argentina international defender Fernando Caceres is fighting for his life in a Buenos Aires hospital after being shot in the head during an armed robbery. The 40-year-old Caceres, who played for Argentina in the 1994 World Cup, was gunned down as a gang tried to steal his BMW car in the early hours of Sunday morning. A bullet has reportedly entered his head through his right eye, and he remains in a coma in a grave condition. Caceres was visited by his former Boca Juniors teammate and national coach Diego Maradona, who clearly distressed, told reporters outside the hospital that crime was rife in the Argentine capital. ""This is a time bomb, going out is a constant danger,"" Maradona told television station TyCSports. ""This happens every day, nobody does anything and something must be done. ""Caceres is in the hands of God and I hope it helps,"" Maradona added. The attack happened in the Fort Apache area of Buenos Aires, which is where Manchester City star Carlos Tevez grew up, and is notorious for high crime levels. Players from two of his former clubs, Argentinos Juniors and Independiente displayed a banner of support for him ahead of their later match in the Argentine league on Sunday. Caceres won the league title with River Plate in 1991 and the European Cup Winners Cup with Spanish side Real Zaragoza in 1995. He played 24 games for Argentina, helping them to the Copa America in 1993 before appearing at the World Cup finals in the United States a year later. Caceres ended his playing career at his original club of Argentinos Juniors in 2007 and has been coaching at Independiente.","Former Argentina international Fernando Caceres in grave condition in hospital .

"(CNN)  -- A former ""enemy combatant"" who was held in a South Carolina Naval brig for six years with no charges was sentenced Thursday to eight years and four months in prison, a Justice Department spokesman said. Ali al-Marri pleaded guilty in federal court in Illinois in May to conspiring to provide material support to a terrorist organization. He could have received a maximum of 15 years in prison. ""This administration is committed to bringing terrorists to justice for their crimes,"" Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said. ""Al-Marri, who has been in U.S. custody since December 2001, was dispatched by the highest levels of al Qaeda to carry out its terrorist objectives in America."" A defense attorney for the Qatari citizen, who had been a student at Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, when he was arrested, said the judge ruled on a lesser sentence to reflect the nearly six years al-Marri already spent at the Naval brig in Charleston, South Carolina. ""We're pleased with the result,"" said the attorney, Larry Lustberg. ""Mr. al-Marri is also very pleased."" Al-Marri was transferred to a federal prison in Illinois in March after President Obama ordered a review of his case. The case was ultimately referred to the Justice Department, which filed charges. The Pentagon said he trained at a terror camp in Afghanistan, met al Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and ""volunteered for a martyr mission,"" according to court documents filed earlier in the case. According to a copy of his plea agreement, al-Marri admitted that he ""knowingly conspired and agreed with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed"" to provide support to al Qaeda and to work under the organization's direction and control. ""Between 1998 and 2001, the defendant attended various training camps because he wished to engage in jihad,"" the document said. While in the training camps and in al Qaeda safe houses in Pakistan, he was known by the name Abdul-Rahman al-Qatari, according to the plea agreement. Mohammed approached al-Marri in 2001 about his offer to assist al Qaeda, the plea agreement said. ""The defendant was instructed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to enter the United States no later than September 10, 2001, with an understanding that he was to remain in the United States for an undetermined length of time,"" the documents said. Al-Marri applied to Bradley using the same e-mail address he used to communicate with Mohammed, the plea agreement said. At Bradley, he ""rarely attended classes and was in a failing status by the end of his first semester."" On September 21, 2001, al-Marri traveled to another central Illinois university and created five e-mail accounts under different aliases, the documents said. ""By this time, the defendant knew that al Qaeda was responsible for the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and fully understood why Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had directed him to be in the United States before that date."" He used the new e-mail accounts to inform Mohammed of his whereabouts and activities, and also gave him his cell phone number in encoded format, according to the plea agreement. In addition, he conducted online research ""related to various cyanide compounds. The defendant's focus was on various cyanide substances ... the defendant reviewed toxicity levels, the locations where these items could be purchased, and specific pricing of the compounds,"" the documents said. He also explored obtaining sulfuric acid. An almanac found at al-Marri's residence was bookmarked ""at pages showing dams, waterways and tunnels in the United States,"" the plea agreement said. Al-Marri initially was arrested on credit card fraud charges in December 2001. But his continued confinement without charges mushroomed into a major legal case before federal prosecutors filed charges in February. The Supreme Court ruled on March 6 that al-Marri's case was rendered moot by a decision to indict him on federal conspiracy charges, and granted the Obama administration's request to dismiss his challenge of the president's unilateral authority to detain him indefinitely without charges. He was transferred to civilian custody and taken to Illinois in March. The court's ruling, however, meant that the larger constitutional issue of the president's power to detain accused terrorists and other criminals in the United States remains unresolved. CNN's Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","Ali al-Marri sentenced for charges of conspiring to provide support to terrorism .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq has appointed its first ambassador to Kuwait in two decades, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. Mohammed Hussein Bahr Al-Ulum was appointed to the post, the ministry said. While Iraq has had an embassy and a chargé d'affaires in Kuwait since the regime of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein fell in 2003, it has not had an ambassador there since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. That invasion resulted in the United States' launching Operation Desert Storm, its first Iraq war, in 1991. Kuwaiti's Kuna state news agency also reported the appointment, saying, ""Iraqi-Kuwaiti relations have been developing since the fall of the Baath regime, with both nations expressing desires to develop bilateral relations."" In February 2009, a Kuwaiti envoy made his country's highest-level visit to Iraq since the invasion. Sheikh Mohammed Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah, Kuwait's deputy prime minister and foreign minister, said at the time that Kuwait wanted to strengthen and develop ties between the two nations, and congratulated Iraq on its recent provincial elections. ""This is Iraq which we have wagered on and we congratulate the Iraqis for this,"" al-Sabah said, according to Kuwait's official news agency. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who met with the delegation during the trip last year, said in a statement he told the Kuwaitis that the Hussein regime ""harmed Arab relations."" ""Some Arabs still view Iraq the same way they did under Saddam, but we tell them Iraq today is built on a constitution and on democracy,"" al-Maliki said at the time.","Iraq has not had ambassador to Kuwait since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 .

"(CNN)  -- An organization of Christian physicians argued Wednesday against an impending rollback of a federal rule allowing health care workers to refuse to provide certain reproductive services, saying it's discriminatory. The rule protects the rights of health care providers who refuse to participate in certain procedures. The Bush White House proposed the rule in August, and it was enacted January 20, the day President Obama took office. It expanded on a 30-year-old law establishing a ""conscience clause"" for health care professionals who don't want to perform abortions. Under the rule, workers in health care settings -- from doctors to janitors -- can refuse to provide services, information or advice to patients on subjects such as contraception, family planning, blood transfusions and even vaccine counseling if they are morally against it. The Obama administration is expected to reverse the rule shortly, touching off a new wave of heated debate over what remains one of the most sensitive and emotional hot-button issues in American politics. "" 'Right of conscience' is under attack, and that is dangerous for our country, our health care system and our patients,"" said Dr. David Stevens, head of the 15,000-member Christian Medical Association. ""When the state demands that we surrender our conscience, it becomes totalitarian and dangerous. Do we want our professional schools to ethically neuter doctors of all moral convictions that are not approved by the government?""  Watch CNN's Sanjay Gupta discuss the 'conscience clause' » . Stevens was speaking on behalf of Freedom to Care, an umbrella organization of 36 groups working to prevent a rollback of the rule.  Watch why one pharmacist says the ""conscience clause"" is needed » . Many health care organizations, including the American Medical Association, believe that health care providers have an obligation to their patients to advise them of the options despite their own beliefs. And critics of the current rule argue that there are laws on the books protecting health-care professionals when it comes to refusing care for personal reasons. ""We don't make God-like decisions. ... That's not what it's about for us. It's about helping the patient make their own decision. ... No one appointed us to be the ultimate person to pass judgment,"" said Mary Jean Schumann, a member of the American Nurses Association. Dr. Suzanne T. Poppema, board chairwoman of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health, praised Obama ""for placing good health care above ideological demands."" ""Physicians across the country were outraged when the Bush administration, in its final days, limited women's access to reproductive health care,"" she said. ""Hundreds of doctors protested these midnight regulations and urged President Obama to repeal them quickly. We are thrilled that President Obama [is taking steps] to ensure that our patients' health is once again protected."" Stevens argued that there is ""a well-funded and increasingly successful effort to discriminate against health care professionals based upon their deeply held religious and moral beliefs."" Rescinding the rule will send ""a clear message,"" he said: ""It's open season on health care professionals of conscience. Discriminate at will. If anyone should understand the ugliness of discrimination, it is our first African-American president."" Stevens predicted that a large number of specialists in obstetrics and gynecology would leave the medical profession if the rule is repealed. A final announcement from the Obama administration is expected with the conclusion of a 30-day public comment period on the proposed rule change. ""We do not want to impose new limitations on services that would allow providers to refuse to provide to women and their families services like family planning and contraception that would actually help prevent the need for an abortion in the first place,"" a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official said in February. CNN's Saundra Young contributed to this report.","Christian doctors group says impending rollback of conscience rule is discriminatory .

"(CNN) -- Philippines President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared martial law beginning Friday night in the southern province of Maguindanao, where 57 people were killed last week, an army spokesman told CNN Saturday. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner Jr. said martial law -- under which police can make arrests without a warrant -- went into effect at 9 p.m. Congress would have to approve any extension beyond 60 days. Brawner said the measure was invoked to impose peace on the region after the unrest, which led to troops being mobilized. ""Life is to resume normally and martial law is established to prevent new violence, with troops on the ground monitoring any possible violence breakout,"" he said. ""But the civilian government will be running the affairs of the province, not a military governor."" Military police have detained three brothers and their father on suspicion of involvement in the unrest: Akmad Ampatuan, the vice governor of Maguindanao; Anwar Ampatuan, the mayor of Sherif Auguak, Maguindanao's capital; and Zaldy Ampatuan, governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the patriarch, became ill and was hospitalized after he too was taken in. ""Local government will function, it will prevent armed groups from wreaking havoc ... and it will allow the officials to search and find the guilty parties,"" Brawner said. Security forces on Friday searched the home of Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay and son of the provincial governor of Maguindanao, according to Brawner. Authorities say Andal Ampatuan Jr. directed the November 23 politically motivated killings. Weapons were found in the house, Brawner said. On Tuesday, Philippine authorities charged Ampatuan and other suspects with 25 counts of murder in the killings. Still more suspects were taken into custody Friday. The Philippine military is investigating its own forces in connection with the case as well, Brawner said. The National Bureau of Investigation has moved a third witness to Manila for questioning, the Philippines News Agency reported Thursday. ""At the moment, we are interviewing the witness, so that we would know what he knows about the incident in Maguindanao,"" NBI Director Nestor Mantaring said. The witness claimed to have been at the site during the massacre. ""He is very vital,"" Mantaring said. ""From what I know ... he knows a lot of information regarding the incident."" Among the victims in the massacre were the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan, the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself. Witnesses and local officials have blamed the younger Ampatuan, a longtime ally of the Philippines president and a known warlord. They said the killings were an attempt to block Mangudadatu from challenging him in the May gubernatorial election. Also killed were a dozen journalists who had accompanied the women. Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the Philippines. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation. Suspicion fell on Ampatuan after a government construction vehicle was found at the hastily dug mass grave that held the bodies of the massacre victims.

"The Hague, Netherlands (CNN) -- Bosnian war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic launched a full-throated attack on the International War Crimes Tribunal Tuesday, as he appeared at a hearing to discuss his refusal to appear for trial. He said he ""cannot take part in something that has been bad from the start, and where my fundamental rights have been violated."" Karadzic, who is accused of responsibility for the worst massacre in Europe since World War II, says he has had insufficient time to prepare his defense. He is representing himself. But Judge O-Gon Kwon told Karadzic it was the court, not the defendant, who decides when the case is ready for trial. He advised Karadzic to participate in order to get a fair trial. The judges will decide by the end of the week how to deal with the former Bosnian leader's boycott of the proceedings, Judge Kwon said before adjourning the trial for the day. Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader during the bloody breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, faces 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Memories of the massacre remain raw. Watch the video . The charges stem partly from the massacre of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys at the town of Srebrenica, in what is know Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1995. Karadzic has been insisting he has not had enough time to prepare for the trial, saying there are 1.3 million pages of documents to study. He denied stalling, and said imposing a lawyer on him would not help. ""It is with joy that I am preparing for these proceedings,"" he said through a translator. ""Nobody can get through this material better than I can, no lawyer. The best possible solution would be that the defense be given sufficient time"" to prepare. He rejected prosecutor Hildegard Uertz-Retzlaff's assertion that Tuesday's proceedings constituted part of the trial. ""I hope that this is not some kind of a trick,"" he said. ""I am attending a status conference hearing."" The court cannot force a defendant to appear. Karadzic, as a ""self-representing accused,"" is the only one who can cross-examine witnesses and speak in court about the substance of the charges against him. However, judges can impose a lawyer on Karadzic if he continues to refuse to cooperate. The trial began without his presence on October 26, more than a year after Karadzic was captured in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. He had been on the run for more than 13 years and was living in disguise in Belgrade, practicing alternative medicine at a clinic. Karadzic faces life in prison if he is convicted. The court cannot impose the death penalty. The 1992-95 Bosnian conflict was the longest of the wars spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. Backed by the government of then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Bosnian Serb forces seized control of more than half the country and launched a campaign against the Muslim and Croat populations. Karadzic was removed from power in 1995, when the Dayton Accords that ended the Bosnian war barred anyone accused of war crimes from holding office. Milosevic died in 2006 while on trial at The Hague.","Radovan Karadzic appears at hearing at International Criminal Tribunal to discuss his refusal to appear for war crimes trial .

"Portland, Oregon (CNN) -- Two F-15 fighter jets escorted a passenger jet that had been headed for Hawaii back to Portland International Airport in Oregon after a passenger in coach became ""uncooperative,"" an airline official said Wednesday. Hawaiian Airlines Flight 39 took off from Portland at 10:10 a.m. with 231 passengers and a crew of 10 when -- 90 minutes into the flight -- its captain decided to turn around the Boeing 767, said Keoni Wagner, the airline's vice president of public affairs. The fighter jets intercepted the plane at 1 p.m., North American Aerospace Defense Command said in a written statement. It landed at 1:16 p.m. without further incident, the TSA said. The military decided that fighters should accompany the flight after receiving ""indicators"" of a problem, said Lt. Cmdr. Gary Ross, a NORAD spokesman. He declined to elaborate on those indicators but noted that NORAD often must make decisions with limited amounts of time and information about whether fighter jets should accompany commercial flights that may be experiencing problems. ""There was little time to react,"" he said. ""The prudent thing to do was to scramble"" the jets. Upon the plane's return, the passenger -- a 56-year-old Salem, Oregon, man -- was escorted from the plane with his female companion without incident, the FBI and the Port of Portland said in a joint statement. The FBI said it was not releasing his name because he had not been charged. FBI agents and Port officers interviewed the passenger and his companion, the flight crew and others, then released the two and referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney's Office for review. Local and federal officers searched the plane, then allowed it to depart again for Hawaii, absent the pair. Oregon Air National Guard spokesman Sgt. John Hughel said command post officials told him they did not know who had placed the call for the escort. In a statement, the Transportation Security Administration said the captain decided to return the plane to Portland ""due to a suspicious passenger who made threatening remarks and refused to store his carry-on bag."" Port of Portland Public Information Officer Martha Richmond told CNN that the plane was turned around ""due to concerns the crew had."" Hawaiian Airlines spokesman Wagner said pilots occasionally return a jet to the airport from which it took off. But, he said he had never known one of the flights to be escorted by fighter jets. ""That's new for us,"" he said. John Cornelio, also a NORAD spokesman, said the command routinely monitors events in the air via the Domestic Events Network, a sort of party line that includes representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies involved in national security. The FAA acknowledged last November that it notified military authorities 69 minutes after losing radio contact with Northwest Flight 188, which had overflown its destination of Minneapolis-St. Paul airport. Under standard procedures, the FAA managers should have reported the incident to the Domestic Events Network five to 10 minutes after losing contact with the flight. Radio contact was eventually restored and the plane was redirected to its destination, where it landed without incident. Afterward, the FAA promised to take steps to prevent a repeat of that failure. The incident was one of two that occurred Wednesday. A Northwest Airlines flight preparing to take off from Miami International Airport in Florida for Detroit's Wayne County International Airport instead taxied back to the gate after a passenger ""was heard making inappropriate remarks and acting disruptively,"" the airport said in an incident statement. At the gate, local law enforcement and TSA personnel met the aircraft and all passengers were taken off the plane. The passenger and three companions were questioned by Miami Dade County police. The aircraft was searched and cleared for its flight. CNN's Mike M. Ahlers contributed to this story.","NEW: NORAD says decision made after receiving ""indicators"" of a problem .

"CABANATUAN CITY, Philippines (CNN) -- Typhoon Parma crossed the northern tip of the already storm-battered Philippines Saturday afternoon and early Sunday, killing three people, according to local media. A NASA satellite image shows Typhoon Parma as it headed toward the Philippines on Friday. Parma made landfall Saturday afternoon in a rural region of fishermen and farmers in Luzon, the largest of the Philippine islands. Tens of thousands of people to fled their homes for safer shelter. Winds whipped the coastline and felled power lines in northernmost Cagayan Province. Debris littered the roads, making evacuations even more difficult. At 5 a.m. Sunday (5 p.m. Saturday ET), Parma, known locally as Typhoon Pepeng, had maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometers per hour (75 mph) with gusts as high as 148 kilometers (92 mph) as the eye began to leave land, heading to the northeast, according to the U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Parma avoided a direct hit on heavily populated Manila, but the real menace in the Philippines capital was not wind. It was water, and there was no escape from it. Parma was expected to dump as much as 8 to 20 inches of rain in areas still water-logged from last week's Typhoon Ketsana. That storm resulted in the heaviest rainfall in 40 years and at one point, 80 percent of Manila was submerged. Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro appealed to Filipinos to remain in shelters even if they were in cities and towns not directly in Parma's path. He said he was worried about massive flooding and possible mudslides in mountainous regions. The government deployed 10,000 troops to help with rescue and relief operations as frightened Filipinos prepared for the worst. World Vision, the Christian humanitarian organization, was planning to launch relief operations Saturday evening in Isabela Province, one of the areas slammed by Parma. The group also plans assistance for nearby Cagayan province, whose capital, Tuguegarao, is being hit hard by Parma's strong winds. Arturo Fidelino, a telecommunications executive in Manila, described panicked people rushing to stock up on essential goods -- drinking water, canned food and electrical supplies. ""We had a traumatic experience when we had Ketsana,"" he said. ""We don't want that to happen again."" President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo placed the country ""under the state of calamity."" Macapagal-Arroyo said disaster-relief crews in vulnerable areas must be equipped with life-saving kits, boats, portable generators and trucks. Ketsana, which swallowed whole houses and buses over the weekend, killed 246 in the Philippines. It later strengthened into a typhoon. An additional 38 are missing, the National Disaster Coordinating Council said. The storm affected nearly 2 million people and forced the evacuation of 567,000. CNN's Eunice Yoon and Pamela Boykoff in Cabantuan City, and Josh Levs in Atlanta contributed to this report.","NEW: 3 dead in Philippines from Typhoon Parma, local media report .

"(CNN) -- Digital cameras are now as common and affordable to the average family as the Polaroid of the '60s. A self-admitted tech geek, Chris Pirillo is president of Lockergnome.com, a blogging network. Best thing about 'em? You don't even have to take your film in to the corner drugstore to get developed -- because digital cameras don't rely on film to make their pictures ""stick."" Thanks to technology, the entire process, from clicking the shutter to printing the pictures, is now entirely within the power of the consumer. Maybe you've taken a picture that's just not as perfect as you'd like it to be. Instead of being at the mercy of a darkroom-shackled photo lackey to improve upon it, you've got more tools than ever to take it upon yourself to edit, store, organize, and share your images with the world. Here's a roundup of 10 free, and mostly free, online tools for the budding digital photographer: . 1. Picnik -- Summed up from the site: ""Picnik makes your photos fabulous with easy to use yet powerful editing tools. Tweak to your heart's content, then get creative with oodles of effects, fonts, shapes, and frames."" If you already use Flickr for your photos (here's what I do with mine), you're only a click away from taking a Picnik. That's how I discovered it, and it's worked fairly well for me to this point. 2. Splashup-- Splashup ""is a powerful editing tool and photo manager. With all the features professionals use and novices want, it's easy to use, works in real-time, and allows you to edit many images at once."" You'd wonder how something this extensive could be free - and it all runs within the browser. 3. FotoFlexer -- FotoFlexer bills itself as ""the world's most advanced online image editor."" With it, you can edit photos from Photobucket, MySpace, Facebook, Flickr, Picasa, and ""more places."" I'm not quite sure what ""more places"" means, but last I checked, this does not include a phone booth. 4. Pixlr -- ""Pixlr is a free online photo editor; jump in and start: edit, adjust, filter. It's just what you imagine!"" Alexa says it's the ""fastest growing photo editor online."" If these resources are starting to look similar to your eye, remember you don't have to use all of them - just pick the one that works best for your needs. 5. flauntR-- flauntR is a suite that includes the ability to edit images, add effects, add text, and print the results on everything from mugs to posters. You might be overwhelmed with the options here, but... isn't that better than being underwhelmed? 6. Photoshop Express-- Adobe's Photoshop was really the first image editor of its kind to herald in the age of digital photography, though it was designed for professionals and its endless options could be daunting (and bank- breakingly expensive) for the layman. Now, Photoshop.com is on the Web to help that very same layman -- for free or plus levels of membership -- edit, store, and share his photos. Lots of helpful tutorials promise to guide the casual user through editing pickles. 7. PiZap-- PiZap's tagline is ""fun with photos made easy."" It's another flavor of photo editor/storage center that, like flauntR, allows you to print the results to mugs, bags, and t-shirts. PiZap invites developers to check out its API for more personalization options (which is usually a good thing). 8. Aviary-- Aviary lets you: ""edit images, create mind-blowing effects, design logos, find colors, collaborate, and more. All you need is a Web browser."" This particular brand looks to be the one to beat, as they have several different tools in development. I'm guessing that within five years, this one is going to be at the top of every person's list of Web-based image editors. 9. DrPic-- DrPic says it's ""the easiest free online picture editor"" and that it has ""processed over five million pictures."" I say they're easy enough, but not necessarily THE easiest. Everything's relative, no? 10. Cameroid -- Cameroid lets you ""take crazy (or not) snaps with your webcam straight from your browser."" I featured this one in a CNN.com live video a while ago, and it certainly deserves to be mentioned again. If you're looking for something else to do with your webcam, give it a cameroid (which isn't as painful as it might sound). As you can see, there are plenty of options for photo editing, storing, and sharing out there. Some are going to fit your personal workflow more neatly than others, so it's worth it to try a few and see what works best for your needs. Or maybe you swear by something that I totally missed? Don't be a miser - share it with the rest of the class! We'd love to know about it.","Tech enthusiast Chris Pirillo suggests 10 free online digital photographry tools .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- U.S. helicopters carrying food hovered above the ground in one area of the battered Haitian capital on Saturday, flinging out boxes to the anxious crowd. It was a chaotic scene as hundreds of Haitians without food and water for four days swarmed toward the boxes, ignoring the wind and dust kicked up from the helicopters' blades.  A similar scene erupted Friday when a food convoy with the World Food Programme was forced to leave an area after men in the crowd starting pushing and shoving their way to the trucks. Elsewhere, people stood in long, orderly lines for food, according to a CNN crew, although anxiety about whether there was enough to go around permeated the wait. In Petionville, a suburb of Port-au-Prince, U.S. troops handed out about 2,500 meals Saturday, before they ran out. Seventy soldiers arrived with the Army's 82nd Airborne Division in Petionville to set up a distribution base and a landing zone for helicopters. They began handing out meals about 2 p.m. ""Our goal is to get supplies out to the people who need it the most,"" Col. Mike Foster said. ""We got a good start."" Authorities set up more than a dozen aid distribution points across battered Port-au-Prince, as aid workers toted medical supplies into the battered island nation. Still, although some progress could be observed four days after Tuesday's devastating earthquake, problems persisted. Get the latest developments on Haiti . A CNN crew observed U.N. World Food Programme personnel who were trying to move food from a warehouse damaged from the earthquake. The building has large cracks up its side, weakening the walls. Its doors could not be forced fully open to allow a forklift through, so workers were painstakingly hand-carrying the supplies out. Despite the difficulties, the Haitian ambassador to the United States, Raymond Joseph, said he did not believe that violence will increase, as long as distribution of food continues. ""I think it won't get any more violent than it is now,"" he said. Also Saturday, former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush kicked off a fundraising drive -- a donation push called the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund, similar to the appeal led by Clinton and Bush's father, former President George H.W. Bush, for the victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami. The drive was announced at the White House, with President Obama flanked by Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush. ""We're moving forward with one of the largest relief efforts in our history to save lives and to deliver relief that averts an even larger catastrophe,"" Obama said. Obama said his predecessors will tap into ""the incredible generosity, the ingenuity, the can-do spirit"" of Americans.  See full coverage of Haiti . The leaders said the best way for Americans to help Haiti is to donate money. ""I know a lot of people want to send blankets or water,"" Bush said. ""Just send your cash."" Aid delivery has been slowed by damaged roads, the destroyed port and bottlenecks at the airport. As TV images showed people jostling for aid, U.S. officials reiterated what they said has been a continuation of relief efforts: Ongoing search and rescue operations; the establishment of 14 aid distribution points; finding alternatives to the damaged port, distributing water containers, water purification units, medical supplies, and establishing medical clinics and field hospitals. Israel was establishing a field hospital to treat thousands of victims from the earthquake, expected to absorb 500 casualties a day. The U.N. World Food Programme said it plans to reach 2 million people ""with one-week rations of ready-to-eat food,"" and UNICEF said it is distributing water purification tablets, dehydration salts and other supplies, specifically to halt diarrhea infections and diseases. The U.S. Southern Command said the military is supplying many resources. About 4,200 U.S. military personnel are currently supporting task force operations, and 6,300 military personnel are scheduled to arrive by Monday, the command said. Aid efforts from the USS Carl Vinson, an aircraft carrier off the coast of Haiti, were in full gear Saturday, with flights transporting concrete-breaking equipment, medical supplies and water. Some of those flights are ferrying aid from the airport to the surrounding region and choppers have rescued two American citizens. The U.S. Agency for International Development said Saturday that the USS Carl Vinson has delivered more than 30 pallets of relief supplies for transport by helicopters. The U.S. Naval Ship Comfort pushed out of the Port of Baltimore for Haiti on Saturday and is expected to arrive late next week. A full-scale medical hospital, the craft is equipped with one of the largest trauma facilities in the United States. It was in Port-au -Prince in 2007, and again in 2009, on humanitarian missions, and its medical workers tended to many Haitians during those visits. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Haiti on Saturday, with top relief officials and aid. She returned to the States later Saturday with Americans who had been evacuated, State Department officials said. USAID chief, Rajiv Shah, who as traveling with Clinton, said some roads have been cleared in Haiti and that water purifications systems have been sent. A major shipment of medical aid was being trucked to Haiti through the Dominican Republic, which shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti, a Red Cross spokesman said. Six truckloads of ""urgently needed medical equipment,"" including a field hospital, and 50 people specializing in health, water, and sanitation, were en route, he said. A Finnish Red Cross plane also landed in Port-au-Prince with a ""badly needed mobile medical clinic, he said.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Deadly blasts targeting foreign nationals in the Afghan capital Friday killed at least 17 people and wounded many others. Authorities were trying to determine how many people died and the nationalities of those slain. Kabir Al-Amiri, an employee at Kabul hospital, said eight Indians and one Pakistani national were among the dead. Afghan Interior Ministry officials said an Italian was killed, and the Indian Embassy said four Indians were killed in the attack. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attacks near the Safi Landmark Hotel in the neighborhood of Shahr-E-Naw, where there are a number of government buildings and U.N. offices as well as supermarkets, banks, diplomatic facilities and villas for well-to-do Afghans. The force of the first explosion -- at about 6:30 a.m. (9 p.m. Thursday ET) -- shook parts of the Afghan capital as windows shattered and smoke billowed. The sound of gunfire filled the air. The attack started with a suicide car bomb and four suicide bombers with explosive-laden vests, said Taliban spokesman Zaidullah Mujahid. Three of the bombers were killed, he said. About 20 minutes later, a second large explosion occurred. Afghan police blocked off roads leading to the area of the blasts.

"(CNN) -- ""The Blind Side"" could have been filmed anywhere, says Tim Bourne, an independent producer who worked on the film. But there's a reason producers brought the project to Georgia: money. ""There's nothing in [the movie] that couldn't have been shot in any midrange urban setting. The reason, and the sole reason, it was shot in Georgia was the tax incentives,"" he said. Georgia boasts one of the highest tax credits in the United States: a 20 percent base tax credit, with an additional 10 percent if a Georgia logo appears somewhere in the project. The Oscar-nominated ""Blind Side"" is one of many films that's taken advantage of the incentives to shoot in the Empire State of the South, incentives that also include a diverse set of locations, state-of-the-art facilities and large production crews. Recently, another production, ""Hall Pass,"" written by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (""There's Something About Mary""), started filming in the Atlanta area. The film, starring Owen Wilson and Jenna Fischer, is about a woman who gives her husband permission to have an affair. It called for a New England location -- standard for the brothers, who are from Rhode Island -- but tax incentives led the production crew south, producers said. Georgia is far from the only state offering filmmakers opportunities to leave Hollywood. Indeed, it's one of 44 states offering incentives in hopes of attracting projects that will help their economies, according to the Tax Foundation. ""No one is trying to compete with L.A. from a technical standpoint,"" Bourne said. ""They're certainly competing from a financial standpoint, though. The name of the game is all about tax incentives. It's the sad truth. ""Films are made in a particular place strictly because of financial rebates,"" he continued. ""If, tomorrow, Louisiana or ... any state with a crew base, rather, came up with a better incentive program, that's where the work would be -- overnight."" Incentives differ from state to state. In most cases, filmmakers are able to apply for a tax credit or rebate as long as they meet the state's minimum standards for expenditures and utilize local crews, some of whom don't belong to unions. However, Bill Thompson, deputy commissioner at the Georgia Film, Music and Digital Entertainment Office, said bigger production companies usually prefer to work with union workers. Louisiana, one of the first states to develop an incentive program eight years ago, has found exposure in front of the camera with films such as ""Ray"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" ""Green Lantern,"" set for release in 2011, is one of many projects whose makers opted to film in Louisiana after the state increased its film production tax credit to 30 percent in 2009, said Chris Stelly, director of the Louisiana Office of Film and TV. But Louisiana doesn't just attract projects because of the state's high tax credit, he said. ""No matter how big your incentive is, if someone doesn't have a good experience, they're not going to be back,"" he said. Warner Bros. Entertainment is what Stelly calls a repeat customer. Michael Walbrecht, vice president of Studio & Production Affairs at Warner Bros., said the company brings a lot of projects to Louisiana. It's the third most popular place the company films, behind Los Angeles and New York. ""So far, we've had great experiences in the [Southeast],"" Walbrecht said. There's no denying the tremendous impact the film industry has had on each state. Hotels, rental cars, restaurants, equipment rentals, local crews, props, wardrobes and local extras are just some of the ways the industry gives back to the area it films in. According to the Web site for Georgia's Film, Music & Digital Entertainment Office, TV networks, Hollywood studios, production companies and independent producers invested more than $521 million in Georgia in fiscal year 2008-09; the state estimates the economic impact of this investment at $929 million. Louisiana has experienced economic success, as well. Its Economic Development department's Web site says the incentives have generated thousands of jobs and more than $2 billion since the program began in 2002. ""With some of the bigger movies, [there are] hundreds of extras on set,"" Thompson said. ""Those people all get paid something per day. This is especially a big deal in small towns that have never had a film [shoot] there. To spend a few million dollars in a rural area [makes a big difference]."" Even California, the home of the business, has gotten into the act. The state recently introduced a 20 percent tax credit, though its incentives aren't as broad as in other states. For example, TV shows to air on basic cable qualify for the credit, whereas shows on broadcast networks do not. Walbrecht said the amount of larger movies and TV shows filming in smaller states will continue to rise, which is one reason California was prompted to create incentives. ""They realized their iconic industry was moving elsewhere,"" he said. Meanwhile, away from Hollywood, the competition is getting stiffer. North Carolina became a major player in the filmmaking business thanks to such productions as the TV show ""Dawson's Creek,"" which filmed in the coastal city of Wilmington and helped create a thriving film industry there. So when ""The Last Song"" -- set in Wilmington -- began filming in seaside Savannah, Georgia, hard feelings were inevitable. ""You can't dwell on what you lost; you have to keep going and move forward,"" said Aaron Syrett, director of the North Carolina Film Office. ""It happens all the time, to every state."" Legislation to raise the 15 percent tax credit was proposed before ""The Last Song"" chose not to film in North Carolina. The state's new refund, 25 percent, went into effect January 1. ""We're not trying to [have] the highest refund. We're trying to be the smartest,"" Syrett said. In other words, offer a hefty tax rebate -- and roll camera.","Forty-four states offer tax credits to filmmakers in hopes of attracting projects .
Georgia boasts one of highest tax returns in United States, up to 30 percent .
Louisiana was one of first states to develop incentive program eight years ago ."
"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai made an unannounced visit to Marjah on Sunday to see the gains made after a massive military offensive by Afghan and international troops to wrest control of the southern city from the Taliban. Karzai toured the city in Helmand province with Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Marjah residents remain skeptical of U.S. troops and the newly installed local government that has moved in and taken over, said U.S. Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Larry Nicholson, who was in charge of the Marjah offensive. They want to know what Karzai's government is going to be able to do for them, he said. ""We are in competition every day for the confidence and support of the population -- we're in competition with the Taliban,"" Nicholson told reporters last week. ""We have a very narrow window of opportunity here in Marjah to make that first impression and you get one shot at it,"" he said. Dubbed Operation Moshtarak, the offensive was launched last month by an international coalition of 15,000 troops including Afghans, Americans, Britons, Canadians, Danes, and Estonians. The Marjah region has long been a bastion of pro-Taliban sentiment and is where the Taliban had set up a shadow government. It is a key area in Afghanistan's heroin trade and full of the opium used to fund the insurgency. The hope now is for the United States to persuade the locals to change their crops from poppies -- grown to produce opium for the Taliban's drug trade -- and instead grow crops like wheat, which can help them survive and provide income as well. Nicholson said for years, the Taliban-run town had no police force. Now, the Afghan government is in the process of recruiting Marjah citizens to join a new police force that would be trained by the Marines. The general had no timetable on how long it would take to truly secure the town. Meanwhile, in Baghlan province, about 50 insurgents, including more than a dozen Taliban, were killed in fighting between two rebel groups, the province's governor said Sunday. Some 35 fighters of the Hezb-e-Eslami, or Islamic Party, and 13 Taliban died in the fighting, which began Saturday and continued into Sunday, Mohammed Akbar Barikzai told CNN. Apparently some bystanders also were killed or wounded, Barikzai said, adding he could not put an exact number on the civilian casualties. More Afghanistan coverage on Afghanistan Crossroads blog . Hezb-e-Eslami is an insurgent group loyal to warlord Gulbeddin Hekmatyar. They are enemies of the Taliban, but it is rare that the anti-government groups fight each other. A group of 25 Hezb-e-Eslami fighters including their commander surrendered to Afghan National Police on Sunday, the governor said. Separately, two children were killed and two were hurt in an explosion while they were playing in Kandahar province, provincial spokesman Zalmay Ayoubi said Sunday. The explosive device was in a bag that blew up while the children were playing, the Interior Ministry said in a press release. The injured children were transferred to a hospital for treatment. Two NATO service members were killed in southern Afghanistan in two separate incidents on Sunday, a NATO news release said. One was killed by small arms fire and the other by an improvised explosive device, NATO said. The identities and nationalities of the service members were not immediately released, pending notification of the relevant national authorities, the statement said.

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Japanese authorities arrested an activist from New Zealand on Friday for illegal trespassing after he boarded a whaling ship last month in waters off the Antarctic. Peter James Bethune, 44, is accused of jumping from a Jet Ski onto the Shonan Maru 2, the security ship of a Japanese whaling fleet, after the Ady Gil boat, of which Bethune was captain, sank. Bethune belongs to the activist group Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. The group said the New Zealander was attempting to make a citizen's arrest of the Shonan Maru 2 skipper for the collision that sank the Ady Gil, a futuristic vessel used to intercept and block harpoon ships, in January. Hirotaka Akamatsu, Japan's minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, said Japan would take a firm stance against Bethune. He said Sea Shepherd's acts were not acceptable. ""Their violent acts are escalating,"" Akamatsu said. Bethune was taken into custody a month ago aboard the Shonan Maru 2, which arrived from Antarctic waters -- where Japan conducts its annual whale hunt -- back to Japan on Friday. He was formally arrested then. Bethune has legal representation in Japan, said Sea Shepherd spokeswoman Traci Walter. A spokesperson for the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the government was providing consular assistance to Bethune on his arrival in Japan. The Bethune case highlights an ongoing feud between Japanese whaling fleets and conservation agencies, especially the hardline Sea Shepherd. Activists have used butyric acid -- found in rancid butter and vomit -- and fired paint guns at Japanese whaling ships, which in turn have repelled protesters with water cannons. Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research, a branch of the fisheries ministry that deals with whaling, accuses Sea Shepherd of jeopardizing the safety of fleets that are conducting research legally. Sea Shepherd uses its boats to interfere with whaling and fishing boats, and its efforts have included ramming a Portuguese whaler in 1979. Two years ago, Sea Shepherd activists boarded a Japanese ship and handcuffed themselves to the vessel with plastic ties. Japanese authorities had called the Shonan Maru 2 incident the latest ""publicity stunt"" by Sea Shepherd activists. Sea Shepherd has accused the Shonan Maru 2 of destroying the Ady Gil during the skirmish in the Southern Ocean -- a term used to describe parts of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic oceans that surround Antarctica. However, Japanese authorities deny their ship intentionally hit the high-tech catamaran and have said the activists were harassing their whaling fleet. In the early 1980s, the International Whaling Commission determined that there should be a moratorium on commercial whale hunting. But whaling is allowed under international law when done for scientific reasons, which Japan cites as the legal basis for its hunts. The country's annual hunt kills up to 1,000 whales a year.","Bethune belongs to Sea Shepherd Conservation Society .

"(CNN) -- The world has a new alliance to save vanishing frogs, toads and salamanders. A frog swims in a pond in Munich, Germany, in June. A coalition of organizations established the Amphibian Survival Alliance this month to conserve species threatened by deadly fungus, habitat loss, pollution, pesticides and climate change. The scientists said amphibians are the world's most threatened group of animals. Though they thrived on Earth for more than 360 million years, one in three of the 6,000 recognized amphibian species are now at risk of extinction and as many as 122 species have gone extinct since 1980, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's amphibian specialist group. ""The world's amphibians are facing an uphill battle for survival,"" said James Collins of Arizona State University, co-chairman of the group. He said the new alliance, formed at the Amphibian Mini Summit at the Zoological Society of London, will focus efforts on the biggest threat to amphibians: infectious disease and habitat destruction. The group includes amphibian specialists working in the wild as well as those in zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens worldwide. ""Amphibians have so much to offer humans,"" said amphibian specialist Simon Stuart. ""Many have an arsenal of compounds stored in their skin that have the potential to address a multitude of human diseases."" But as amphibians die out, so do opportunities to develop new medicines, he said. The southern gastric brooding frog, for instance, could have led to the development of a treatment for human peptic ulcers had it not gone extinct, Stuart said. ""We simply cannot afford to let this current amphibian extinction crisis go unchecked,"" he said. Andrew Blaustein, who began documenting amphibian declines two decades ago, said the loss of species was part of an overall biodiversity crisis. ""Amphibians seem to have been hit the hardest of all vertebrate species,"" said Blaustein, a professor of zoology at Oregon State University. ""The long-term ecological repercussions of their decline could be profound, and we have to do something about it.""","Amphibian Survival Alliance aims to save threatened frogs, toads, salamanders .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The top U.S. general in Afghanistan vowed that coalition forces ""are absolutely going to secure Kandahar,"" as security efforts expand in the country's south. ""We already are doing a lot of security operations in Kandahar, but it's our intent -- under President [Hamid] Karzai -- to make an even greater effort there,"" Gen. Stanley McChrystal told a joint news conference Monday with Mark Sedwill, the NATO senior civilian representative to the country. The news conference coincided with a visit by U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who was also to meet with Karzai. McChrystal indicated a military operation could begin in the volatile Kandahar province as early as this summer, but both Sedwill and McChrystal cautioned that much political groundwork lay ahead for NATO-led coalition troops before an offensive can begin. Just as in the recent Marjah operation, the goal, they said, is to gain the support of the Afghan people. ""What I think we've learned about operations in Afghanistan ... is if you try to push against the culture, you have huge problems,"" McChrystal said. ""What we're trying to achieve in Kandahar is to do the political groundwork so when it's time to do the military operation, the significant part of the population is pulling us in and supportive so we're not only doing what they want but we're operating in a way that they're comfortable with. That's the key to success here."" McChrystal said the goal ""is to demonstrate again that we can operate in a way where we've got strong resolve by the government of Afghanistan, effective performance by the Afghan military and coalition partners, and government partners, so that as we do an operation that shows the people of Kandahar, and the Taliban as well, that operations like this actually result in a better outcome for everyone."" He declined to comment specifically on when the Kandahar offensive will begin, but said ""our forces will be significantly increased around there by early summer."" ""There won't be a 'D-Day' that is climactic,"" McChrystal said. ""It will be a rising tide of security as it comes."" The push to secure Kandahar from what McChrystal calls a ""menacing Taliban presence"" is part of a larger counterinsurgency effort in the country's south, started last month in Marjah in southern Helmand province. Long a bastion of pro-Taliban sentiment and awash with the opium used to fund the insurgency, the Marjah region has been known as the heroin breadbasket of Afghanistan and as a place where the Taliban had set up a shadow government. The hope now is for the United States to persuade the locals to change their crops from poppies -- grown to produce opium for the Taliban's drug trade -- and instead grow crops such as wheat, which can help them survive and provide income as well. Sedwill and McChrystal praised the early stages of the Marjah offensive, with Sedwill calling it a ""template for the way we want to take this campaign forward over the next year to 18 months."" McChrystal said that in addition to the strategic importance of the Marjah offensive, the operation was a ""demonstration to the Afghan people, to the international community, to the Pakistanis, and very important to the Taliban as well, that things have changed.""","McChrystal indicates a military operation could begin in Kandahar as early as summer .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Fantasy author Terry Pratchett has admitted that he has been diagnosed with a rare form of Alzheimer's disease -- but says he plans to continue writing his multi-million selling Discworld books. Terry Pratchett, whose books have sold more than 45 million copies worldwide in 33 languages. Pratchett, 59 -- whose books have, according to his Web site, sold more than 45 million copies worldwide in 33 languages -- suffered what he called a ""phantom stroke"" earlier this year. In a statement titled ""an embuggerance"" on the Web site of Discworld illustrator Paul Kidby, Pratchett says that he has been diagnosed with what he terms ""a very rare form of early onset Alzheimer's."" ""I would have liked to keep this one quiet for a little while, but because of upcoming conventions and of course the need to keep my publishers informed, it seems to me unfair to withhold the news,"" says Pratchett, who has a strong following among fans of fantasy fiction. ""All other things being equal, I expect to meet most current and, as far as possible, future commitments but will discuss things with the various organisers,"" he continues. ""Frankly, I would prefer it if people kept things cheerful, because I think there's time for at least a few more books yet."" Pratchett adds that work is continuing on his next book ""Nation"" and that the ""basic notes are already being laid down for Unseen Academicals."" In a P.S. he adds that ""I would just like to draw attention to everyone reading the above that this should be interpreted as 'I am not dead'. I will, of course, be dead at some future point, as will everybody else. ""I know it's a very human thing to say 'Is there anything I can do', but in this case I would only entertain offers from very high-end experts in brain chemistry."" Pratchett's Discworld novels, of which 36 have been published to date, are set in a fantasy universe through which the author satirizes modern-day life. He says in a statement on his own Web site that the series ""started out as a parody of all the fantasy that was around in the big boom of the early '80s, then turned into a satire on just about everything, and even I don't know what it is now.""

"(CNN)  -- Russia and South Ossetia have strongly denied news reports that a motorcade carrying the presidents of Georgia and Poland came under fire, calling the claims ""a provocation"" meant to destabilize the region. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, said there were ""unpredictable people"" in the area. ""This is a real provocation,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told journalists on Monday. ""It is not the first time that such things have happened: First they mastermind everything themselves and then accuse the Russian or the Ossetian side."" Eduard Kokoity, president of the breakaway region of South Ossetia, added: ""Today's event was a deliberate provocative act of the Georgian and Polish presidents targeted at regional destabilization."" Kokoity made his comments to the Russian news agency, Interfax. The motorcade, carrying Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili and Polish President Lech Kaczynski, was passing a checkpoint near Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia region -- site of intense conflict between Russian and Georgian troops in August -- when shots were fired Sunday, according to the Georgian Interior Ministry. The motorcade was not hit and there were no injuries, the Georgian Interior Ministry said. No other shooting was reported in the area. The shots were fired from Russian-controlled territory as the motorcade passed, the ministry said. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin denied the gunfire came from its army positions. ""This is one more instance of wishful thinking on the part of Georgia,"" he told reporters. After the incident, Saakashvili told reporters he would not have taken his Polish counterpart into danger intentionally and that the incident showed ""you are dealing with unpredictable people"" in the disputed area. Kokoity, the South Ossetian president, countered that the Polish and Georgian presidents need to answer questions whether they informed European Union monitors of their trip. Tensions have remained high in the area since fighting between Russian and Georgian troops broke out in August. Georgia launched a campaign against South Ossetia, a Russian-backed separatist territory, on August 7. The following day, Russian tanks, troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian territory, Abkhazia, advancing into Georgian cities outside the rebel regions. The two sides blamed each other for starting the conflict and have accused each other of a variety of offenses leading up to and during the fighting, including ethnic cleansing.","Russian peacekeepers, South Ossetia deny involvement in shooting .

"(OPRAH.com) -- ""My beloved. The delight of my eyes."" So says a poem inscribed in cuneiform on a lump of clay approximately 4,000 years ago. Why does love inspire such works of art? Recent science points to a possible answer -- and a difference between the way the brain reacts to love and lust. Last year psychologists in the Netherlands reported on a study where they asked a group of young men and women to imagine taking a long walk with their beloved (those without a partner imagined taking a walk with an ""ideal"" one). A different set of volunteers were asked to imagine having casual sex with someone they found attractive but were not in love with. Before and after, both groups were given a battery of tests to examine their creative and analytical abilities. The results: Thinking about a romantic partner stimulated ""global processing"" mechanisms in the brain, which increased long-term focus and improved creativity. Thinking about sex, on the other hand, stimulated ""local processing,"" which increased focus on the present and heightened analytical thinking. Oprah.com: Tap into your right-brain thinking . There may be a physiological explanation for these results. Feelings of romantic love can boost levels of dopamine, a neurochemical associated with creativity, while sexual desire can raise levels of testosterone, known to promote analytical skills. And these chemical links may have evolved for an important purpose: increasing the likelihood of sexual reproduction. In ancestral days, creative individuals may have used their inventiveness to attract future mates, while sex-focused individuals harnessed analytical clarity and short-term focus in order to bed a partner here and now. Thoughts of either love or sex could pay off in the form of children -- the ultimate measure of survival. While we no longer use cave drawings to attract our partners, you can still take advantage of this evolutionary link. Daydreaming about your sweetheart may boost inventiveness and help you come up with creative ideas, while sexual thoughts could help you solve an analytical puzzle. Oprah.com: How to fix whatever's broken . In addition, it may be that jilted lovers who want to get over an ex faster would be better off replacing thoughts of what might have been with sexual fantasies. This might just help refocus your attention on the present -- and on the steps you need to take to rebuild, so that one day you'll be ready to write love notes again.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Iraqi President Jalal Talabani will likely not seek re-election once his term ends. Jalal Talabani says he will not run for Iraq's president again, but he plans to stay in the political arena. Talabani, 75, has been president since April 2005. The ethnic Kurd was re-elected in 2006 for a four-year term. Although he ""has expressed his willingness not to seek another presidential nomination ... it does not mean that he will withdraw from the political and partisan arena,"" a message on Talabani's Web site said. ""President Talabani, on various occasions, sought to emphasize the importance and the need to devolve the power, tasks and responsibilities of leadership in the country to local authorities, especially at this stage when the country is going through political efforts by the parties to expand their bases,"" the statement said. In Iraq, the prime minister wields most of the power. However, Talabani played an important role in maintaining the country's delicate ethnic balance. The Iraqi parliament picks the president and two vice presidents, a Sunni and a Shia. All will leave office when parliamentary polls are held in December. Talabani is the head of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) party. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Iraq president Jalal Talabani says he will likely not seek re-election .

"(CNN) -- Former Democratic Rep. Charles Wilson of Texas, whose support for anti-Soviet forces in Afghanistan inspired the 2007 movie ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" died Wednesday at age 76. The 12-term congressman, who served the state's second congressional district, had been in a meeting Wednesday morning with a friend when he complained of difficulty breathing, said Yana Ogletree, a spokeswoman for Memorial Medical Center in Lufkin. The two men were heading to the hospital when they passed an emergency medical services vehicle on the side of the road and stopped for help, she said. Paramedics took Wilson to the hospital emergency room, where he was pronounced dead, she said. Wilson, who had undergone a heart transplant at Methodist Hospital in Houston in September 2007, moved back to Lufkin when he retired from Congress in 1997 after having served since 1973, she said. ""I had the unforgettable experience of knowing Congressman Wilson when I was at CIA and he was working tirelessly on behalf of the Afghan resistance fighting the Soviets,"" said Defense Secretary Robert Gates in a written statement. ""As the world now knows, his efforts and exploits helped repel an invader, liberate a people and bring the Cold War to a close. After the Soviets left, Charlie kept fighting for the Afghan people and warned against abandoning that traumatized country to its fate -- a warning we should have heeded then, and should remember today."" ""Charlie Wilson led a life that was oversized even by Hollywood's standards,"" said Texas Gov. Rick Perry in a statement. ""Congressman Wilson was fiercely devoted to serving his country and his fellow Texans."" ""Charlie was a man of courage and conviction who worked hard, loved his country, and lived life to the fullest,"" said House Appropriations Committee Chairman David R. Obey, D-Wisconsin. ""We will miss him."" Tom Hanks portrayed the flamboyant congressman in the 2007 movie ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" based on the book by George Crile. The book and the film told the story of Wilson's efforts to get weapons to Mujahedeen fighters after Soviets invaded Afghanistan. ""Hanks did a great job,"" Wilson said in 2008. Wilson also praised the other actors. ""They were too close to the truth,"" he said. The U.S. Naval Academy grad and Navy veteran was elected to Congress in 1972 -- a Democrat bucking the national Nixon landslide -- and quickly became known for his high-living escapades, which earned him the nickname ""Good Time Charlie,"" and shrewd accumulation of political chits. His savvy came in handy in the early 1980s, when Wilson, a staunch anti-Communist, decided to help Afghan rebels in their war against the invading Soviet Union. Over several years, working behind the scenes, his efforts to raise funds through his defense subcommittee, to establish a bond with a CIA agent named Gust Avrakotos (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman in the film) and to negotiate support from Middle Eastern countries helped the Afghans take the upper hand and eventually forced the Soviets out of the country. Asked what led to the Soviet departure, Pakistani leader Gen. Muhammad Zia ul-Haq was blunt: ""Charlie did it,"" he told CBS News' ""60 Minutes."" Some people criticized the film because it didn't do much to highlight what happened in Afghanistan after the Soviets left: the Taliban's takeover of the country and al Qaeda's use of the nation as a base. Wilson was asked in 2008 about the consequences of helping the Mujahedeen fighters. ""I don't think there was a serious blowback,"" Wilson said. ""I think there was the point that [author] George Crile made in the [book's] epilogue, that the Muslims saw that they took down one superpower and then the radical ones thought they could take down another one. But they're wrong."" Wilson is survived by his wife, Barbara Alberstadt Wilson, a sister, a niece and a nephew. Funeral arrangements are pending.

"(CNN) -- Authorities are asking residents in some some parts of south Australia to evacuate their homes as an impending heat wave prompted the nation to issue its first ""catastrophic"" brush fire warning. The warning system was put in place to better alert residents after a devastating brush fire ravaged the southeastern state of Victoria in February, killing more than 170 people and destroying 2,000 homes. During that fire, many residents stayed to defend their property. Though authorities still cannot mandate that people leave, the new warning system urges people to flee. The Code Red ""Catastrophic"" warning was issued for the Eastern Eyre Peninsula and West Coast districts in the state of South Australia. Are you there? Send your pictures, video . Such a rating means that even well-constructed and defended homes might not be safe from the blaze, the South Australian Fire Service said. In addition, three other districts -- Flinders, North West Pastoral and Lower Eyre Peninsula -- were placed under an ""Extreme"" watch. Such a rating means that only well-constructed homes can withstand the flames. An intense heat wave -- with temperatures climbing to 104 F (40 C) -- is expected to hit the areas until the weekend. The region is already in the midst of a severe drought. Coupled with low humidity and strong winds, the soaring temperatures will make it ripe for fires to ignite. Any fire that breaks out will be uncontrollable, the fire service said. People in their path will likely die, it added.","Warning system put in place to better alert residents after a devastating fire ravaged Victoria in February .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- At least 30 Iraqi children riding in a bus were among the 160 people killed in Sunday's twin car bombings in Baghdad, the Interior Ministry said Monday. At least 540 people were wounded in Sunday's attacks, the deadliest in the capital in more than two years, the ministry said. One of the bombs exploded outside Baghdad's governorate building, the other outside the Justice Ministry. The bombs detonated in quick succession about 10:30 a.m., officials said. The children were packed in a mini bus that was outside the Justice Ministry building, a ministry official said. The vehicle carrying the explosives that detonated outside the ministry building was a stolen white pick-up from Falluja, Baghdad Gov. Salah Abdul Razzaq told CNN during his inspection of the bomb site. Images from the time of the attack showed the truck, linked to the Department of Water, pull up to the side of the building and blow up, he said. Plumes of smoke billowed from the sites as victims fled, some with blood streaming down their faces. The streets were strewn with debris, including charred cars and chunks of concrete. Some government buildings and others in the area were heavily damaged. Among the wounded were three American security contractors, the U.S. Embassy said, declining to provide further details. The area struck is close to the heavily guarded ""Green Zone,"" which houses the embassy. The blasts sparked questions about Iraq's security and national elections planned for January. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who visited the scene shortly after the explosions, said holding the elections as scheduled would send a strong message to the attackers. ""The cowardly attack ... should not affect the determination of the Iraqi people from continuing their battle against the deposed regime and the gangs of criminal Baath party, and the terrorist al Qaeda organization,'"" al-Maliki said in a written statement. U.S. President Barack Obama called the attacks an attempt to derail progress in Iraq, and pledged to work closely with the country as it prepares for elections. Obama spoke with the prime minister and President Jalal Talabani to express his condolences and reiterate U.S. support. In August, more than 100 people were killed in a series of bombings that led to tightened security in Baghdad. Blast walls were installed across the city and checkpoints were added. Two years earlier, three truck bombings killed hundreds in Qahtaniya, in northern Iraq. Sunday's attacks were the deadliest on Iraqi civilians since those blasts in August 2007. A day before Sunday's explosions, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, visited Iraq for the first time. During her trip, she made a condolence stop at the Foreign Ministry, one of six sites attacked in August. Iraqis are supposed to go to the polls January 16, but parliament has not passed key election legislation, putting the balloting in limbo. The president, prime minister and other top officials are scheduled to meet Monday to discuss the elections law and security concerns.

"(CNN) -- Investigators searching for a missing 8-month-old boy began an intensive excavation and search effort Tuesday at a Texas landfill. ""Let me say this, that we do remain hopeful that baby Gabriel is alive,"" William McManus, chief of the San Antonio Police Department, said at a news conference at the landfill. ""We are, however, conducting both a missing persons investigation as well as a homicide investigation,"" he said, adding that aspects surrounding Gabriel Johnson's disappearance involve elements of a possible homicide. Gabriel has been missing since December 26 and was last seen in San Antonio, with his 23-year-old mother, Elizabeth Johnson, who has refused to disclose information on his whereabouts. She told Gabriel's father she killed the boy and has also said she gave him away to a couple in San Antonio, police say. Johnson drove Gabriel to San Antonio from Tempe, Arizona, and she went to Florida a week later, according to investigators. Johnson was arrested in Florida and extradited to Maricopa County, Arizona, where she remains behind bars, charged with kidnapping, custodial interference and child abuse. A lead prompted investigators to focus on the landfill, which is owned by Republic Services, a waste and environmental services company based in Phoenix, Arizona. The part of the landfill that will be searched has been pinpointed, according to McManus. First, it will take at least six days to remove 45 feet of garbage that has piled up since the time investigators believe evidence may have been dumped in the area. ""Once we have removed the debris and have searched our target area, we will begin the arduous task of sifting through layers in the search for possible evidence,"" McManus said. ""This phase will be a long and repetitive cycle. Search teams will be looking for anything of evidentiary value."" Cadaver dogs will assist the search teams in the effort, which will be conducted weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., McManus said. He estimated more than 20 people will be involved. Rain would not compromise any evidence but could cause dangerous toxic runoff, which Fire Department and hazardous materials experts would work to contain. San Antonio police have been working with the FBI and Tempe police. They have been looking at every lead and ""chasing them down very, very vigorously,"" McManus said. ""We are doing everything that we can to try to track down baby Gabriel, and hopefully we will find that baby alive.""","8-month-old has been missing since December 26 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Former President Bill Clinton will travel to Haiti on Monday to meet with officials and deliver aid supplies to the quake-ravaged country, his foundation announced Sunday. Clinton, the U.N. special envoy to Haiti, will meet with Haitian President Rene Preval and other members of the local government as well as aid workers, to discuss how to proceed with recovery operations.

Bush. In a pre-recorded interview broadcast Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Bush and Clinton said the first goal of the fund is to get aid to Haiti right away to save lives. It also seeks to ensure that money keeps coming in after public attention begins to wan in the weeks and months ahead. ""For me, success is helping save lives in the short term, and then we can worry about the long-term after the situation has been stabilized,"" Bush said. Clinton, who also is the U.N. special envoy to Haiti, defined success as ""setting up a network quickly to get the food, water, medicine, security and information people need."" The overall goal is to help Haiti resume ""as quickly as possible"" its efforts to build a ""strong, modern society"" after decades of political and social instability that made it the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere before the earthquake, Clinton said. Officials in Haiti fear more than 100,000 people killed in the disaster. Clinton noted that Haiti already was working to overcome its problems before the latest crisis. ""They have an economic plan,"" Clinton said. ""We're going to have to amend it now, and substantially, to take account of the damage done."" Simply restoring Haiti to its impoverished state prior to the earthquake would amount to failure, Clinton said. The two predecessors to Obama as U.S. leader also said the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund (http://www.clintonbushhaitifund.org/) was intended to provide people with a safe place to continue donating money to help the Caribbean country. ""Our job it to set up a fund to make sure the compassion is still existent once the crisis gets off TV and make sure the money is wisely spent,"" Bush said. That means getting the donated money quickly to organizations with experience working in Haiti, including faith-based groups and international aid groups, Bush and Clinton said. ""During these crises, all kinds of fake charities spring up that take advantage of people's good will,"" Bush said. ""We're safe haven. We will make sure the money is accounted for and there's transparency and properly spent."" Both Bush and Clinton noted politics should play no role in responding to the crisis, with Clinton saying: ""I hope that it will humanize us all in every aspect of our lives."" However, Clinton couldn't resist a little politicking, praising the Obama administration's response so far and noting that the president had ""extraordinary taste"" in a secretary of state -- his wife, Hillary Clinton. Clinton also offered warm praise for CNN's coverage of the Haiti earthquake. ""You made this come alive to the American people,"" Clinton said. ""You put us in the skin of the Haitian people, and I'm personally very grateful."" For Bush, his return to Washington is a welcome chance to aid a worthy cause, but nothing more. ""I frankly don't miss the limelight,"" Bush said. ""I'm glad to help out.""","Clinton will meet with Haitian president on Monday .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actor Peter Graves, best known for his starring role on TV's ""Mission: Impossible,"" died Sunday. He was 83. While the cause of the actor's death was not immediately known, he apparently suffered a heart attack, his publicist said. Graves had gone to brunch with his family Sunday morning. After they returned home and entered the house, one of his daughters began to wonder why he hadn't come back inside with them, said publicist Sandy Brokaw. The family went outside and found Graves had collapsed. His daughter performed CPR but was unsuccessful in reviving the actor, Brokaw said. Graves had been in good health and was celebrating 60 years of marriage and 60 years in the entertainment business. He was still pursuing work when he died, the publicist said. Share your memories of Peter Graves . He is best known for playing the character Jim Phelps for all but one of the seven years ""Mission: Impossible"" ran on CBS, from 1967-1973. He won a Golden Globe in 1971 for his work on the show, and was also nominated for an Emmy. He reprised the role from 1988 to 1990 when the show resurfaced on ABC. In an interview with CNN in 1996, Graves expressed disappointment with Hollywood's movie version of ""Mission: Impossible"" -- starring Tom Cruise -- which included none of the stars from the original TV series. Actor Jon Voight played the Phelps character. ""I am sorry that they chose to call him Phelps,"" he said at the time. ""They could have solved that very easily by either having me in a scene in the very beginning, or reading a telegram from me saying, 'Hey boys, I'm retired, gone to Hawaii. Thank you, goodbye, you take over now.' "" Graves also appeared as Capt. Clarence Oveur in the 1980 movie spoof ""Airplane!"" -- a role he originally turned down, according to the Web's Internet Movie Database. He changed his mind after meeting with the film's writers, according to IMDb. In recent years, Graves was part of a larger group that won an Outstanding Informational Series Emmy for the 1997 TV documentary ""Judy Garland: Beyond the Rainbow."" Graves hosted the documentary. He is survived by his wife, Joan Endress, and three daughters, Kelly, Claudia and Amanda Graves, according to IMDb.

"Washington (CNN) -- A U.S. Army officer who was honored for valor after his combat outpost in Afghanistan was attacked has also received a letter of reprimand for failing to secure the base before the attack, according to Army officials. Such a letter normally would prevent career advancement. U.S. Army Capt. Matthew Myer received the Silver Star for his part in repelling a Taliban attack on his small combat outpost in eastern Afghanistan in July 2008. The attack, near the village of Wanat, is still the deadliest ground combat of the war involving U.S. troops. A coordinated Taliban attack from the steep hills surrounding the base almost resulted in the outpost being overrun. According to troops who survived, the Taliban came at the base with about 200 fighters, outnumbering the U.S. forces at the base. In the end nine soldiers were killed and 12 were wounded. About 100 Taliban were killed. Despite the heavy U.S. death toll, Myer was awarded the Silver Star for calling in aircraft to beat back the fighters, some of whom had breached the base walls, according to U.S. military officials in Afghanistan. After the attack, the U.S. military scrutinized how enemy forces were allowed to get as close to the base as they did. Officials familiar with the after-action review said Taliban fighters got within grenade-throwing distance of U.S. troops. Myer even called in close air support to hit enemy targets just 10 meters from his own position, according to officials familiar with the after-action report. Four-star Gen. Charles C. Campbell was chosen to review the final investigation and make disciplinary decisions. Campbell decided Myer would receive a career-ending letter of reprimand for failing to prepare the base's defenses sufficiently against an enemy attack. Myer was informed this week of his punishment, according to U.S. military officials. CBS News first reported his punishment. Two of Myer's senior commanders, who were not at the base during the attack, also received similar career-ending letters of reprimand. Officials would not elaborate on the reasons for the reprimands. Army officials acknowledge the base, built to protect the people in Wanat, was at the bottom of a valley surrounded by high hills, an almost impossible location to defend. According to one U.S. military official familiar with the general's decision to reprimand Myer, ""He saw the evidence and made a decision based on that."" However, the same official said, ""Unless you've been there, you don't know how hard those places are to defend."" Myer and his two senior officers are allowed to appeal the punishment. Another U.S. military official familiar with the review said he expects the three officers to meet with Campbell to plead their cases.","Army Capt.

"Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lanka's former army chief appeared before a military court Tuesday, on charges that he says are designed to remove him from politics. Retired Army Gen. Sarath Fonseka faced a panel of three military judges, who are to decide whether he is guilty of participating in politics while still in uniform. Fonseka's spokesman Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the former military commander's lawyers raised two objections: that the judges are biased and that a military court can no longer rule on Fonseka's case, because he left the army more than six months ago. The court will reconvene on April 6 to rule on the objections, according to government spokesman Maj. Gen. Prasad Samarasinghe. However, Fonseka must return to court Wednesday to face separate charges of violating military procurement procedures. Fonseka says the charges against him are false and politically motivated. The man credited with the military campaign that defeated a quarter-century-long insurgency by the Tamil Tiger rebel movement was arrested last month. He was dragged from his office by armed military police during a meeting with his supporters, they said. He has since been detained at naval headquarters in Colombo, where the military tribunal is convening. Fonseka and President Mahinda Rajapaksa were allies and heroes of last year's battle against the Tigers, but they drifted apart. Fonseka's supporters say the former general was seen as a threat to the government and his arrest was ordered to prevent his participation in parliamentary elections April 8. The former military commander challenged Rajapaksa in January's presidential elections, but lost by a wide margin and accused the government of election fraud. The Fonseka family has challenged his arrest in Sri Lanka's supreme court. Those arguments are to be heard April 26. His wife, Anoma Fonseka, called the legal proceedings against her husband a joke. Journalist Amal Jayasinghe contributed to this report.","Retired Gen. Sarath Fonseka credited with campaign that defeated Tamil Tiger rebels .

But Spanish ace Nadal kept battling and got a lucky break in the fourth game of the decider as his U.S opponent's return hit the net cord and bounced back on his side of the net to fall down a break.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- In 2009, some units of the New York Police Department still function more like ""Dragnet"" than ""CSI."" They rely on typewriters. Records show New York City signed a $432,900 contract for typewriter maintenance with in 2008. NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne confirmed the department's continued, if limited, use of the 20th-century writing devices, explaining that they're mainly used for filling out property vouchers -- forms that officers must file when they seize items during case investigations. The typewriters also are retained in case a technological meltdown disables the NYPD's computers, he said. The vintage typing machines do not come cheap. Public records show that the city signed a $432,900 contract for typewriter maintenance with Afax Business Machines in 2008, as well as a $99,570 contract with that company in 2009. Typewriter company Swintec received a $982,269 contract from the city in 2007. Eugene O'Donnell, a former New York police officer who now lectures at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the typewriters are an anachronism -- and a waste. ""The two places you'd find typewriters are the museum and the police department,"" O'Donnell said. Typewriters create significant efficiency and storage problems for the department, he added, causing extra labor and unwieldy paper trails. Deputy Commissioner Browne emphasized that ""we have a $4 billion budget"" and the financial resources devoted to typewriters are relatively miniscule. Officers interviewed by CNN on the street had no soft spots for the contraptions. ""It's so antiquated,"" said one officer who did not want to be identified. Her partner shared her frustration.

"Washington (CNN) -- Citing a ""deficit of trust"" in government by the American people, President Obama's first State of the Union address urged Congress to erode the influence of special interests and work together to confront the nation's most pressing problems. In the nationally televised speech Wednesday night to a joint session of Congress, Obama sought to reassure Americans angry and nervous about the pace of economic recovery that his government understands the challenges and would act boldly to meet them. Obama called for a new political climate of ""common sense"" approaches that invest in the American people without building ""a mountain of debt."" Highlights of the speech . ""We have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now. We face a deficit of trust -- deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years,"" Obama said. Key areas where Obama wants to build that trust include: the economy, education, energy, health care and national security. Democrats applauded the remarks of their party's leader. ""He outlined a road map that, if followed with bipartisan support in Congress, can reduce our deficit, rebuild our economy and create a new foundation of prosperity for American families and businesses,"" said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ""It was a serious speech -- reached out to Republicans,"" said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, the House majority leader. iReport: Share your views on the speech . Republicans, however, were skeptical of Obama's ability to change the partisan atmosphere in Washington. ""Real bipartisanship requires more than just lip service; it demands both sides coming together in a real and meaningful way. It's time for the administration to abandon this big-government agenda and start working in a meaningful way with Republicans to find common-sense solutions to move the country forward,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ""I would have liked to have seen him emphasize reaching out to the other side of the aisle and bringing us together,"" said Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio. Read more reaction to address . Analysts, too, were mixed in their reactions to what Obama had to say Wednesday night. CNN political contributor John Avlon said Obama was targeting independents with his remarks, but questioned his success. ""They still hear The Who's 'Won't Get Fooled Again' in the back of their minds,"" Avlon said. Democratic strategist James Carville said Obama made progress. ""He picked up a first down tonight,"" Carville said. And a post-speech opinion poll shows a divided public. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey indicated that 48 percent of speech watchers had a very positive reaction, with three in 10 saying they had a somewhat positive response and 21 percent with a negative response. See full results of poll . The 48 percent who indicated they had a very positive response is down 20 points from the 68 percent of speech watchers who felt the same way a year ago about the president's February 24 primetime address to a joint session of Congress. ""Wednesday night's State of the Union audience is more Democratic than the nation as a whole, but speech-watchers were less Democratic this year than they were last year,"" said Keating Holland, CNN polling director. ""That may be one reason why the number who gave his speech a 'very positive' rating is lower this year. But part of the reason also may be that speech-watchers didn't necessarily hear a new agenda and aren't confident that the president can improve health care or lower the deficit.""","Obama says he wants to close ""deficit of trust"" with American people .

"(CNN) -- Rock guitarist and singer Alex Chilton, known for his work with bands the Box Tops and Big Star, died Wednesday. He was 59. Chilton was having heart problems and died in an emergency room in New Orleans, Louisiana, said longtime friend and business associate John Fry. ""Obviously, we are all stunned and deeply saddened at this news,"" Fry said. Chilton started in music as a teen in the 1960s, as vocalist for the psychedelic soul group the Box Tops, Fry said. They were known for the No. 1 hit ""'The Letter"" and songs such as ""Neon Rainbow"" and ""Cry Like a Baby."" After that group disbanded in 1970, Chilton formed the Memphis rock group Big Star. Though that band had a short life, breaking up in 1974, its music catapulted the group and Chilton to cult status. ""While Big Star struggled with success commercially, their early '70s, power-pop sound is often cited as directly influencing bands like Cheap Trick, R.E.M. and the Replacements,"" Billboard magazine said in its biography of Chilton's group. The evidence of that: a song the Replacements released in 1987, called ""Alex Chilton."" Part of the chorus of that song is ""Children by the million sing for Alex Chilton when he comes 'round. They sing, I'm in love."" In the 1990s, Big Star got back together. Chilton and the band were scheduled to perform at the South by Southwest music festival in Texas this weekend.

"(CNN) -- Authorities have linked seven deaths to the nor'easter affecting the Eastern Seaboard, and more than 300,000 customers remained without power Monday in the Northeast after rain and fierce winds. Hurricane-force winds over the weekend toppled trees, taking power lines with them. Five of the weekend's deaths were caused by falling trees, authorities said. Two people died in New Jersey; authorities from Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Connecticut, West Virginia and New York each said they had one storm-related death. Heavy rain also caused flooding across the region. Flood warnings were in effect from northern Virginia to southern New Hampshire, the National Weather Service said. The city of Alexandria, along the Potomac River across from Washington, distributed nearly 800 sandbags to those in low-lying areas that typically are first to see high water. A coffee shop there experienced minor flooding, said Alexandria official Rich Baier. Some coastal areas have received more than 6 inches of rain since Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. Are you there? Share pictures and video . Con Edison said that more than 86,000 customers were without power Monday in New York City and Westchester County, New York, while the Long Island Power Authority said that 64,437 customers were in the dark. In New Jersey, about 100,000 were without power. Flooding caused 2,000 customers in New Jersey to lose their gas service, PSEG said. Connecticut Light and Power said that about 56,000 customers also had no power Monday. And in Pennsylvania, utility companies had restored power to a majority of residents, but the outage still affected more than 5,000. ""The ground is so wet from all the snow we've had this winter, it's helping the trees to topple over as well as our utility poles,"" said Long Island Power Authority President and CEO Kevin Law. ""The conditions are still too terrible to get crews out there."" Some customers probably will go without power for a few days, Law said. The outages were due mostly to power lines downed by Saturday's winds, which knocked over trees and utility polls. Wind speeds reached 75 mph at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport -- as strong as a Category 1 hurricane -- and 72 mph in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In Connecticut, the lingering effects of wind and rain from the weekend were apparent just by looking at the streets, according to J.P. McNamara, an iReporter in Fairfield, along the coast. ""The beach area of Fairfield experienced high tides that flooded streets with ... water and sand on Saturday night,"" McNamara said Monday. ""Many roads are still blocked off because of fallen trees and limbs, and it seems that this occurrence is widespread."" James Durosier, an iReporter from Rahway, New Jersey, said the storm's aftermath reminded him of a scene from an action movie. ""The way the whole scene looked was just incredible,"" Durosier said Sunday of the damage in the area. ""Power lines were hanging, street signs knocked down, and it was very quiet."" Brian DeNicola of Sayreville, New Jersey, said he has opened his home to three friends who don't have any power or hot water to shower. He said he lost electricity for about an hour Saturday evening and had to use a vacuum to relieve his basement of flooding. DeNicola said he's eager for spring's arrival Saturday.

"(CNN) -- As the April 15 income tax filing deadline approaches, the top tax expert at the National Association for the Self-Employed offers his best advice for business people who work for themselves. Keith Hall, a national tax adviser at the association, answers the tax question he is asked most often and talks about changes in tax rules for small-business owners. He also offers advice about how the self-employed can best avoid being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. CNN: What should self-employed taxpayers keep at the top of their minds this year? Keith Hall: I think the most important thing to remember is that you have resources. The IRS is always changing information -- from automobile deductions, to alternative minimum tax limits, to net operating loss carry-forwards. It's tough to keep up with, but you don't have to remember it, because it's all out there on the IRS Web site for you. Don't forget, you've got resources to go out and look for. CNN: What's different this year for self-employed taxpayers? Hall: Perhaps the most important thing unique to this year is there are so many businesses which were affected by the downturn in the economy, that the IRS has expanded opportunities for loss carrybacks. The definition of a loss carryback is if you had losses from your business in 2009, then you may have the opportunity to then take those losses and offset income from previous years. That's certainly something to look into if you had a tough year for 2009, because it may give you the ability to recover taxes in more years -- namely five -- than you used to be able to, which is just two. So if that's the situation that you find yourself in, certainly look into options for those loss carrybacks. It certainly can help you with the tax impact. More particularly, for those new to being self-employed or maybe even their first year filing a Schedule C, make sure you look for deductions that don't appear in your business checkbook. It's very easy to overlook deductions like the deduction for the home office that you use, deduction for the business use of your automobile -- those typically don't show up in your business checkbook, so if you don't know to look for them, they're very easily overlooked, and that's basically just leaving money on the table. CNN: What can self-employed workers do to avoid an IRS audit? Hall: The No. 1 reason a small business gets audited or asked for additional information by the IRS is simple math errors -- the numbers simply don't add up correctly on the form. Whether you use TurboTax or TaxCut or the IRS online filing, it's a great idea -- particularly for the new small business -- to make sure you use that software package -- if nothing else -- just to make sure those math errors are eliminated. Don't be too afraid of an IRS audit. Obviously, when people think in terms of the IRS, they get a little bit antsy. Nobody likes to get that letter in the mailbox on Saturday morning that's got an IRS return address in the upper left-hand corner. But if you do, the best thing to keep in mind is pay attention to your tax return. Do the due diligence that you need to to avoid the little shortcuts of filling in numbers that you don't have support for. If you just take the time to pay attention to the business and do the tax return the way you should, there's nothing to be afraid of with that audit. So at a very minimum -- just to ease the stress of that potential letter you're going to get form the IRS -- just make sure you take the extra time to use resources like nase.org, like the IRS Web site at irs.gov, and just make sure you dot your I's and cross your Ts. And then, if you do get a request from the IRS, it won't be stressful. CNN: What are some important tax law changes for tax year 2009? Hall: Always be aware that every year, the IRS changes something. For example, automobile mileage: The new rate for 2009 is 55 cents. Make sure you get that one correct. The IRS always changes the adjusted limits for alternative minimum tax. For the standard itemized deductions, all those levels are adjusted for inflation. Make sure that you get those right numbers. Using an automated software program -- having that system in place -- will help you keep up with any of those changes that occur as a matter of course with the IRS every year. CNN: What's the most frequent tax question you get asked? Hall: The first question we typically get, particularly at tax return time, is ""What can I do right now to save money on last year's tax return?"" Most tax planning ideas really end with the New Year's Eve party. But the one thing you can do today to save money on your taxes for last year is to consider making a retirement plan contribution -- whether it's a traditional IRA contribution, a self-employed pension plan contribution, lots of different ways to put money away for your own future. The IRS recognizes how important that is, and they'll even give you a tax deduction for it. So you can actually reduce the taxes you have to pay right now, just by putting money away for your own future. That's certainly something that should be considered. CNN: Should we expect future tax breaks for small businesses? Hall: The current administration and both sides of the House and Senate all promote the growth of jobs through small business. The influences of small business in generating jobs -- which are more and more important these days -- is only going to increase the influence of small business. Whether it's legislation for a standard home office deduction, which is pending, legislation for additional health credits and concentration on affordability for health care for the self-employed, which is also pending, there's lots of legislation out there to benefit small business. The more and more small businesses we have, I think more emphasis in Washington and at the state level will focus on benefits for the self-employed.","Use IRS.gov to avoid mistakes, says top tax expert at advocacy group for self-employed .

"(CNN) -- The murderer of a 16-year-old girl who bragged about his crimes was electrocuted Thursday night, a spokesman for the Virginia Department of Corrections said. Paul Warner Powell was pronounced dead at 9:09 p.m. at a correctional center in Jarratt, Virginia. He did not make a last statement at the execution attended by the victim's family. Powell was convicted in the 1999 murder of Stacie Reed and the rape of her 14-year-old sister in their Manassas, Virginia, family home. Powell's execution comes after Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell denied him clemency and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to block the execution. The killer claimed double jeopardy after state prosecutors put him on trial for a second time in the killing. In July, the high court delayed Powell's execution while considering the broader constitutional claims, which were finally rejected. Powell rejected lethal injection, the state's usual method of execution. ""I'm hopeful this is the last legal chapter in the long history of this case,"" said Powell's prosecutor, Prince William County Commonwealth's Attorney Paul Ebert. ""The survivors -- Stacie's mother and [her sister] -- have really been traumatized by delay after delay. Hopefully they're going to get some peace and closure after all these years."" CNN does not identify sexual assault victims without their permission, even though the surviving victim, now 25, has talked publicly about the case. The crime shocked the Washington area. Reed knew Powell, then 20 and an admitted racist. The state's highest court eventually threw out the 2000 verdict in the first trial, saying prosecutors had not proven other necessary death-eligible offenses were committed against the 16-year-old. Such ""aggravating"" factors could include rape, attempted rape or robbery in commission of the murder. The sexual assault and attempted murder of Reed's younger sister was upheld, and Powell was given a long prison sentence. Powell, believing he was free from execution, proceeded to write a taunting, profanity-filled letter from behind bars to Ebert, laying out explicit details of the crime unknown to investigators at the time. ""Since I have already been indicted on first degree murder and the Va. Supreme Court said that I can't be charged with capital murder again, I figured I would tell you the rest of what happened on Jan. 29, 1999, to show you how stupid all of y'all ... are,"" wrote Powell, who is white. He said he had gone to the family's home to confront Reed about dating a black man. He admitted pinning the victim, threatening to rape her, then stabbing her in the heart when the girl resisted. He then stomped on her throat. ""I guess I forgot to mention these events when I was being questioned. Ha Ha!"" he wrote in 2001. ""Do you just hate yourself for being so stupid ... and saving me?"" The killer also said that after that crime, he waited in the house until the younger girl returned from school, then attacked her, leaving her for dead. In the meantime, he drank iced tea from the family refrigerator and smoked a cigarette, part of the forensic evidence that investigators used to place Powell at the scene of the crime. With this first-hand account from Powell, he was indicted again and charged with murder and attempted rape of Stacie Reed -- a capital-eligible crime. He was convicted again, and federal and state courts subsequently upheld the conviction on appeal.","Paul Warner Powell did not make a last statement at the electrocution .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona and Manchester United are on course to meet again in the money-spinning European Champions League final after they avoided each other in the draw for the last eight. Josep Guardiola's reigning champions Barca will face English Premier League side Arsenal in the quarterfinals -- a repeat of the 2006 final which the Spanish club won 2-1. French striker Thierry Henry played for Arsenal in that game but has since joined Barca. Henry remains Arsenal's all-time leading goalscorer. The draw for the quarterfinals of the tournament took place at the headquarters of European football's governing body (UEFA) in Nyon, Switzerland where the match-ups for the semifinals were also decided. United will win the Champions League ... I feel it in my bones . Alex Ferguson's Manchester United were drawn against Bayern Munich, who they famously beat in the 1999 final. Bayern went in front after just six minutes of the final in Barcelona but United scored two injury time goals to stun the German side. Dutch coach Louis van Gaal is attempting to secure Bayern Munich's first European crown since 2001, after they knocked out Italian side Juventus in the group stages. Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan are playing first time quarterfinalists CSKA Moscow. The Italian champions dumped Mourinho's former club Chelsea out of the competition earlier this week. There is no country seeding at the last eight stage, which led to Lyon and Bordeaux being drawn together. Their tie means France is assured a representative in the last four. The Champions League is the most lucrative tournament in world football with the final worth an estimated $421 million, according to sponsors Mastercard, with the winners earning close to $150 million. The quarterfinal ties will take place the week beginning March 29. In the Europa League draw English Premier League team Liverpool were drawn against Portuguese club Benfica. There is an all-Spanish tie in the last eight after Atletico Madrid and Valencia were drawn against each other. If Liverpool get past Benfica they will face one of the Spanish teams in the semifinal, meaning either an emotional return for striker Fernando Torres to former club Atletico, or for manager Rafael Benitez to the team he used to coach, Valencia. Juventus' conquerors Fulham were drawn against German champions Wolfsburg while Hamburg pulled Belgian side Standard Liege.","Draw for the UEFA Champions League to take place in Switzerland on Friday .

"(CNN) -- Security cameras were rolling when a killer whale at SeaWorld's Florida park grabbed a trainer by her hair and pulled her underwater, leading to her death. Now SeaWorld and the family of Dawn Brancheau are fighting to keep videos and photos related to her death out of the public eye. A Florida judge on Thursday granted a request from SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment to join in a lawsuit filed last week by Brancheau's family seeking to prevent the release of the footage, which was captured at SeaWorld's Orlando, Florida, park on February 24. Brancheau was interacting with an orca named Tilikum when the animal grabbed her ponytail and pulled her underwater in front of shocked onlookers at Shamu Stadium. She died from ""multiple traumatic injuries and drowning,"" the Orange County Sheriff's office said. Portions of the incident were captured on two cameras at the park -- one that shows a view from under water and another from that park's Sky Tower, according to the family's complaint, which was filed last week. ""The underwater view does not show Mrs. Brancheau until after she had entered the water. The overhead camera was not aimed at the scene until after the incident had begun,"" the complaint states. ""Significantly neither camera shows what occurred in the moments prior to and including Mrs. Brancheau being pulled into the water and offer no insight into the cause of this tragic event."" Brancheau's family filed the complaint against the Orange County Sheriff and the District Nine Medical Examiner's Office, who have possession of the footage. Circuit Court Judge William Kirkwood granted a temporary injunction of the release of the footage, noting that the sheriff's office filed a notice with the court stating it had no position on the matter. The medical examiner's office also filed a notice of no objection to the Brancheau family's complaint. iReport: Bob Barker, Tippi Hedren speak out on Sea World incident . In a motion filed Monday, SeaWorld claimed it has an interest in the pending litigation because it is the exclusive owner of the footage. If possession of the videos is not controlled, the motion further claims, ""it is almost a certainty that they will be made publicly available on the Internet,"" causing SeaWorld to lose its exclusive right to the video. ""Further, SeaWorld's interests are generally aligned with the Plaintiffs' interests, and SeaWorld, as the former employer of Mrs. Brancheau, seeks to assist Plaintiffs in protecting their privacy interests,"" the motion states. SeaWorld also expressed concern that members of the media will be able to gain access to the videos if they become part of an investigative file with law enforcement. In fact, Florida's broad laws regarding access to public documents creates a great likelihood of such a possibility, said CNN legal analyst Lisa Bloom. ""As a general rule, matters of a police file are public record, and the media has access to contents of a police file. Most mainstream media are not going to broadcast someone being killed or someone's remains, but it's a matter of having that access to decide how to use it,"" Bloom said. ""Law enforcement files have to be released in Florida, so the media has a very strong argument not only under federal First Amendment laws but also under Florida access laws,"" Bloom said. The Brancheau family's lawsuit marks the second time this month that a family has asked the courts to intervene in the release of footage depicting dead loved ones. Earlier this month, another family made a similar appeal to the courts involving the release of photos depicting dead loved ones. The family of slain hiker Meredith Emerson last week asked a Georgia judge to issue an order preventing the release of crime scene photos depicting her nude and dismembered body. A reporter on assignment for Hustler requested the photos for a story he was doing, according to the adult magazine. A judge granted a temporary order in the case preventing the photos' release pending a hearing on the matter.","Judge grants SeaWorld's request to join family's lawsuit restricting access to footage .

"(CNN) -- The path that brought U.S. citizen David Coleman Headley to the point of pleading guilty to involvement in two international terrorism plots is complicated and twisted. His life, in many ways, is far from the average American experience, but he's also very much a product of a typical American upbringing. He's an unusual fusion, a product of two worlds, a rare blending of East and West. And because of his unusual background, Headley, experts say, is one of the most unusual and important American-born terrorists. Even his eyes -- one blue and one brown -- reflect the double life he has lived almost since the day he was born. Headley pleaded guilty Thursday to all 12 charges against him in connection with the four-day siege on India's financial capital in 2008 that left more than 160 people dead and a planned attack in Denmark. Headley, the son of an American mother and Pakistani father, was accused of extensive involvement in planning the devastating attacks on hotels in Mumbai, which the Indian government says were carried out by the Pakistan-based terrorist group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. At least six Americans were among the dead. Headley, 49, was indicted last October and charged by the U.S. government for conspiracy to murder and maim people in India and provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. He initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, but he has changed his plea as part of a deal with the government to cooperate with investigators and possibly to avoid the death penalty he might have received if convicted on some of the charges. In the federal courtroom in Chicago, Illinois, on Thursday, Headley told the judge that he did not dispute any of the 12 charges. By pleading guilty, he also gave up his right to appeal in the case. He faced six counts of conspiracy to bomb locations in India and to murder and maim persons in India and Denmark, and six counts of aiding and abetting the murder of U.S. citizens in India. The indictment against him charged that Headley scouted targets in Mumbai for more than two years to set up the November 2008 attacks. He was also accused of planning a terrorist attack on a Danish newspaper, which was never carried out. The newspaper became the target of Muslim fury in 2005 after it published cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad in a manner offensive to Muslims. Even family asks: Who is David Coleman Headley? Now that he's admitted to conspiracy to murder and maim in the Mumbai attack, even members of his own family are wondering who David Headley really is. ""I was really shocked. And just didn't expect something like that. And I mean such a hands-on accusation,"" said William Headley, his uncle, reflecting on when he first learned of the government's accusations against his nephew. ""It was like you had poured cold water inside my chest."" David Coleman Headley was born in 1960 in Washington, D.C., but with a different name: at birth, he was given the Urdu name Daood Gilani. He was the son of an eccentric, flamboyant and rebellious high society mother from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Serrill Headley; and a strict, formal Pakistani diplomat father, Sayed Salim Gilani. The couple met at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington but moved to Lahore, Pakistan, when their son was very young. ""He was the first baby I had anything to do with,"" his uncle William Headley said. ""He was the first baby I ever touched or held or anything like that. And somewhere I have a photograph of me in my pajamas holding little Daood. ... He was a nice-looking little baby."" Fractious union of East and West . After only a few years, Daood's parents split up, an early sign of the fractious union of East and West. The separation left Daood straddled between his traditional Muslim father and his very Western, very American mother. For a time, his mother remained in Pakistan, but she eventually returned to Philadelphia, where she opened a popular bar called the Khyber Pass. The Khyber Pass is the name of the main passage between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Daood remained in Pakistan throughout much of his childhood, and as a teenager he was enrolled for several years at a prestigious and regimented Pakistani military academy, the Hasan Abdal Cadet College. But then his mother pulled him out of the school and brought him back to Philadelphia. There, the teen moved into his mother's apartment above the bar. In 2006, Daood Gilani changed his name to David Coleman Headley, borrowing the family's American name, and even the middle name of William Headley's father, Coleman. The change was made, U.S. officials believe, to help Headley escape detection and travel more easily between the United States, India and Pakistan. In an exclusive television interview with CNN in January, Headley's uncle described his disbelief in learning that his own nephew was connected in any way to the massacre in Mumbai -- disbelief that lingered until he began receiving letters from his nephew in his jail cell. ""To find an insider in my own family involved [in terrorism] -- you're not responsible for what your family does and yet you have such a close association with it, it's your blood."" Headley wrote to his uncle from jail, saying that despite his heritage, he was now 100 percent Muslim. Headley's life has been full of twists and turns, from his dual heritage childhood -- being equally comfortable in Pakistan's Muslim circles and in Philadelphia's social scene -- to his marriage to a blond American beauty and subsequent divorce, after which he took a traditional Muslim wife. Drug trafficking snare . In the 1990s, Headley became a major drug dealer and turned informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration after being caught, according to his family. His involvement with the DEA may have been one of the factors that pushed him toward Islamic extremism. In 1997, he was running a video shop in New York. On February 7 of that year, he was in a midtown hotel negotiating to bring a large load of heroin from the Middle East to New York City. But he had walked into a trap. The hotel room, on the ninth floor, was wired by the Feds. As Gilani tried to escape, he found himself surrounded by gun-toting DEA agents. It was a moment that became the ultimate turning point in his life, said his uncle. ""Daood said 'If I get free of this I'm going to commit myself to God,' "" William Headley recounted. ""So that is when, I would say, he became a serious Muslim."" What happened next is somewhat of a mystery. While his co-conspirator in the drug deal went to prison for 10 years, Headley was out within 15 months. His family believes the DEA was using him as their own informant, frequently sending him to Pakistan and Afghanistan to meet directly with heroin dealers. Those trips may also have put Headley in direct contact with Islamic terror groups who use the drug trade to finance their operations. It was during this time that he may have first encountered Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, the Pakistani group that some say is now second only to al Qaeda in its global terrorist reach. The indictment indicated that Headley had moved among senior figures in Lashkar -- including Ilyas Kashmiri, who's alleged to have had contacts with al Qaeda. Headley case called unique . The Headley case is unique for many reasons, experts say. ""It reads like a spy novel more than your typical terrorism cases,"" said Frank Cilluffo, who heads the George Washington University Homeland Security Policy Institute. He says Headley was a sophisticated and valuable asset for anyone in the terrorist world, because of his ability to move easily between the East and the West. ""This is someone who clearly lived in two different worlds and grew up in two different worlds and had an awareness of both the United States -- having spent much of his adult life and later childhood life here -- as well as in Pakistan,"" said Cilluffo. ""Clearly, you have someone who was conflicted, even though he lived in both worlds. You get the sense that he never felt at home in either world, searching for his identity ... and we know how, unfortunately, it plays out,"" he added. Headley's uncle still finds it hard to believe. He was shocked when CNN called to tell him that his nephew was pleading guilty. The nephew he knew was not someone who could have been involved in a terrorist plot, William Headley said. ""We absolutely cannot imagine it,"" he said. ""It's not at all consistent with anything we know at all.""","David Coleman Headley is a product of two worlds, a rare blending of East and West .

"Jerusalem (CNN)  -- In a bid to end what it calls illegal riots, the Israeli military will prohibit outsider access to areas in two occupied West Bank villages one day a week, according to a statement explaining the move. ""Every week, violent, illegal riots take place in the area of Nil'in and Bil'in, during the course of which members of the security forces are wounded and heavy damage is caused to the security fence and to public property,"" the Israeli military statement read. ""In an effort to prevent the inciters of these riots from reaching the area in which the riots take place, three weeks ago, OC Central Command Maj. Gen. Avi Mizrahi signed an order designating the area between the fence and the villages of Nil'in and Bil'in as a closed military zone."" Word of the Israeli military order became public Monday. For the past five years the two Palestinian towns have been home to weekly Friday protests opposing Israel's separation barrier, the over-700-kilometer stretch of concrete wall and fence that separates Israel from the West Bank. The demonstrations have become a weekly ritual and the center of a nascent non-violent Palestinian resistance movement, which attract an assortment of Palestinians, Israelis and international activists. However, the demonstrations often degenerate into clashes between Israeli military personnel and stone-throwing youths. The protest sites will be closed between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. every Friday for the next six months, but the closure does not apply to residents of the villages. The Palestinian Authority Cabinet issued a statement saying it ""condemned the repressive actions by the occupation forces against peaceful demonstrations, as well as the declaration of Bil'in and Nil'in as closed military areas every Friday for six months."" The cabinet ""stressed the right of the Palestinian people, according to international laws, to defy occupation measures, settlement activities, and the building of the wall."" The move comes after months of increased Israeli military activity in the form of night raids and arrests in the villages. Residents and protest organizers also have decried the latest Israeli military action, saying in a news release that it is part of a ""persecution campaign against Palestinian activists in an attempt to suppress the rising tide of West Bank popular resistance to the occupation."" Speaking to CNN last month, Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli military, acknowledged Israeli army activity in the towns and said Israel has the responsibility to deal those who were leading the protests. ""If those people who are organizing it from even behind the scenes, they cannot be above the law, and that's what we're dealing with."" Gaby Lasky, a lawyer representing village residents, said the military order is illegal and argued that ""closed military zone orders are not meant to deal with demonstrations, which are clearly in the civic rather than the military realm."" According to the Palestinian activist group Popular Struggle, six protesters have been killed in the demonstrations since 2008. The Israeli military says more than a hundred of its soldiers have been wounded.","Two Palestinian towns have been home to weekly protests opposing separation barrier .

"Washington (CNN) -- Health care reform advocates inched closer to victory Wednesday as a high-profile liberal Democrat switched his position and announced his intention to vote for a sweeping $875 billion plan under consideration in the House of Representatives. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, said he believes ""health care is a civil right."" He had previously characterized the bill, which cleared the Senate in December, as little more than a boondoggle for private insurers. Kucinich was publicly lobbied for his vote by President Barack Obama during the president's visit this week to Kucinich's congressional district in Ohio. He told reporters he's had four meetings with Obama to discuss the bill. ""The president's visit to my district ... underscored the urgency of this vote,"" Kucinich said. ""I have doubts about the bill ... [but] I've decided to cast a vote in favor of the legislation."" He said he ultimately had ""to make a decision on the bill as it is, not on the bill as I'd like to see it."" Kucinich is a backer of a single-payer health care system under which the government would fund all costs billed by doctors and hospitals. Kucinich's decision to change his vote is ""a good sign,"" Obama told reporters in the Oval Office. ""I told him thank you."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said she thought Kucinich's switch would make a difference with a large number of liberal activists. ""He's been a supporter of health care for all Americans for a long time,"" she said. ""He has a constituency, and many of those people still don't understand why there isn't a public [option]."" Pelosi has repeatedly expressed confidence that she will have enough support to pass the bill when it comes to the floor for a final vote. Read more about how votes are lining up . Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, indicated Wednesday the vote could come at some point this weekend. He said the leadership is still waiting for final cost estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on a package of changes to the measure. Asked if the release of the CBO numbers was imminent, Pelosi said, ""I would have said ... half an hour ago, hopefully any minute. I think it's going to take a little more time."" She said she had no explanation for the delay. ""I don't know the calculation,"" she said. ""I don't know how they do it. Whatever it is, they're the gospel and we have to live by it."" Later, Pelosi spokesman Nadeam Elshami said that the CBO estimates would not be released Wednesday night. Since the Democrats have said the bill will be available for reading for 72 hours before a vote, the vote can take place no sooner than Sunday, provided the CBO numbers are posted Thursday. Pelosi needs 216 votes from her 253-member caucus to pass the Senate bill. No Republicans are expected to back it. A number of House Democrats have refused to state their voting intentions publicly. Twenty-seven House Democrats, however, have indicated they will join Republicans in opposing the Senate plan. That puts opponents of reform 11 votes shy of the 216 needed to prevent Obama from scoring a major victory on his top domestic priority. Meanwhile, GOP leaders continued to pound away at the legislation on Wednesday, slamming House Democratic leaders for considering the use of a controversial legislative maneuver to pass the Senate bill. Pelosi may try to help House Democrats unhappy with the Senate bill by allowing them to avoid a direct vote on the measure. She is considering pushing for a vote on a rule that would simply ""deem"" the Senate bill to be passed. The House then would proceed to a separate vote on the more popular package of changes to the Senate plan. ""I've never seen anything like the plan that House Democrats hatched this week to jam their health care bill through Congress,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said Wednesday. ""Historians will remember this as a new low in this debate, the week that America was introduced to the 'scheme and deem' approach to legislating. They'll remember this as the week that Congress tried to pull the wool over the eyes of the public in order to get around their will."" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Tuesday that Republicans will try to block the procedure. They will try to force a vote on a resolution requiring the Senate health care bill to be brought to an up-or-down vote. Boehner has called the maneuver -- also known as a ""self-executing rule"" -- the ""ultimate in Washington power grabs."" House Republicans sent a letter to the Democratic head of the House Rules Committee on Wednesday asking her to move an upcoming hearing on the health care bill to a larger room to account for overwhelming public interest in the issue. The committee is responsible for deciding whether the full House will have a chance to pass the Senate bill using the self-executing rule. ""While C-SPAN may decide to cover the hearing, that does not satisfy the need for the maximum amount of transparency and openness needed to give the American people faith in this process,"" the letter said. ""By moving the hearing to a larger room, we can ensure more Americans will have the opportunity to participate in our proceedings and not be turned away at the door."" Where does health care reform stand? If enacted, the Democratic reform proposal would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid more than four decades ago. The plan is expected to extend insurance coverage to more than 30 million Americans. The Senate bill also would reduce federal deficits by about $118 billion over 10 years, according to CBO estimates. Top Republicans contend the plan amounts to an ill-conceived government takeover of the country's health care system. They have said it would do little to slow spiraling medical costs. They also argue it would lead to higher premiums and taxes for middle-class families while resulting in deep Medicare cuts. Public opinion polls indicate a majority of Americans have turned against the administration's health care reform plan, though individual elements of the proposal remain widely popular. CNN's Dan Lothian, Charles Riley, Alan Silverleib, Jeff Simon, Deirdre Walsh and Robert Yoon contributed to this report.","Democratic leaders say timing of vote will depend on CBO figures, which are delayed .

"(CNN) -- A five-year-old British boy who was kidnapped in Pakistan earlier this month has been found safe and is back with his relatives, the British High Commission said Tuesday. Sahil Saeed was released at a school in the Punjab province of Pakistan, said Assistant Chief Constable David Thompson of the Greater Manchester Police in England, near his parents' residence in Oldham. From there, Sahil wandered into a field and was found by residents who looked after him until police arrived, Thompson said. Regional Pakistani police said Sahil was found near the town of Danga in Punjab province, close to where he was abducted March 3. Sahil was in good condition, said Aslam Tareen, the head of the regional police. ""He is with members of family in Pakistan and the Pakistani police, and there is also contact from the British High Commission,"" Thompson said. He added that Sahil had already spoken to his mother and father in England by telephone and that both parents were ""clearly relieved"" to speak to their son. The High Commission issued a statement thanking police in Jhelum, another town in the eastern province of Punjab, for the boy's return. ""This is fantastic news that brings to an end a traumatic ordeal faced by Sahil and his family,"" said Adam Thomson, the British high commissioner to Pakistan. Police arrested some of the kidnappers, said Rana Sanaullah, the provincial law minister. Sahil, a British citizen of Pakistani descent, was on the last day of a two-week vacation in Pakistan before he was to return home to Oldham, in northern England. Gunmen barged into Sahil's grandmother's home in Jhelum and took him. They reportedly demanded a ransom of 10 million rupees ($118,000). Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik had said the captors included someone close to the family. ""There is someone who is very close to the family because the way the situation happened, the way the entry was made,"" Malik told reporters. But Tareen said Tuesday there is no evidence that any family member was involved. There was also no indication a ransom was paid, Tareen said. Sanaullah, the law minister, said the kidnappers were part of a ring that operated in and out of Pakistan. He did not elaborate. Thompson, of the Greater Manchester Police, could not comment on the possibility of arrests in England. ""At this stage there are no inquiries that we're carrying out in the UK that would lead me to contemplate that we'd make an arrest in the near future,"" he said.","NEW: Sahil Saeed was released at a school in the Punjab province of Pakistan .

"London, England (CNN) -- Saying it plans to lease aircraft and provide replacement workers, British Airways on Monday unveiled an ambitious contingency plan in preparation for the first of two strikes by the union members representing the airline's cabin crews. The Unite union's leadership aimed to ground the airline through its action, but ""the flag will continue to fly,"" said Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, in a written statement. ""Around 60 percent of our customers will be able to fly as planned and many thousands more can be rebooked onto alternative BA flights or onto rival airlines."" Members of the Unite union voted to strike for three days beginning March 20, and for four more days beginning March 27. BA said Monday its contingency plans will allow about 45,000 customers to fly each day during the first strike period. ""At this stage, the vast majority of flights between March 23 and March 31 remain in the schedule, and we will update customers due to fly during the second strike period after the first strike period has ended,"" the statement said. ""The airline is still available to hold further talks but wants customers to have early warning of its flying schedule to allow sufficient time for alternative travel arrangements to be made."" At London's Heathrow Airport, more than 60 percent of British Airways long-haul flights will be operated during the first strike period, the company said. In addition, it will operate all long-haul flights to London's Gatwick Airport and more than half of the short-haul flights at Gatwick. ""The airline will operate some of its own short-haul flights at Heathrow, and will supplement its schedule by leasing up to 22 aircraft with pilots and crews from eight different airlines based in the UK and Europe,"" the statement said. ""Due to the numbers of cabin crew who have called in to offer their services over the weekend, the schedule will be slightly larger than we had originally anticipated,"" Walsh said. The airline said it has also made agreements with 40 other carriers to rebook customers free of charge during the strike period if their British Airways flights are canceled. ""We will continue to try to prevent this strike taking place, but we have reached a point when we must now offer some clarity to our customers who have waited with great patience since Friday, when the strike dates were first announced,"" Walsh said in the British Airways statement. ""... I recognize the frustration of customers booked for travel from March 27 onwards, when the second stoppage is due to begin, and we will do all we can to give them more clarity about their specific flight number once we start to understand just how many cabin crew are willing to work as normal."" The industrial action is over planned changes to cabin crew conditions, which British Airways says will save the carrier more than £60 million (approximately $90 million) a year. Unite has said the plans call for working hours to be extended and crew levels to be cut, changes that it has said will damage customer service and the BA brand. The airline's management submitted a formal offer to the union Thursday, Unite said, but added that the offer failed to address union concerns about crew numbers and service delivery. That prompted Unite officials to announce the strike dates Friday. When that occurred, the airline took its offer off the table. The airline, for its part, also has rejected all union proposals so far, saying they would have saved the airline significantly less money than the airline's own planned changes. British Airways has opened an extra call center manned by volunteers to help customers, the Monday statement said. ""We remain absolutely determined to search for a sensible settlement and our door remains open to Unite, day or night. It is not too late for ... Unite to call off this action and we will do all we can to reinstate some of the canceled flights,"" Walsh said in the company's statement Monday.","BA: Contingency plans will allow about 45,000 customers to fly each day .

"(CNN) -- Three people connected to the U.S. consulate in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, were killed in two drive-by shootings, a senior White House official told CNN Sunday. Two of the victims were an American employee at the consulate and her U.S. citizen husband. Their 1-year-old child, who was in a vehicle with the couple at the time of the shooting, survived the incident, according to the El Paso County Sheriff's Office. The American couple were found dead inside a white Toyota RAV4 with Texas license plates, according to the Chihuahua state attorney general's office. The woman was shot in the neck and left arm, while the man had a bullet wound near his right eye, officials said. ""We know that the U.S. citizens were targeted,"" Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz told CNN, saying a police officer witnessed a car shooting at the Americans' car. ""We know they were chasing them. We know they wanted to kill them."" The Americans were identified as Arthur Redelfs, 34, and Lesley Enriquez by the El Paso County Sheriff's Office, where Redelfs worked as a detention officer. Redelfs was a 10-year veteran of the department, according to Jesse Tovar, a spokesman for the sheriff's office. ""On behalf of the men and women of the Sheriff's Office, I would like to extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to the family during this difficult time,"" said Sheriff Richard Wiles. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with them."" Authorities retrieved only one shell casing, from a 9 mm weapon. About 10 minutes before authorities received the call, they were alerted to a body inside a 2003 Honda Pilot. Inside was the husband of the Mexican employee, identified as Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, 37. Reyes said the victim was a state police officer who was married to a Mexican employee at the U.S. consulate. Two children, 4 and 7, were injured in that shooting and transported to the hospital, the attorney general's office said. Police recovered two shells at that scene from an assault rifle, authorities said. ""The president is deeply saddened and outraged by the news of the brutal murders of three people associated with the United States Consulate General in Ciudad Juarez,"" National Security Council Spokesman Mike Hammer said in the statement Sunday. ""He extends his condolences to the families and condemns these attacks on consular and diplomatic personnel serving at our foreign missions. In concert with Mexican authorities, we will work tirelessly to bring their killers to justice."" In response, the U.S. State Department authorized the temporary relocation of employees' families working in border-area consulates. ""These appalling assaults on members of our own State Department family are, sadly, part of a growing tragedy besetting many communities in Mexico,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement Sunday night. ""They underscore the imperative of our continued commitment to work closely with the Government of (Mexican) President (Felipe) Calderón to cripple the influence of trafficking organizations at work in Mexico."" The families of employees at U.S. consulates in Tijuana, Nogales, Ciudad Juarez, Nuevo Laredo, Monterrey and Matamoros, are allowed to leave for a period of 30 days ""in response to an increase in violence along the Mexican side of its border with the U.S.,"" State Department spokesman Fred Lash told CNN. After 30 days, the authorization can be renewed, depending on a review, Lash said, adding that this was not a mandatory evacuation. The announcement was part of a warning to American citizens regarding travel to Mexico. The warning urges U.S. citizens to delay nonessential travel to parts of the states of Durango, Coahuila and Chihuahua, where Juarez is located, because of recent violent attacks. U.S. government employees are restricted from traveling to all or parts of these three states. The attacks include the kidnapping and killing of two resident U.S. citizens in Chihuahua, the warning states. ""Some recent confrontations between Mexican authorities and drug cartel members have resembled small-unit combat, with cartels employing automatic weapons and grenades,"" the warning says. ""During some of these incidents, U.S. citizens have been trapped and temporarily prevented from leaving the area."" The mayor said the shootings highlight a problem shared by both countries along their border. ""It is not just a Mexican problem -- it's is a U.S.-Mexico problem,"" Reyes said. ""I'm very glad that the U.S. has taken that position."" He said he supported the State Department's authorization to consular families and that ""it is important they feel safe."" Mexico on Sunday said that its government was committed to protecting all people, citizens and visitors alike, diplomats or not. ""The Mexican government deeply laments the killings of three people linked to the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juarez,"" Mexico's foreign ministry said in a statement. ""The Mexican authorities are working with determination to clear up the facts surrounding the crime scene and put those responsible before the law."" Juarez is one of the front lines in Mexico's war against the drug cartels that operate in its territory. More than 2,600 people were killed in Juarez in 2009. Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas, has become a focal point of Mexican President Felipe Calderon's anti-drug efforts after the January 31 killings of 15 people, most of whom were students with no ties to organized crime. The incident sparked outrage across Mexico. In the western state of Guerrero, at least 25 people were killed in a series of violent acts on Saturday, state officials said. The bodies of 14 people, including nine civilians and five police officers, were found in various parts of the resort city of Acapulco, the official Notimex news agency reported, citing Guerrero Public Security Secretary Juan Heriberto Salinas. In the small city of Ajuchitlan del Progreso, 10 civilians and one soldier were killed in two shootouts that started when federal officials tried to carry out search warrants on two locations, Salinas said. Police in the state were on a heightened security alert, he said. The government has not released official figures, but national media say 7,600 Mexicans lost their lives in the war on drugs in 2009. Calderon said last year that 6,500 Mexicans died in drug violence in 2008.

"Washington (CNN) -- Democratic congressional leaders unveiled a long-awaited $940 billion compromise health care plan Thursday, setting the stage for a final legislative showdown on President Obama's domestic priority. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs announced that Obama had decided to delay an upcoming trip to Australia and Indonesia to help push the bill over the finish line. The president had been set to depart Washington on Sunday, the same day that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the measure. Watch Gibbs defend health plan maneuver . ""I'm sure he wants to be here for the history,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California. If enacted, the measure would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid more than four decades ago. It would extend insurance coverage to an additional 32 million Americans, according to a preliminary analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Among other things, the plan would expand Medicare prescription drug coverage, increase federal subsidies to help people buy insurance, and ban denials of coverage for pre-existing conditions. It seeks to bridge the gap between previous House and Senate bills partly by watering down and delaying the implementation of a tax on high-end insurance plans. As with earlier House and Senate plans, it includes significant reductions in Medicare spending, in part through changes in payments made under the Medicare Advantage program. It also eliminates a deeply unpopular provision in the Senate bill that exempts Nebraska from paying increased Medicaid expenses. The compromise plan would cut the nation's deficit by $138 billion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It would further reduce the deficit by more than $1 trillion in the following decade. The full House is now tentatively set to consider two measures Sunday: the $875 billion plan passed by the Senate in December and the compromise, which would bring the total to $940 billion. The compromise plan cannot become law if the Senate bill is not also enacted. If the Senate bill passes, it would go to Obama to be signed into law. If the revisions unveiled Thursday are also approved, they would still have to clear the Senate. House members unhappy with the less expansive Senate bill have received assurances from top Senate Democrats that they will pass the $940 billion compromise. House Democrats pushed hard to ensure the compromise included an expansion of subsidies to low- and middle-income families, as well as a reduction in the tax on high-end ""Cadillac"" plans. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, told reporters Thursday that the budget office's cost estimate ""will go a long way to get [fiscally conservative Democrats] to feel comfortable with the legislation."" The Senate bill, if allowed to stand unchanged, would reduce federal deficits by $20 billion less than the compromise plan over the next 10 years. GOP leaders said the new budget office estimate of the revised plan had not changed their opinion of the overall measure, which they vehemently oppose. ""It's not too late for the American people to continue to speak up,"" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Thursday. ""They need to yell a little louder, and we can stop this."" Republicans insist the Democratic proposal will do little to slow spiraling medical costs. They also say it would lead to higher premiums and taxes for middle-class families while resulting in deep Medicare cuts. Pelosi has nevertheless expressed confidence in recent weeks that she will have enough support to pass both the Senate plan and the compromise bill when they come to the House floor. The speaker needs 216 votes from her 253-member caucus to pass the measures. No Republicans are expected to back either one. Watch Pelosi express her confidence in the plan . Twenty-seven House Democrats indicated to CNN on Wednesday they will join Republicans in opposing the Senate plan. That leaves opponents of reform 11 votes shy of defeating the measure. Pelosi has tried to sweeten the deal for House liberals by adding a large student loan reform measure to the compromise plan. The measure, which is a priority for Obama, would end the practice of having private banks offer student loans while expanding direct lending from the government. The speaker may also try to help House Democrats unhappy with the Senate bill by allowing them to avoid a direct vote on the measure. She is considering pushing for a vote on a rule that would simply ""deem"" the Senate bill to be passed. The House then would proceed to a separate vote on the changes incorporated in the $940 billion version of the plan. Read about the highlights of the compromise plan . Republicans failed Thursday to force a vote on a resolution requiring the Senate health care bill to be brought to an up-or-down vote. GOP leaders are also fuming over Democrats' decision to use a legislative maneuver called reconciliation, which will allow the $940 billion plan -- if passed by the House -- to clear the Senate with a simple majority of 51 votes. Senate Democrats lost their filibuster-proof 60-seat supermajority in January with the election of GOP Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts. Republicans say that reconciliation, which is limited to provisions pertaining to the budget, was never meant to facilitate passage of a sweeping reform measure such as the health care bill. Democrats say that reconciliation was used to pass several major bills in recent years, including President George W. Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. Public opinion polls indicate that Americans remain sharply divided over the Democrats' health care reform agenda, though individual elements of it remain widely popular. CNN's Ted Barrett, Dana Bash, Lisa Desjardins, Brianna Keilar and Kristi Keck contributed to this report.","NEW: GOP effort to require up-or-down vote on Senate health care bill fails .

"(CNN) -- Mexican President Felipe Calderon made his third visit in a little more than a month Tuesday to the troubled border city of Juarez, where three people associated with the U.S. Consulate were killed over the weekend. Ciudad Juarez is the most violent city in Mexico, with more than 2,600 drug-related deaths in 2009. No official numbers are available, but more than 400 killings have been reported in local media this year. The city, long the focal point of Calderon's war on drug cartels, came to renewed prominence after the January 31 killings of 15 people, most of them students with no links to organized crime. The massacre sparked outrage throughout Mexico and drew worldwide attention. Saturday's deaths of a pregnant woman and two other people connected with the U.S. Consulate renewed attention to the blood-soaked city. Calderon visited Juarez twice in mid-February within a one-week period, meeting with local officials and residents. More such meetings were scheduled for Tuesday. Although Tuesday's visit had been scheduled before the latest slayings, analysts say it highlights the city's importance to the president. ""What it says is that he has really decided that success in Juarez is essential for stemming the tide of organized crime,"" said Andrew Selee, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Mexico Institute. ""He has staked his presidency on success in Juarez."" Juarez, which accounted for about one-third of the drug-related killings in Mexico last year, was already significant because of the high death count, Selee said. But the killings in January and over the weekend have elevated the city to a symbolic level, the analyst said. ""It has gained an emotional value,"" Selee said. The latest killings were carried out by a local gang known as Los Aztecas, who are allied with the Juarez Cartel, Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said. The three victims were followed and targeted, Reyes said. They were attacked as they left a birthday party at the U.S. Consulate in Juarez. U.S. and Mexican officials said a consulate employee who was four months pregnant and her husband, a U.S. citizen who was a jailer in El Paso, Texas, across the border from Juarez, were slain in their SUV. The couple's 10-month-old daughter, who was in the vehicle, was not injured, Reyes and other officials said. Authorities identified the couple as El Paso residents Arthur Redelfs, 34, and Lesley Ann Enriquez, 35. Redelfs was a 10-year veteran of the El Paso County Sheriff's Office, department spokesman Jesse Tovar said. The third victim was identified as Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, 37, a state police officer who was married to a Mexican employee at the U.S. Consulate. His wife was not traveling with him, but two of their children, ages 4 and 7, were in the car and were wounded, officials said. Authorities said they don't know of a motive, nor had they made any arrests Tuesday. Widespread violence throughout northern Mexico in the past few weeks has led U.S. officials to take precautions, including the temporary relocation of State Department employees' families in border-area consulates. The family members at U.S. consulates in Tijuana, Nogales, Ciudad Juarez, Nuevo Laredo, Monterrey and Matamoros are allowed to leave for up to 30 days, the State Department said. The leave can be renewed after 30 days. The announcement was part of a continued warning to U.S. citizens regarding travel to Mexico. U.S. citizens are advised to delay nonessential travel to parts of the states of Durango, Coahuila and Chihuahua, where Juarez is located. In addition, U.S. government employees are restricted from traveling to all or parts of the three states. Attacks have included the kidnapping and killing of two resident U.S. citizens in Chihuahua, the warning states. ""Some recent confrontations between Mexican authorities and drug cartel members have resembled small-unit combat, with cartels employing automatic weapons and grenades,"" the warning says. ""During some of these incidents, U.S. citizens have been trapped and temporarily prevented from leaving the area."" About two weeks ago, the Texas Department of Public Safety took the unprecedented step of telling college students not to visit Mexican border cities during spring break because they are too dangerous. It was the first time Texas authorities had taken that step. Canada, likewise, issued an advisory Tuesday urging citizens not to take nonessential trips to Ciudad Juarez and to ""exercise a high degree of caution"" throughout Mexico. ""Travelers are advised to reconsider their need to travel to Ciudad Juarez and should only do so if it is absolutely necessary,"" the government warning says. Asked if Ciudad Juarez is safe for visitors, Mayor Reyes laughed softly. ""We have a problem in Ciudad Juarez,"" he said. ""We can't deny that or lessen it. ""Normally, the violence is directed at people involved in crime, but at times, civilians are affected who are not involved in crime."" Violence last weekend is a prime example of the extent of the problem. In the western state of Guerrero, for instance, at least 25 people were killed Saturday, state officials said. The bodies of 14 people, including nine civilians and five police officers, were found in various parts of the resort city of Acapulco, the official Notimex news agency reported, citing Guerrero Public Security Secretary Juan Heriberto Salinas. In the small city of Ajuchitlan del Progreso, 10 civilians and one soldier were killed in two shootouts that started when federal officials tried to carry out search warrants in two locations, Salinas said.

Calderon said last year that 6,500 Mexicans died in drug killings in 2008. No official figures are available, but unofficial tallies this year say more than 17,000 people have been killed since Calderon declared war on the cartels after assuming office in December 2006.","Felipe Calderon goes to troubled city for third time in little more than a month .

"Tenino, Washington (CNN) -- Authorities in Alaska are examining two wolves to see if they are the animals that killed a jogger last week, said a wildlife biologist investigating the attack. The two gray wolves were tracked down Monday and shot to death from a helicopter near the town of Chignik Lake, Alaska, said wildlife biologist Lem Butler. The wolves are suspected of killing special-education teacher Candice Berner last week. Berner, 32, was attacked while jogging near the town, authorities said. ""We had a systematic search,"" he said. ""These were the only two wolves we could find tracks for."" The wolves appeared to be the same ones that left tracks at the scene of the attack, and they matched witnesses' descriptions of the animals seen near Berner's body, Butler said. Officials will conduct tests on the wolves' carcasses to determine whether they killed Berner, Butler said. The carcasses will also be examined to see whether the animals were rabid or starving, or suffering from some condition that led them to attack a human, he said. The rare wolf attack shook Chignik Lake, population 105. ""We see wolves a lot,"" said Johnny Lind, president of the Village Council. ""But we've never had anything like this happen."" The killing is thought to be only the second fatal wolf attack in North America in more than a century. In 2005, a wolf pack killed a geology student in Saskatchewan, Canada. Wolves typically avoid human contact and do not threaten people, said John Blankenship, executive director of Wolf Haven. ""They are not human predators. It's healthy to have awareness of them, for sure. But to be afraid of them is too strong an emotion,"" he said. Wolf Haven in Tenino educates the public about wolves and serves as a haven for about 50 rescued wolves, many of them once kept as pets.","Teacher was killed by wolves last week while jogging near Alaska town .

"New York (CNN) -- The rash of stories about priestly sexual abuse in Europe, especially in Ireland and Germany, has put many Catholics on the defensive. They should not be. While sexual molestation of any kind is always indefensible, the politics surrounding this story is also indefensible. Employers from every walk of life, in both the U.S. and Europe, have long handled cases of alleged sex abuse by employees as an internal matter. Rarely have employers called the cops, and none was required to do so. Though this is starting to change, any discussion of employee sexual abuse that took place 30 and 40 years ago must acknowledge this reality. Thus it hardly comes as a surprise that Cardinal Sean Brady in Ireland did not summon the authorities about a case involving a priest in the 1970s. What is surprising is why some are now indicting him, acting as if his response was the exception to the rule. Selective indignation at the Catholic Church is not confined to Brady. Why, for example, are the psychologists and psychiatrists who pledged to ""fix"" abusers treated so lightly? After all, employers from the corporate world to the Catholic Church were told over and over again that therapy works and to give the offender a second chance. Indeed, the zeitgeist of the day was that rehabilitation not only works, it is virtuous. That such advice was wildly oversold can now be agreed upon by almost everyone, and that is precisely why it smacks of politics to deny how strongly held the rehabilitative ideal was. Had the Catholic Church simply tossed the offenders out, it would have been branded as heartless. There is also much noise about Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger -- now the pope -- approving the transfer of a priest out of his archdiocese in Germany for therapy. That happened 30 years ago. Again, he did exactly what virtually every other leader, clerical or secular, did. Anyone who maintains that in North America or Europe it was common practice for employers outside the Catholic Church to file a police report about suspected wrongdoing by their employees needs to put up or shut up: Where is the evidence? Beyond that issue, the focus on sexual abuse in the Catholic Church is far out of proportion to the attention given by the media to the sexual molestation of minors when committed by non-Catholic clergymen. According to a report by the New York Times in October, the Brooklyn district attorney's office had filed charges in 26 cases of sexual abuse involving members of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. Just this month, Rabbi Baruch Lebovits was found guilty on eight counts of sexually abusing a Brooklyn boy. Yet the Times, which has run several stories on the decades-old cases in Ireland and Germany, never reported it. And none of it merits the kind of attention given to priests. Catholics aren't fooled. Public school teachers accused of sex abuse are either transferred to another school district -- it's so common that it is called ""passing the trash""-- or they are assigned to what, in New York, they call a ""rubber room"" (these are places where teachers draw full salary and benefits doing makeshift administrative work). Both the teachers unions and state law allow this outrage to continue. Maybe if the media concentrated on this problem, solutions would follow. But the politics of the day being what they are, don't bet on it. It's a lot sexier to nail the Catholic Church. The hyper-concentration on the Catholic Church is not by accident. The Church preaches an ethic of sexual restraint -- a profoundly countercultural idea -- so when a priest fails, it's tempting to highlight it. Human nature being what it is, that's understandable. But it's also immoral. Quite frankly, if sexual abuse is wrong, it should not matter what the identity of the abuser is. Selective justice is the highest form of injustice. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bill Donohue.","Bill Donohue says church treated sex abuse as internal matter, as did other leaders .
He says critics are unfairly implying Church acted differently in failing to disclose such cases .
He says other faiths, professions have had similar problems but less publicity ."
"Washington (CNN)  -- On a Saturday at the Lamar Edward Salon, a small cluster of women watch a demonstration of a new product. Their giggles turn into growing interest. They learn the city is handing out free samples, but it's not shampoo or makeup products. Instead, the women can leave the salon with free female condoms tucked into their purses. Co-owner Gerald Armstrong said his salon is a perfect place for a frank discussion about safe sex. ""We talk about beauty and we talk about hair and makeup and things to make them feel better,"" Armstrong said. ""We should start talking about things that are helping them to live longer."" Faced with an HIV infection rate six times higher than the national average, District of Columbia officials are launching an unorthodox campaign to halt the spread of the disease. They will hand out 500,000 female condoms at salons and community centers and offer informal training sessions to teach women how to use the little-known product. About 30 percent of people infected in Washington are women, and the numbers are growing, said Shannon Hader, senior deputy director of the district's Department of Health. HIV is particularly prevalent among African-Americans, and more black women between 25 and 34 will die from HIV/AIDS nationwide than from any other cause. ""Women haven't really gotten the message that they're at risk,"" Hader said. ""So we are very, very concerned with making sure that women in the district realize that HIV, in fact, is a woman's disease too."" In the past, the higher price of female condoms kept them from reaching the ubiquity of the male condom. A newly released version, called FC2, is cheaper and designed to be more user-friendly, but the female condom is still relatively unknown. So when health officials in Washington decided to use a $500,000 grant from the M.A.C. AIDS Fund to distribute female condoms, they allocated a portion for marketing. ""One of the things about female condoms is that they're a new product to most people,"" Hader said. ""So like any new product, you can't expect it just to sell itself, just to take off on its own."" The city trained outreach workers to demonstrate female condom use and then sent them into salons and onto college campuses to reach women where they already feel comfortable. Charlene Cotton became an outreach worker after she discovered she was HIV-positive six years ago. Now Cotton has begun giving demonstrations on the female condom. She says she's a convert. ""It will give a woman a choice, freedom to use protection when a man feels as though that he doesn't have to use a condom,"" Cotton said. ""And it gives her the opportunity to say, 'Well you don't have to use one, so I'll use one.' "" She said demonstrators ask women to take home three female condoms in the hopes it will increase their familiarity with the product. ""Try it three times,"" Cotton said. ""First time, experiment [with] it, you feel it, try to apply it. Second time, apply it again. And the third time, use it with your friend. And if they're not convinced by the third time,"" then they probably won't continue to use it, she said. Before Katrina Byrd saw a demonstration she was not enthusiastic about using an ""unattractive"" female condom. But after another woman offered tips on female condom use and explained the condoms could prevent sexually transmitted diseases, Byrd said she would give them a chance. ""I'll try it,"" Byrd said. ""I'll see if through my own experience I'll like it."" That's the response that prevention advocates are hoping to hear. ""HIV and AIDS has declared war on our communities, particularly on African-American women. And I feel that we are justified as health care providers to look for every single avenue to fight back,"" said Dr. Celia Maxwell, director of the Women's Health Institute at Howard University. ""For me the important thing would be that even one women is spared from becoming infected.""","D.C. officials will hand out 500,000 female condoms at salons and community centers .

"Editor's Note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is broadband television network of VICE. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- For the launch of VICE magazine in Mexico, we decided to make an entire issue about Mexico, written entirely by Mexicans. At the same time, we came up with the idea of producing a parallel version of that issue in video for VBS.TV and populate our site with documentaries about Mexico, local artists, local musicians and beautiful Mexican girls for the entire month. Since then, we repeated the same concept when we launched the magazine in Brazil, and we produced an entire month of content about China during the Olympics. Producer Santiago Stelley and I spent a few weeks in Mexico City producing an hour-long documentary about nighttime crime photographers, interviewing some of the best bands and artists in the city and shooting a project about B movies inspired by the lives of drug traffickers. A couple of days before Mother's Day, I got to spend a few days at an amazing place called Casa Xochiquetzal (The House of the Beautiful Flowers), a retirement home for older prostitutes in Tepito, one of the sketchiest neighborhoods in the city. I went there with Guillermo Rivero, who wrote the print version of the article, and I produced the documentary version of the same story. The house has a minimum age requirement of 60 and can accommodate up to 45 women. Right now, there are only 23 retired ladies of the night living there. The majority of them continue working, because there are still people who want to pay to have sex with them. See the rest of House of the Setting Sun at VBS.TV . We had the opportunity to meet some of the women that live there, such as 86-year-old Reyna, who sang for us and told us stories of her youth, and Lourdes, a childless widow in her 60s who is still turning tricks. We met Canela, a woman in her 80s who was soft spoken and looked incredibly tired. She had stopped working just a few years ago and now sells candies for a living. Finally, we spent some time with Paola, a 61-year-old who is still a sex worker and hopes to continue working for as many years as she can. We ended up spending Mother's Day with them at what was perhaps the most bittersweet party I've attended. The women were dancing and eating and drinking punch together, they joked around and seemed to be having a great time. But at some point, Paola started talking to me about her sons, whom she hasn't seen in years and never really visit her. She also talked about the kids of many of the other women in the house -- none of them present at this party -- to celebrate motherhood. Most of these women actually ended up becoming prostitutes to support their children as their only means of survival. I think the work that this house and its director Rosalba Rios do -- as weird and unusual as it may seem -- is incredibly valuable. Spending Mother's Day with these brave women forever changed they way l look at prostitution and without a doubt has been one of the most intense parties I've ever attended.","VBS.TV visits home for elderly prostitutes in sketchy Mexico City neighborhood .

"(CNN)  -- Tennis ace Roger Federer has given his unfailing support to his ""good friend"" Tiger Woods as the embattled golfer attempts to restore his reputation. Federer believes the ""worst has passed"" for Tiger after his very public apology to a world wide television audience. Woods fought back the tears as he admitted he had cheated on his wife Elin, but surprised observers by not setting any date for his return to golf ahead of major tournaments later this year, although he subsequently announced he would return for the U.S. masters in April. It's time to give Tiger some peace . But Federer told The Gulf News that whatever the future held, Woods would remain his friend. ""What's happened to him has been hard to watch over the last three months right down to when he made his apology. I am sure he's headed in a better direction now,"" he added. Federer, who has appeared in a well-known advertisement for Gillette with Woods and football star Thierry Henry, went on: . ""The worst has passed. I hope that he can also work things out with his wife Elin because they are very nice people - obviously for the sake of their kids as well."" But Federer admitted he had not spoken to Woods since the November car crash which set in chain a stream of revelations about the American's private life. ""I have supported him, but I haven't had any contact with him,"" added the Swiss maestro, who was forced to withdraw from the Dubai Open with a lung infection which is set to sideline him for several weeks. ""It's been hard to watch from far away but I would love to see him back on the golf course. It is what he does best,"" added the 16-time grand slam winner.","Roger Federer goes public to back his ""good friend"" Tiger Woods .

"Washington (CNN) -- The pilots of Northwest Flight 188 did not fall asleep when they overflew their destination by more than 100 miles in October, the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday in a detailed report on the wayward flight. The two pilots ""became distracted by a conversation"" about the airline's new work schedule system and by laptop computers they were using in violation of company policy and did not communicate with air traffic control for about 1 hour and 17 minutes while they cruised past their Minneapolis, Minnesota, destination at 37,000 feet, the NTSB said. The safety board also faulted the Federal Aviation Administration for air traffic control shortcomings. The NTSB report gives the most complete official account to date of the errant flight, which prompted the FAA to revoke both pilots' licenses, prompted the airline to suspend them from flying and prompted the FAA to adopt new procedures to notify the U.S. military in cases where the FAA loses contact with commercial aircraft. According to the account, the flight from San Diego, California, was routine until the plane was in the Denver, Colorado, region. There, air traffic controllers directed the crew of the Airbus A-320 to change their radio frequency. The co-pilot, or first officer, acknowledged the frequency change and read back the correct frequency. However, neither the captain nor the first officer contacted controllers on the new frequency until about 1 hour and 17 minutes later, when Winnipeg, Manitoba, controllers directed the crew to contact Minneapolis. The NTSB said that because of the proximity of the Winnipeg frequency to the last frequency acknowledged by the pilots (Winnipeg is 132.125 megahertz, while the last frequency used was 132.17) it is ""likely the first officer began to dial in the new frequency but never completed the frequency change by pushing an activation button. Nor did the first officer attempt to contact the next controller."" The NTSB said the frequency change likely occurred while the captain was taking a restroom break and while a flight attendant was serving dinner. ""These events may have distracted the first officer from completing the frequency change or attempting to contact the next ATC controller,"" the NTSB said. Further, the captain's absence would have prevented him from checking the co-pilot's actions. When the captain returned, the pilots became involved in a conversation over new scheduling procedures, and the first officer tutored the captain using their computers, the NTSB said. ""The pilots allowed this conversation to monopolize their attention,"" the board said. ""Both pilots state that they heard radio chatter but did not hear a radio call for NWA188."" The laptop computers they used likely blocked their view of numerous visual alerts, including text messages sent by airline dispatchers and at least nine messages regarding their position on the airplane's primary flight display, the NTSB said. Northwest Airlines policy prohibited the use of the laptops, the NTSB said. Both pilots told the NTSB the first indication of anything unusual was when a flight attendant called to ask about their arrival time. The captain ""looked at his navigation display and saw Duluth [Minnesota] to his left and Eau Claire [Wisconsin] to his right,"" the board said. The NTSB said it could not determine why the pilots did not respond to numerous radio calls, but said it could be because the volume was turned down, the pilots were distracted or the plane was outside the coverage for the 121.5 megahertz transmitters. The NTSB faulted the FAA for not catching the pilots' errors earlier, saying the plane entered two Denver sectors uneventfully, but radio contact was not established in the next two sectors, where controllers were preparing for a shift change. ""Neither sector controller's relief briefing included information that communication had not been established"" with the plane, the NTSB said. The NTSB said the FAA had no standard procedures to indicate that an aircraft had not made radio contact when electronic radar handoffs of planes occurred from one sector to the next. ""Because of this lack of standardization, NWA188 passed through two Denver ATC sectors without the controllers being aware that it had not made radio contact,"" the safety board said. Almost 30 minutes had elapsed before the next sector's controller attempted to regain contact with the plane and realized the plane was unresponsive to radio calls, the board said. Recognizing the problem, controllers first attempted to regain contact by calling Northwest dispatchers, then by calling an emergency frequency, but did not use words such as ""emergency"" or ""mayday"" that may have helped capture the pilots' attention, the NTSB said. The pilots did not respond. As a result of the investigation and of the crash of an executive jet in Montana in 2009, the safety board is recommending steps to prevent a repeat of the incidents. Six days after the event, the FAA revoked the licenses of Capt. Timothy Bryan Cheney and First Officer Richard Irwin Cole, saying their lack of awareness that they had overflown the Minneapolis airport was ""completely unacceptable"" and ""put your passengers and your crew in serious jeopardy."" But in a settlement signed with the pilots on Monday, the pilots acknowledged no wrongdoing, and the FAA agreed to allow the pilots to reapply for their licenses in August, two months shorter than would ordinarily be allowed. A spokesman for Delta Airlines, which merged with Northwest, said this week the airlines' internal investigation is continuing.","First officer didn't completely load radio frequency, NTSB says .
He and pilot then were distracted by discussion, personal computers, NTSB says .
NTSB also blames air traffic controllers for not realizing problem earlier ."
"BIRMINGHAM, Alabama (CNN)  -- Detroit, Michigan, is often thought of as the automaker capital of the country, but increasingly, foreign auto plants are heading south, to a region known for more than its charm. Toyota's plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, is as big as 156 football fields. Almost every foreign auto factory that's opened since the '90s has sprouted below the Mason-Dixon Line. Two of the three auto plants under construction also are in the South. Plants typically establish their roots in what is known as the auto corridor -- a roughly 200-mile-wide stretch that runs from Michigan to Alabama. ""The northern end is more heavily dominated by the traditional Detroit-base assemblers and their supplier base, and then the foreign automakers and their supplier base tend to pull a little further south,"" said Thomas Klier, a senior economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago who specializes in the auto industry.  Check out auto plants across the corridor » . So what's behind the South's charm? It has a lot to do with the people, experts say. ""If you don't have people, you don't have economic development,"" said Michael Randle, president and publisher of Southern Business & Development. ""People drive economic development and that's why the South has gone from being dirt poor 50 years ago to leading this country's economy."" The South's population is growing much faster than the Midwest, which is home to the Big Three: Chrysler, Ford and GM. Between 2000 and 2030, the South's population is expected to increase by about 43 percent, while less than 10 percent growth is expected in the Midwest, according the U.S. Census Bureau.  See how the United States is expected to grow » . But it's not just the quantity of the people that matters. The quality of the work force was a big factor in Toyota's recent decision to build a plant near Tupelo, Mississippi, according Dennis Cuneo, formerly Toyota's senior vice president and now an adviser to the company.  Watch how Toyota hopefuls are already preparing for jobs » . Northern Mississippi has been hit hard by the closing of furniture factories, leaving highly skilled workers looking for jobs. Those workers have the mentality the automobile makers want, Randle said. If it's broken, they are going to fix it, he said. The automotive industry provides a much-needed bridge, connecting a labor pool that wants to work with an economy in need of a boost, Randle said. And the plants bring in far more than their initial investment. The Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Alabama, for example, announced it would double its production just three years after it opened. Honda had a $450 million expansion in Lincoln, Alabama, that added another 2,000 jobs. For each job created inside an auto plant, experts estimate as many as six to eight are created in businesses outside.  Hear a worker describe how an auto plant changed his life » . Local leaders know how valuable the industry is -- worth enough to offer to foreign companies hundreds of millions of dollars in incentives -- including tax abatements, site preparation and employee training. While companies remain mum on the topic, those local leaders have a big edge on the North: They are fighting to bring jobs to workers who aren't unionized, unlike much of the Big Three's workforce. Unions increase overall costs at plants, Randle said, explaining that the foreign automakers are drawn to the South where unionization is not mandatory and where workers have resisted calls to join voluntarily. If a plant is unionized in the North, everyone must join. No foreign assembly plants are unionized except for a few joint-ventures: the ones that started as projects between domestic and foreign companies. ""That's not a coincidence,"" Klier said. ""That suggests pretty strongly that that does affect the location decision."" With all of these benefits playing in its favor, the South -- with its low operating costs -- has become the go-to place for this international industry, Randle said. ""A lot of economists were saying manufacturing was dead in this country and it's not coming back,"" Randle said. ""It may be dead Massachusetts or New York or Detroit ... but it's not dead in the South. ... You have to make cars in this country.""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Palestinians hurled rocks and burned tires in several neighborhoods in East Jerusalem Tuesday to protest the reopening of a landmark synagogue after more than 60 years. Officers dispersed the crowd by firing stun grenades in one area, and village elders helped end the riots in another, said police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld. At least seven people in the Mount of Olives neighborhood were wounded when police fired rubber bullets. In all, 91 people were wounded in the clashes, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said. About 3,000 officers were deployed in the city after the militant group Hamas declared Tuesday a ""Day of Rage."" The group was protesting the reopening of the Hurva synagogue on Monday. However, rumors swirled that right-wing groups were planning to ascend the Temple Mount, where al-Aqsa Mosque is located. Senior Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal, in a speech Monday in Syria, called on Palestinians to take to the street to protect Jerusalem and its Islamic and Christian shrines. The Palestinian Authority suggested Israel was ""preventing citizens from reaching the Old City ... to pray in al-Aqsa Mosque, as part of increasing provocative policies violating international law and human rights."" ""Pay no attention to malicious slander,"" said Rabbi Yona Metzger, chief rabbi of Israel, told the Jewish news agency JTA on Monday. ""All we are doing is resurrecting the Hurva that was destroyed 60 years ago. All the rumors that suggest we will later march on Temple Mount are just that -- rumors."" However, the incident is only the latest to ratchet up tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. The synagogue is located in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City. The Old City also includes East Jerusalem, seen as Palestinians as the capital of their future state. Israel claims sovereignty over all of Jerusalem since it took over East Jerusalem and the West Bank in 1967 in the Six-Day war. The rededication has underlined Palestinian concerns that Israel is attempting to bring more Jews into East Jerusalem and drive Palestinians out, particularly as it comes on the heels of an Israeli announcement last week that 1,600 more housing units would be built in the Ramat Shlomo neighborhood of East Jerusalem. The synagogue rededication, however, had been planned for months in advance, according to organizers. In a statement Tuesday, the Palestinian Center for Human Rights said it ""strongly condemns recent measures taken by Israel in East Jerusalem, the latest of which has been the inauguration of a synagogue in the old city. PCHR holds Israel responsible for the escalation of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory."" Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak, meeting in Madrid, Spain, with the Spanish minister of defense, said, ""Israel will not allow extremists to dictate and force political arrangements. ""I have said this times before and I repeat: Israel is strong ... and must reach political arrangements out of this position,"" Barak said. ""Lack of political negotiations will strengthen and encourage the extremists of both sides and the riots in Jerusalem today proves so. A political arrangement will only be achieved by direct negotiations."" Construction on the synagogue began in 1700, but halted, according to the Web site of Sacred Destinations, which describes itself as an educational and travel resource. It was restarted in 1836 and the synagogue was completed in 1856. The synagogue was destroyed by the Jordanian Arab Legion in 1948. Conservation and investigation of the ruins began in 1977. Meshaal also warned the international community that Israel is ""playing with fire"" that could lead to a regional blowup. Speaking to reporters Monday, U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said there were American concerns ""about the tensions regarding the rededication of a synagogue in the Jewish quarter of the Old City. And we are urging all parties to act responsibly and do whatever is necessary to remain calm."" At a memorial service Tuesday for late Israeli prime ministers and presidents, President Shimon Peres said: ""We cannot afford to unravel the delicate fabric of friendship with the United States. ""Today, we are also at a decisive moment and we must decide without the determination of external parties. That is, decide that even in a time of threats we will not give up on peace. The heritage of our leaders guides us and our children as such."" Last month, protests erupted after the Israeli government announced it would include two West Bank religious shrines as part of a larger list of 150 Zionist heritage sites. CNN's Kevin Flower and Michal Zippori contributed to this report.","Palestinians protest reopening of landmark synagogue in Jerusalem after 60 years .

"(CNN) -- Alaskan musher Lance Mackey has won the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race and set an Iditarod record for most consecutive wins, according to race officials. Mackey, 39, of Fairbanks has dominated the sport in recent years and is the 2007-2010 Iditarod champion. Mackey completed the 1,049-mile Iditarod race, which was broadcast live on IditarodInsider.com, in just under nine days. He was cheered across the finish line in Nome by family and friends, including his father, Dick Mackey, the 1978 Iditarod champion. The senior Mackey greeted his son at the finish line with a hug, saying, ""You've done something that will never be repeated, son."" Dick Mackey told race commentators his son ""is highly competitive and he likes to get the best out of his dogs. ... I don't think anybody trains them any better than he does."" Mackey could be heard on the broadcast microphones speaking to his dog team just before reaching the famous burled arch on Nome's Front Street, ""Nice, nice. This is so cool. We're almost there, guys. You did such a good job."" Arriving in Nome at 2:59 p.m. local time, Mackey's official time was 8 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes and 9 seconds. Mackey, a throat cancer survivor who says he began racing ""at birth,"" was inducted into the Alaska Sports Hall of Fame in February ""for capturing multiple titles in two of the world's longest sled dog races."" Mackey is also a four-time champion of the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest race from Fairbanks to Nome as well as the record holder for the most consecutive first place finishes in that race. Second place in the Iditarod went to Yukon musher Hans Gatt. Past champion musher Jeff King came in third. King, from Denali, Alaska, received praise and gratitude from the Iditarod Trail Committee earlier this season when he donated $50,000 toward the 2010 Iditarod prize purse after learning the race was experiencing financial trouble because a shortage of sponsors. More than 54 teams remained on the Iditarod trail headed toward Nome, including rookie Jamaican musher Newton Marshall, who was in 48th place. Marshall trained with Mackey this season in preparation for his first Iditarod run. Fourteen of the original 71 teams that entered this year's race have scratched en route. A ""Red Lantern"" will be presented to the last place finisher in the dog race, an Alaska tradition dating back to 1953, according to Alaska Magazine.","Alaskan musher Lance Mackey sets Iditarod record for most wins in a row .

"(CNN) -- A snow storm on the first day of spring could drop several inches this weekend from New Mexico to Missouri, while farther north, Minnesota and North Dakota brace for the rising waters of the Red River. The waters of the Red River are forecast to rise another foot this weekend, testing the more than a million sandbags stacked as a defensive barrier along Fargo, North Dakota, and Moorhead, Minnesota. Waters had reached 36.8 feet -- just two-tenths short of cresting level -- by Saturday night, the National Weather Service reported. The river had reached flood stage at 18 feet and major flood stage at 30 feet. The river is expected to crest Sunday, about 3 feet below last year's record flood level of 40.8 feet. Last year, there were 10 reports of property damage, Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker said Saturday. There have been no reports of property damage associated with the recent river rising, he said. More than 700,000 sandbags were guarding Fargo, and the National Guard was deployed to help in the city and surrounding Cass County on Friday. The flooding began last week when warmer weather and rain melted snow south of Fargo and Moorhead, causing the Red River to swell. Upstream, snow and ice have yet to melt, pushing water back toward the two cities. Near one area of the river bank in Moorhead, a mound of packed snow several inches high sat across from a flooded and impassable underpass. iReport: Are you there? Share photos, video . The waters are expected to start receding Monday afternoon, but Walaker said he plans to keep Fargo's sandbags in their places through next week as a precautionary measure. ""Right now, I feel that all the dikes, sandbags and earthen dikes should stay in place until we at least get it down to 30 feet and if its continuing to go down we can start the process,"" he said. ""But I would hate to see us move because of the quick change in the weather. I mean it doesn't take much to bounce us back ... just a weather front moving in with significant precipitation."" The Weather Service forecasted the waters to recede to 32 feet by next Saturday. Farther south, the Plains are dealing with another severe weather threat. Oklahoma Gov. Brad Henry called for a state of emergency on Friday in anticipation of the coming snow storm, according to the governor's office. Ten to 14 inches of snow could fall from northeast Oklahoma to northwest Arkansas, the Weather Service said. The Tulsa metro area could see 5 to 9 inches of snow. By Saturday night, snow accumulations had reached up to 7 inches in some areas and had slowed down operations at Will Rogers World Airport. Freezing fog and snow have caused delays of at least an hour and several flight cancellations, the airport announced in a news release. Continental Airlines canceled all departures and four arrivals, according to the statement. A ski resort in New Mexico's Santa Fe County received 21 inches, the largest snowfall total from the storm in the state, according to the weather service. Other parts of the county saw half an inch or less, while 15 inches dropped over Rociada, which lies on the east side of the Santa Fe National Forest. More than 6 inches of snow had already fallen in Lawrence, in northeast Kansas, the weather service reported. Seven inches of snow was tallied about 120 miles northeast in Conception Junction, Missouri. From southeast Kansas to western Missouri, 4 to 8 inches of snow are expected through Sunday, the Weather Service said. Meteorologists forecast 2 to 6 inches in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles through Saturday afternoon. Wind gusts up to 40 miles per hour could cause whiteout conditions on roads, the Weather Service said. Snow drifts higher than 2 feet could also occur.","Red River waters forecast to rise another foot this weekend in Minnesota, North Dakota .

"Washington (CNN)  -- An American lawyer has been holding secret negotiations with Iran for the release of an Iranian-American being detained for two years. Reza Taghavi, a retired businessman from Orange County, California, has been held in Iran's notorious Evin prison since his arrest in May 2008 without ever being charged, his lawyer said. Los Angeles-based attorney Pierre Prosper told CNN he has been talking to the Iranian government since September 2009 and traveled to Tehran in December to seek the release of Taghavi, a retired businessman accused of supporting an anti-regime group. Taghavi, 71, traveled frequently to Iran to visit family and friends without incident, according to Prosper. In April 2008, he went to Tehran with his wife. Before he left, he was asked by an acquaintance in Los Angeles to take $200 for a friend in Tehran ""who was down on his luck."" Los Angeles has a large Persian community. Taghavi did not know the individual to whom he was asked to deliver the money, Prosper said. He handed over the money and two weeks later was detained by Iranian authorities, after the recipient of the money was arrested on charges of association with an anti-regime group called Tondar. The group, which seeks to restore the monarchy in Iran, claimed responsibility for the April 12, 2008, bombing of the Hosseynieh Seyed al-Shohada mosque in the city of Shiraz. Prosper declined to name the man, who he said has since been tried and convicted. Taghavi has a rag-to-riches story, his 36-year old daughter, Leila Taghavi, told CNN. He brought his family to the United States in 1979, before the revolution, and stayed on in California to keep his family safe. Leila Taghavi said her father taught himself English, started a video game company in his garage and grew it into a successful corporation, which he handed over to his son when he retired 10 years ago. ""His life was the American dream,"" Leila said. ""He learned everything the hard way, sacrificed for his children and taught us to be grateful for the good things. He is wonderful, honest and generous, the kind of father every daughter would want."" Taghavi's family was silent for more than a year about his arrest, fearful his arrest would be politicized in Tehran and Washington by getting the American government involved. ""It was blind faith, really,"" Leila said, explaining the silence. ""Not knowing it would take this long, and fear of the system. There was never a doubt of his innocence."" In September 2009, with no movement on the case and losing hope he would be released, they hired Prosper to contact the State Department and initiate a dialogue with the Iranian government. Prosper said he contacted the State Department about seeking a consular visit by Swiss diplomats, which was denied because Iran does not recognize the dual citizenship of Iranian-Americans. The United States and Iran do not have formal relations, and Switzerland serves as the ""protecting power"" for the U.S. in Tehran. A U.S. State Department spokesman urged Iran to allow Swiss diplomats to be granted consular access to Taghavi. ""We are adamant that we believe he should be released on humanitarian grounds along with all the Americans who are unjustly held there,"" Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman, told CNN Wednesday. A senior government official who met with Prosper said the lack of information makes it difficult to help Taghavi. ""As far as we are concerned, there are no facts in the case,"" the official said. ""Our concern is that he should get due process."" Taghavi is one of several Americans in prison in Iran. American hikers Josh Fattal, Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd were detained on July 31, 2009. According to their families, they accidentally strayed across an unmarked border into Iran while on a hiking trip in Iraq's Kurdistan region. They are being held on espionage charges. Kian Tajbakhsh, an Iranian-American scholar who spent four months in jail in 2007, was arrested in July after the disputed presidential election and sentenced to 15 years in jail for spying. His sentence was later reduced by an appeals court to five years, and a State Department official tells CNN he has been released for two weeks from jail to celebrate the Persian New Year. The United States has no information about Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran almost three years ago. After being hired by Taghavi family last September, Prosper said he contacted the Iranian Permanent Mission to the United Nations and was granted a meeting with the ambassador, who eventually put him in touch with Iran's foreign ministry. After several months of weekly contact with Iranian officials in New York and Tehran, Prosper was invited to Iran in December for talks about Taghavi's case. Prosper said he was briefed on the Iranian view of the case but was told the authorities were still investigating the matter. ""It's still not clear what the accusations actually are,"" he said. Prosper left Tehran without being allowed to see Taghavi, but he was taken to visit victims of the 2008 mosque bombing by Tondar in an Iranian effort to show him the threat the regime says it's facing from ""terrorist groups"" being financed from sources abroad. ""I think they had me meet with victims and survivors of the bombing to let it be known that they, too, in their eyes had experienced terrorism,"" Prosper said. It is unclear why the Iranian government invited Prosper, who served as the ambassador-at-large for war crimes under the Bush administration and as a prosecutor for the Rwanda tribunal at the Hague, for talks in Iran. Beyond talking about the case and attacks at the hand of the Tondar group, Prosper said his Iranian hosts made no effort to broaden the discussions to include the nuclear standoff between Iran and the West or the Obama administration's offer of engagement. The facts of the case remain a mystery. Taghavi's family maintains he is innocent and has never been involved in political activism against the Iranian regime. Prosper acknowledged the case has been a challenge to investigate because of his inability to question people in Iran and the lack of information from the government or Taghavi's Iranian lawyers in Tehran, who don't speak English. But based on his discussions with the family and his own ""due diligence,"" Prosper said he believes Taghavi is an innocent man, whose only crime is guilt by association. As a former prosecutor, Prosper said he believes if the Iranians had a case against Taghavi, they would have already tried him. He's seeking a humanitarian release for Taghavi, who suffers from diabetes and whose health is deteriorating in prison, according to his family. The political upheaval in Iran after the disputed presidential election and subsequent violent crackdown on demonstrators has complicated his efforts, the lawyer said. ""It casts a shadow over our efforts,"" Prosper acknowledged. ""What I've been doing to my best ability is to cut through that, cut through the fog that has been created, focus on Mr. Taghavi and work with the Iranian authorities on the substance of what happened in 2008."" Leila Taghavi traveled to Iran last year and was allowed a brief visit with her father in prison. ""I saw him behind a window,"" she said, choking back tears. ""It was painful to see your father, an innocent man, behind a window."" ""We are chipping away at this,"" Prosper said. ""I want to give them credit for the dialogue, but the proof will be in the results. We are holding out hope because that is the only thing we can do. ... Effectively his life is at stake."" Leila spoke with her father by phone Wednesday morning and said he sounded tired and anxious. ""My biggest hope is that this message reaches people and somebody can do something,"" Leila added. ""Not just for my father, but for the many people that are trying to get their loved ones out of Iran.""","Businessman Reza Taghavi of California has been held in Iran since May 2008 arrest .

"(CNN) -- The city of Fargo, North Dakota, largely completed flood preparations early Thursday as a surging Red River rose nearly 3 feet in 24 hours. The waterway was well beyond its banks along the North Dakota-Minnesota line. ""Thanks to our volunteers, we've been able to fill a million sandbags and place 700,000 around our city,"" Fargo spokeswoman Karena Carlson said early Thursday. ""We're just buttoning up a lot of our clay levees and putting a few more sandbags in place, and we hope to be protected up to 40 feet."" Several hundred volunteers worked with the National Guard in Fargo to fill those sandbags as the river rose. Flooding where you are? Share pictures, video . Fargo set a record in 2009 when the Red River hit 40.8 feet. As of 9:15 a.m. Saturday, the river stood at 36.56 feet, more than 18 feet above the flood stage of 18 feet and past major flood stage. ""Fortunately, we started filling sandbags March 1st. We thought our crest was going to be the first or second week in April. It turns out our crest is going to be this week,"" Carlson said. ""So we did it in just over two weeks."" Floodwaters are forecast to peak at 38 feet Sunday afternoon. Last week, warm weather and rain melted snow south of Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, causing the Red River to swell. Upstream, snow and ice have yet to melt, causing water to accumulate near the two cities. Across the river in Moorhead, Tom Holmgren spent Wednesday filling sandbags as Minnesota State University gave students time off to help with the effort. ""Most of my friends have put in at least a couple hours,"" said Holmgren, who said sandbagging has become a source of college pride. ""I know there's a big push in just the college community that's like, 'Yeah, we're doing it. We're saving this town.'"" One man refuses to leave his home . About 90 miles south of Fargo in Browns Valley, Minnesota, Kathryn Bartz said Thursday that she's grateful that a 40-year water diversion project is nearly complete. ""Otherwise I believe we would have washed out a considerable amount of our town,"" said Bartz, a former town council member. Browns Valley suffered severe flooding from the winding Little Minnesota River in 2007, 1993 and 1943, and lesser floods many other years. Funding and property acquisition problems kept the diversion project -- consisting mainly of a canal to carry overflow around the town -- from being completed, Bartz said. A section of a new road that is part of the project washed out this week, but boulders and rocks were put in place to prevent further erosion, said Bartz, 66, who owns a hobby ranch outside of town. ""That will be repaired when the water goes down,"" she said. ""It's an inconvenience, but we are grateful that it has worked as well as it has."" Meanwhile, in the Northeast, utility crews made steady progress restoring electricity after a nor'easter -- a powerful low-pressure system -- blasted the region over the weekend. About 40,000 customers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut remained without power early Thursday, down from a peak of more than 500,000. ""We recognize the hardship our customers face from being without power for days,"" said Jeff Butler, president of Connecticut Light & Power. ""We appreciate everyone's patience as we continue to safely restore power as quickly as possible."" The outages were caused mostly by power lines downed by Saturday's hurricane-force winds, which knocked over trees and utility poles. At least seven deaths were attributed to the storm, authorities said. CNN's Ed Payne and Jim Kavanagh and CNN Radio's Shelby Erdman contributed to this report.","NEW: Diversion project saves Minnesota town, resident says .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- The parents of an injured baby girl who was flown to Florida for treatment after Haiti's earthquake have been told what they already know: They are the biological parents of the little girl. The International Red Cross notified Nadine Devilme and Junior Alexis in Haiti that DNA testing proves that the infant is theirs, said Mark LaPoint, an attorney representing the baby. Rescuers dubbed her Patricia, but her parents call her Jenny. On Wednesday morning, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Cindy Lederman decided that Jenny's parents will get to take her back to Haiti after doctors and nurses in Florida finish treating her. ""This is a case where these were really good parents, and I can't wait for these parents to be reunited with their baby,"" the judge said. ""This is one happy day."" Federal authorities have pledged to help Devilme and Alexis travel from Haiti to the United States to reunite with their daughter, though the timing of that trip has not yet been determined, said Bob Martinez, an attorney for the parents. The baby still has a hard time closing her left hand and needs some medical therapy, LaPoint said in court Wednesday. The judge scheduled a hearing for April 7 to get an update on the baby's condition. Jenny was 4 months old when the January 12 earthquake destroyed large swaths of Haiti. Her mother was knocked unconscious in the 7.0-magnitude temblor and taken to a hospital. When she awoke, she urged her husband to go home to search for their baby. Alexis searched through the broken rubble for four days, but found nothing. The couple says that on the fifth day, January 16, witnesses saw a cleanup crew rescue Jenny from the rubble. She reportedly was found in the arms of her baby sitter, who was dead. The witnesses got word to Devilme, who was in the hospital with her own injuries. Rescuers apparently assumed the baby was an orphan and whisked her away to a different hospital in Port-au-Prince, one run by the University of Miami and Project Medishare, where a team of pediatricians worked desperately to keep her alive. Read more about the couple awaiting the baby's return . With several broken ribs, the baby was having trouble breathing. The doctors stabilized her, and a few hours after the baby's rescue, a United Nations truck took her to a plane that was minutes away from leaving for Miami, Florida. ""I told the ambulance driver if she got there in time, we'd name the baby after her,"" says Dr. Arthur Fournier, a University of Miami physician working at the hospital. The driver, Patricia, did make it on time, and thereafter, doctors at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami referred to the infant by that name. Devilme says the friend who told her of Jenny's rescue didn't know where the baby had been taken. By the time she found out , the baby had already been flown to Miami, Devilme says. Devilme and Alexis say it was ""God's will"" that Jenny went to Miami, as she might not have survived if she'd stayed in Haiti.

"(CNN) -- Arsenal climbed to the top of the English Premier League with a 2-0 victory over London rivals West Ham despite playing half of Saturday's clash with only 10 men. Arsene Wenger's team moved a point above champions Manchester United, who host Liverpool on Sunday, while Chelsea dropped to third ahead of their trip to Blackburn. Carlo Ancelotti's side can join Arsenal on 67 points with victory in that game. Gianfranco Zola's West Ham team were left to rue a missed penalty as the defeat left them just three points above the relegation zone. Arsenal, who on Friday were handed a chance to avenge 2006's Champions League final defeat by Barcelona in the upcoming quarterfinals, took the lead after just five minutes in the rain at the Emirates Stadium. Brazil midfielder Denilson fired in a low shot for his sixth goal this season, having dispossessed Valon Behrami and then played a neat one-two on the edge of the area with striker Nicklas Bendtner. But Arsenal could not turn their dominance into further goals, and West Ham should have leveled just before halftime when Belgium defender Thomas Vermaelen was sent off as his nudge in the back of Guillermo Franco saw the Mexico striker tumble in the box. But Alessandro Diamanti saw his penalty saved by Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, and the hosts also escaped in the second half when substitute striker Carlton Cole saw his fierce low shot hit the outside of the post. Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas made the points safe on his return from injury five minutes after that with a penalty on 82, as England defender Matthew Upson paid the price for deliberately blocking the Spain midfielder's clever little flick with his arm. Tottenham consolidated fourth place with a hard-fought 2-1 victory at 10-man Stoke, as substitute Eidur Gudjohnsen came off the bench to put the London club ahead before Dean Whitehead was sent off and then helped set up Niko Kranjcar's 77th-minute winner. The on-loan Iceland forward netted just 18 seconds after halftime having come on for Roman Pavlyuchenko, who joined England striker Jermain Defoe on the injured list after suffering a hamstring problem in the first half. Whitehead went three minutes later for his second booking, but Stoke leveled on 64 as winger Matthew Etherington scored from the penalty spot against his former club after fullback Benoit Assou-Ekotto fouled striker Paul Kitson. Gudjohnsen's dummy allowed Croatia midfielder Kranjcar to put the Londoners four points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool, who will have played one more match after Sunday's trip to bitter North-West rivals United. The victory was doubly important for Tottenham after fellow Champions League hopefuls Aston Villa had to come from behind to snatch a 2-2 draw with lowly Wolverhampton in the Midlands derby earlier on Saturday. John Carew put Villa ahead in the 16th minute despite appearing to be offside, and the Norway striker salvaged a point for the hosts with eight minutes remaining as he steered Steve Sidwell's low shot into the visitors' net for his 13th league goal this season. Wolves moved four points clear of the bottom three, but were denied a first win at Villa Park in 30 years despite Jody Craddock's bundled 23rd-minute equalizer and an own-goal from England international James Milner seven minutes before halftime. The result left Villa in seventh, having played one less game than Tottenham, equal on 50 points with Manchester City, who travel to Fulham on Sunday. Everton moved above Birmingham into eighth place with a 2-0 win at home to Bolton, who had Gretar Steinsson sent off in the 71st minute for bringing down Nigeria striker Yakubu. Spanish midfielder Mikel Arteta fired in the resulting freekick and South Africa international Steven Pienaar wrapped up victory with a minute to go after Leon Osman hit the crossbar. Birmingham crashed 3-1 at Sunderland, who eased their relegation worries as England World Cup hopeful Darren Bent scored twice in the first 11 minutes to take his Premier League tally to 20 goals this season and 21 overall. Wigan moved seven points clear of the bottom three with a 1-0 win over Burnley, as Colombia striker Hugo Rodallega's 90th-minute header left the visitors deep in relegation trouble after a 15th defeat in 16 away matches. Hull remain second from bottom, behind Burnley on goal difference, as new manager Iain Dowie suffered a heartbreaking 3-2 defeat at basement club Portsmouth in his match in charge. The visitors led 2-1 with 17 minutes to play after two goals from striker Caleb Folan, but Portsmouth's on-loan midfielder Jamie O'Hara leveled in the 88th minute with a curled free-kick and the Nigerian veteran Kanu netted a late winner. Portsmouth are still set to be relegated after being docked nine points for going into administration, now 14 points from safety with eight games to play.","Arsenal climb to top of English Premier League with 2-0 victory over London rivals West Ham .

"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (CNN) -- A man who provided legal advice to 10 American Baptists accused of kidnapping 33 Haitian children after the earthquake there was arrested Thursday night in the Dominican Republic and accused of human trafficking, the country's anti-narcotics agency said Friday. The man, identified as Jorge Torres-Puello, is linked to a network that trafficked in Haitian and Central American children and is wanted in the United States, El Salvador and Costa Rica, the National Drug Control Agency said. Torres-Puello had been hiding in the Dominican Republic after he was accused of using the country to take Haitian children to North America, it said. Members of the drug agency took Torres-Puello, also known as Jorge Torres Orellana, into custody without incident at 8 p.m. in the parking lot of a McDonald's restaurant in the capital, the news release said. Torres-Puello is a Dominican who was born in New York, it said. ""According to documents of authorities in the United States, the Dominican Republic as well as El Salvador and Costa Rica, this person is an important part of a network of traffickers of undocumented people, especially women and children from Central America and the Caribbean,"" the news release said. Torres-Puello faces charges in the United States of conspiracy to take foreigners into the country illegally, it said. In El Salvador, he and his wife, Ana Josefa Ramirez Orellana, face charges of presumed sexual exploitation of minors and women, it said. Ramirez Orellana is jailed in El Salvador. The drug agency said Torres-Puello forced Nicaraguan and Dominican children to work as prostitutes in El Salvador. Torres-Puello is also wanted in Vermont on alien smuggling offenses and in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for probation violations for fraud, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said. He is also wanted in Canada. Shortly after the American missionaries were arrested in Haiti on kidnapping and abduction charges, Torres-Puello contacted their church in Idaho, identified himself as a legal authority on Haitian and Dominican law, obtained a retainer and began representing himself as their attorney/spokesman, the U.S. agency said. But Torres-Puello is not registered in the country's College of Lawyers, implying that he was practicing without a license, the Dominican drug agency said. In February, law enforcement authorities in El Salvador suspected that the missionaries' legal adviser looked like a man they were seeking, and asked Interpol to help. The international police agency coordinated the efforts of various agencies that resulted in Thursday's arrest, the ICE statement said. In a phone interview last month with CNN, Torres-Puello acknowledged he is the same man wanted by Salvadoran authorities but denied the charges against him. ""I never did anything,"" Torres-Puello said. ""I started helping a Dominican pastor helping a lot of people who were stranded to get back to their home countries. We once gave some Nicaraguan and Costa Rican women some money to return home and instead they went to the authorities and put in a complaint against us. I never had anybody against their will."" He also denied Salvadoran allegations that he and his wife ran a brothel out of their home. ""I know I am innocent and I want to clear my past,"" he said. Journalist Diulka Perez contributed to this story from Santo Domingo.","Jorge Torres-Puello gave legal advice to missionaries in quake case .

"Harrison, New York (CNN) -- Investigators from Toyota and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Wednesday inspected a wrecked Prius and extracted data from the car's event data recorder they hope will help determine what caused the car to speed out of control. The driver of the car told police the 2005 Prius accelerated on its own as she was driving down her employer's driveway on March 9. She lost control of the car, crossed the road and crashed into a stone wall, police say. She was treated for minor injuries. No other cars were involved in the accident. A team of six inspectors from Toyota and two from NHTSA spent several hours taking photos and measurements of the damaged vehicle and downloading the black box data from the car, which has been at the Harrison Police Department since the accident. Two independent inspectors from a forensic technology company, hired by the Police Department, also were aiding the investigation. A Toyota spokesman, Wade Hoyt, said that in this model year Prius, the black box contains data only from the moment the airbags deploy, but not the three seconds before impact that newer models are programmed to record. Hoyt said investigators were pleased they were able to extract any data from the vehicle. ""We are getting information on engine speed, pedal position, that sort of thing,"" Hoyt said. ""I'm happy we have it. It's possible it might not have been in there."" Police say the car's driver, whose name has not been released pending the investigation, has a clean driving record and there is no reason to believe she is to blame for the accident. But Acting Police Chief Anthony Marraccini said driver error is not being ruled out. ""I'm not sure we're going to have conclusive information as to what caused this accident. But we're not ruling out any possible causes."" Marraccini said. The 2005 Prius was part of Toyota's November recall to address the risk of accelerator pedal entrapment in the floor mat. Police say floor mats were not a factor in this particular accident, because they were secured to the seat with nylon ties. A recall to address a sticky accelerator problem did not include the Prius. Hoyt said he would not speculate about the accident's cause. The Prius is equipped with a brake override feature. ""When everything in the car is working correctly, the brakes will override the engine,"" Hoyt said. ""You have to draw your own conclusions."" Hoyt said Toyota will release the data from the black box recorder to the Harrison Police Department, but will not make it public because of privacy and legal concerns. Marraccini said police will make a determination after their investigation how much of the data to make public. ""If there's definitive information that shows the cause of this accident, absolutely we'll have to release it,"" Marraccini said.","Toyota and federal safety officials extracted data from a wrecked 2005 Prius .

"(CNN) -- At a hearing Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, federal officials said a bailout is needed immediately for the health of the U.S. economy. Sen. Christopher Dodd is chairing Tuesday's hearing on President Bush's proposed $700 billion bailout plan. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke are urging the passage of a $700 billion bailout proposed by President Bush following the failure of financial institutions and frozen credit markets. The proposal, if adopted, would amount to the most sweeping economic intervention by the government since the Great Depression. Before the hearing, Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who is the Banking Committee chairman, spoke Tuesday with ""American Morning's"" Kiran Chetry about whether the bailout is the right option and what may have contributed to the tumultuous economic environment. Kiran Chetry: You know talk about waking a sleeping giant -- we have almost 2,000 blog posts on CNNMoney.com about this bailout alone. Many people are outraged about it. They feel the government is spending $700 billion or more to reward bad behavior. What can you do to assure people that this is the right thing? Sen. Christopher Dodd: Well, I'm not sure it is at this point. That's why we're having this hearing this morning. We'll have Secretary Paulson and Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, before the banking committee to explain this plan, why it's necessary and where we go from here. They basically have asked for a blank check of $700 billion for the next several years here to buy a lot of bad instruments out there in these institutions.  See what power Paulson would have if the bailout is approved » . I have a lot of reservations. We're trying to put some safeguards in it. I'm angry as well. This didn't have to happen. It was not a natural disaster. It was a preventable, avoidable situation. We are where we are. Our economy is teetering. We've been warned we're very fragile. There could be a complete collapse. It needs to be straightened out or it could get worse. Pension funds, 401(k)s, jobs could be in worse shape. Chetry: You have a revised version yourself. We'll get into what you're talking about. Do you believe that in general a bailout needs to happen? Dodd: Something needs to be done here. I don't know if it's at this magnitude or if ... the specifics of this [bailout plan] make the most sense. But clearly something needs to be done. We can't lurch from one weekend to another with one failed institution after another watching our economy decline, stock market collapse and the price of oil rise. It's not just our own country; this has global implications. Chetry: Let's look at some of the things you want added or in some cases taken out. Under your [revised version of the bill], you feel there should be some foreclosure assistance -- if Wall Street is getting some help, Main Street should be getting help, too, especially for those struggling homeowners. You want limits on executive compensation. You don't want CEOs to get millions of dollars in packages for a failed company. You talk about an oversight board over the Treasury. Why are these so important to include, and what if they end up costing more? Dodd: Well, let me tell you why. First of all, we have almost 10,000 foreclosures occurring every day. For the last 18 months on a daily basis, I've had 65 hearings since July of 2007 begging the administration to do something about the foreclosure problem. They admitted today if you don't deal with 10,000 foreclosures a day -- that's the bulk of these bad debts that are out there -- so you need to do something about that to stop the hemorrhaging. That's No. 1. No. 2, I won't give a check for $700 billion, for 41 days, to this secretary or any secretary without safeguards built in -- accountability, transparency, oversight. That's just not going to happen.  Watch CNN's Lou Dobbs discuss whether the bailout would work » . Thirdly, taxpayers deserve to be first in line in all of this. I'm not going to write this at the end of the day [and] watch a handful of chief executives walk away with multimillion-dollar contracts. You'll have people storming this building if we don't understand that people are fed up with that kind of behavior. Chetry: You yourself said this is not a natural disaster, and a lot of people have been asking, ""Why didn't Congress see this coming?"" In fact, this is a quote from Henry Paulson, the treasury secretary, back in July. This was during the time of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailout. People thought that was the beginning and the end of this. He writes: ""Remember our economy has got very strong long-term fundamentals, solid fundamentals. Your policymakers are here; regulators were being very vigilant."" How can the argument be made that they were vigilant when we see the bottom fall out of the market? Dodd: Back in 2005, [then-Rep.] Mike Oxley, along with [Rep.] Barney Frank and [Sen.] Paul Sarbanes, tried to do just that. The administration opposed the bill, and it was defeated on a party-line vote here in the Senate. I know the history very, very well. When you had cops on the beat not doing their job, basically an eight-year coffee break by and large. Where you had legislation on the books and legislation not being enforced. Where you had regulators sitting back as loans were being made with no documentation, luring people into subprime mortgages, predatory lenders taking advantage of the situation that's how this all unfolded. It's not a mystery. Chetry: ... I want to ask you is there anything in this bill ... to make sure this doesn't happen again. All the things you listed -- the predator loans, everything that was taking place -- is there any room for regulation or more oversight in this bill? Dodd: Probably not in this bill. We're trying to act quickly. I'm prepared to act quickly, but I'm not going to act irresponsibly. If it takes longer, so be it. We'll have a new election in 41 days, and a new secretary in a matter of five or six weeks, and we can't begin to guess who that might be. Turning over a check of this magnitude not only to this secretary, but his successor, I think would be the height of irresponsibility.","Sen. Christopher Dodd: ""We're trying to put some safeguards"" in plan .

"(CNN) -- The games begin Thursday, and March Madness buzz will soon take over the lunchroom. Everywhere you turn, co-workers will chat about their favorite teams, the upsets, the injuries. Maybe you will watch the games. Maybe you won't. But maybe, irrespective of whether you plan to follow the tournament, you've ponied up to be part of the office pool. And you don't have to worry about explaining how you made your picks while filling out out your bracket. Everyone is hoping to choose that one team that comes from behind to win. So what if you always pick Gonzaga just because you like saying the name? Should it matter if you take Louisville out of the running just because that jerk who once strung you along came from there? You are in the running like everyone else, and, heck, you might surprise yourself and actually win. In these coming weeks, though, you don't want to sound like an idiot. It would be nice, you think to yourself, if you actually appeared to know what you were talking about. CNN reached out to Stewart Mandel, a senior writer at SI.com who covers basketball, as well as sports fans in the CNN.com newsroom to get some tips for how you can bluff your way through the tournament. With their sage advice, we offer this wisdom: . • Be careful not to talk about a ""buzzer beater"" unless it's actually happened. When they do happen, when a player scores at the buzzer (in the last second) to change the game's outcome, throw the term around wildly. It'll be what everyone is reliving, and if you feel especially bold, you can try to give someone a high-five while saying, ""How about that buzzer beater?"" • Discussing injuries in vague terms is always safe, since most every team has suffered some. Ideas: ""They really can't afford any more injuries this season."" Or, ""Didn't they have a big injury this year?"" You don't have to know the answer, but it's an easy way to engage with a sports nut who will gladly tell you more about some stranger's ankle than you ever wanted to know. • Tell people around the water cooler that you really admire a team's ""tenacity."" Mandel says that's ""a good fastball no one can argue with,"" because by virtue of making it to the tournament, a team's got to have some serious tenacity. Other terms you can throw around to describe a team: ""smart,"" ""experienced"" and ""well-coached."" • Something called ""guard play"" is apparently very big this time of year. You might shake your head and mutter, ""I don't know if their guard play is good enough."" Or, conversely, you can say, ""Oh, yeah, I think they have a good chance because they've got good guard play."" • There are some things you might say that could be risky, as they may prompt others to ask you a question in return. For example, if you were to say, ""Gosh, that was a big shot,"" someone might ask, ""Which one?"" This would be a good time to spill your coffee, diverting attention. • In basketball, the word ""press"" (short for pressure) is used when discussing defense. So you might want to express your heartfelt concern about a team ""having trouble with the press."" • There are different conferences that make up the NCAA. The Big East dominated this year. You can talk about how the ""Big East ruled,"" but make sure you don't misspeak and talk about the Big North, because no such thing exists. There is a Big 10, but it's made up of 11 teams. • ""Ball movement"" refers to how a team passes a ball. Any team that's made it to the ""tourney,"" as some insiders like to say, must be strong in this realm. So you can assume you're covered if you say something like, ""Wow, they have great ball movement."" • A strong three-point game can make the difference for an underdog team. So if some folks are saying how a team doesn't have a chance, you could nonchalantly stroll by and say in passing, ""They could pull an upset if they get hot shooting threes."" Another fun phrase to toss out: ""They live or die by the three."" • Casting blame on referees for making ""questionable calls"" is highly popular. ""Man, there were some questionable calls"" is a good gripe to share, but only if the game was close. If it was a ""blowout,"" a win by a large margin, your saying this would make you look foolish. It might be better to say, if people are chatting about an upcoming game, ""Man, I hope the refs just let them play."" • Word is that everyone loves a ""Cinderella,"" the team that comes out of nowhere to make a good run in the tournament. If you want to sound especially savvy, use it in conjunction with the world ""dance,"" another fun slang term for March Madness, as in, ""It's always nice to see Cinderella go deep in the dance."" • If you feel compelled to throw out a player's name, one you're pretending to be excited to watch, the one to know -- and one that's easy to remember -- is John Wall. Rhymes with ball, if that helps. He's a freshman guard at Kentucky and will likely go pro soon, so using his name next year during March Madness would blow your cover. Keep that in mind. • Last, and this is very important, do not -- repeat -- do not walk into work on April 1 and talk about how crestfallen you are that March Madness is over. The tournament goes by this name, but the actual championship is played in April. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Steve Almasy, Todd Leopold and Manav Tanneeru contributed their wisdom to this very important report.","NCAA basketball tournament begins Thursday, as does workplace obsession .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Comedian Betty White -- currently enjoying a career resurgence at age 88 -- said Wednesday that she credits her longevity in the entertainment industry to ""sheer blind luck."" ""I'm the luckiest old broad that ever drew a breath,"" White told CNN's ""Larry King Live."" After a cameo on a popular Super Bowl commercial in January and a series of comedic sketches on Craig Ferguson's ""Late, Late Show,"" White's fans campaigned successfully via Facebook for her to host NBC's ""Saturday Night Live."" White admitted to King that she was nervous about the May 8 show and said she finds herself questioning, ""What are they doing with me?"" She said she had been approached to host ""SNL"" three times ""many, many years ago,"" but declined because she associated the show with New York, and as a California girl, ""I'm so not New York."" White got her start in show business in 1949 on a local television show. She went on to star in two hit sitcoms, ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and ""Golden Girls."" ""I think the reason for the longevity is that ... several generations have gotten to know me over the years so I've become ... sort of part of the family,"" she said. Most recently, she appeared in the blockbuster ""The Proposal"" with Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. And to add to her current hot streak, White recently signed on to be a series regular on a new TV Land cable channel sitcom titled ""Hot in Cleveland"" opposite Jane Leeves, Wendie Malick and Valerie Bertinelli. ""I'm not hot again, but I'm surprised to still be working,"" White said. ""I just am amazed and I'm thrilled and I'm going along with it and enjoying it."" White has also continued her work for animal health and well-being, including a 46-year partnership with the Los Angeles Zoo, calling it one of her two loves in life -- alongside show business of course.

"(CNN) -- For Capt. Kamaljit Singh Kalsi, a doctor, and 2nd Lt. Tejdeep Singh Rattan, a dentist, this is a hill worth fighting for. Tejdeep Singh Rattan, left, and Kamaljit Singh Kalsi are set to report for duty in the U.S. Army in July. These two U.S. military recruits of the Sikh faith are challenging an Army order that they remove their turbans and cut their unshorn hair and beards when they report for active duty in July. In Sikhism, which originated in northwestern India, the turban and unshorn hair are articles of faith and can't be removed. But the U.S. military says there are times when the military cannot accommodate certain religious practices, ""such as when those religious observations would interfere with the wear of proper military headgear or protective clothing or equipment."" ""It doesn't make sense to me, especially in these hard times,"" Kalsi told CNN. ""The military is hurting for professionals. They need doctors, they need nurses."" Aided by the Sikh Coalition, a national civil rights group, and a law firm, the men have filed requests that their religious needs be accommodated. They have filed appeals with their immediate superiors and complaints with the inspectors general of the Army and the Pentagon. The Sikh Coalition said Kalsi and Rattan had been assured that when they were recruited to join the Army's Health Professions Scholarship that their unshorn hair and turbans ""would not be a problem."" ""Both men were both recruited and commissioned -- with their Sikh articles of faith -- during their respective first years of medical and dental school (2001 and 2006) through the Army's Health Professions Scholarship Program. ""Both are concluding their training and are slated to begin active duty in July 2009. However, the U.S. Army is now disputing their ability to serve with their Sikh identity intact,"" the Sikh Coalition said in an April 14 letter addressed to Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Amardeep Singh, the head of the Sikh Coalition, told CNN that the issue at hand involves observant Sikhs, not those Sikh-Americans who entered the military after removing their turbans and shaving their beards and hair. The issue is all-important for the roughly 500,000-strong American Sikh community, which faced hostility after the September 11, 2001, attacks, when people associated them with al Qaeda terrorists because their turbans and beards resembled the militants' appearance. ""The perception is still there,"" said Singh. ""We're sort of still feeling it."" He said surveys -- including one done recently in Queens, New York, where children reported being on the receiving end of verbal and physical abuse -- chronicle the problems Sikhs face. ""These kids are being harassed in New York. It's Queens, the most diverse county in the United States. If this is happening in Queens, it's happening in other parts of the country."" So, he said, the opportunity to serve in the U.S. Army sends the opposite message -- ""that we are part and parcel of the fabric of this country."" Kalsi, Singh and the Sikh community stress the Sikhs' military heritage. Kalsi, for example, is the fourth generation in his family to serve in the military, and his ancestors served in India's military. The Sikh served in allied forces in the two world wars and they serve in the militaries of Great Britain, Canada, Sweden, Pakistan, as well as India. The coalition notes in its letter to Gates that a Sikh doctor and dentist were serving in the Army, ""grandfathered in under the old policy"" that ended in the 1980s when observant Sikhs were barred from admission to the armed forces. Lt. Col. Christopher C. Garver, an Army spokesman, told CNN in an e-mail that ""the Army places high value on the rights of Soldiers to freely observe the tenets of their respective religions."" ""Accommodation of a Soldier's religious practices must be examined against military necessity and cannot be guaranteed at all times,"" he wrote. ""There are times when the Army cannot accommodate for religious reasons, such as when those religious observations would interfere with the wear of proper military headgear or protective clothing or equipment. ""The Army regulations which establish the standards of wear and appearance of the uniform and accommodating religious practices are in accordance with the Department of Defense Instruction on this subject,"" he said. But the Sikhs want the Army to rethink and reconsider their situation. ""If they can come up with another policy that would allow Sikhs to serve, I guarantee you, they will have many, many people join from the Sikh community,"" Kalsi said.","Two recruits of Sikh faith set to report for duty in U.S. Army in July .

"Washington (CNN) -- A killer who sent a prosecutor a taunting letter about  killing a 16-year-old girl died in Virginia's electric chair Thursday night, the Richmond Times Dispatch reported. Paul Warner Powell was pronounced dead at 9:09 p.m. ET, the newspaper reported. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell had denied clemency and the U.S. Supreme Court in January refused to block the execution. Powell was convicted in the 1999 murder of Stacie Reed and the rape of her 14-year-old sister in their Manassas, Virginia, family home. Powell claimed double jeopardy after state prosecutors put him on trial for a second time in the killing. The high court in July delayed Powell's execution while considering the broader constitutional claims, which were finally rejected. The killer rejected lethal injection, the state's usual method of execution. ""I'm hopeful this is the last legal chapter in the long history of this case,"" said Powell's prosecutor, Prince William County Commonwealth's Attorney Paul Ebert. ""The survivors -- Stacie's mother and [her sister] -- have really been traumatized by delay after delay. Hopefully they're going to get some peace and closure after all these years."" CNN does not identify sexual assault victims without their permission, even though the surviving victim, now 25, has talked publicly about the case. The crime shocked the Washington area. Stacie Reed knew Powell, then 20 and an admitted racist. The state's highest court eventually threw out the 2000 verdict in the first trial, saying prosecutors had not proven other necessary death-eligible offenses were committed against the 16-year-old. Such ""aggravating"" factors could include, rape, attempted rape or robbery in commission of the murder. The sexual assault and attempted murder of Stacie's younger sister was upheld, and Powell was given a long prison sentence. Powell, believing he was free from execution, proceeded to write a taunting, profanity-filled letter from behind bars to Ebert, laying out explicit details of the crime unknown to investigators at the time. ""Since I have already been indicted on first degree murder and the Va. Supreme Court said that I can't be charged with capital murder again, I figured I would tell you the rest of what happened on Jan. 29, 1999, to show you how stupid all of y'all ... are,"" wrote Powell, who is white. He said he had gone to the Reed house to confront Stacie for dating a black boyfriend. He admitted pinning the victim, threatening to rape her, then stabbing her in the heart when the girl resisted. He then stomped on her throat. ""I guess I forgot to mention these events when I was being questioned. Ha Ha!"" he wrote in 2001. ""Do you just hate yourself for being so stupid ... and saving me?"" The killer also said that after that crime, he waited in the house until the younger girl returned from school, then attacked her, leaving her for dead. In the meantime, he drank iced tea from the family refrigerator and smoked a cigarette, part of the forensic evidence that investigators used to place Powell at the scene of the crime. With this firsthand account from Powell, he was indicted again and charged with murder and attempted rape of Stacie -- a capital-eligible crime. He again was convicted, and federal and state courts subsequently upheld the conviction on appeal. The Supreme Court appeal is Powell v. Kelly (09-21).","Paul Warner Powell was convicted of murdering Stacie Reed and raping her sister .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A trendy California sushi restaurant charged by federal authorities with serving whale meat offered an apology Monday, saying it ""ignored its responsibilities"" to endangered species. Prosecutors charged Typhoon Restaurant Inc., the parent company of Santa Monica's The Hump, and chef Kiyoshiro Yamamoto, 45, with the illegal sale of a marine mammal product for an unauthorized purpose. Although it is considered a delicacy in Japan and some other countries, meat from whales -- an endangered species -- cannot be sold legally in the United States. ""We write to address the misdemeanor charge recently filed by the U.S. attorney,"" the restaurant said in a statement posted on its Web site. ""The charge against the restaurant is true: The Hump served whale meat to customers looking to eat what in Japan is widely served as a delicacy,"" the statement continued. ""In serving this meat, The Hump ignored its responsibilities to help save endangered whales from extinction and failed to support the world community in its uphill fight to protect all endangered species."" The restaurant pledged to set up procedures to ensure that it complies with laws and ""becomes a good corporate citizen."" ""We sincerely apologize. We pledge to work hard to re-earn the trust of the public and respect of our customers."" The misdemeanor charge carries a federal prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of up to $200,000 for the company, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office. The law firm for the restaurant and its parent company deferred questions to The Hump's Web site. However, Typhoon attorney Gary Lincenberg has said the restaurant accepts responsibility for serving whale and will agree to pay a fine, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. The investigation into the restaurant began in October, when two members of the team that made the documentary ""The Cove"" visited The Hump, officials said. ""The Cove,"" which exposes the annual killing of dolphins at a Japanese fishing village, won the Academy Award for best documentary this month. The restaurant, located at the Santa Monica Airport, is known for its exotic fare. Its Web site asks diners to surrender themselves to its chefs for ""a culinary adventure ... unlike any that you have previously experienced."" Crowd marches outside restaurant . Armed with a hidden camera, the two women captured the waitress serving them whale and horse meat and identifying them as such, a federal criminal complaint said. A receipt from the restaurant at the end of the meal identified their selection as ""whale"" and ""horse"" with the cost -- $85 -- written next to them. The women snuck pieces of the meat into a napkin and later sent them for examination to a researcher at Oregon State University. He identified the whale sample to be that of sei whale, prosecutors said. The sei is found throughout the world's oceans. Whalers began to hunt them after the populations of right, humpback, blue and fin whales declined due to overfishing. It is now considered an endangered species. In February and March, the activists returned and again asked for -- and were served -- whale meat, the criminal complaint said. A DNA test of the meat smuggled out after the February visit confirmed it to be meat from the sei whale, Mrozek said. During a final visit in March, officials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration observed the activists asking for ""kujira,"" or whale meat. One of the officers then saw the sushi chef leave the restaurant and return with a wrapped package that he seemed to have retrieved from a parked Mercedes, the complaint said. The chef told a customer it was whale meat, the document said. Next, officials raided the restaurant, and chef Yamamoto admitted that he had served whale meat, the complaint said. ""Someone should not be able to walk into a restaurant and order a plate of an endangered species,"" U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. said. Conservation agencies are engaged in an ongoing feud with Japan over whaling. In the early 1980s, the International Whaling Commission determined that there should be a moratorium on commercial whale hunting. However, whaling is allowed under international law when done for scientific reasons, which Japan cites as the legal basis for its hunts. The country's annual hunt kills up to 1,000 whales. Many in the international community believe that such hunts amount to needless slaughter.","The Hump sushi restaurant apologizes in statement posted on Web site .

"(CNN) -- A tour bus carrying about 40 people rolled over Tuesday near Campbellton, Texas, killing two people and injuring more than a dozen, an official said. Tommy Cavazos, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said that 18 people were injured in the Americanos tour bus crash on Interstate 37, about 50 miles south of San Antonio in southern Texas. Most of the injured are being transported to San Antonio's Brooke Army Medical Center and University Hospital, Cavazos said. The bus, which was headed to Matamoros, Mexico, flipped and landed on its right side, he said. A spokesman for Brooke Army Medical Center, Dewey Mitchell, said four patients were taken to the hospital's trauma unit. He did not provide further information. University Health System spokeswoman Julie Wiley said five adults -- four men and one woman -- were transported to the medical facility. She could not describe their conditions but characterized the people as all between the age of 40 and 60. Although it was not immediately clear whether others were taken elsewhere, Wiley said that University Health System and Brooke Army Medical Center are the two trauma centers in San Antonio and would receive patients in situations such as Tuesday's crash. The names of those killed were not released. Americanos is a subsidiary of Greyhound. Maureen Richmond, a spokeswoman for Greyhound, said that 40 people were on board the bus, which left San Antonio shortly before 9 a.m. for Matamoros, Mexico. It was a regularly scheduled trip, she said. She said the cause of the crash was not immediately known. KSAT: 2 dead, dozens injured in charter bus crash .

"(CNN) -- Local and federal authorities in Enfield, Connecticut, are investigating how a band of burglars broke into a large pharmaceutical warehouse and made off with approximately $75 million in prescription medications. Police say the well-orchestrated heist at the Eli Lilly and Co. distribution center occurred during a rainstorm shortly after midnight Sunday. ""Based on the sophistication of what was used, this had to be well-executed and planned,"" Enfield Police Chief Carl Sferrazza said. According to Sferrazza, the thieves scaled the side of the building onto the roof, where they cut an opening. He said they then rappelled into the building, disabled the alarm and proceeded to steal several dozen pallets of prescription pills, loading them onto one or more getaway vehicles. Police say the robbery was not discovered until almost 2 p.m. ET Sunday. When asked whether the crime could have been an inside job, Sferrazza replied, ""Anything is possible; we are not ruling anything out at this point."" A spokesman for Eli Lilly, Ed Sagebiel, said the company is working closely with both the Enfield Police and the FBI. Though Sagebiel would not confirm what types of medications were stolen, he said there were no narcotics at the site. Although the intended destination of the drugs is unknown, the spokesman speculated that the suspects will attempt to sell them on the domestic or international black markets. ""We certainly know that there is a market for these products,"" Sagebiel said. ""We have a closed system here in the U.S. that makes it more difficult to distribute them in the United States for legitimate means."" Based in Indianapolis, Indiana, Eli Lilly is the ninth-largest pharmaceutical company in the world.","Thieves broke into Connecticut facility early Sunday, police say .

"(CNN) -- Little Rhode Island made big news in the education arena last month. Superintendent Frances Gallo fired all the teachers at Central Falls High School after negotiations with the teachers' union failed. The move was triggered by low test scores -- only 7 percent of 11th-graders passed the state math tests, and 50 percent of the students at Central Falls failed to graduate in four years. Appalling numbers. Gallo wanted teachers to increase the length of the school day and spend time tutoring kids. The teachers' union was not convinced. Even President Obama got involved and supported the firing, saying, ""If a school continues to fail its students year after year after year, if it doesn't show signs of improvement, then there's got to be a sense of accountability."" Yes, accountability is right, but who is supposed to be accountable for this massive failure to learn? The general consensus is that the teachers are responsible. Is it really all the teachers' fault? Columnist Ruben Navarrette Jr. thinks so. Having been a teacher himself for five years, he says teachers just like to complain. He doesn't say why he is no longer teaching, but he applauds the firing and blames the teachers. Superintendent Gallo agrees. She fired all of them. Everyone agrees that the K-12 schools are failing, but the reasons are not as simple as Navarrette and Gallo think. Firing all the teachers is not the answer. Closing schools is not the answer. Schools aren't failing because the teachers don't care or aren't trying. It's not because teachers fail to follow the curriculum. It isn't because they are poorly paid. Teachers go into teaching because they want to make a difference and help kids. They certainly don't go into teaching to get rich. They don't want to do a bad job, either; no one likes to fail. A recent survey of 40,000 teachers by the Gates Foundation shows that teachers are more interested in reform than money. If you examine Central Falls High School closely, a few things stand out: More than 96 percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced lunch, according to the school's Web site, and only 6 percent of the people in the town have a college degree. Does that tell you something important about the parents? They are struggling financially and lack postsecondary education. Central Falls provides little or no parental support for students or for the teachers, yet everyone expects teachers to do it all with few resources. Clearly, it does not work. In his book entitled ""Does Money Matter? the Effect of School Resources on Student Achievement,"" Gary Burtless argues that the ""home environment has strong effects on student achievement, stronger in fact than social class effects."" He argues that the most important home environment variables involve ""parents expending time participating in activities with children that enhance learning."" Very little, if any, of this is happening in the communities of a failing school. Look at where the schools are failing -- in the most densely populated areas of the 50 largest American cities. Teachers are not magicians. Low test scores and the dropout rate cannot be blamed on the teachers alone. They need help from the parents, help from the community, help from the administrators, help from state and federal governments. Thousands of kids starting kindergarten each year don't know colors, counting, or even the names of fruits and vegetables. Their vocabularies are hundreds of words fewer than their more advantaged peers. Who is talking to these kids? The electronic nanny -- the television. No teacher can effectively educate a child without support from the parents. Support at the elementary level means spending time with their child, reading to their child, talking with their child, providing a stable home for their child. Support in high school means a quiet place to study, recognition and approval for kids' efforts, and helping when they are not doing well. Strong schools have supportive parents and an involved community. Schools like Central Falls High School have struggling communities. To fire all the teachers and blame them for the failure is to dismiss the important role that parents and communities play in the education of their children. Imagine firing all the parents -- does that solve the problem? What we have in communities with failing schools is parents who are for a variety of reasons -- mostly economic -- failing to parent effectively. They have no time. The job of mothering is passé. Let's look at how ineffective school closures have been in Washington, where Chancellor Michelle Rhee has closed many schools. Test scores are up, but scores dropped on the federal government's broader measure of how local schools are doing in meeting the standards of the No Child Left Behind law. Or take a look at the Chicago Public Schools, where former CEO Arne Duncan, now U.S. secretary of education, closed many schools. There's been little change in scores because students are being transferred to other low-performing schools. It hasn't worked because the community's attitude and level of support hasn't changed. A report released on March 1 by The Education Trust shows that schools often lumped together as ""low-performing"" are not all alike. ""Examining data from reading and mathematics assessments for elementary and middle schools in ten states, the study's authors found that some low-performing schools remain stuck year after year, and others that started low performing are among the fastest improvers in their states."" Solving the problem requires individual solutions tailored to each school, not a blanket approach. The U.S. Department of Education needs to change its focus and stop its policy of supporting the closing of failing schools; it does not bring long-lasting change. No Child Left Behind has had unintended negative consequences. Instead, we as a nation need to support teachers in the classroom and stop using teachers as scapegoats in seeking to solve a major national problem. We need to work with teachers, not fire them.

"(CNN) -- When Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced he would be pushing for a public option in the final health care bill, it looked as if he had given up on the possibility of a bipartisan agreement. Most Republicans have been steadfast in their opposition to the Democratic health care proposals. The only serious possibility for GOP backing has come from Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine. While expressing support for much of the Senate Finance Committee bill, she has said she would accept a public option only if private markets and new regulations fail to control costs and lower premiums. Reid's decision is not a sign of commitment to an ideal but rather an act of political realism. The notion that either party will be able to find substantive bipartisan support for legislation today is dubious. The political forces that generate partisan conflict in Washington are deeply rooted and hard to change. Partisanship is not always a bad thing for politics. Strong parties can give voters real choices at the ballot box, and party leaders are willing to push for bold objectives that centrists often avoid. But bipartisanship is also a valuable objective, and good to have as part of our political mix. When both parties are open to sometimes entering into negotiations and reaching agreements, this improves the chances for major policy breakthroughs that will last over time. When Americans see that their leaders are willing, under the right circumstances, to focus on doing what the country needs even if the other side might receive more credit, citizens are exposed to a side of government that is usually overshadowed by the political machinations that dominate the news. But the pressures against bipartisanship are enormous. Gerrymandered congressional districts favor representatives who play to the party base. The number of centrists in both parties has steadily diminished. The campaign finance system empowers party leaders and conservative activists who are able to raise and distribute substantial amounts of campaign funds to pay for television ads and get-out-the-vote operations. Within the GOP, their power was recently on display in New York's 23rd district. Conservatives pressured centrist Republican Dede Scozzafava to step down from the special election to clear the way for Conservative Party candidate Doug Hoffman, who has received the strong support of national conservative groups. ""Doug's campaign,"" Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele announced, ""will receive the financial backing of the RNC and get-out-the-vote efforts to defeat Bill Owens on Tuesday."" In the Senate, the constant threat of the filibuster offers the minority party an easy way to thwart the agenda. The media favors stories about conflict over consensus. People tend to be a nostalgic for moments when the two major parties worked together. In fact, this has rarely been the case. But when there were periods with some bipartisanship in the 20th century, what is striking is how much more substantial they were. They involved significant numbers of legislators from one party joining forces with the other. One of the most famous examples of bipartisan leadership involved Republican Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, who in 1947 and 1948 chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Vandenberg worked with President Harry Truman to pass some of the key policies of the Cold War, including the National Security Act, the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. Many Republicans disagreed with Vandenberg, focusing much more on attacking Truman. But Vandenberg still delivered Republican votes for that short period. During the Senate vote on the Marshall Plan in 1948, which provided economic assistance to help rebuild Western Europe, 31 Republicans joined 38 Democrats to vote for the bill. The same held true with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. We often remember the important work of Republican Sen. Everett Dirksen, an Illinois conservative who joined forces with Johnson in the summer of 1964 to vote for cloture to end the filibuster by Southern Democrats. Dirksen was one of 27 Republicans who voted to end the filibuster and then to vote for civil rights. Today, discussions of bipartisanship focus on obtaining one or two votes from the opposition party. This is a phenomenon we have seen intensifying since the 1970s. Republicans also had trouble obtaining Democratic votes under President George W. Bush. Until politicians are able to deal with some of the underlying forces that make bipartisanship difficult to achieve, party leaders should not give so much weight to legislative strategies that hinge on appealing to the other side. Seriously searching for bipartisanship, for example, would require reforming the campaign finance system so that legislators are not in such desperate need of private campaign contributions, over which party leaders and activist organizations maintain tight control. Citizens should also support media outlets that place solid journalism above partisan analysis. Right now, bipartisan votes are not coming. In the past few weeks, Democrats seem to have come to this conclusion and are now focusing more on what will unite their own party than what will win Sen. Snowe's vote. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer says Harry Reid appeared to be giving up on bipartisanship .
He says Democrats are more focused on unity than on attracting GOP votes .
Bipartisanship once involved many legislators crossing party lines .
Today, Zelizer says, many forces make bipartisanship hard to achieve ."
