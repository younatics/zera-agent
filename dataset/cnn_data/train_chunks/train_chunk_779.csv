"By . Matt Chorley . and Sean Poulter . Shifting blame: Ofgem rejected the claims by Npower chief executive Paul Massara, pictured . Parents would be able to cut their energy bills if their children learned to turn off their lights, TVs and iPods, the head of Npower claimed today. Chief executive Paul Massara claimed even his own teenage daughters wasted electricity, and people must stop fewer power something than can be easily wasted. He also tried to shift the blame for higher charges from the industry to the Government, claiming eco-schemes are the biggest driver of costs. Green taxes will more than double by 2020, pushing up bills to £1,500-a-year, the German-owned firm claimed today. But Mr Massara courted controversy when he suggested gas and electricity bills are high only because households waste so much power. 'The reality is that we have some of the cheapest prices in Europe but our bills are some of the highest because our houses are old and not insulated.' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'It’s interesting. I have two teenage daughters. They have been brought up in a generation that has looked at energy efficiency, that has looked at climate change. 'They would never dream of walking out of a bathroom leaving the taps running. And yet my teenage daughters will walk out of a room and leave the lights on and their iPod playing and the TV on quite happily. 'So I do think we need to change our approach and the way we think about energy waste.' Saying he wanted to dispel myths and restore trust, he insisted suppliers were responsible for only 20 per cent of a bill. He added: ‘The actual unit price of energy in the UK is one of the lowest in Europe – but bills are high because British houses waste so much energy. ‘If we can increase the efficiency of the UK’s old and draughty housing, we can ensure that annual energy bills are some of the lowest too.’ The chief executive’s claims were immediately rejected by industry regulator Ofgem. A spokesman said: ‘Their data on network costs is incorrect and misleading.’ Npower boss Paul Massara . Mr Massara made his comments ahead of a report his German-owned firm publishes today on the energy market. It said the cost of green taxes and eco schemes will rise by 272 per cent between 2007 and 2020, driving up energy bills. Npower says the average figure paid by householders through levies on bills under the heading of ‘Government energy policy and regulation costs’ will rise from £75 in 2007 to at least £279 by 2020. By contrast, it says the average cost of supplying a home with energy – gas and electricity – over the same period will actually fall from £514 a year to £408. The company’s figures suggest the cost of shifting energy supply away from fossil fuels toward wind, solar and wave power, coupled with schemes to insulate homes are the main reason for rising bills. The cost of building nuclear power stations, which will also be subsidised through bills, will push up the prices paid. The figures are included in an Npower report called ‘Energy Explained: Inside the Cost of Energy’, which is designed to help customers understand why their bills are going up. Burning money: A report by Npower has warned prices will rise still further due to the cost of building nuclear power stations. It claims government policies will push the average household bill to £1,330 in 2020 . The company’s calculations suggest Government policies, coupled with the fact we live in cold and draughty homes, are largely responsible for a predicted rise in energy bills from £954 a year in 2007 to £1,330 in 2020. Mr Massara said: ‘At times during the debate on energy, facts have been in short supply, but we urgently need to dispel some myths to restore trust in the energy industry. 'Suppliers control less than 20 per cent of a bill and I want to shine a light on all the different aspects of energy – particularly to reassure my customers that there is no hidden profit. ‘We made a 3.2 per cent margin in our retail business in the first nine months of 2013. ‘Over the same period our power stations were struggling to recoup the hundreds of millions of pounds in investment required to build them, and made a loss of £59million.’ 'Misleading': A spokesman for Ofgem said Npower declined to work with them to make the data accurate . But the Ofgem spokesman disputed the research: ‘We offered to help Npower improve the accuracy of their numbers for network charges and it is disappointing that they did not engage fully with us until after the document had been circulated. ‘Ofgem directly regulates the money that network companies can earn through charges. ‘Given this level of certainty we can see that after 2014 network costs per household are expected to remain broadly flat in real terms. It is unclear how Npower can state with any authority otherwise.’ The . simplest, and often best, way to slash your energy costs is to use an online . service that can compare all the best tariffs on offer for you.

"By . Becky Evans . Facebook is considering launching legal action against a small Dubai hairdressers - that is named Facelook. Not only does the name resemble the social network giant's but its logo is also strikingly similar. The men's salon has simple white lettering on a blue background, just like the iconic branding of Facebook. Facebook said it is investigating whether Dubai hairdressers Facelook (pictured) has infringed its copyright . The owner of the hairdressers said any similarity between his logo and Facebook's was a coincidence . Now the company, which is based in California, said it is investigating whether the hairdressers has breached its intellectual property rights. However the owner of Facelook, based in Discovery Gardens, said any similarity was a coincidence. The owner, who did not want to be named, told The National that he had registered the name and brand under UAE labour law. He said: 'We started with the name Facelook, but when later on the branding came through, coincidentally it looked like Facebook. 'For a normal guy, with a naked eye, it looks familiar. However, the colour and the font is different to Facebook.' A Facebook spokesman for the Mena region told The National: 'We are careful to protect the Facebook brand and we will look more closely at this particular case.' Last year Primark threatened to sue a shop in Dubai that opened under the same name. Billion dollar company Facebook, founded by Mark Zuckerberg (centre), is based in plush offices in California. A company spokesman said they are 'careful to protect the Facebook brand' British shoppers who visited the store in the Bur Dubai district said the clothes had little resemblance to those sold in the famous bargain chain. A spokesman for the brand said at the time: 'This is not a legitimate store and the company is considering its legal options'. Businesses with similar names to international brands are warned to check they are not breaching copyright after a long line of small companies being threatened with legal action. During London 2012, many businesses in the UK fell foul of trademark rules protecting Olympic logos. The owners of Le Rose florists in Hanley, Stoke, were warned they risked being sued by Games organisers if they did not remove five rings and a torch made from tissue paper from the shop. Google threatened to sue 23-year-old school dropout Andries Maree Van Der Merwe after he set up a jobseekers website and named it Doogle.","The owner of the hairdressers said any similarity is a coincidence .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Spiritualist: Luke Monrose, 27, was found drowned after his bid to secure enlightenment went tragically wrong . An extreme yoga fanatic drowned in a quarry after an experiment to achieve enlightenment through a 'near-death experience' went tragically wrong, an inquest has heard. Spiritualist Luke Monrose believed that by pushing his body to its limits and catching hypothermia he could 'unlock the secrets of the afterlife'. The 27-year-old hoped to see the future, acquire psychic powers and enjoy an out-of-body experience - known as astral projection - by nearly dying. But his risky experiment went tragically wrong and a coroner today ruled Mr Monrose 'died as a consequence of a near-death experience which resulted in physical death'. The inquest heard the popular and sporty youngster became obsessed with near-death experiences, meditation and spirituality. Before plunging into a flooded clay pit in St Austell, Cornwall - wearing a life jacket and goggles - Mr Monrose submerged himself in the bath to practise. His body was discovered in the pit two days later. Cornwall's Coroners' Court heard Mr Monrose was obsessed with aliens and theories about the afterlife, as well as being an avid follower of conspiracy theorist David Icke. He told his mother he was meeting friends for a drink but revealed his true plan to younger brother Daniel, 26. His sibling agreed to give their mother a note explaining his actions if he failed to return by midday on May 18. Luke failed to come back and, after his family raised the alarm, police divers found his body at the remote Lantern Pit. Near-death experiment: Police divers discovered Mr Monrose's body in the disused clay bit at St Austell in Cornwall. He was wearing a life jacket and goggles . Distraught mother Susan Monrose, 59, told the hearing on Tuesday she was convinced her son never meant to harm himself. - Susan Monrose . She said: 'He knew he was going to do something that endangered his life. But this wasn’t suicide and he wasn’t suffering with a mental illness. 'The intent was not to die, but to have a near-death experience, but it went wrong. 'He made absolutely sure I knew where to find him. He was brave and silly and he was thinking about me. 'He wasn’t unhappy. It was a very unselfish act because he was trying to prove something to other people. 'I didn’t want anyone thinking he had killed himself on purpose. He was funny, brave and gentle and his spirit will never die.' Luke enjoyed football and snooker at school and had plenty of friends in Rescorla, the small Cornish village where the family live. Tragic accident: A coroner ruled the 27-year-old yoga fanatic died when his near-death experiment went tragically wrong, and 'caused physical death' But after leaving school he became withdrawn, reclusive and spent all his time reading books on meditation and spirituality. Ms Monrose told the hearing: 'I told him he should get out more, get a girlfriend and go to the pub and get drunk, but he wasn’t interested. 'He read books on people that have had near-death experiences and came back with a new sense of purpose. 'Luke intended to be one of those people and to say ""It’s OK, we don’t die, we carry on"". That’s what he intended to do. He took it to the extreme.' In a statement read out in court, Daniel, his brother, said: 'It’s my belief that Luke thought he was on this Earth to change the fate of the planet for the better. 'Luke and I weren’t scared of death as we know that our consciousness is separate from our physical bodies.' Recording a narrative verdict, coroner Emma Carlyon said Luke 'died as a consequence of a near-death experience which resulted in physical death'. The cause of death was ruled as drowning.","Spiritualist Luke Monrose, 27, hoped he would achieve enlightenment .

"By . Jill Reilly . Nine North Korean teenagers forcibly repatriated from China have spoke of the horrors they endured in their homeland. The defectors, aged between 14 and 22, are classed as 'ggotjebi in North Korea - a term for vagrants who stay . alive by begging, scavenging and stealing. They had been detained in Laos some 17 . days earlier, along with a South Korean missionary who tried to help . them get to a foreign embassy in the Southeast Asian country, according to activists in Seoul. Before . they were flown back from China last week, the group of young North . Korean defectors told an activist . how some of them were beaten with sticks for trying to steal noodles in . their homeland. Scroll down for video . Returned: Nine young North Koreans have been repatriated from China after fleeing their homeland . Evicted: The North Korean youths playing Janggi or Korean chess to pass the time at a residence at an undisclosed location in China before they were deported . They talked about a South Korean movie they saw, and wondered if prison cells there were really as clean as the film depicted. Most are believed to be orphans found roaming around a Chinese border town by a South Korean missionary who took them in. China, North Korea's neighbor and ally, frequently returns North Korean defectors hiding in its territory to their homeland under a bilateral treaty, but analysts said it was unusual for the news of the return of teen ggotjebi to become so public. The term ggotjebi is believed to originate from a Russian word meaning nomad. It refers to those who manage to stay alive by begging on the streets, stealing food and goods at markets, rummaging through trash heaps, pickpocketing and burglary.

Emotional: North Korean defector Ko Mi-hwa holds a picture of the North Korean defectors who were flown home as she cries during a rally protesting against Laos' repatriation . North Korean defectors say the . government considers ggotjebi a headache because they don't abide by . regulations and undermine the country's image. Though . it is unclear how many ggotjebi are in North Korea, the number was . believed to have sharply surged in the 1990s, when the country was . devastated by a famine that foreign economists estimate killed hundreds . of thousands of people. Many people sneaked across the border to China in search of food. In . recent years, as more North Koreans have left their homeland - . sometimes without telling immediate family members - the number of . children abandoned by their parents has risen as well, defectors say. Anger: A protestor holds a sign reading 'We shed tears of blood due to indiferent government; and the sign, left, reads, 'human rights accountability is compulsory provisions of international law' Pray: A group of human rights activists holding a rally in downtown Seoul to pray for the nine North Korean youths recently taken back to Pyongyang by North Korean agents from Laos . 'We left our children with a promise that they will only have to wait for just three days (until we can stay together again), but now we cannot even count how old they have become,' defector Kim Tai-hee said at a rally in Seoul on Wednesday. 'We don't know the whereabouts of the children in North Korea.' Eight of the nine had been ggotjebi at markets in the city of Hyesan in North Korea's northern Ryanggang province, and in the Chinese border town of Changbai, according to South Korean human rights activist Ahn Kyung-su. He said he met the defectors in China in mid-April, for one day. Ahn said he was told that a South Korean missionary had looked after them for months at a shelter in the Chinese border town of Dandong after bringing them from Changbai. Ahn traveled to Dandong to see if any of the defectors wanted to come to his organization in Seoul. Ahn said most of the defectors were 'very active and playful' and knew one another well. 'They . just playfully told me about what one another did as ggotjebi,' he . said. Marking: South Koreans burn incense.

He . said the defectors were interested in South Korea's pop culture and . asked him about a recent hit movie in which inmates help one of their . own reunite with his daughter in prison. 'One of the questions was . whether prison cells in South Korea are really as clean as shown on the . movie,' he said. North Korea alleged Wednesday that the youths were not defectors but had been kidnapped by South Koreans. A spokesman for the Central Committee of North Korea's Red Cross Society accused South Korean traffickers of attempting to abduct the teens, and subjecting them to brainwashing and beatings. The teens also were forced to convert to Christianity, according to a statement carried Wednesday by North Korean state media. Under North Korea's penal code, repatriated defectors face a minimum of five years of hard labor, and up to life in prison or death for cases deemed serious. The U.N. human rights chief criticized both China and Laos for allowing the nine defectors to be repatriated. The U.S. has said it is very concerned about the case, and South Korea has demanded that North Korea not punish the defectors unfairly.

[caption . China urged the U.N. not to make 'irresponsible' comments, and Laos cited human trafficking as a reason for the detainment of South Koreans who helped the defectors. Not all ggotjebi become vagrants because of economic reasons. Kim Hyuk, a 31-year-old North Korean defector now living in South Korea, said he ran away from home in the northeastern city of Chongjin when he was 7 after finding out his mother was actually his stepmother. He said he started out scavenging for leftovers in garbage bins, and later stole food from shops, broke into vacant houses, stole clothes that were hanging out to dry and even used razors to slit open other people's bags to steal their lunch at a crowded train station. 'At first I felt a little bit guilty, scared and nervous, but I also thought I would die if I didn't do those things,' he said in an interview with The Associated Press this week. Caught by police, he was frequently sent home and beaten by his father, but he kept running away. He said he never fit into strictly controlled North Korean society. Kim said he fled to South Korea in 2001 after serving more than a year at a North Korean labor camp for smuggling and other charges, and now works for the government as an instructor on North Korea.","The nine repatriated defectors ranged in age from 14 to 22 .

"By . Associated Press . and Alex Greig . The fashion house Valentino has apologized for touting in an email blast to journalists that one of their pricey bags was carried by Amy Adams as she stepped from a car at the wake of Philip Seymour Hoffman. Much was made of the promotional email sent Friday, complete with two photos of Adams outside the Thursday wake. Valentino said in a statement that quickly followed that the company didn't realize the photos were snapped at the sad gathering of loved ones for Hoffman, who was found dead February 2 of an apparent heroin overdose in his apartment. Solemn occasion: Amy Adams, her Valentino bag and her husband Darren Le Gallo attend the wake for Philip Seymour Hoffman in Manhattan Friday .

It was an innocent mistake and we apologize to Ms. Adams who was not aware, or a part of, our PR efforts,' said the regretful statement signed by Mona Swanson, vice president of communications for Valentino USA. The New York Post splashed the Valentino-toting actress all over its front page Saturday with the headline 'DEAD CARPET' after putting up the gaffe online, apparently prompting the apology. The Daily News included the image of Adams with the red, $2,500 bag in a two-page spread inside the paper.Both Hoffman's wake and his funeral the next day were attended . by numerous celebrities, Adams included.

It was accompanied by two pictures of a grieving Adams with her head down, wearing sunglasses and a sombre expression. Bag lady: Adams may not now be so fond of her designer bag . Adams, who recently broke down in tears while speaking to students on Inside the Actors Studio about working with Hoffman, is disgusted by the PR stunt. The actress' representative called the tasteless ploy 'truly appalling.' 'Amy Adams is not a paid spokesperson for Valentino and the suggestion she would use this moment to participate in a promotion is truly appalling,' the spokesperson told Page Six. Adams wore a red halterneck Valentino gown to this year's Golden Globes, where she picked up the award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy but it now seems unlikely she'll choose the designer for the upcoming Academy Awards. Adams, who is nominated in this year's awards for best actress for her role in American Hustle, co-starred with Hoffman in the 2012 Oscar-nominated film The Master, 2008's Doubt and Charlie Wilson's War in 2007. Hoffman was due to direct Adams in Ezekiel Moss, a period piece, sometime this year. The company issued an apology for the press release late Friday afternoon. 'We sincerely regret releasing a photo to the media this morning of Amy Adams with a Valentino bag,' said Valentino spokeswoman Mona Swanson.

"By . James Gordon . Google may tout itself as being a publicly responsible, green fingered, all-things-good company that touts green technology, but the companies chief executives are not setting a good example from on high.In fact, it would appear they're flying high whilst American taxpayers foot the bill. Despite lobbying the federal government on environmental policy, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, and Eric Schmidt have put 3.4 million miles on their private jets in recent years, polluting the atmosphere with 100 million pounds of carbon dioxide according to The Blaze. Forget using Google Hangouts to conduct business, the execs prefer the old-fashioned method of face-to-face communication. Often, they'll take a trip on one of the enormous corporate fuel-guzzling 757 or 767 aircraft or the more exclusive Gulfstream V at a moments notice – and sometimes to the most exotic of vacation destinations. Hypocritical: The company extol the virtues of greener living but it also appears that Google are happy to travel at the expense of taxpayers in gas-guzzling jets . Racking up the airlmiles: Googl;e owns several aircraft including this Gulfstream V private jet . We only pay this much: Executive Chairman of Google Eric Schmidt is one of the lucky Google employees who has a fleet of aircraft at his disposal. Better yet, the fuel is also far cheaper than anyone else pays thanks to taxpayers . Their trips have been analyzed and logged and show that despite trying to convince federal lawmakers to introduce stringent and restrictive environmental regulations, they happily jet off using gallons of polluting aviation fuel. It might not be such a big deal if Google would practice what it preaches. The search engine powerhouse has been a leading proponent of encouraging the federal government to, as the company says, ‘put a price on carbon through cap-and-trade or a carbon tax.’ Through has introduced its own Google Green Initiative as well as a Clean Energy 2030 proposal to wean the U.S. off its reliance on fossil fuels. Google wishes to transform the economy from one running on fossil fuels to one largely based on clean energy. They’re happy to talk about building whole new industries and creating millions of new jobs along with cutting energy costs both at the gas pump and at home. Could it be that this is nothing more than hot-air in an effort to maintain its hip image? Gas-guzzler: Google even owns 767 and 757 jets such as this one. Their trips, according to flight log data analyzed, included single-day jaunts and brief corporate meetings, but also what appear to be hundreds of exotic vacation destinations . The Blaze claim that when a company attempts to manipulate the government into using environmental policies to determine what types of cars Americans can drive, what kinds of jobs Americans can have and how taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars are spent, it should at least be unerring in its commitment to the environment. Drew Johnson, a fellow at the Center for Individual Freedom has been looking through the hours and hours of flying time generated by Google’s Sergey Brin, Larry Page, and Eric Schmidt. Google maintains a hangar of jets ready to take to the air at a moments’ notice. In total, according to flight data that was analyzed, Google executives have flown more than 3.4 million miles, burning an average of 100,000 gallons of fuel every month in recent years. Google’s planes burned through nearly 59 million barrels of crude since 2007, much of it on non-essential trips to adult playgrounds Nantucket, Aspen, Costa Rica, St. Maarten, Hawaii, Bermuda and Tahiti. The supposedly environmentally conscious company’s jets have emitted more than 100 million pounds of carbon dioxide over the last four years alone. Google co-founder Sergey Brin: Brin, Larry Page, and Eric Schmidt have put 3.4 million miles on their private jets in recent years, polluting the atmosphere with 100 million pounds of carbon dioxide . No wonder he's smiling: Larry Page, Google co-founder and CEO  uses campaign contributions to strong-arm federal lawmakers into hamstringing everyone else with restrictive environmental regulations . It even appears that Google is hand-in-glove with the government. Google has snagged a few favors along the way and has been getting preferential rent when it comes to housing their collection of gigantic jets. Since 2007, the private airplane fleet owned by Google execs has been housed in a hangar at NASA’s Ames Research Center just outside Google’s Mountain View, California HQ. The hangars are funded by the taxpayer and are supposed to be for aircraft conducting scientific research for NASA. The government is even allowing Google to fill itself up with jet fuel at a cut price deal – again, thanks to U.S. taxpayers. The fuel was of course meant for NASA and Department of Defense aircraft, but why fly somewhere else to fill up when you have it on tap? Mr Johnson estimates that Google . officials spent $29 million on jet fuel – a saving of around $10 . million. But what is $10 million to a company that has generated $60 . billion in revenue over the past few years? It should come as no surprise that as a result of Google’s involvement with the government and securing their cheap and exclusive parking space and fuel s for the company’s jets, Google also happens to be among the largest contributors to political campaigns in the United States. Almost a million dollars was given to President Obama’s campaign in 2008 with a similar amount in 2012. Not practicing what they preach: While Google encourages government to limit carbon emissions for the rest of the American economy, company VIPs are zooming through the skies, polluting their way to the exotic playgrounds of the rich and famous . Mr Johnson claims that ‘by pushing strict ‘climate change’ policy on everyone else, while polluting up a storm themselves. ‘ Google reaches levels of hypocrisy not seen since I uncovered the inconvenient truth about frenzied environmentalist Al Gore, who devours about 20 times more electricity in his mansion than the average American family uses in their home over the course of a year.’ Incidentally, Mr Gore has been an company has had plenty of time to learn directly from the discredited environmental prophet, whom they have paid handsomely to serve as a ‘senior adviser‘ since 2001.’ As Google continues to extol the virtues of environmental purity and encourage the government to limit carbon emissions for the rest of the American economy, its own company VIPs are busy zooming around, polluting the skies as they go on travel subsidized by American taxpayers. Perhaps Google should begin by Googlingthe word ‘Hypocrites’?","Google execs have traveled millions of miles to playgrounds of the rich and famous .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It sounds like the latest gadget from Apple. But ‘iPosture’ is being blamed for an alarming level of  back pain among 18 to 24-year-olds. The term is being used to describe the stooped body shape adopted by those texting, emailing or playing games on their iPad or smartphone. Some 84 per cent of those aged 18 to 24 admitted to having suffered back pain in the past year, in a survey by the healthcare provider Simplyhealth. The study found 84 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds have admitted to suffering back pain in the last 12 months - perhaps because they are spending a large amount of time hunching over tablets and smartphones . This age group now loses more working days a year to back pain than those in their parents’ generation. Dr . Brian Hammond, chairman of BackCare, the national back pain charity, . said: ‘The vast majority of people experience back pain in the lower . back. ‘Over half the population experience pain in the neck or lower back every year. ‘This survey shows that 18 to 24-year-olds are more likely to experience pain in the upper back and neck. ‘It . is likely that slumping and hunching over computers and hand-held . devices is a contributory factor in the different types of back pain . reported by different generations. ‘Younger . people are far more likely to be hunched over a device on a sofa, and . would benefit from paying close attention to the basics of good . posture.’ The results . also show that almost all age groups spend as much time in front of a . computer, laptop or tablet screen in total as they do asleep in bed, . some even more so. Excluding . time spent watching the ‘traditional’ TV, the typical young adult . spends 8.83 hours a day in front of a screen. The total is 6.64 hours . for the older generation. The 18 to 24-year-olds are also much more likely to either slouch or hunch in front of their PC or other devices. Part . of that could be down to a lack of old-fashioned advice, because it . appears that being told to sit up straight seems to be on the decline. A combination of work and home screen time, excluding traditional TV, means that over 55s spent an average of 6.64 hours a day in front of a computer screen. However this age group are more than twice as likely to sit up straight at home with their PC or laptop in front of them that the younger age group . Nearly . three-quarters of the older generation recall being given this advice . from their parents and more than half remember similar admonishments . from their teachers. Parents . today are much less likely to tell their children to sit up and stand . up straight. Nearly two thirds of those questioned said they never gave . their children this advice. Jean . Broke-Smith, an expert in etiquette and deportment, said: ‘Although it . has been decades since people learned good posture at finishing schools, . the time seems right to recognise its potential to help younger people . avoid the risk of back pain associated with increasing use of hand-held . devices. ‘Being aware you are slouching or hunching over your tablet or smartphone is half the battle. ‘The . other half is to counter this bad habit and the potential pain it can . generate by always sitting up with a straight back with your device in a . comfortable position at a reasonable height in front of you.’ Over half the population experience pain in the neck or lower back every year. The study results also show almost all age groups spend as much time in front of a PC, laptop or tablet screen in total as they do asleep in bed, some even more so . Motion sickness caused by smartphones, 3D films and computer games could become a curse of the 21st century. A variation called simulation sickness is on the rise as gadgets become better and better at mimicking reality. Up to 90 per cent of people could be affected, according to technology website Quartz. Motion sickness is usually triggered when we feel movement  but cannot see it. Simulation sickness, is the opposite – we see movement that the body cannot feel. It is being felt by iPhone owners using its new operating system, which makes the screen appear more 3D. Google Glass spectacles, which flash images into the wearer’s field of vision, are expected to exacerbate the phenomenon.","84 per cent of 18-24 year olds have admitted to suffering back pain in the last 12 months, according to a survey by Simplyhealth .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Food prices are predicted to rise faster than incomes every year until 2018, with meat and fresh fruit and vegetables becoming only an occasional treat for some. The cost of putting food on the table is forecast to rise by 3.8 per cent next year and still further in 2015, according to industry experts. They also say the cost of eating out in restaurants and pubs has increased by seven per cent in the past six months. Fresh fruit and vegetables are due to become a rare treat for some as food prices are set to rise . A report from Prestige Purchasing, which supplies the restaurant trade, said lower harvests as a result of volatile weather, and high demand for meat from the growing middle classes in countries such as China and India have resulted in a ‘perfect storm’ to push up costs. Fruit prices rose by 10.2 per cent in the past year, vegetables by 5.4 per cent, meat by 5.2 per cent and fish by 4.9 per cent. Evidence from government studies shows that many UK households, particularly those on low incomes, have consumed less fruit, vegetables and meat since the cost-of- living squeeze began five years ago. They have switched to less healthy, processed food, while fresh meat and produce are increasingly seen as a treat. Prestige said the horsemeat scandal earlier this year, coupled with high costs of production and rising demand is keeping the price of beef high. Mature cheddar cheese is up by 13 per cent from last year because of limited milk supply. By contrast, chicken should get cheaper, according to Prestige, after a 20 per cent fall predicted in the cost of corn used for feed. There is also hope that a sharp increase in the cost of salmon in recent years is unlikely to continue, because shoppers simply cannot afford to pay any more. Prestige said its figures are in tune with those from analysts Conlumino, which has forecast that average household food bills will rise by £850 per year by 2018 – adding up to £19.6billion to the UK’s annual grocery bill. Supermarkets battle it out to prove they give the best value. But one shop opening today can really claim to be Britain’s cheapest store. The ‘social supermarket’, in Goldthorpe, South Yorkshire, is packed with branded groceries, reduced by up to two thirds. Up to 500 people can become members of the discount store run by Community Shop, as long as they claim one of a specified list of benefits including Employment Support Allowance. Stock will arrive daily from manufacturers and suppliers with the consent of shops such as Tesco, Asda, Marks and Spencer, Morrisons and Ocado.  Sarah Dunwell, of Community Shop’s parent firm, said 500 people will be given membership for six months to test the idea, with the hope of launching 20 nationwide next year, including six in London. ‘It is not just about the long-term unemployed but really hard-working families who are struggling,’ she said. The supermarket will use residual food not needed by larger retailers for reasons such as damaged packaging or the wrong labelling. ‘While we have people in the UK going hungry it is wrong such foods should be thrown away,’ Miss Dunwell added. Average pay rises are running at just two per cent a year in the private sector and one per cent in the public sector, according to figures collated by Income Data Services. David Read, chief executive of Prestige, said: ‘Unpredictable weather patterns caused by climate change, an ever-increasing global population, rising production costs, commodity futures trading and water scarcity is putting a lot of pressure on food prices around the world. And this isn’t going to stop any time soon. This will not only have a significant impact on the costs of eating out and the things we eat, but also the average grocery bill. ‘We urge families to learn from the restaurant trade and take simple steps in planning and shopping to help control spiralling costs.’ He recommended families and pensioners consider switching to frozen vegetables rather than buying fresh, only to throw a lot of it away. He also suggested a return to simple ‘meat and two veg’ meals, rather than elaborate dishes with lots of ingredients. Mr Read added: ‘You can get more value out of meat by using cheaper cuts such as chicken thighs instead of breasts or preparing dishes with more mixed ingredients, such as meat stews with pulses, root vegetables and dumplings. ‘People should reconsider the weekly shop and switch to frozen. Recent research has found that up to six meals a week are wasted by the average UK family. ‘To reduce this, families should consider whether it would be more economical to pick up fresh produce two or three times a week or consider switching some ingredients from fresh to frozen.’","Cost of putting food on the table to rise by 3.8 per cent next year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . You might want to take a seat - or maybe not: new research suggests your chair is killing you. That's the finding of Dr James Levine, director of obesity solutions at America's Mayo Clinic, who says: 'The consequences of prolonged sitting include obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and poor mood.' This is because of the effect sitting has on your body. It means the rate at which you burn calories falls to about one per minute (just above what it would be were you dead), and the amount of enzymes responsible for removing bad fats from the bloodstream plunges. Could you walk your way to better health while fielding phone calls, answering emails and planning proposals on a laptop? Worse, the long-term harm of these effects cannot be mitigated by exercise. One piece of research found women who spent six hours or more a day sitting had a 40 per cent higher rate of premature death than those who sat for three hours. In men it was 20 per cent. However, a bonkers-sounding new invention could be the answer. Treadmill desks, which allow you to work while walking, have taken health-conscious New York and Los Angeles by storm, and are now available in the UK. The desks - which come with an inbuilt workstation and slow belt on which you walk at about two miles an hour while using your computer - are already being used by Google, Microsoft and the hotel chains Hyatt and Marriott. The average person will burn about 100 calories for every mile they walk. It takes a bit of getting used to, but some workers claim they've lost weight, cured back pain and tackled depression. â– â€‰Walkers start at Â£999 from gymworld.co.uk .","Sitting at a desk all can day result in obesity, cancer and depression .

"By . Jack Doyle, Home Affairs Correspondent . Stringent: The rules have been introduced after Jimmy Savile, pictured, abused children for decades . Celebrities and other public figures who use their fame to abuse children will face longer sentences under new rules published today. Tougher sentences for future cases similar to those of Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall are a response to the public outcry over a string historic sex abuse cases dating back decades. The move is part of wider toughening of sex offence sentencing guidelines designed to protect the public against dangerous rapists, paedophiles and online perverts. Among the changes are: . Sentencing Council chairman Lord Justice Treacy said: 'No-one wants more people falling victim to offenders who come before the courts, and public protection is central to this guideline, whether this is by jailing offenders or, where appropriate, imposing a rigorous treatment order and other restrictions to prevent reoffending.' The new guidelines for judges cover more than 50 sex offences including rape, child sex offences and trafficking. Significantly, it will mean future cases similar to that of Hall - the disgraced It’s A Knockout presenter - or Savile, would be likely to result in longer jail sentences. Sex attackers will no longer get a shorter sentence because of their claimed ‘good character’ if they used their public image and status to target victims. Paedophile: The guidelines were released in the wake of celebrity abusers including Jimmy Savile . Jailed: Former It's a Knockout presenter Stuart Hall, pictured, was also convicted of exploiting children . Other factors likely to lead to a longer sentence are the involvement of multiple people - a response to the sickening grooming gang cases in Rochdale and Oxford. The guidelines also explicitly recognise for the first time the psychological damage caused by rape and other sex crimes, and the long term impact on victims. On child pornography offences, anyone caught downloading even the lowest level of images will not ‘get off’ with a fine, although judges are also encouraged to use community sentences involving treatment than short jail terms. Sick: The Sentencing Council also reviewed cases of gangs of men grooming girls. Shabir Ahmed, pictured, led one such gang in Rochdale . Anyone distributing sick videos or making their own while abusing youngsters will also receive longer sentences. Over the last five years a total of 59 paedophiles were fined for possession of child abuse images. Earlier this year there was an outcry when a 13-year-old sex attack victim was described in court as ‘predatory’ - and her attacker got a suspended jail sentence. The new guidelines make clear that children aged 13 or over no longer able to ‘consent’ to sex. Longer terms will be doled out to gangs found guilty of grooming their victims. In Rochdale and Oxford young girls were abused by groups of men whom they regarded as their ‘boyfriends’ and whose plight was ignored by police and social services who regarded them as consenting. The new rules also acknowledge the increasing use of technology by paedophiles online. Criminals who use codes to hide sex offending activity, who groom online and luring children into sharing explicit photos or videos can expect tougher penalties. Children’s charities welcomed the changes, which come in to effect from April. Barnardo’s deputy director of strategy Alison Worsley said: ‘The publication of this new sentencing guideline will help to ensure the focus is on the perpetrator and not the victim. ‘As the guideline emphasises, it is plain wrong to imply in any way that the experiences of sexually-exploited children are something they bring on themselves.’ Sue Berelowitz, deputy Children’s Commissioner for England said: ‘These far-reaching changes to the guidelines on sentencing for sexual offences by adults by the Sentencing Coucil rightly place the victims centre stage. ‘The new guidelines give an unequivocal message that society considers sex offences to be amongst the most serious and grave crimes that can be committed. ‘The impact, including long term consequences, for victims are frequently devastating. These guidelines make clear that such crimes are abhorrent and that sentences will properly reflect the gravity of the offence.’","New Sentencing Council guidelines for judges cover more than 50 offences .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A ghostly figure has been caught on camera standing outside Parliament on New Year's Eve. The spooky image shows a transparent figure dressed in modern clothing gazing out over the Thames near Westminster Bridge in London. Professional photographer Jules Annan took the image on New Year's Eve  - but only noticed the ghostly apparition when he got home. Ghost? A photographer thinks this strange figure, circled, he captured on New Year's Eve could be a ghost . He said: 'Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. I can't explain it. 'There was no one there when I took the photograph and it is not a double exposure or a long exposure. 'I have shown it to five or six other people and they cannot explain it either.' Among the experts he has consulted is paranormal investigator Lee Roberts, owner of Haunted Events UK. Spooky: The image up close. Paranormal experts say the figure is either a ghost, or someone tampering with the image with editing software . He also believes it can not be explained by camera error and says it is either paranormal activity or someone tampering with the photographs using editing software.

"By . Nick Mcdermott . The BBC’s shambolic television coverage of the men’s road  cycle race was yesterday blamed on spectators using Twitter as the athletes passed. Olympic officials said this had jammed the network used to provide crucial race timing and positional updates to broadcasters from the athletes’ bikes. One million spectators turned out to watch the race on Saturday, one of the few unticketed events in the Games. Problems: The BBC has apologised for its coverage of the men's road cycling race, in which Mark Cavendish (left) was riding for Great Britain . Celebration: Kazakhstan rider Alexandr Vinokourov holds his arms aloft as he crosses the finish line to win gold. BBC commentators seemed unsure about which cyclists had won medals . But viewers at home were left baffled, with many criticising the BBC for confusing and ill-informed commentary by a team including British cycling greats Hugh Porter and Chris Boardman, as well as presenter Jill Douglas. Fans were left clueless about timings and positions on the course, and even for a while after the race ended, it was unclear who had won the bronze medal. One viewer complained on Twitter: ‘Horrible BBC coverage of the Olympic cycling road race. Erratic time splits, wrong names and inaccurate position calls. Frustrating.’ Another posted: 'The #olympics2012 cycling road race coverage contained literally the worst commentary I have ever heard. Embarrassingly bad coverage.' Colin Lynch, an Irish Paralympic cycling world champion, tweeted: ‘If you’re watching cycling for the first time today on TV, I promise – it usually has much better coverage and commentary. Don’t be put off.’ Not our fault: Presenters Gary Lineker (left) and Jake Humphrey (right) defended the BBC, tweeting that the problems . were beyond the broadcaster's control . Defence: Jake Humphrey took to Twitter to respond to complaints by viewers . Apology: Cycling commentator Chris Boardman, who won gold at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, said he was 'gutted' about the technical problems affecting the BBC's coverage . Former Olympic gold-medal cyclist Boardman took to the social media site to apologise to fans, writing: ‘Folks, got to apologise for issues today, gutted. Tomorrow we aim to have stuff like information and a monitor we can see for commentary.’ Frustrated: Chris Boardman, a member of the BBC commentary team, apologised for the disappointing coverage . The BBC yesterday said the problems were beyond its control, as the coverage was via the Olympic Broadcasting Service (OBS) supplies footage and data to all the TV networks. BBC presenter Gary Lineker wrote on Twitter: ‘This is the Olympics. The coverage is from a pool of broadcasters from across the world. I’m afraid that’s how it is regardless of who hosts.’ Jake Humphrey also used the site, writing: ‘'For those asking about more on-screen stats, graphics and info. None of it in the BBC control, we just take pictures provided to whole world'. The International Olympic Committee yesterday said the sending of race information from tiny GPS transmitters in competitors’ bikes had been jammed by spectators using their mobile phones to access social media sites. Before yesterday’s women’s road race, IOC communications director Mark Adams even urged spectators to refrain from using their phones when the riders passed. Mr Adams said: ‘From my understanding, one network was oversubscribed, and OBS are trying to spread the load to other providers. We don’t want to stop people engaging in this by social media and sending updates, but perhaps they might consider only sending urgent updates.’ The plea was partially successful, with better race information during the women’s event – although Boardman yesterday told viewers the split times shown on their screens were inaccurate, forcing him to keep a record. A BBC spokesman said last night: ‘The pictures are provided by the host broadcaster OBS to all global  rights holders, these are not BBC-produced pictures. We have raised our concerns with OBS who have explained that there were GPS problems with ... the timing graphics, which resulted in a lack of information for the commentary teams.’ Elsewhere, at the North Greenwich arena, the BBC’s coverage of the gymnastics prompted complaints as the British men’s team qualified for the final for the first time since 1924. But viewers saidthat they missed much of the action because the broadcasting team showed pictures of other country's athletes. Star performer: Kristian Thomas of Great Britain competes in the gymnastics event. Viewers described the BBC's coverage of the competition as 'shocking' 'Listen up': BBC sports reporter Ollie Williams sought to explain why more performances by British gymnasts were not shown . The BBC's own commentators appeared frustrated as pictures of foreign competitors were shown while British gymnasts' displays elsewhere in the arena were drawing loud cheers from the home crowd. One viewer tweeted: 'Shocking coverage from the BBC for the GBR boys in the artistic gymnastics. After 1 hour of qualifications we've seen 2 performances.' Another Twitter user wrote: 'Very disappointed with bbc coverage of the gymnastics so far-not seen a peep of GB&watching same person on floor twice!' BBC sports reporter Ollie Williams, who was covering the event, tweeted: 'Listen up. This applies to all sports and to the gymnastics now. 'The BBC is NOT the host broadcaster. We do not decide the pictures shown. 'So if wondering why you can't see GB gymnasts, it's because the BBC is not in charge. 'The Olympics' own broadcaster, OBS, directs coverage.'","Commentators repeatedly made mistakes during coverage of road race contested by British cycling stars Mark Cavendish and Bradley Wiggins .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A former member of one of the most notorious university fraternities in America has spoken of his experiences being beaten, locked in a basement and forced to stand in a waist-high bucket of ice as part of his attempts to join the exclusive organisation. Justin Stuart, who was 19 at the time, was an aspiring member - or 'pledge' - in a branch of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at Salisbury University in Maryland. Along with others, he was subjected to cruel and dangerous 'hazing' rituals in order to enrol in the group. Mr Stuart spoke of how he and other pledges were forced to recite the fraternity's creed while standing in a rubbish bin full of ice, wearing only underwear, while older members poured water over him. Fraternity: Justin Stuart was a 'pledge' in a branch of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon in Maryland. Pictured is a branch in Kansas . He also said that over an eight-week period in 2012 he was beaten with paddles, forced to drink to the point of unconsciousness and forced to dress in nappies and women's clothing. In a particularly gruelling incident, he said a group of recruits were locked in an unlit basement for up to nine hours without food, water or toilets while an aggressive song by German metal band Rammstein was played on repeat. Mr Stuart compared the incident to being held in Guantanamo Bay and said it was 'like torture'. According to The Independent, Mr Stuart, who is now a student at another university, said the incidents still trouble him today. Beatings: Justin Stuart says he was beaten by a paddle, a common feature of 'hazing' rituals, like the one pictured here in 1946 New York . He said: 'I have dreams of the basement sometimes. I hear the yelling. It sounds like theyâ€™re about to attack me. Then I wake up from my . nightmare.' As well as being illegal, and officially banned by Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national headquarters, any sort of 'hazing' is against the policy of the university. Mr Stuart took his account to the universities authorities, who launched an investigation into the group, which resulted in them being suspended until the spring of this year. Sigma Alpha Epsilon, which launched an appeal against the ruling but lost, will then be on probation for a further year. Some former members of the group were so angry with the suspension that they withdrew substantial donations to the university. The fraternity, which was founded in 1856 and has branches in almost every U.S. state, has been disciplined more than 100 times. More than 15 branches suspended or closed since 2009. The organisation has also been linked to nine deaths related to drink, substance abuse and hazing since 2006.","Justin Stuart endured painful and humiliating rituals in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity .

"By . Shari Miller . Global warming has not stopped - it's just on a 'hiatus' and likely to return with ever more heatwaves, droughts, floods and rising sea levels - according to a draft report from leading scientists. The 127-page United Nations report, and a shorter summary for policymakers due for release in Stockholm on September 27, suggests a slowdown in Earth's rising temperature can be explained by volcanic ash and a cyclical dip in energy emitted from the sun. While likely to attract opposition from sceptics - who say climate change is not man-made - the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel . on Climate Change is likely to stand by the bold claims as the body attempts to salvage its reputation following the publication of its last report in 2007. In that report, scientists erroneously claimed the Himalayas would melt by . 2035. Meltdown: Climate scientists say despite a slowing of temperatures, global warming is still likely to return and continue having a negative effect on the world's polar ice caps . Now six years on, the IPCC must convincingly explain why temperatures have risen more slowly in the past 15 years despite rising emissions of greenhouse gases - something that has emboldened sceptics who question the need for urgent action. The IPCC is seen as the world authority on the . extent of climate change and what is causing it. Governments around the world, . including Britain, largely base their green policies on the report. Just on Friday, France called for bolder EU cuts in greenhouse gases and said it would halve its own energy consumption by 2050. While the IPCC draft report acknowledges the slow rise in temperature, scientists predict this is simply a 'common break' in global warming - and it will resume once more. 'Barring a major volcanic eruption, most 15-year global mean surface temperature trends in the near-term future will be larger than during 1998 to 2012,' reports the Technical Summary, dated June 7. Temperatures are likely be 0.3 to 0.7 degree Celsius (0.5-1.3 Fahrenheit) higher from 2016-35 than from 1986-2005, it adds. Heating up: The report suggests that Earth's temperatures in the future are likely to be higher than in previous decades . The reports by the IPCC, updating an overview of climate change from 2001, are the main guide for government action. 'Fifteen-year-long hiatus periods are common' in both historical records and in computer models. But scientists were caught out - in one computer model, 111 of 114 estimates over-stated recent temperature rises. The drafts predict that temperatures could rise by up to 4.8C (8.5F) this century - far above a ceiling set by governments of 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times to avoid dangerous changes to nature and society. However, the report suggests that with deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, the rise could be kept to just 0.3C (0.5F), the draft says. Many experts agree that natural variations in the weather, caused by factors such as shifts in ocean currents or winds, can mask a warming trend even with a continued build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The hiatus 'is not a sign that the warming trend has gone,' said Guy Brasseur, director of the Climate Service Center in Germany. He said the climate was comparable to Wall Street - there were often long-term trends with unpredictable daily swings. Brasseur and other experts contacted were stating their own views, not referring to details of the coming report. 'There are a number of explanations (for the hiatus), any one of which might be correct,' said professor Myles Allen of Oxford University, who contributed to the IPCC draft. 'That is very different from saying: 'We have no idea what's going on'.' Still frozen: A 2007 IPCC report erroneously suggested that the Himalayas would melt by 2035 . The drafts say that a reduction in warming for 1998 to 2012 compared to 1951 to 2012 is 'due in roughly equal measure' to natural variations in the climate and factors such as 'volcanic eruptions and the downward phase of the current solar cycle.' Volcanoes spew ash into the air that can dim sunlight and so cool the surface of the planet. The sun was in a downward cycle of output - meaning that it was emitting less energy - during most of the period. The technical summary says that warming from 1998 to 2012 slowed to 0.05 degree C (0.09F) per decade, against 0.12 (0.2F) per decade from 1951-2012. But the decade to 2012 was the warmest since records began in the mid-19th Century. It says another factor could be that computer models consistently over-estimate warming. Some experts argued that near-term projections of temperature rises should be cut by 10 percent, it said. Other theories include that more heat is going into the oceans or that air pollution is dimming sunlight. An academic report last month said a cooling of the Pacific Ocean, linked to natural La Nina events that bring cooler waters to the surface, was the main explanation. The IPCC draft also says the planet may be somewhat less sensitive than expected to a build-up of carbon dioxide in the air. A doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from pre-industrial times is likely to mean an eventual temperature rise of between 1.5 and 4.5 C (2.7-8.1F), down from 2.0 to 4.5 (3.6-8.1F) estimated in 2007, the report adds. The . United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will . release a report in Stockholm on September 27 to guide governments in . tackling global warming. Drafts . show that it will raise the probability that global warming is man-made to at least 95 percent - up from 90 per cent in its previous assessment in 2007. WHAT IS THE IPCC? It . was set up by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World . Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988 to assess scientific, . technical and socio-economic information from all over the world about . climate change. The IPCC does . not conduct any research itself or collect or monitor climate data, but . thousands of scientists contribute on a voluntary basis. Currently, . 195 governments participate in the review process of IPCC reports and . in its plenary sessions, where the main decisions about the IPCC's work . programme are taken and reports are accepted, adopted and approved. The . IPCC is chaired by Rajendra Pachauri, of India. The IPCC shared the . Nobel Peace Prize with former US Vice President Al Gore in 2007. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was set up by the United Nations, which is headquartered in New York (pictured) in 1988 . WHAT IS AR5? The . IPCC has published four assessment reports since 1990. The Fifth . Assessment Report (AR5) will be released in stages in 2013 and 2014. AR5 . is composed of three working group reports and a synthesis report. The . first working group report assesses the physical science basis for . climate change and will be released on September 27 in Stockholm. The . second will be about climate impacts, adaptation and vulnerability and . released on March 29 next year in Japan. The third report will focus on . ways to solve the problem and be released on April 11 in Germany. The . synthesis report is based on material from the three working group . reports and will be released on October 14, 2014 in Copenhagen. More than . 830 authors are involved in writing the reports. A FORCE FOR CHANGE . Previous . IPCC reports have sometimes spurred action at UN climate talks with . ever stronger warnings that greenhouse gases will cause more floods, . droughts, heatwaves and rising seas. A 1995 IPCC report that concluded it was more than 50 . percent likely mankind was to blame for climate change contributed . to the negotiations that led to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol for cutting . emissions by developed nations. The . 2007 report spurred two years of negotiations that led to a summit in . Copenhagen where world leaders failed to clinch a global deal. Governments agreed two years ago to have another try, giving themselves . until 2015. The IPCC faces . extra scrutiny this year after errors were found in the 2007 report, . which exaggerated the rate of melting of Himalayan glaciers. A review by . outside experts found that the main conclusions were unaffected. The IPCC subsequently set up a more rigorous and formal process for dealing with errors.","Climate change is on a 'hiatus' and likely to return with more heatwaves, droughts, floods and rising sea levels .

"By . Daniel Martin . Tasers are being used by police against children as young as 11 almost every day, figures have revealed. Armed officers discharged, targeted or threatened to use the 50,000-volt weapons against youngsters more than 320 times a year – an 11-fold increase from the first year they were cleared for use against under-18s in 2007. It emerged earlier this year that a girl aged just 12 had been shot by police with a Taser device in St Helens. Other children aged 11 have been threatened by officers with the weapons, forced have admitted. Widespread: In 2011 Tasers were used 323 times against under-18s . Critics pointed out that the revelations about the controversial of Tasers by the police come at a bad time for forces – just as they are ‘in the dock’ over their conduct in the Plebgate scandal. In the first year of officers being cleared to Taser children, they were used just 29 times in England. By 2009, this total had increased to 135. New figures released to Parliament show that one year later, in 2010, the weapons were used 339 times against children. By 2011 – the latest year that figures are available, the total stood at 323. The figures were not broken down into whether the guns were fired, or whether officers targeted children with a red dot laser to threaten them. Sophie Khan, solicitor-advocate specialising in Taser-related injuries and director of Police Action Centre, said she was appalled by the findings – and called for the use of Tasers on children to be prohibited. ‘It is shocking that Tasers have been used on under 18s nearly once a day for the last two years,’ she said. ‘Tasers should only be used on children and young adults if there is no other feasible way to restrain them due to the specific health risks they could suffer. If the Taser is fired at their chest there is a higher risk they will suffer a cardiac arrest. ‘The statistics show that the Taser is being used in contravention of the Taser Policy and Guidance, due to the dramatic increase in their use on under 18’s. This needs to be addressed by the police forces immediately before there is a serious injury caused to a child or young adults.’ Shocking: The weapons use 50,000 volts of electricity to stun people whom the police need to restrain . David Green, chief executive of the Civitas think tank, said: ‘It seems there is a risk of misuse of Tasers, that the police will use them as an on-the-spot punishment. ‘These figures come at a time when the police is in the dock over perceived untrustworthiness.’ In one of the most shocking cases, Merseyside Police shot a 12-year-old girl in St Helens as she brandished two knives and threatened to harm herself. At the time a spokesman said: ‘The Taser was deployed as a means to safely detain the girl and prevent serious harm to both her, the public and the officers. ‘The girl was uninjured and was subsequently arrested and cautioned for the offence.’ Freedom of Information requests have revealed that over the past three years, at least six children aged only 14 have been shot with Tasers, four ages 15 and 13 aged 16. Children as young as 11 have been threatened. The latest figures, released following a parliamentary question asked by Lib Dem backbencher Julian Huppert, did not break down the 2011 figures into the way the stun guns were deployed. But figures for 2009/10, released last year, show that of the 114 usages against children, 31 had been shot with Tasers – where an officer pulls the trigger shooting out a pointed barb attached by a wire to deliver an electric shock. Another 74 were ‘red dotted’ - a threatening gesture by officers pointing the Taser at the child pinpointing exactly where the barbs will hit their body with a red ‘sniper’s’ dot. 'Get a grip': Lib Dem MP Julian Huppert said the statistics uncovered were 'alarming' Experts say even deploying the red dot is still very threatening and can constitute assault. On 18 occasions the Taser was ‘drawn’ by police as a show of force, while in nine cases the ‘drive stun mode’ was used to stun a suspect. Only specialist officers can use Tasers at present, but last year the Police Federation called for every officer to be armed with one. There are 12,000 Tasers on the streets. Official guidance from the Association of Chief Police Officers states that ‘children and adults of smaller stature as being at potentially greater risk from the cardiac effects of Taser currents than normal adults of average or large stature’. The 2008 document added: ‘Until more research is undertaken to clarify the vulnerability of children to Taser currents, children and persons of small stature should be considered at possible greater risk than adults.’ Last night Julian Huppert, the Lib Dem MP who uncovered the statistics, said: ‘It is very alarming that hundreds of children are having Tasers used against them every year. ‘Whilst of course they do have a role, the Home Office should have a better grip on exactly when they are being used. ‘It’s alarming how many children are being targeted. It seems that, step by step, we are moving closer to a militarised police force rather than a civilian police force.’ Last year police were accused last night of behaving like ‘thugs with weapons’ after firing a 50,000-volt Taser into the back of a blind man. An officer mistook stroke victim Colin Farmer’s white stick for a samurai sword and discharged the stun gun – leaving the retired architect writhing in agony on the ground. Last night a spokesman for the Home Office said: ‘The Home Office and the police have rigorously tested Taser and independent medical assessments have concluded that the risk of serious or life threatening injuries is low. ‘They are only used by officers who have been carefully selected and trained and in situations where there is a serious threat of violence. ‘Taser provides the police with an additional tactical option that is less-lethal than conventional firearms and there have been no reported serious injuries or deaths in the UK directly linked to their use.'","New figures have been released under Freedom of Information laws .

"By . Leon Watson . An Irishman wanted in the U.S. for allegedly being the world's biggest child porn dealer could go free, it emerged today. Irish authorities have revealed Eric Eoin Marques will not be prosecuted under their jurisdiction and may challenge an attempt by the U.S. to get him extradited. Last month the 28-year-old, who the FBI has accused of being  the 'largest facilitator of child porn on the planet', indicated he would plead guilty to a series of charges under Irish law. In court: Ireland's DPP has revealed Eric Eoin Marques, aged 28, will not be prosecuted. He is pictured here being led to the High Court in Dublin, Ireland . But Ireland's director of public prosecutions Claire Loftus has now said she will not bring proceedings against him in Ireland - a decision she has not explained. It leaves the U.S. facing an uphill battle to extradite Marques because of its stiffer sentencing regime. In Ireland, Marques, who has no criminal record, faced a maximum 14-year jail term that would have been reduced significantly by an early guilty plea. However, in America the FBI told a court last month that he faced a total at least 100 years - four life terms in Ireland - behind bars if found guilty of the charges he is accused of. Unlike Ireland, each of the U.S. charges carries a sentence of between 20 and 30 years and are likely to run consecutively, rather than concurrently. Lawyers for Marques are expected to argue that U.S. sentences for similar charges are too harsh in comparison with Ireland's, and that Ireland should refuse to extradite him. Further, under Irish law the Justice Minister has the power to refuse an extradition where the DPP has decided not to bring proceedings against a suspect, the Irish Independent reported. Mr Marques's senior counsel, Remy Farrell, told the paper the direction from the DPP before the accused's extradition hearing, which is expected early next year, was a 'very significant event'. Mr Marques is accused of being the 'largest facilitator of child porn on the planet' by the FBI . After appearing before a High Court judge, Marques was denied bail and is considered a 'flight risk' by gardai and FBI . Last month Marques appeared before the High Court in Ireland, after he was arrested in Dublin in August on a Maryland warrant for four charges of distributing and promoting child pornography on the internet. The images he is accused of distributing and promoting relate to distressing depictions of youngsters being raped or tortured. Mr Marques, who has no previous convictions, has been identified as a 'flight risk' by gardai and the FBI. The High Court heard that large payments had been transferred to accounts in Romania, and his computer's browsing history revealed that he had inquired about Russian visas. His arrest coincided with the disappearance of a vast number of 'hidden services' hosted on anonymous encrypted network Tor. Tor is a popular internet anonymising tool which can be downloaded for free from the web. It enables all members to remain anonymous online and uses an 'onion' system to make sure IP addresses - each computer has its own one - are always hidden from police. It makes identifying the physical location of the computers using the software all but impossible. Tor only protects users from being monitored on applications that are properly configured to send their Internet traffic through the programme unless individuals also use it as a browser instead of Google or Internet Explorer. As well as protecting users from being tracked by police, it also means they are protected from network surveillance and state security known as traffic analysis. This makes interference with the website difficult on morality grounds as it is used by activists trapped in countries with oppressive regimes to communicate without being tracked by governments. Prime examples are human rights groups in China and Iran which would otherwise be censored or even persecuted for expressing their views. A large proportion of Tor's funding comes indirectly from the U.S. state department's internet freedom budget. The website is accessed via a programme called Tor which enables all members to remain anonymous online and uses an 'onion' system to make sure their IP address is always hidden from police. Tor is free software and an open network that makes identifying the physical location of the computers operating the marketplace – or anyone visiting it – all but impossible. It protects internet users against a form of network surveillance and state security known as traffic analysis. They can be used for good - such as activists trapped in oppressive regimes - or bad, with drug dealers selling illegal substances without risk of getting caught. Marques is alleged to be behind Freedom Hosting, a major hidden services hosting provider, Arstechnica reported. Freedom Hosting was one of a number of hosting providers specialising in hidden services. The business — which is in no way connected to the Tor Project — allegedly hosts child pornography sites, as well as sites that allowed pornography traffickers to post their links for distribution, Arstechnica reported. Freedom Hosting was brought to the public's attention in October 2011 after the hacking collective Anonymous shut down the largest host of such illegal material on the Web. In a statement issued on the internet, Anonymous said that it had warned Freedom Hosting to take the sites down but the company failed to do so. Anonymous hackers then disabled its servers and would continue to do so until the material was removed. Its operation began on October 14 and targeted child porn on the ‘darknet’ - anonymised sites designed to protect users' identities, which are invisible to normal web users. Anonymous hackers detected the links to the pornography and removed them but they were up again within five minutes. They then discovered that 95 per cent of the links were being hosted by Freedom Hosting and so shut down the firm’s servers. Freedom Hosting switched to their backups but Anonymous closed them down again.

"By . Aaron Sharp . Thousands of miles of British farmland could be turned into 'bee motorways' in a bid to boost the declining number of pollinating insects in the country. The scheme would see farmers and land owners volunteering their fields toward a 3,000-mile corridor of plush grassland filled with wildflowers which encourage bees and other insects to migrate. Others may receive a grant or bursary for allowing use of their estates. Breeding ground: Patches of grassland, such as the in Balranald RSPB reserve, above, are perfect for pollintors to thrive in. The plan is to encourage migration across the country rather than having certain insects confined to separate patches of the country, as is the case with some species now. It is hoped that the 'bee lines' would also help butterflies, moths and hover flies to spread their wings and breed across Britain. The scheme, which has been strongly backed by the Liberal Democrats, is the brainchild of wildlife charity Buglife. They have already begun recruiting landowners in Yorkshire, where it is estimated that 60,000 acres are needed for pollinating beasts to thrive. The project comes at a time when the honey bee population of the UK is in steep decline. It is believed that there are only half the number of nectar producing insects pollinating in the country now, compared to population figures of 25 years ago. And the decline in bees and other species is not just a worry for insect lovers. Migration: If the plan is successful, it could see not only the honey bee, left, but also butterflies, right, and other pollinating species more widespread in Britain . According to farming experts, around 90 per cent of food and crops in our country are thought to be depend on pollinators. Currently in around 60 per cent of the insects who help plants reproduce are in decline. The causes of this drastic reduction has been put down to factors such as toxic pesticides, habitat loss, disease and intensive agriculture which has meant there is now less wild grassland in which the insects can breed. Matt Shardlow, chief executive of Buglife, who has already presented plans to the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, said losing our insects could mean losing a major part of our source. Support: Climate change secretary Ed Davey, above, is said to be a fan of the bee motorway scheme having previously voiced concerns about the decline in pollinator numbers . Speaking to The Sunday Times, he said: 'If we lose a lot of our pollinator species, we lose a lot of the options for feeding ourselves. The mroe we lose the less likely we are to be able to feed ourselves in an efficient way.' Climate change secretary Ed Davey is said to be behind the initiative, while Baroness Parminter, a leading Lib Dem has also lent her backing. The environment spokeswoman in the House of Lords said: 'The government is putting together a comprehensive strategy for all pollinators, but until we have that, it is important that projects like this are supported.'","Large stretches of grassland could help insects migrate .

"By . Emma Thomas . A widely used anti-clotting pill can double the risk of stroke when patients with a faulty heart rhythm first start taking it, a study has found. Researchers believe warfarin may deactivate two naturally occurring anti-clotting proteins before its blood-thinning effects are felt. After 30 days, the drug halves the risk of stroke. Although only a small number of patients are believed to be at risk, the study authors urged doctors to be vigilant. Study: Researchers believe warfarin may deactivate two naturally occurring anti-clotting proteins (file picture) Warfarin, originally developed as a rat poison, is the most commonly prescribed oral anti-clotting agent in the UK. Scientists carrying out the new research analysed data on 70,766 adult patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF), which occurs when the heart pumps haphazardly instead of with a steady beat. AF leads to blood pooling, thereby increasing the risk of clotting and strokes. Over a 10 year period, 5,519 of the patients suffered a stroke. The study found during the first 30 days of treatment, warfarin increased the risk ischaemic stroke - one caused by the blockage of blood flow to the brain - by 71 per cent. The risk peaked on the third day after starting warfarin, when patients on the drug were more than twice as likely to have a stroke than those not treated with it. Patients with a previous history of ischaemic stroke were 2.5 times more at risk of another stroke during the first month taking warfarin. Stroke: Anti-clotting pill can double the risk of stroke inpatients with faulty heartbeat . Lead researcher Dr Laurent Azoulay, from McGill University in Canada, said: 'There is no question that warfarin is highly effective in preventing strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation. Thus, our finding that the initiation of warfarin may be associated with an increased risk of stroke should not deter physicians and patients from using this drug, since this likely affects a small number of patients. 'Future studies should confirm our results, and identify the small subset of patients who may be at risk. However, the results of our study suggest that physicians should be vigilant when initiating warfarin, particularly in the first week of use.' The findings, published in the European Heart Journal, suggested that patients with 'hypercoagulable' states whose blood clotted easily were most at risk. Warfarin blocks the action of four clotting factors in the blood. But it also deactivates two other proteins, C and S, which are natural anticoagulants. Rapid depletion of protein C in particular might lead to a temporary hypercoagulable state, said the scientists. Co-author Professor Samy Suissa, also from McGill University, said: 'While these findings need to be confirmed in other settings, it would be imperative to also investigate whether the newer popular anticoagulants also carry this early risk.' He suggested offering an injected anti-clotting drug, heparin, to patients starting warfarin treatment to counteract the increased risk of stroke. Heparin is routinely given to hospital patients who have undergone surgery.","Drug may deactivate two naturally occurring anti-clotting proteins .

"By . Suzannah Hills . The price of nutty snacks and treats is set to soar as almond orchard owners struggle to pollinate their crops because of the dwindling honey bee population. Almond nuts and milk are a vital ingredient for confectioners and cereal-makers around the world with the global market worth around $5 billion (approximately Â£3.1 million). Almond orchards in California, which account for 80 per cent of the world's crop, require 1.5 million beehives every year for pollination making honey bees vital to crop production. But almond farmers have seen the price of renting bees hives for pollination triple in the last decade which is having a knock-on effect on the wholesale cost. Rising costs: The cost of nutty treats is set to soar as the price of hiring beehives to pollinate almond orchards, pictured near Williams in California, continues to rise as the bee population declines . It now costs on average $150 (Â£94) to hire a single hive with some farmers to pay up to $200 (Â£125), the Financial Times reports. This has seen the wholesale price of almonds reach an eight year high with the figure expected to continue rising as honey bee populations decrease. As Californian almond prices set a benchmark for the industry, the increasing cost of hiring beehives in America has also had an impact in Europe. Production: Orchards in California, such as the one pictured above in Glenn County, account for 80% of the world's almond production but many farmers are being forced to pay more and more to pollinate their crops . Alpro, one of the top manufacturers of almond milk in Europe, said it was concerned about the impact on prices. The drastic downturn in the honey bee population is also concerning environmentalists and scientists around the world. In the last few years, the annual winter 'die-out' rate has been 10 per cent higher than usual. It has been suggested climate change, pollution, pests or even 'travel stress' from the bees being shipped from pollination site to pollination site being to blame. Mounting concerns: There has been a drastic decline in the honey bee population around the world with the annual winter 'die-out' rate 10% higher than usual .","Almonds are a vital ingredient for confectioners around the world .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Lockheed Martin has unveiled plans for a hypersonic spy plane that could fly at Mach 6, twice as fast as its famed SR-71 Blackbird, and said a missile demonstrating the new technology could fly as early as 2018. Brad Leland, the Lockheed engineer who has headed the seven-year research effort, said the new aircraft, dubbed the SR-72, was designed using off-the-shelf materials to keep it affordable in the current tough budget environment. He said the new plane offered game-changing capabilities to the military - and a twin-engine demonstrator jet that could reach any target in an hour could be developed for under $1 billion in five to six years. The jet accelerates by way of a two-part system. A conventional jet turbine helps boost the aircraft up to Mach 3, at which point a specialized ramjet takes over and pushes the plane even faster into hypersonic mode. Scroll down for video . Flying high: A successor is being developed to the Blackbird spy plane. The SR-72 will use a new hypersonic engine and will be twice as fast with a cruising speed of Mach 6 . In a hurry? The SR-72 will fly at Mach 6 (around 4,000 mph) 'Hypersonic is the new stealth,' Leland said. 'Your adversaries cannot hide or move their critical assets. They will be found. That becomes a game-changer.'The new aircraft would travel three times as fast as current fighter jets, which can reach speeds of Mach 2, twice the speed of sound, and it could be outfitted with light weapons to strike targets. Replacement: The SR-72 supersedes SR-71 Blackbird. For more than 25 years, the aircraft provided the nation with demonstrated strategic reconnaissance capability . SR-71 Blackbird : When the last SR-71 Blackbird was grounded in 1998 it was a double blow. Not only did aviation lose one of the most advanced aircraft ever built, but also one of the most beautiful . When the last SR-71 Blackbird was grounded in 1998 it was a double blow. Not only did aviation lose one of the most advanced aircraft ever built. The SR-71 Blackbird is one of history’s great aircraft. It was built during the Cold War in the early 1960s by Lockheed at its secret Skunk Works facility and flew from 1966 to 1998. With black paint covering its unprecedented titanium fuselage, it was designed as a reconnaissance platform capable of flying 2,900 nautical miles (5,400 km) at sustained supersonic speeds at an altitude of 80,000 ft (24,000 m). The Blackbird could fly so fast and so high that it could literally outrun enemy missiles, and routinely did.. Using a new hypersonic engine design that combines turbines and ramjets, the company says that the unmanned SR-72 will be twice as fast as its predecessor with a cruising speed of Mach 6. Hypersonic: The SR-72¿s purpose is to provide the United States with not only a hypersonic recon platform, but also a strike aircraft as well . How it works: The upper engine is a turbine, which is used to power the SR-72 as it takes off from a conventional runway and accelerates it to Mach 3. Then the lower dual-mode ramjet takes over and accelerates the plane to Mach 6 . The SR-72’s purpose is to provide the United States with not only a hypersonic recon platform, but also a strike aircraft as well. 'Hypersonic aircraft, coupled with hypersonic missiles, could penetrate denied airspace and strike at nearly any location across a continent in less than an hour,' says Brad Leland, Lockheed Martin program manager, Hypersonics. 'Speed is the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next several decades. The technology would be a game-changer in theater, similar to how stealth is changing the battle space today.' In an interview with Aviation Week, which broke the story, Leland explained that the retirement of the SR-71 left significant gaps in the satellites, subsonic manned and unmanned platforms meant to replace it, which the SR-72 will fill. The article went on to point out that the SR-72 program is meant to dovetail with the Pentagon’s hypersonic research and weapons programs, which has dictated the timetable and many design parameters. Bye bye Blackbird: By bye Blackbird: The SR-72 is the replacement for the SR-71 blackbird (pictured). The Blackbird was built during the Cold War in the early 1960s by Lockheed at its secret Skunk Works facility and flew from 1966 to 1998 . According to Leland, a Mach 6 platform would not only leave very little time for an enemy to respond, but it also be a very effective way to launch hypersonic missiles. Since these wouldn't need a booster rocket when launched at six times the speed of sound, they can be of much lighter and simpler construction. No new technologies . needed to be invented for the SR-72 so a demonstration aircraft could . fly by 2018, and the plane could be operational by 2030. Details of the new hypersonic spy plane project emerged days after Lockheed, the Pentagon's biggest supplier, teamed up with No. 2 supplier Boeing Co (BA.N) to develop a bid for the Pentagon's new long-range bomber.Lockheed, Boeing and other big weapons makers are pressing the Pentagon to continue funding new aircraft development programs despite big cuts in military spending, arguing that a retreat from such projects could undercut U.S. military superiority in years to come. Greatly missed: The retirement of the SR-71 Blackbird (pictured) left significant gaps in the satellites, subsonic manned and unmanned platforms meant to replace it, which the SR-72 will fill . Leland, who works for Lockheed's Skunk Works advanced development arm, said missiles based on the new technology could be ready for operational use in 2020, at a cost only slightly more than the current Tomahawk or JASSM missiles.Lockheed declined to say how much it had invested in the SR-72 project to date, or what the new airplane might cost if it is ever built. But it said it had tried to keep the current tight budget environment in mind while working on the project.'What we are doing is defining a missile that would have a small incremental cost to go at hypersonic speed,' Leland said. He said about 20 Lockheed employees had worked on the project.One key factor in keeping the new project affordable was a decision to limit speed to Mach 6, rather than reaching for higher speeds that would require more expensive materials such as those used on the space shuttle, Leland said. He said top Pentagon officials had been briefed on the program's progress and they were very interested in the new technology as a possible way to counter work by potential adversaries on technologies that could detect stealth aircraft.He said the company and its partners had developed and tested key components of the proposed new aircraft using their own internal research funding, but the program needed additional funds to move ahead with larger-scale demonstrations of the technologies involved.Rob Stallard, analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a note on Friday that the new aircraft could help the U.S. military quickly identify or hit targets that were intentionally hidden or protected by an enemy's air defenses. He said the previous SR-71 was ""the coolest airplane ever made, rivaled only by fictional aircraft.""Leland said Lockheed had worked closely with Aerojet Rocketdyne, a unit of GenCorp Inc (GY.N), to develop a propulsion system for the new aircraft, which uses an off-the-shelf turbine with a scramjet engine to reach the hypersonic speeds.The project builds on HTV-3X, an earlier hypersonic project funded by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) that was canceled in 2008 after its turbojet engines were found not ready for further development.","The SR-71 Blackbird flew faster than any other production plane .

Now, if you told us they made people run away from you faster, maybe we would believe it.’ Lucy Danziger, the editor of Self magazine, has apologised after her magazine mocked cancer survivor Monika Allen (pictured right, with her friend, Taramae Baize) for wearing a tutu in a marathon . However, after Ms Danziger realised the mistake, she issued an apology on Twitter saying: ‘@glamrunner apologies from me and @selfmagazine. We applaud you for supporting girls & wish Monika speedy recovery’. The editor wrote on the magazine's Facebook page yesterday: 'On behalf of SELF, we sincerely apologize for our inadvertent insensitivity. 'I . have personally reached out to Monika and her supporters online to . apologize for the misstep and tell them we are trying to remedy the . situation. 'At SELF we support women such as Monika; she is an inspiration and embodies the qualities we admire. We . have donated to her charity and have offered to cover her good work in a . future issue. We wish her all the best on her road to good health.' She also told NBC 7 that an apology had been issued both to Ms Allen, who she described as an ‘inspiration’, and her supporters. Ms Danziger said: ‘In our attempt to be humorous, we were inadvertently insensitive and we deeply apologize.’ Ms Allen's photograph featured under this caption in the BC Meter section of Self magazine . Ms Allen was recently contacted by the magazine asking for permission to use her photograph in the April edition. But she was not told it would appear on the magazine’s ‘BS Meter’, a ‘guide to what’s legit and what’s lame this month’. Ms Allen, who did the run in the middle of chemotherapy, said she was ‘stunned and offended’ by the appearance. 'The reason we were wearing those outfits is because this was my first marathon running with brain cancer,' she told NBC 7. The . tutu was one of 2,000 Ms Allen has made through her company, Glam . Runner, over the last three years. Through the sales, she has donated . $5,600 to the non-profit organisation, Girls On The Run. The . magazine was criticised by a number of readers on its Facebook page, . with some saying they would be cancelling their subscriptions. Although . the attention has led to a lot of interest in Glam Runner's tutus, Ms . Allen has not responded to the magazine's apology, saying that it had . not addressed the most important issue for her - the fact she had been . 'misled' on how her photograph would be used. Ms Danziger told USA Today she was 'personally mortified' by the mistake, adding: 'I had no idea that Monika had been through cancer.'","Self editor Lucy Danziger said she was 'personally mortified' after Monika Allen, a brain cancer survivor, was mocked for wearing the tutu .

"By . James  Nye . The Ivy-League educated half-brother of President Obama is publishing his autobiography in which he makes the shocking claim their father dished out alcohol-fueled beatings to him and his mother and in one terrifying instance held a knife to her throat. Mark Obama Ndesandjo, 48, also uses his new book to set the U.S. president straight on inaccuracies he claims exist in his best-selling 1995 memoir Dreams From My Father and confirms they have never seen eye-to-eye because 'Barack thought I was too white and I thought he was too black.' The self-published book, Cultures: My Odyssey of Self-Discovery, which will be released in February, claims that Barck Obama Sr. consistently battered his wife when they lived in Kenya and details Ndesandjo's journey from the African country to America and finally to China where he now lives with his wife. Revelations: Mark Obama Ndesanjo, U.S. President Barack ObamaÃ­s half-brother, holds his self-published book Cultures: My Odyssey of Self-Discovery during an interview in Hong Kong . Troubled childhood: The President's half brother Mark Obama Ndesandjo as a baby with his mother Stanley Ann Dunham. Mark claims his father once held a knife to her throat . . Mark Obama Ndesandjo, half-brother of US President Barack Obama, launched his new biography entitled 'Cultures', in Guangzhou, China on 19 December. According to publisher Mark Obama Ndesandjo Foundation Ltd, the memoirs narrate the story of a dysfunctional family and his journey of self-discovery across three cultures: Kenyan, American and Chinese.  EPA/Mark Obama Ndesandjo Fd. HO  HANDOUT EDITORIAL USE ONLY/NO SALES . Ndesandjo also recounts his sporadic but intense encounters with his brother over the years and when asked how he would describe his relationship with his brother, he said, 'Right now it's cold and I think part of the reason is because of my writing. My writing has alienated some people in my family.' Even though he felt their relationship was distant, 'I hope that my brother and I can really hug each other after he's president and we can be a family again,' said Ndesandjo, who resembles Obama. Like the president, Ndesandjo also has a white American mother, Ruth Ndesandjo, a Jewish woman who was Barack Obama Sr.'s third wife. Their father died in a car crash in 1982 at age 46 - which is the central theme to Dreams From My Father. In his new book, Ndesandjo recalls alcohol-fueled beatings meted out by his father to his mother. He recounts one incident in which his father held a knife to his mother's throat because she took out a restraining order against him. Accusations of violence: The president's father with Mark's mother. Mark says the President thought he was 'too white' Ndesandjo's book comes four years after his novel, 'Nairobi to Shenzhen: A Novel of Love in the East.' As in his first book, Ndesandjo wanted to raise awareness of domestic abuse by using his family's story . His parents met when Obama Sr. was a graduate student at Harvard University and moved in 1964 to Kenya, where Mark and his brother David were born. David later died in a motorcycle accident. Obama Sr. had earlier divorced President Obama's mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, after Obama was born in Hawaii in 1961. Mark Ndesandjo's mother later divorced the senior Obama and married another man, whose surname both mother and son also took. Ndesandjo and Obama did not grow up together. Ndesandjo was brought up in Kenya but moved to the U.S. for college, earning a bachelor's degree in physics at Brown University, a master's in the same subject from Stanford University and an MBA at Emory University. The book recounts Ndesandjo's first encounter with Obama, who was visiting Kenya in 1988. They did not hit it off. Only visit: Barack Obama Sr. visits the future president in Hawaii in the 1970s for the first and only time before heading back to Kenya and poses right with his one time wife and Barack Obama Jr's mother Stanley Ann Dunham . 'Barack thought I was too white and I thought he was too black,' Ndesandjo said. 'He was an American searching for his African roots. 'I was a Kenyan, I'm an American but I was living in Kenya, searching for my white roots.' President Barack Obama gestures as he speaks to the media as he and first lady Michelle Obama meet with a group of mothers in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Dec. 18, 2013 . The 500-page book includes an appendix listing a number of alleged factual errors in Obama's 1995 memoir, 'Dreams from my Father,' such as quotes incorrectly attributed to Ndesandjo's mother. 'It's a correction. A lot of the stuff that Barack wrote is wrong in that book and I can understand that because to me for him the book was a tool for fashioning an identity and he was using composites,' Ndesandjo said. 'I wanted to bring it up because first of all I wanted the record to be straight. I wanted to tell my own story, not let people tell it for me,' he said. President Obama saw his father only . once after his parents' divorce, when he was 10 years old. In a . best-selling memoir, 'Dreams from My Father,' Obama wrote about his . fatherless upbringing and search for identity. In . it, Obama described a visit to Kenya to meet his half siblings and . learn more about his father. While painting his father as abusive, he . called Obama Sr. a gifted but erratic alcoholic who never lived up to . his intellectual promise or his family responsibilities. Obama, . in his book, also quotes Ndesandjo criticising their father, saying, 'I . knew that he was a drunk and showed no concern for his wife and . children. That was enough.' Ndesandjo said his mother often called Obama Sr. 'a brilliant man but a social failure . He . has lived for 12 years in the southern Chinese boomtown of Shenzhen, . next door to Hong Kong. He moved there to teach English after losing his . job when the U.S. economy cratered following the Sept. 11, 2001, . attacks and now works as a consultant.

"By . Emily Kent Smith . From outside, Simon Edward's home looks like any other flat but close the door and this two bedroom property is covered with murals of scenes from Indiana Jones to Flash Gordon - and they took 13 years to paint. The amateur artist has spent more than 10,000 hours turning his house into a film set: from a toilet which captures the scenery of Venice to a hallway complete with futuristic fittings and 'insectoid' walls, based on the hit 1979 film Alien. The flat, which was built in the 1960s, has been valued at £300,000. Every room in the property is covered with murals - apart from the kitchen because, his wife Jo Edwards 'would have killed me,' Mr Edwards said. As you walk into the flat, this huge mural (left) depicts alien tentacles from the 1979 film Alien. Also in the entrance are these gruesome jaws dripping with saliva . The terrifying scene in the corridor where the walls are painted black and a hand hangs from the ceiling contrasts with the brightly coloured kitchen. The kitchen is the only room not covered in a mural . Simon Edwards imagines he is on an Indiana Jones set as he relaxes in his lounge where even the lamps look like rocks found in the desert. The drawings are so intricate that you can even make out the roots of the trees and the expression on the monkey's face . The murals are incredibly detailed as shown by the texture of the monkey's fur in this picture and the way its hand is clasped around a piece of piece of leaf . The Amazon jungle brought to Mill Hill, London by Simon Edwards. The house has been valued at £300,000 but Mr Edwards has spent just £1,000 on painting materials. The flat is now up for rent. He said: 'You either love it or hate it but it always provokes a reaction. You can probably rule out 95 per cent of people that are looking' Temple of Doom: The lounge mirrors the set of Indiana Jones action films - but there is no painting of Harrison Ford. The walls are covered with Indian statues morphed with statues and temples from Cambodia - also featured in the 1984 Temple of Doom. Even the door is camouflaged . Sunset on the Temple of Doom: The light flickering against the blue sky mirrors the sun beginning to set against the mural. Mr Edwards said: 'Paint doesn't cost much, and painting costs only time. It's been a fantastic journey and so much fun' The amateur artist devoted 13 years to turning the property into a piece of art, he worked on the paintings for a total of 10,000 hours. But now, the flat is up for rent for £1,300 pcm . 'It would have been too much for me to take off all the cabinet doors and sand them down,' he added. The flat in Mill Hill, North West London, is now up for rent - but Mr Edwards admits he may some problems finding tenants for the place he compares to Marmite: 'You either love it or hate it but it always provokes a reaction,' he said. 'You can probably rule out 95 per cent of people that are looking. 'It would have to be someone who likes . art, with a quirky personality, and probably someone who likes travel . and films or just crazy ideas,' he added. Not your average dining room: This is the room where Mr and Mrs Edwards eat dinner. Mr Edwards said that his friends like the murals in the house but he admits that they are 'like Marmite' Simon Edwards stands at the table that he eats at every evening. He has spent years turning the house into a work of art and many of his memories are weaved into the property . The main bedroom is themed around comic strip Flash Gordon. The comic was first created in the 1930s before becoming a hit film in 1980. The walls are covered in characters such as Flash and Hans Zarkov. There are also pictures of Flash and his love interest Dale Arden . This is the room shared by Simon Edwards and his wife Jo. The bedroom walls tell the story of Flash Gordon and even the comic strip captions are written out . From floor to ceiling the bedroom is covered with the key moments from Flash Gordon. Famous quotes include Dale Arden saying: 'Flash! I love you, but we only have 14 hours to save the Earth' Only the bedroom door is not covered with pictures from the action series. Flash Gordon is set on fictional planet Mango Planet. On the ceiling is the colourful galaxy around the planet . The main bedroom, which Mr Edwards shares with his wife, is the 'Flash Gordon room' complete with scenes from the classic comics on all four of the fours. The spare bedroom is decked floor to ceiling in a panorama of London submerged in water - to scale. Even the furniture in the bedroom is aquarium-themed with the handles of the drawer chest made out of metal shells. Entering the lounge is like being transported onto the set of Indiana Jones. Murals depict the Amazon jungle, temples, vines and elaborate trees - but there is no Harrison Ford peeping out from behind. Simon Edwards stands next to the hieroglyphic painting of himself (left). Right is a hieroglyphic of his wife Jo Edwards which is painted in the flat . Hieroglyphics include these comical pictures such as a Pharaoh showering, carved outside the bathroom and another of a toilet, also outside the bathroom. He has also created hieroglyphic images of his friends faces. He said: 'I . have written each of their names in hieroglyphics in the Egyptian . hallway so they love coming over and pointing it out to people' Maze: This is the wacky hallway in Simon Edward's flat which looks like the inside of a pyramid with its sand-coloured paint and intricate carvings into the walls . From outside, the purpose-built 1960s block looks like any normal residential building. In fact, behind its doors is the wacky two-bedroomed flat covered in weird and wonderful artwork . Even when entering the toilet, the room takes you to Venice, the scene of The Talented Mister Ripley. The toilet door has been decorated and turned into a painting of Venice with its canals and terracotta colours. Mr Edwards, a 43-year-old business analyst, has only spent some £1,000 on paint and art supplies for the flat. He said: 'Paint doesn't cost much, and painting costs only time. It's been a fantastic journey and so much fun.' The couple are now moving out of the . flat because Mr Edwards wants to start painting another flat 'all over . again' on a 'blank canvas'. But the artist admits that he will be sad to leave: 'It's a very unusual flat, not to everybody's taste, but I love it. 'If my wife didn't like it I guess she wouldn't be with me. And my friends love it. This stunning doorway looks like a window with a view of a Venice canal. In fact, this is the bathroom door. Venice is the scene of The Talented Mr Ripley . From Venice to underwater London: The scene in the spare bedroom shows London underwater. Buildings such as Big Ben and the London Eye are depicted in detail and everything is located exactly as it would be on a map . Underwater London from the houses of parliament to Big Ben and the river Thames where dolphins, imagined by Simon Edwards, swim through the water . Parts of the wall look like coral reefs where fish are hiding in the blue water. The lighting is also blue-coloured in the spare bedroom . This picture was taken while the mural was still under construction and shows the outlines of London's buildings . 'I . have written each of their names in hieroglyphics in the Egyptian . hallway so they love coming over and pointing it out to people.' Mark Nasab, from Cosway Estate Agents, the company marketing the flat said: . 'I've never seen anything like this before - it's such an incredible property. 'I think I'm safe in saying that there isn't anything else like this in the whole of London. 'People will either love it or hate it - and I don't know if there will be many people out there who will want to rent it. 'But it is a special flat and there will be some tenants who will be fascinated by the art work. 'It will be a challenge to find the right tenant but every house has a buyer, and there is someone to rent every property.' Under construction: These pictures show the flat under construction. Mr Edwards attached wire mesh to the walls to create the tentacles.

"By . William Turvill . The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has claimed the global financial crisis may never have happened had women been in charge of the world’s biggest banks. Christine Lagarde said women have ‘different ways of taking risks’ and make fewer snap decisions than men. In a US radio interview yesterday, she added that women are still hugely under-represented in finance, including the IMF, where she is the only woman in the boardroom. IMF chief Christine LaGarde has revealed how at the beginning of her career she was told by one of France's 'most reputable' firms that she would never be made a partner because of her gender . Asked if the crash could have been . avoided if Lehman Brothers – the investment bank which collapsed in 2008 . sparking the financial crisis – had been run by women, she said: ‘I do . believe women have different ways of taking risks ... of ruminating a . bit more before they jump to conclusions. ‘I think that as a result, particularly on the trading floor ... the approach would be different.’ Ms Lagarde also revealed how at the beginning of her career . she was told by one of France’s ‘most reputable’ firms that she would . never be made a partner because of her gender. She was told by the unnamed firm that she would be taken on, but should not ‘ever expect to make partnership’. When told this was ‘because you’re a woman’, she declined to take the job and found work elsewhere. Speaking to NPR, Ms LaGarde said that when she was a ‘baby lawyer’ applying for the best firms, one told her: ‘We’ll take you any time. You can join us tomorrow and be an associate, be given great tasks and great files and great clients to work on, but don’t ever expect to make partnership.’ She also talked about the IMF executive board, which has 24 men representing 188 countries on it. Ms Lagarde said that she was interviewed by 24 men and no women for her role at the firm because the only female director – who is soon to leave IMF and be replaced by another man – was away. ‘I can't do anything about it except talk about it — and complain about it when I talk about it — because those people are actually appointed by the various countries around the world that comprise the membership of the IMF,’ she said. ‘And it's very unfortunate because, not that these men are incompetent — they're very competent — but diversity is a richness and we're not having the benefit of that.’ Ms Lagarde was speaking shortly after . the release of an IMF study which found that half the women in the world . are not working, and that women are overexploited in work. Ms LaGarde was speaking shortly after the release of an IMF study which found that half the women in the world are not working, and that women are overexploited in work (stock picture) In the interview, she also highlighted the fact that the number of women in IMF management has doubled in the last ten years – although, she said, it is still ‘much too low’. Ms Lagarde said it was her intention to help build the number of women in middle management or upper-middle management at the firm, adding: ‘Where I perceive my role as making a difference is when I can encourage other women. ‘If I'm the single voice constantly in a room full of men, it's only going to carry the organization so far.’","Ms Lagarde said women had 'different ways of taking risks' than men .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Booked: San Francisco 49ers cornerback Christopher Culliver, who was arrested Friday March 28, 2014 on suspicion of felony hit and run and reckless driving . San Francisco 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver was tossed in jail Friday after hitting a bicyclist with his car, fleeing the scene and threatening witnesses with brass knuckles, police said. Culliver, 25, was charged with felony hit and run, reckless driving and weapons possession for the Friday morning incident in San Jose. This is not the first brush with controversy for the maligned defender, he claimed during the build-up to last year’s Super Bowl that gay players were ‘not welcome’ in NFL locker rooms – he later apologized for the remarks. Culliver was recklessly driving his Ford Mustang through an intersection just after 10.00am when he struck a pedestrian on a bicycle, police sources told SF Gate. Another motorist drove after the three year veteran and cornered him while waiting for police to arrive, said police. A police report cited by the site says Culliver then got out of his car to threaten the driver using a pair of brass knuckles. Police found the brass knuckles while searching Culliver’s car, they also discovered he was driving on a suspended license, according to KPIX. The bicyclist suffered only minor injuries, according to SF Gate. Where it happened: The San Jose intersection where police say Culliver slammed into a bicyclist before fleeing the scene . Reckless: Skid marks show where Culliver reportedly hit the bicycle rider, police said the football player was driving recklessly when the incident occured . Culliver missed all of the 2013 season after tearing his ACL during summer training camp, he had been slated to take over as one of two starting cornerbacks upon his return this year. It is not clear how this incident will affect those plans, but the 49ers released the following statement regarding this morning’s incident. ‘The 49ers organization is aware of the recent matter involving Chris Culliver. We will remain in contact with Chris and the local authorities as we continue to gather the facts regarding this situation. As this is an ongoing legal matter, we will reserve further comment at this time.’ Tainted moment: Chris Culliver, #29 of the San Francisco 49ers, watches Jacoby Jones of the Baltimore Ravens catch a 56-yard pass before running in for the touchdown during Super Bowl XLVII - the 49ers' appearance in the championship was tainted by Culliver's derogatory remarks towards gays . Culliver first drew national attention after telling comedian Artie Lang that gays were not welcome in NFL locker rooms and that they should ‘come out 10 years later.’ He made the comments only days before the 2013 Super Bowl, which the 49ers lost to the Baltimore Ravens. He apologized within hours of the remarks. ‘The derogatory comments I made yesterday were a reflection of thoughts in my head, but they are not how I feel,’ he said in a prepared statement published by KPIX. ‘It has taken me seeing them in print to realize that they are hurtful and ugly,’ he continued. ‘Those discriminating feelings are truly not in my heart. ‘I apologize to those who I have hurt and offended.’ Culliver was booked into Santa Clara County Jail, he remains behind bars as of Friday evening.","Chris Culliver faces multiple felony counts after police say he struck a bicyclist a fled the scene .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Yoko Ono is a regular on Twitter, using it as a platform to share such gems as 'Remember, we are all water in the same ocean'. And while her 4.7million followers may smile wryly at her more mystical offerings, one, in particular, is driven mad by them. Tennis coach Judy Murray has taken to mocking John Lennon's widow on Twitter, retweeting her thoughts and adding jokes of her own. Barely a day goes past on the social network without the mother of Wimbledon champion Andy Murray making a jokey comeback to the 81-year-old New Yorker. Musings: Yoko Ono's mystical messages on Twitter are relentlessly mocked by tennis coach, Judy Murray . Not impressed: Judy Murray, 54, replies in typical fashion to one of the New Yorker's messages on Twitter . 'Give us peace springs to mind': Murray seems unmoved by the pacifist's thoughtful messages of peace . Not smiliing: Murray, who is from Dunblane, has no truck for another of Ono's more spiritual pronouncements . Earlier this week, Ono posted on Twitter: 'Clean up the water inside your body.  Let's be the oasis for the world. 'Even if you don't announce it, it will be felt by the whole world'. Murray, 54, was clearly at the end of her tether when she replied: 'Face. Palm'. Hours before, Ono had tweeted: 'Think PEACE, Act PEACE, Spread PEACE and tell your friends to IMAGINE PEACE'. To which Murray, from Dunblane, replied: 'Mmm.  Give us PEACE springs to mind'. When Ono tweeted: 'Send a friend a photo that says ""Smile"" or a picture, a story or a piece of pie, but specify it's a smile ur passing on', Murray tweeted back: 'Yes dear'. Taunting: The mother of Wimbledon tennis champion, Andy Murray, finds Ono's tricks don't work for her . 'What is beauty?' Murray's tweets demonstrate not only a sharp sense of humour but also a surprising love of cakes . 'Course we will': The Scotswoman and mother of two has little patience for Ono's most unlikely suggestions . And when Ono wrote: 'Attach a card saying SPACE TRANSFORMER to the room and/or object you wish to transform', Murray replied: 'Did it....nothing happened.  What now?' Ono, mother of Kyoko Chan Cox by her first husband, Anthony Cox, and of Sean Lennon by the Beatle, has not yet replied to the taunts by the Scotswoman. Indeed, she seems to derive great comfort from Twitter, tweeting recently: 'A big hug + kiss to each one of you.  I feel privileged to share this time with you. 'Thank you for being in my life.' Murray, who has 94,500 followers on Twitter, replied: 'Ur welcome.' Her tweets demonstrate a humour many of had not suspected the mother of the steely-jawed tennis star possessed. Running out of patience: The New Yorker comes up with ideas of how her followers can explore spirituality . Not on the same wavelength: Ono's more philosophical musings are not enjoyed by the dour Judy Murray . Thoughts for the day: Ono tweeted these two suggestions for her 4.68million followers earlier this month . When Ono wrote: 'This is a piece of sky.  Hold on to it. After 10 years we will get together and put the sky back into one piece', Murray immediately retorted: 'Course we will.' But she isn't always so charitable. In response to Ono's suggestion: 'Get a telephone that only echoes back your voice.  Call every day and talk about many things', Murray wrote: 'First sign of madness'. And when Ono wrote: 'I think it's impossible to see a chair as it it', an impatient Murray replied: 'Four legs, a seat and a back rest.  What's not to see?' Good idea: Ono, who is 81, also tweets photographs of herself overlooking the sea or lakes . Let it be: The widow of John Lennon is an enthusiastic tweeter, often sharing messages of peace online . Ono has two children; Kyoko Chan Cox from her first marriage, and Sean Lennon by Beatle John Lennon . A very few Ono musings go unremarked, such as: 'Make a sculpture to put on a mountain for people to see with telescopes.' Another tweet the tennis coach may have missed was: 'Next time you meet a foreigner, remember it's only like a window with a different shape to it and the person who's sitting inside is you.' While Ono has yet to reply to Murray, her enthusiasm for Twitter continues unabated.  Already this week she has reminded her followers that it was Mother's Day in Slovenia, and encouraged them to 'be playful - dance with your mind and body'. It is likely that at least one of her followers won't be taking her up on it. No-nonsense: Straight-talking Judy is widely credited as being a driving force behind her son's tennis success .","Judy Murray, 54, often mocks Twitter messages posted by Yoko Ono, 81 .

"By . Sam Creighton . One family of troublemakers has cost taxpayers more than £250,000 in efforts to help them change their ways. The unnamed family from Havering, east London, has received advice on a number of areas, including parenting and debt management, over the last two years as part of the government's Troubled Families scheme - all paid for out of the public purse. A street in Havering, the London borough where the family who have received £250,000 are reported to live . A spokeswoman for Havering Council confirmed that the family are still on the scheme, meaning their issues are still not resolved. The family, which is believed to have several children, has sucked in £100,000 more than the average household on the scheme and more than three times the £72,696 a normal law abiding UK family can expect to earn during the same two-year period. The scheme, introduced after the 2011 riots, aims at getting households struggling with drug, crime and behavioural issues back on the straight and narrow but can, so far, only boast a nine per cent success rate. Jonathan Isaby, the chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, told the Daily Mirror: 'Those that cannot change their ways should not be entitled to limitless support at the expense of their law-abiding neighbours.' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the programme was saving the taxpayer money by reducing the level of crime.","Family from has received advice on parenting and debt management .

"By . Matt Blake . Swimsuit designer Sylvie Cachay sent a furious and expletive-laden email to her boyfriend hours before her death in which she accused him of cheating of her, ranting: 'You will f***ing pay... have fun in jail.' The 33-year-old brunette sent the explosive message to Nicholas Brooks on December 8 2010, 18 hours before her body was found semi-naked in an overflowing hotel-room bath, Manhattan prosecutors revealed today. Brooks has been charged with strangling and drowning her to death at New York's upscale Soho House, where she spent her final hours, and is awaiting trial. Bearing the subject line, F*** you, the email read: 'For the past six months I have supported you financially and emotionally. The fact that u cheated on me makes me sick and you will f***ing pay. Brutally murdered: Sylvie Cachay, 33, was found strangled in a bathtub at the Soho Hotel in Manhattan on December 9, 2010 . 'I am speaking with the credit card company and the police and I am going to tell them that I never allowed you to use my card. I don’t care. Have fun in jail.' Prosecutors claim the email demonstrates that Brooks had motive to commit murder in pre-trial notes handed to New York's District Attorney, the New York Post reported. The notes add: 'His meal ticket for expensive dinners, home delivery of marijuana . and $300-$400 weekly allowance was about to be cut off.' They are attepting to paint Brooks as a gold-digging layabout who was hooked on marajuana and had a violent - and deadly - temper. They allege he told one of Cachay's male friends at the Soho House bar four months before her death: 'Are you trying to f*** my girlfriend in the bathroom? Party lifestyle: Brooks is on trial for the murder of his girlfriend at the trendy hotel in the Meatpacking District in 2010 . 'You don’t know who I am? I will slit your throat.' The revelations come days after a forensic pathologist revealed Cachay had a cocktail of drugs in her system that could have contributed to her tragic death in the bathtub. Cachay's boyfriend, Nicholas Brooks, has been charged with strangling and drowning her to death at the upscale Soho House. But . in a pretrial hearing in Manhattan Supreme Court on Wednesday, forensic . pathologist Gerard Catanese revealed evidence that would support . Brooks' innocence. He said there were anti-depressants, sedatives and . muscle relaxers in Cachay's system at the time of her death. 'That combination of drugs could . account for her falling asleep, losing consciousness, passing out and . sinking under the water and ultimately dying,' he said, according to the New York Daily News. Cachay, 33, was found half-clothed and face up in a bathtub at the Soho House hotel at 3 a.m. on December 9, 2010. In the hours after Miss Cachay was . found, Brooks, 27,  gave several statements to New York police that . could be used against him in court. He . told police that he had had left his girlfriend at the hotel to go out . drinking the night of her death and that she was sleeping - not taking a . bath - when he left. Several . minutes after he was seen leaving on the hotel's surveillance cameras, . guests began to complain about water leaking through the ceiling from . the couple's room upstairs. It . is unclear whether other statements he made after he was arrested - . including asking an officer 'How much could I get for something like . this' - will be allowed at trial. Miss . Cachay's mother Sylvia told the Post: 'We realize we are going to see . justice, and I am sure New York justice is going to be in our favor.' Miss Cachay, whose designs have been worn by a string of celebrities, was known to have a volatile relationship with Brooks, who was 25 at the time of her death. According to investigators, she had red marks around her neck and a bite mark on her hand when her body was found. It was later discovered that on the eve of her tragic death, Miss . Cachay sent a message to Brooks with 'F*** . you' written in the title field. Awaiting trial: Nicholas Brooks, 27, the son of Oscar-winning composer Joseph Brooks, stands trial accused of murder . Beauty: Sylvie Cachay had a successful career as a designer and led a glamorous life in Manhattan when she was brutally killed . The expletive-laden email accused Brooks of stealing from her credit card and threatening to go to police, it has been claimed. Brooks is the son of late Oscar-winning composer and alleged sex attacker Joseph Brooks. 'The subject line was ""F*** you,"" and it said she was going to the police, and that’s relevant,' prosecutor Jordan Arnold told a court as he argued that the District Attorney did nothing wrong in plundering Brooks' email account for clues. Justice . Wittner agreed that it would be in the public interest to . disclose the contents of his emails to a jury. But Brooks' defence lawyer Jeffrey Hoffman told the New York Post that the . email is inadmissible, adding: 'This is nothing more than a given . feeling at a given moment that was different two moments before and two . moments after.' Grim find: Sylvie Cachay's body is removed from Soho House hotel after its discovery in December 2010 . Celebrated designer: Miss Cahchay's designs have been worn by a string of celebrities . On the night of her death, Miss Cachay and Brooks checked . into the hotel after a fire in her apartment. Police allege Brooks left . her there to die while he went to party. Ms Cachay lived in an apartment in Manhattan's West Village and had a membership at the Soho House, an elite club and hotel that has hosted such stars as Nicole Kidman, Victoria Beckham and Naomi Watts. She made swimsuits for Victoria’s Secret, Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs and Syla, her own label. Brooks’ father, Joseph, who won an Oscar for the 1977 hit 'You Light Up My Life,' committed suicide in 2011 amid multiple charges of sexual assault. Plush: Soho House Hotel is one of New York's most exclusive members' clubs known for its lavish bedrooms . He was charged with 91 counts of rape, sexual abuse, criminal sexual acts, assault, and other crimes. However, he committed suicide before his case or his son's could go to trial. The elder Brooks left no money to his children and was nearly broke when he died, the New York Post reported. It's unclear whether the proceeds of his biggest hit, which still rakes in royalties, will go to his son. Brooks is facing 25 years to life in prison, if convicted.","Sylvie Cachay, 33, found face up in bath at the Soho House hotel in 2011 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An insurance executive has been found guilty of DUI manslaughter in the gory 2010 death of 22-year-old Miami Heat dancer Nancy Lopez-Ruiz. Mario Careaga, 46, of Fort Lauderdale, was immediately taken into custody Thursday after the ruling by Broward Circuit Judge Ilona M. Holmes. He is scheduled for sentencing on May 5, and faces between four and 15 years in prison. Lopez-Ruiz's family sobbed in court Wednesday, after the all-male jury delivered its guilty verdict following 10 hours of deliberations. However, that decision as immediately questioned after an alternate juror, who had been dismissed from the case, accused another juror of exhibiting an anti-gay bias during the trial. Guilty: Mario Careaga, 46, of Fort Lauderdale, pictured right on Thursday, was found guilty of DUI manslaughter in the gory 2010 death of a 22-year-old Miami Heat dancer . Carrega is gay and his partner of 20 years, Ray Stapleton, gave testimony. On Thursday, Stapleton urged the public Thursday to continue praying for the victim's family. 'They're good people,' he said, according to the Sun Sentinel. Careaga crashed his Mercedes into the victim who had stopped her motorcycle on the side of the road in Fort Lauderdale at 9:38 p.m. on September 10, 2010, sending her flying more than 130 feet into the air. One juror was accused of mocking the Cargeaga's voice as he testified and using an expletive to describe Bogenschutz. The alternate juror told defense lawyer David Bogenschutz Tuesday he thought this could affect the outcome of the trial. Bogenschutz brought the allegations to Judge Holmes on Tuesday afternoon. The Sentinel reported that after Wednesday's verdict, Holmes spoke with each juror individually to ask whether they heard or said anything disparaging about gays - non of them had. Justice: Nancy Lopez-Ruiz' mother, Adela, pictured Thursday, said she feels justice has been served . Relieved: The dancer's family were relieved with the verdict . The juror denied both accusations, instead saying he had been clearing his throat during Careaga's testimony. Nevertheless, the judge decided to hold off on formally entering the jury's verdict until Thursday morning. But in the end she decided against declaring a mistrial and upheld the verdict. Clutched a figurine of an angel she'd received from her daughter, the victim's mother, Adela Lopez-Ruiz, talked of her relief. 'Justice came for Nancy,' she said, according to the Sentinel. 'We trust the justice system, and we are pleased that justice was served.' She has been a vocal opponent to drink driving since her daughter's death. At the beginning of the trial, Adela sobbed as she told reporters, 'I have no words to express the pain' of losing her daughter. The beautiful 22-year-old was killed after she pulled over her Suzuki sport motorcycle on the side of the road and Careaga crossed three lanes of traffic in his white 2009 Mercedes-Benz, slamming into her. Tragic: Miami Heat cheerleader Nancy Lopez-Ruiz, pictured left and right, was thrown 137 feet to her death . Scene: The 22-year-old was killed on September 10, 2010 after she pulled over her Suzuki sport motorcycle, pictured left, and Careaga allegedly crossed three lanes of traffic in his white 2009 Mercedes-Benz, right, hitting her . She was pronounced dead at the scene. 'For a mother, for a father, yes, it is very, very hard,' Adela Lopez told wsvn.com. 'It's in the hands of the people who serve justice. We are anticipating that justice will be served.' Her father, Armando, added that seeing his daughter's alleged killer for the first time was 'very hard.' The . cheerleader grew up in the Bradenton area and was a college student . living in Plantation when she tried out and won a spot as a Miami Heat . dancer. She was supposed to start performing publicly in October 2010. On the night of the deadly crash she was reportedly coming home from practice. Meanwhile, Careaga, a wealthy insurance executive, was spotted at an event at a nearby mall shopping for jewellery with a glass of champagne in his hand just one hour before the collision. According to police, his blood alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit, at .23 and .24 percent. According to responding police, he was 'swaying from side to side and in a circular motion.' They also said he had 'bloodshot, . glassy eyes, slurred speech, the odor of alcoholic beverages coming from . his person, unsteady balance and difficulty supporting himself.' A video of the crash was shown to jurors. In court on during the trial, Careago looked uncomfortable. He has been free on bond as he awaited his trial, which has faced repeated delays.

"By . Louise Boyle In Darrington, Washington . A mother's petty argument with her young daughter caused her to miss the devastating mudslide, which crashed through the town of Oso, Washington, by mere minutes on Saturday. Angela Durant, 40, who lives in Darrington, was heading to work at the Trafton General Store in Arlington but was 15 minutes late because she was bickering with her nine-year-old, Sarah. Those precious minutes saved Ms Durant's life. Her journey to work along Highway 530 was cut short Saturday by what she first thought was a logging truck up ahead, turned sideways and blocking the road. Good Samaritan: Angela Durant poses for a portrait at the rodeo grounds in Darrington, Washington, where she helps other volunteers care for animals that were displaced by the mudslide that occurred in Oso; Durant was among the first to call 911 . First look: Angela Durant, from Darrington, Washington, took this picture of Highway 530, moments after the wall of mud crashed through the town of Oso Saturday, destroying everything in its wake . Lucky to be alive: Drivers who were traveling on the road but missed the slide by minutes look on as a first responder climbs on to the roof of a home to check for signs of life . As she climbed from her car to take a closer look, she realized it was tree trunks piled high that had been swept down the mountainside in a sea of mud - and the roof of someone's home was just visible alongside. The mother of two told MailOnline today: 'My daughter saved my life. She is the reason that I was not there when that slide hit.' Ms Durant was one of the first on the scene, and from the other side of the rushing mud, water and debris, she could see an elderly man around 200 feet away, standing by his truck and waving his arms in the air, shouting words to her that she could not hear. She said: 'I pulled out my cell phone and there was no network, the only number I could call was 911. I told them they had to come, that a man was trapped on the other side, and that there could be other people trapped underneath the mud. Marker: This mailbox on the right was left standing amid the mudslide debris on Seapost Road. Angela Durant gave the number when she called 911, allowing emergency crews to reach the site in three minutes . The rodeo grounds in Darrington is taking care of animals that were displaced or in need of care . â€˜It just seemed like the wall of the mountain had come down and the noise was like a powerful, slamming wind. 'Around 10-15 cars pulled up behind me and people got out to look at what had happened. We were trying to be quiet to listen for people calling out but there was no one.' Ms Durant gave the first responders the number of a mailbox - 294925B - which was the only thing left standing in the debris to help them locate the disaster site. She said that within three minutes, the emergency teams were there. 'I saw what used to be a pump house float by, the roofs of people's homes, a garbage can. There was smoke coming from the pump house; I was worried that it was going to explode while the rescuers were searching.' Roughing it: Mikel Cook smokes after waking up from sleeping in his car for the second night while volunteering his time and services to the community of Darrington and to the rescue workers at the site of the mudslide . Pulling together: Rescue workers in Darrington prepare to head to the site of the slide Thursday . Doing his part: Tom Gent volunteers and coordinates donations of pet food, supplies, and animal feed for animals affected by the natural disaster . Ms Durant said that on Highway 530 where the road should have dipped ahead of her, it was completely leveled. 'I cannot wrap my head around what's happened,' she said. Ms Durant, who also has a 16-year-old daughter, Lizzy, was born in Southport, Seattle, but has lived in Darrington for 30 years. 'I've left a couple of times,' she said. 'But something makes me come back - it's the way that people treat each other here. And those mountains.' Ms Durant was helping out alongside Tom and Diana Gent at the Darrington Rodeo. The couple have established a place where rescued animals can be cared for and local residents can pick up dog and cat food, and hay for horses. Heavy duty: Workers use an excavator to move a vehicle as search work continues in the mud and debris . A sign outside a fire station in Oso, Wash., thanks people for support in the wake of the deadly mudslide, that claimed the lives of at least 25 people . Four search and rescue workers wade through water covering Washington Highway 530 Thursday as heavy equipment moves trees and other debris in the background . A few horses were already being cared for on the grounds Thursday. Mr Gent, who works full-time at Monroe prison, volunteered to set up the valuable service for Darrington. He said: 'We do what we can; every day is a learning experience. Everyone knows their neighbors in this town, itâ€™s tightknit, so you do what you can to help.â€™ . Mrs Gent added: 'I can't get out on the slide, but helping with the animals is something I can do.' Sixteen bodies have been recovered, but officials say at least nine more had been found as of Wednesday night. The medical examiner's office has so far formally identified only a single victim, 45-year-old Christina Jefferds. Family members have confirmed a handful of other fatalities to news organizations. The main goal now is to find more bodies and winnow the list of the 90 people who are still missing in the mudslide that buried the community of Oso on Saturday.","Angela Durant, 40, was 15 minutes late to work Saturday because of argument with her daughter .

"By . Hugo Gye . Parties: Max Clifford, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court today, has admitted organising 'good honest filth' during the 1960s . Max Clifford threw 'legendary sex parties' where people would go for 'good honest filth', a court heard today. The PR guru was the 'ringmaster' at the events, but he insisted that he did not participate in the sex because he was in a relationship at the time. Giving evidence at Southwark Crown Court, Clifford angrily denied sleeping with Diana Ross as he called the sex abuse allegations against him 'a pack of lies'. The 70-year-old has pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of indecent assault against seven teenage girls, who claim he attacked them between 1966 and 1984. Today the court heard how Clifford had organised 'legendary sex parties' and 'blue movie' nights during the early 1960s, when he was working as a journalist. He also said he had 'thoroughly enjoyed' sex parties hosted by film star Diana Dors. Clifford described the parties as 'good honest filth for adults old enough to know what are doing, having a good time', and added: 'Sometimes when you are a star it's difficult to have the same kind of fun as other people.' But he denied taking part himself, saying: 'I was involved in organising good honest filth but that doesn't mean I had to stand there and take part. 'I was with my partner, I was quite happy with that. Sometimes there was sex, sometimes there wasn't - to call them sex parties obviously sells.' He insisted he didn't personally call the parties 'legendary', adding: 'There are sex parties going on all over London all the time, that doesn't make them legendary'. When it was put to him that he was the 'ringmaster' of the sex parties, he replied: 'It's a role I like to have in many aspects of my life.' Clifford conceded he 'liked to be in control' but denied 'grooming' or 'manipulating beautiful and randy girls' for 'pleasure and a laugh'. Earlier he appeared agitated during cross-examination by prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC, and described his experience of being in court as 'horrible'. He told jurors: 'I have had heard more conversations about my penis in the last three weeks than I have in the last 70 years. It's all totally untrue'. Referring to claims he told a 17-year-old aspiring fashion model he slept with soul star Diana Ross, Clifford said: 'She actually said I claimed to have had sex with Diana Ross, nonsense. 'Because I had a photograph of Diana Ross justifies her claiming that I had sex with Diana Ross. There is also a picture of Frank Sinatra - what are you suggesting, that I had sex with him as well?' He moaned about having to sit in the glass-enclosed dock 'for three weeks and listen to a pack of lies' while the prosecution presented its case to the jury. Evidence: Clifford was being cross-examined in court by prosecuting barrister Rosina Cottage QC . Anger: The veteran PR man described the allegations against him as 'a pack of lies' Speaking about claim he abused a girl in a jacuzzi, the defendant said: 'I knew she was lying through her teeth. As far as I was concerned a liar is a liar is a liar. 'She told a pack of lies then the next one went on to tell a pack of lies.' Clifford denied adopting voices including Bond supremo Cubby Broccoli, Hollywood heavyweight Aaron Spelling and Western star Charles Bronson to 'play games for his own sexual fun and pleasure'. 'These are all people that I would assume have very distinctive accents,' he said, insisting he only put on an effeminate voice to 'catch people out'. The court heard that Clifford had a string of affairs, but he denied the suggestion that he had told his daughter Louise to keep them secret from his wife. 'Most of my friends were having affairs themselves', he said. 'My daughter knew and if she wanted to tell my wife, she could have done. She is very much her own person. 'I would have said, ""You know I love your mum and I would never leave her, but I'm greedy.""' Accusation: Clifford is charged with 11 counts of indecent assault against seven girls and young women . When Ms Cottage suggested Louise had to lie for him to cover up his flings, he responded: 'She was a very responsible young lady but she didn't need to lie for me. 'If she decided she wanted to tell my wife then she could have. I didn't say that makes it all right but that's what happened.' Ms Cottage told Clifford: 'You knew and always knew her loyalty would be with you.' He replied: 'No, that loyalty was to both of us. She was totally devoted to her mother as well. 'It was the kind of relationship you have when you have been through all she had all these years. My daughter loved and trusted me and I loved and trusted her. 'I'm very proud of my relationship with my daughter and proud of the woman she has become. I have never, ever expected her to lie.' Claim: He denied sleeping with soul singer Diana Ross, pictured in 2007 . Clifford suggested that his accusers had invented their stories in order to make money by exploiting his fame. 'Because of who I am and where I am I have had calls from hundreds of people, both men and women, about stories they have fabricated,' he said. 'When the Savile scandal broke we had dozens of people calling about stories, some of whom were obviously lying but some wanted money. It happens - it happens an awful lot.' Clifford dismissed suggestions he abused a 14-year-old he met at a Wimpy bar in 1966 - telling jurors he didn't like food from the burger joint. He also rebuffed the school girl's claims that the attack took place in a car - insisting he could not drive at the time. 'It's absolute rubbish, a fairy story that only you believe', he told Ms Cottage. The lawyer said: 'You had only one thing on your mind, to have your sexual way with her, as you did again and again and again.' He replied: 'No, you are wrong, you are totally wrong. Why on earth would a girl get in a car with a total stranger that is repulsive and nerdy? It's totally ridiculous'. When it was suggested that Clifford's wife and mistresses would have been angry to discover him molesting young girls in his office, he replied: 'It didn't happen, so it wasn't a problem'. Clifford will continue giving evidence when the trial resumes on Monday.

"By . John Hall . Dredging equipment has finally been installed on the Somerset Levels - three months after the heaviest January rainfall in 250 years forced thousands of people to flee their homes. Thanks to enormous water pumps from the Netherlands removing millions of tonnes of water from the land, large sections of the Somerset Levels are now dry, allowing for long-awaited dredging to begin on silt-laden rivers in the area. The dredging is part of a £5.8million plan to clear a five mile stretch of the nearby Tone and Parrett rivers, with the project due to get underway on Monday - just a day before a deadline imposed by David Cameron in the middle of February. At last: Thanks to enormous water pumps from the Netherlands removing millions of tonnes of water from the land, large sections of the Somerset Levels are now dry, allowing for long-awaited dredging to begin on silt-laden rivers in the area . Plans: The dredging project will see tonnes of sediment removed from the rivers Tone and Parrett. The material has been building up since clearing stopped 18 years ago . Before: This photograph was taken on the Somerset Levels in January and shows huge expanses of land under several feet of water . And after: The same area seen three months later. Millions of tonnes of water have been removed by enormous water pumps brought over from the Netherlands . The dredging project will see engineers remove tonnes of sediment from the rivers, which has built up since clearing stopped 18 years ago. It is hoped removing the sediment will increase the capacity of the rivers, which have been operating at just 60 per cent in places, and reduce the risk of them overflowing during the next period of heavy rainfall. The dredging comes as farmers who evacuated the area in January finally started to move their cattle back on to rain-damaged fields. The initial dredging is just the start of a £100million plan which was put together by locals in the hope of ensuring their homes are never flooded again.

The dredging comes as farmers who evacuated the area finally start to move their cattle back on to rain-damaged fields . Underway: The dredging will start at a crucial point of the River Tone, where two and a half miles will be cleared before workmen move on to the River Parrett . Speaking ahead of the dredging, Sedgemoor District Council chief executive Kerry Rickards said: 'When the waters recede and the media spotlight moves on to something else, it's very easy to get moved on to the next challenge.' 'However we will keep chasing for money to prevent prolonged flooding. We will not stand by and run the risk of more floods when we have spells of prolonged rain.' In February Prime Minister David Cameron promised that work to clear the river beds would begin by the end of March. Work will start at a crucial point of the River Tone, where two and a half miles will be cleared before workmen move on to an equal stretch of the Parrett. The full 20-year dredging plan includes improvements to the upper river areas that drains into the Levels, and a water gate across the Parrett near Bridgwater .

This Somerset Levels home become a symbol of the January floods when its owner - builder Sam Notaro - refused to abandon the property despite it being completely surrounded by water. He created makeshift defences from building material he had on site . Dubbed King Canute's castle, the property managed to escape the extensive flooding thanks to a seven-foot high mud dam. This is how the four-bedroom home in Moorland, Somerset looks today . In February David Cameron promised that work to clear the river beds would begin by the end of March. It will finally get underway on Monday - just one day before the Prime Minister's deadline . The full 20-year plan includes improvements to the upper river areas that drains into the Levels, and a water gate across the Parrett near Bridgwater to prevent tidal surges. The work begins as farmers start to rebuild their livelihoods which were decimated by the waters. Farmer James Winslade, 40, this week returned some of his 550 cows to his farm in West Yeo, Bridgwater. They had been scattered all over Somerset after all 790 acres of his farm went underwater and he lost 10,800 bales of hay and straw, and countless farm machines. He said: 'It will be a relief to get them back, it will make life so much easier. i can get some feed in and I won't have to take it back and forth.'","The rivers Tone and Parrett can now be cleared of sediment, which has dramatically reduced their capacity .

The Authority for Television on Demand, said laws should be changed to protect children from seeing adult material on the internet . Research for Atvod found that 6 per cent of children aged 15 or under had accessed an adult website over the course of a month, the BBC reported. Some 5 per cent of visitors to adult sites were under 18, and one website alone, Pornhub, was visited by 112,000 boys in the UK aged between 12 and 17. The figures support the Daily Mail’s Block Online Porn campaign that wants internet service  providers to automatically block adult content unless a household opts in to accepting it. The statistics were uncovered after the online habits of 45,000 desktop computers and laptop users were monitored over a month, with volunteers reflecting a cross-section of the population. The issue of children accessing online pornography was so urgent that it was ‘critical the legislation is enacted during this Parliament’, Atvod said. Atvod already forces pornographic websites based in the UK to carry out age verification checks before customers can view explicit photographs or video . It called for sites that did not comply with legislation to carry out age checks should be forbidden from processing payments from British customers. Atvod already forces pornographic websites based in the UK to carry out age verification checks before customers can view explicit photographs or video, the BBC said, by requiring valid credit card details or personal information that can be checked. But it said the vast majority of online pornography was downloaded from overseas businesses, over which it has no control. Atvod wants all adults sites to request a licence that would only be granted if age checks were in place, with payment processors not allowed to handle fees for for services from UK citizens to unregistered sites. Atvod chief executive Pete Johnson told the BBC: ‘We're a very substantial market and to access the money that's flowing from the UK would be quite a powerful incentive to introduce restrictions.’ An Atvod spokesman added: ‘The material that appears on the free services is placed there by the paid services to attract customers to sign up to subscriptions. ‘As long as the paid service placed content on a free service without age verification it would be in breach of its licensing conditions and so would not be able to access funds from the UK. ‘We're not saying this will stop all children seeing all pornography online. ‘But our argument is that even if you reduce the number of children who are accessing hardcore pornography online by 10 per cent, that would be a significant win.’","Online video regulator Atvod calls for urgent change to the law .

"By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 09:47 EST, 24 October 2011 . Televisions, fridges and furniture pieces are heading for Hawaii, as a huge amount of debris from Japan’s earthquake sails across the Pacific. Up to 20 million tons of debris from the earthquake in March is traveling faster than expected and could reach the U.S. West Coast in three years. A Russian ship’s crew spotted the debris - which included a 20ft long fishing boat  - last month after passing the Midway Islands. Debris wave: Up to 20 million tons of debris from the earthquake is travelling faster than expected and could reach the U.S. West Coast in three years . On the way: Experts have revised predictions to say the debris will reach will now reach the Midway Islands by winter and Hawaii in less than two years . Researchers at the University of Hawaii have been tracking the debris for almost half a year. Nikolai Maximenko and Jan Hafner were . working on untested computer models of ocean currents to forecast the . trajectory of the debris. But last month's sightings  suggest their model works as the debris was spotted in predicted areas. ‘We have a rough estimate of 5 to 20 million tons of debris coming from Japan,’ University of Hawaii researcher Jan Hafner told KITV. Experts have revised predictions to say the debris will now reach the Midway Islands by winter and Hawaii in less than two years. Crew members on the Russian training ship STS Pallada spotted the debris 2,000 miles from Japan, including a fishing boat from Fukushima, reported AFP. ‘They saw some pieces of furniture, some appliances, anything that can float - and they picked up a fishing boat,’ Mr Hafner told KITV. A crew member told AFP: 'We keep sighting things like wooden . boards, plastic bottles, buoys from fishing nets [small and big ones], . an object resembling a wash basin, drums, boots, other wastes.' On its way: Debris from the tsunami is approaching Hawaii . 'We also sighted a TV set, fridge and a couple of other home appliances.' A spokesman for the International Pacific Research Center at the University of Hawaii said: 'The Russian ship... found an array of unmistakable tsunami debris on its homeward voyage from Honolulu to Vladivostok.' Some of the lighter debris is moving quicker than expected. ‘We don't want to create a panic, but it’s good to know it’s coming,’ Mr Hafner added. Salvaged: Crew members on the Russian training ship STS Pallada spotted the debris almost 2,000 miles from Japan, including a fishing boat from Fukushima . Find: Russian ship STS Pallada's crew spotted the items last month soon after passing the Midway Islands, where the debris is expected to reach in winter . Japan was badly hit by the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami on March 11, which left 20,000 people dead or missing. 'We don't want to create a panic, but it’s good to know it’s coming' Jan HafnerUniversity of Hawaii researcher . The quake damaged cooling systems at the Fukushima plant, which resulted in the worst atomic disaster in the world since Chernobyl in 1986. Japan is struggling in part because tourists are worried about visiting, so the country's tourist board is giving away 10,000 free flights. Scientists are eager to track where the debris is heading because it can threaten small ships as well as coastlines, reported LiveScience.","Debris travelling faster than expected across Pacific .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Nowadays, the seaside resort of Blackpool is looking rather tired. But, as this remarkable collection of images show, this was not always the case. The images show the Lancashire town at the height of its popularity from the 1870s through to the 1930s, 40s, 50s and 60s. Scores of Britons can be seen enjoying the sand between their toes, while wearing knotted hankies and tucking into ice creams - or indeed enjoying some Blackpool rock. Meanwhile, families can be seen packed on the beach with hardly a spare inch of sand between them. Run aground ships, couples larking around on the promenade, horse drawn carriages and the iconic Blackpool Tower are captured in full glory in others. In other black and white snaps, mobs of holidaymakers can be seen descending on famous faces - including Frank Sinatra. All of the images have been released by The Blackpool Gazette who are tweeting them everyday on the twitter account @TheLostArchives.

With Britain on the brink of war, Blackpool was more popular than ever in 1939, pictured.

"By . Lydia Warren . The nine-year-old girl who shaved her head to support her best friend suffering from cancer felt she was being punished when her school said she could not return, she has revealed. 'I was pretty sad that they didn't let me go to school,' Kamryn Renfro said on the Today show on Friday morning. 'I was feeling that I was punished.' Kamryn, from Grand Junction, Colorado, impressed her family and friends when she asked to shave her head so her best friend, 12-year-old Delaney Clements, wouldn't be the only one without hair. Delaney lost her hair after undergoing chemotherapy treatments for a childhood cancer known as neuroblastoma and said it made her stand out and feel alone. Scroll down for video . Best friends: Nine-year-old Kamryn Renfro, right, was told not to return to school after she shaved off her hair in support of her friend, Delaney Clements, left, who suffers from a childhood cancer . Proud: The girls appeared on the Today show on Friday morning with their proud mothers - Wendy Campbell, Delaney's mother (left), and Jamie Renfro, Kamryn's mother (second left) 'I felt very good inside,' Delaney told Savannah Guthrie. 'I was so happy that I would have somebody there for me and she was . there for me the whole step of the way and everything.' So she was stunned when Kamryn's mother emailed the school to let them know what her daughter would look like on Monday morning - and they responded that the new look violated the school's dress code, which bans girls from shaving their heads. The school told her she could not return to class until she wore a wig or her grew her hair back. Catherine Norton, chairwoman of the . board, said the dress code is designed to promote uniformity and a . non-distracting environment. She said exceptions could only be made in certain . circumstances. The families were shocked. Before: Delaney, 12, photobombs her nine-year-old friend Kamryn before she cuts off her hair . After: Kamryn, left, shows off her newly-shaved head on Sunday - but her school said she could not return . 'Friends support each other no matter . what and this is a brave girl and we should support her and the fact . that she made that decision,' Wendy Campbell, Delaney's mother, told KUSA. 'For a little girl to be really brave . and want to shave her head in support of her friend, I thought that was a . huge statement and it builds character in a child.' But after Kamryn's mother, Jamie Renfro, expressed her frustration on Facebook, the community began protesting the decision - and the story made headlines across the country. Caprock Academy, Kamryn's school, agreed to let her return the following day and the school board held a special meeting. On Tuesday, . board members voted 3-1 in favor of Kamryn's return. The only member to vote against it was Bill Newcomer, who told NBC: 'I believe we as a country have succumbed to making . decisions based on emotion, as opposed to logic and critical thinking.' Invited back: Jamie Renfro hugs and kisses her daughter Kamryn on Tuesday night after the school board of directors voted to let her remain at the charter school following her show of compassion . Fighter: Delaney, with her mother, suffers from neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer affecting the nerves . But Kamryn said her friends were happy to see her back in the classroom. 'They just thought I was brave to shave . my head for cancer,' she told the Today show. Her mother added: 'Proud is an understatement. We are so proud of her and Delaney both. They are amazing.' Delaney, who met Kamryn at a gymnastics class, is about to start another round of chemotherapy following her fourth relapse from the cancer. Her mother said: 'So many people don't realize what these kids go through when they're in the hospital,' she said. 'So when you actually have a friend who takes an amazing step in life and shaves off all their hair - Delaney has been just so excited.'","Kamryn Renfro, from Grand Junction, Colorado, was told she could not go to school after shaving her head because it violated the dress code .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The manager of an Indiana Pizza Hut fired for refusing to open his restaurant on Thanksgiving has now been offered his job back. Tony Rohr worked at the Elkhart Pizza Hut for nearly ten years, climbing the ladder from cook to general manager, before getting fired last week. Rohr wrote a defiant note to his employer instead of the letter of resignation they’d requested. Instead of even more scorn, the heartfelt letter won him praise from across the country and now it's won him his job back. After 10 years: Indiana Pizza Hut manager Tony Rohr refused last week to open his restaurant on Thanksgiving and was fired . ‘Why can't we be the company that stands up and says we care about your employees and you can have the day off,’ Rohr recalled thinking after he was told he and his workers had to work the holiday when so many eat at home with loved ones. He said he refused not for himself, but for his employees. ‘Thanksgiving and Christmas are the only two days that they're closed in the whole year. And they're the only two days that those people are guaranteed to have off to spend with their families,’ he told WSBT. For his employees: The owners of the Elkhart, Indiana Pizza Hut first asked Rohr to resign, but instead he shot off a list of reasons he found the decision unfair . 'Why can't we be the company that stands up and says we care about your employees and you can have the day off,' Rohr wondered . At first, Rohr says he wasn’t fired, but asked to resign from the Pizza Hut, which is run by a franchisee and not directly by Pizza Hut. Instead of a letter of resignation, Rohr shot of a missive detailing all the reasons he found the requirement unfair. ‘I accept that the refusal to comply with this greedy, immoral request means the end of my tenure with this company,’ he wrote. ‘I hope you realize that it is the people at the bottom of the totem pole that make your life possible.’ He says he was then fired, but the local franchise told WSBT Rohr quit. Popular: Rohr's letter won him praise from people all over after news spread he was fired . When Pizza Hut's corporate offices got wind of the controversy, they moved quickly. 'We strongly recommended that the local franchisee reinstate the store manager,' they said in a statement . Regardless of which occurred, something unexpected definitely happened thereafter. Coverage of Rohr’s situation won him praise from across the country from Americans who sympathized with his cause. It also won him the sympathy of the Pizza Hut corporate big wigs. According to CNN, officials there said the franchisees ‘made a serious error in judgment, one which we hope to help remedy.’ Remedy it they did. Rohr has now been offered his job back. ‘We fully respect an employee's right to not work on a holiday, which is why the vast majority of Pizza Huts in America are closed on Thanksgiving,’ reads a statement on the corporate office website. ‘We strongly recommended that the local franchisee reinstate the store manager and they have agreed. We look forward to them welcoming Tony back to the team,’ it reads. Rohr, who’s likely spending the holiday with family, has not commented on whether he accept the offer.","Tony Rohr had worked at the Elkhart, Indiana nearly 10 years when he was fired last week for refusing to open on the holiday .

The . one room 'shed' on Mudeford Spit near Christchurch in Dorset is just 10 feet . by 15 feet and can only be accessed by boat from nearby Christchurch Quay or on a novelty land train from the nearest car park at Hengistbury Head. Even then, the owners . will face a half-a-mile trek after the boat or train ride to reach the four-walled hut that is positioned . at the very end of the sandy peninsula. This tiny beach hut on Mudeford Spit in Christchurch, Dorset with no running water or mains electricity has been put up for sale for £150,000 . The hut's only electricity comes from solar panels on the roof that power . the lighting. A cooker and small fridge run off a camping gas bottle. There is no toilet either but there is a shared shower block on the sandy spit. The agent marketing the property say four people can sleep in hut but between March and October only, due to a local bylaw. Not . only that, the buyer will have to stump up £3,000 a year in ground rent . to the local council, as well as £500 in annual rates. The cooker and fridge in the kitchen of the beach hut run off a small camping gas bottle as there is no mains electricity connected to it . The agent marketing the property says it can accommodate up to four people but they can only stay overnight from March to October, due to a local bylaw . Mudeford Spit near Christchurch in Dorset is home to around 350 beach huts looking out across Christchurch harbour . The . enormous asking price is equivalent to a top of the range Bentley . Continental car and even a four-bedroomed terraced house in Thornaby, . Stockton-on-Tees. The shed also measures in at £1,000 per sqaure foot, the same as a property in central London's Pimlico area. Andy . Denison, of Denisons Estate Agents in Christchurch, who is selling the . leasehold for hut number 17, said: 'This beach hut is more towards the . quieter quayside-end of the sandspit facing 'the run', the stretch of . water between the spit and Mudeford. The view from the hut on Mudeford spit looks out across Christchurch harbour on to Avon beach . The small shed includes a kitchen and two beds but has no toilet or running water and those staying there must use the shared shower block . Mudeford Spit where the beach is located, is only accessible by taking a boat from Christchurch Quay or a land train from a nearby car park . There are around 350 beach huts located on Mudeford Spit, with one earlier this year being snapped up for £180,000 . 'It has lovely views over Christchurch harbour and across to Avon beach. 'The hut is not huge but it's quite nicely done out with a little kitchenette and two sofa beds so you can sleep four people. 'You can only sleep there between March and October, but you can visit any time of the year.

In 2012, another hut in the same area sold for a £170,000 in just two days of going on the market. The wooden structure was subject to a bidding frenzy as people as tried to get their hands on one of the most sought after properties. Builder Nick Willan, 56, also spent a staggering £189,000 on a decaying Victorian toilet block which had been left to rot on the seafront in Sheringham, Norfolk. He presented the renovated property - dubbed 'The Wee Retreat' - to his wife, Sue, as an anniversary present. Steve . Barratt, chairman of the Mudeford Sandbank Beach Hut Association, . added: 'The huts at that end of the spit go for a bit less because of . the hike you face from the jetty or the land train station, especially . if you have luggage.

A hospital is the first in the UK to install a silk flower vending machine to get around a ban on fresh bouquets in wards. The machine has been put in the corridors of St James' Hospital in Leeds after patients complained about a lack of flowers by their bedsides. Blooms have been banned by 92 per cent of UK hospitals amid fears they cause infection and spread bacteria. The machine is currently distributing silk flower posies for free in the run-up to Mother's Day. Statistics show 76 per cent of people disagree with the ban and many experts believe they have a beneficial effect on patients' wellbeing. Studies show nine out of ten people . believe that receiving flowers can dramatically improve someone's mood . and 50 per cent of the public feel flowers can aid a person's recovery. Kay Lawton, Deputy Facilities Manager at St James's Hospital, said: 'Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust has a ban on fresh flowers across many of our wards and though we have good reason to do so, we are really excited about this campaign. 'We believe that silk flowers are a truly brilliant way to provide the holistic benefits that flowers can give to our patients whilst combating some of the health and safety issues that are brought about through visitors bringing their family and friends fresh flowers.' St James' Hospital in Leeds has come up with a unique way of getting around the flower ban, which is in place in 92 per cent of UK hospitals . The hospital's new flower machine dispenses silk bouquets and are free in the run up to Mother's Day . The bunches of silk flowers are designed based on an idea from China . Patient Pearline Berry said: 'These flowers are beautiful, I will treasure them. 'My stay at St James's has been brilliant - the staff have treated me so well and these flowers have just completed my great experience here. 'Flowers really make me feel happy.' Though it's currently each individual NHS trust's decision, many hospitals are increasingly banning fresh flowers for a variety of reasons. Catherine Vowles was one of the first people on the elderly ward at St James' hospital to receive the flowers . The flower machine was not only installed to get around the ban, but also because many believe flowers have therapeutic effects on the sick . Some trusts fear flowers can trigger allergies, some flower water can contain harmful bacteria and that fresh flowers are creating further work for nurses. Psychologist Emma Kenny, who is supporting the 'Power of the Flower' campaign, a campaign to get flowers back in hospital wards to benefit the health of patients, said: 'There are many studies that show the psychological impact that flowers can have on a person's recovery or general well-being. 'In a hospital environment it is vital that patients are kept feeling as upbeat and positive as possible.' Country Baskets flower company installed the machine for free, as a charitable donation, and has been instrumental in handing out the free flowers all weekend.","St James's Hospital in Leeds has installed the flower vending machine .

The London Mayor’s unkempt blonde mop has helped make him one of the most-recognised politicians in the country. But appearing on ITV’s Saturday Night Takeaway tomorrow night he is presented with a comb by Little Ant and Dec, which he says he will use – to scratch his back. Scroll down for video . London Mayor Boris Johnson has been grilled by Little Ant and Dec for this week's Saturday Night Takeaway . Boris Johnson's hair is often out of control, but he seemed unsure about what to do with a comb . Mr Johnson’s hair looks such a mess that in the past he has been asked if he cuts it himself. Despite being in charge of the one of the world’s great cities, he often looks like he has just got out of bed. In the interview, Little Ant and Dec quizzed the Tory about whether his tousled tresses has landed him in hot water. Little Dec asked the Mayor: ‘Do you get told off for never brushing your hair?’ Mr Johnson admitted: ‘Yes very frequently.  I do it’s a failing of mine.’ Little Dec then presents the Mayor with a comb, but he appears reluctant to use it for its intended purpose. Mr Johnson said: ‘Thank you very much I will keep that it’s a handy looking object, I can use it to scratch my back.’ The duo handed over the comb during the interview filmed at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park ahead of its official opening on April 3 . In the interview, to be broadcast tomorrow night, Mr Johnson was also asked about why his role as Mayor does not come with suitable regalia. Little Ant asked: ‘If you are the Mayor where is your big hat and gold chain?’ Reluctantly, Mr Johnson confessed: ‘I don’t have either a hat or a chain.’ When Little Ant added:  ‘You’re The Mayor you should have that stuff’ Mr Johnson replied: ‘Well I know it’s very nice of you to say so Little Ant.’ The interview was filmed at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park ahead of its official opening on April 3. The cheeky interviewing duo, who look like the ITV stars Ant and Dec, also challenged Mr Johnson about how attractive the women of London are. Little Dec asked: ‘My daddy said there is a lot of posh totty in London what does he mean?’ Mr Johnson replied: ‘I don’t know what your father means by that but I’m sure he’s right.’","London Mayor challenged about his locks for Saturday Night Takeaway .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . In a move that wouldn’t look out of place in an Austin Powers movie, a student from Illinois has fitted a spider-shaped robot with laser beams. The remote-controlled Death Ray Laser Drone Bot is fitted with a beam so powerful it can pop balloons and make paper and card burst into flames. It was created by 20-year-old Drake Anthony who demonstrated the full force of his creation on his Styropyro YouTube channel. Illinois student Drake Anthony fitted a remote-controlled Attacknid robot with a laser diode that is fired from the spider-shaped drone and is capable of setting fire to paper within seconds, pictured . In May, 20-year-old chemistry student Drake Anthony created a handheld lightsaber. A video of the gadget showed the invention cutting through paper, tape and cardboard - and even melting a ping pong ball. The laser used was a 9mm 450nm diode powered by two 18650 Li Ion batteries. Anthony called the lightsaber The BEAST. To build the device, Anthony, 20, modified an Attacknid robot. An Attacknid toy traditionally fires foam darts and disks, can walk around, and is designed to battle against other robots. By removing the top of the robot and tweaking the firing mechanism, Anthony was able to replace the foam thrower with a 2W blue laser diode. By connecting the laser to existing . wires, Anthony was able to move the Attacknid using the robot's remote control. This control can make the Attacknid walk, spin the lasers 360-degrees, and fire the laser at targets. In the video, Anthony demonstrates the power of the laser by firing it at a series of black balloons that each pop immediately. He then fires the laser at a piece of paper, which bursts into flames within three seconds. According to Anthony: ‘I present my most terrifying laser creation as of yet - the remote controlled death ray drone bot! To build the device, Anthony modified an Attacknid robot, pictured. The Attacknid traditionally fires foam darts and disks, can walk around and is designed to battle against other robots . By connecting the laser to existing wires, Anthony was able to move and fire this laser using the robot's remote control, pictured bottom.

"By . Lizzie Parry . An A&E department plagued by abusive patients is to open the first hospital police station in the UK, to tackle the rising tide of violence. Staff at the Royal Blackburn Hospital's emergency department were forced to call police 1,230 times from September 2012 to September 2013 - an average of 100 calls a month. The majority of those calls were for help dealing with patients who were being physically and verbally abusive, while drunk or high on drugs. Pioneering: Two police liaison officers will be stationed in A&E at The Royal Blackburn Hospital from Tuesday. The £80,000 pilot project - thought to be the first of its kind in the UK - aims to reduce the pressure on police and staff in the emergency unit. Picture posed by models . Officers were called to deal with assaults on members of staff, concerns over the safety of other patients, and often to help find distressed patients who had disappeared from the department. But from Tuesday two specially trained liaison officers will be stationed in the hospital's busy A&E unit to help stem the rising problem. The £80,000 pilot project aims to deal with those patients who regularly turn up at the department. Chief Inspector Justin Srivastava, of Lancashire Constabulary, said: 'This project isn’t about providing a security presence in A&E. 'These two officers will be highly skilled individuals trained to . identify complex frequent attenders at A&E who can benefit from . other services. 'This . is an extremely positive initiative across the health economy aimed at . dealing with the root cause of the problem rather than treating the . symptoms of the problem and thus allow resources to be utilised better . both from a hospital and police perspective.' While other hospitals in the UK have officers on site at weekends, this is thought to be the first full-time project of its kind. Charles . Thomson, Clinical Director of the Emergency Department at East . Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'This initiative represents an . ideal opportunity to benefit the patients in ensuring that they get . directed to appropriate services. Rising tide of violence: In the year from September 2012 to September 2013 A&E staff at the hospital in Lancashire had to call police 1,230 times for help to deal with patients who were being physically and verbally abusive, and those who were drunk and high on drugs . 'It also gives our staff increased . support on site and increases police efficiency. 'This example of safe, . personal and effective care will result in a better experience for all . patients who attend our Emergency Department. 'It will help to reduce . emergency admissions, re-admissions and streamline the way care is . provided to ensure safe and dignified care – key requirements from the . Keogh review.' Dr Chris Clayton, the Clinical Chief Officer at the NHS Blackburn and Darwen CCG, said the initiative should improve the quality of care those distressed patients receive. He said it is designed to reduce the demand on both the police force as well as under-pressure hospital teams. Lancashire Police and Crime Commissioner Clive Grunshaw, added: 'I am . committed to ensuring the Constabulary's work is focused around early . action, and this scheme will hopefully ensure residents receive the help . and support they require at the earliest possible opportunity.' The officers have been trained to work with doctors and nurses to spot those individuals who display challenging behaviour, alcohol and substance misuse issues, people with undiagnosed mental health issues and those who frequently visit the hospital with any of the problems.","The £80,000 pilot project is thought to be the first of its kind in the UK .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . It's time to play the music. It's time to light the lights. It's time to discuss Scottish independence on the Muppet Show tonight. Kermit the Frog has become the latest international star to warn Scottish voters against breaking away from the rest of the UK, in a fresh blow to Alex Salmond's dream of independence. And after the SNP claimed the Queen could be ditched as head of state for an independence Scotland, Kermit revealed Miss Piggy is ‘willing to serve’ as a new Queen of Scotland. Muppets star Kermit the Frog urged voters to reject Scottish independence ahead of the referendum in September . Miss Piggy is preparing to become Queen of Scotland in the event of the break-up of the United Kingdom . With less than six months to go until the referendum, the issue of independence has become a global talking point. Rock star David Bowie stunned the Brit Awards when he used an acceptance speech, delivered by model Kate Moss, to plead with Scots ‘stay with us’. Now Kermit has joined the chorus of celebrities urging voters to remain in the UK. Asked whether he agrees with Bowie, Kermit told The Big Issue: ‘Absolutely!’ However, he revealed his other half was preparing for Scotland to go it alone. ‘I understand that Miss Piggy is willing to serve as Queen of Scotland if there is a split. So you may want to guard your castles,’ Kermit added, while promoting his latest film in London. A senior SNP minister said at the weekend that the Queen could be removed as head of state. Kenny MacAskill, the Scottish justice minister, said ‘it will be for the people of Scotland to decide’ if the country becomes a republic or remains a monarchy. Mr Salmond’s official policy is that the monarchy would be automatically be retained if Scotland decides to secede - but many in his party are staunch republicans. SNP First Minister Alex Salmond has suffered a series of high profile setbacks, with big business, banks and now the Muppets warning against his dream of independence . Singer David Bowie pleaded with Scotland not to leave the UK, in a Brits Awards acceptance speech delivered by model Kate Moss . Kermit added: ‘We love the UK!. We’ve made several movies here and, of course, this is where we shot The Muppet Show. ‘The British people really “got” our humour. Heck, you folks even get Fozzie’s jokes, but it was the great impresario, Lord Lew Grade, who gave us our first big break… and we’re forever grateful to him and to everyone here in England.’ Downing Street refused to be drawn on whether it had coerced the Muppets into the political debate. ‘Are you suggesting somebody might be pulling the strings?’ David Cameron’s official spokesman told journalists at a briefing. He gave no answer when asked if the Prime Minister ‘had a hand in Kermit’. A growing list of celebrities has come out against independence. Singer Rod Stewart said: ‘I’d hate to see the Union broken after all these years - and I don’t think it will happen.’ Actor John Barrowman: 'All of us who believe in unity over division should use our voice to help win the referendum. We are stronger when we stand together.’ Even wee Jimmy Krankie, otherwise known as Janette Tough, said: ‘Alex Salmond can sod off ’cos I don’t want it. We don’t live in Scotland so we won’t get to vote and I don’t think it’s fair.’ Lookalikes: Lab assistant Beaker and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander . News that Kermit is backing Scotland remaining in the UK will come as no surprise to one member of the Cabinet. Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has long been compared to Beaker, the ginger long-suffering sidekick of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew. He has also led Lib Dem opposition to independence, warning if Scotland goes it alone they would lose the right to use the pound in a currency union. Mr Alexander acknowledged the similarity, writing on Twitter: 'I am reliably informed that Beaker agrees with @KermitOfficial - Scotland is #BetterTogether in the #UK #IndyRef @UK_Together'","Muppets star joins chorus of opposition against independence .

"By . Tamara Cohen, Political Reporter . David Cameron has taken industry experts by surprise, saying he wants fracking underway by the end of the year . Britain has a duty to step up fracking to reduce dependence on gas from Russia, the Prime Minister said yesterday. David Cameron, who met world leaders to discuss the crisis in Ukraine, said the annexation of Crimea was a ‘wake up call’ for Europe about its reliance on Russian energy. Moscow supplies around a third of Europe’s gas, much of it via a pipeline through Ukraine, and Mr Cameron said some countries are nearly 100 per cent reliant on Russian gas. He said he wanted some shale gas wells up and running by the end of the year, to encourage the idea of self-sufficiency in energy. But his call surprised industry experts, who said it would be the end of this decade before commercial fracking could begin. Britain gets most of its gas from the North Sea, Norway and Qatar but will need far more imports as North Sea supplies dwindle. Officially the UK imports less than 1 per cent of its gas from Russia. But Moscow-owned firm Gazprom claims it could be as high as 15 per cent indirectly, as Britain’s buys gas from other European countries such as Germany at peak times, which originates from Russia. In 2009, when Russia cut off the gas to Ukraine, UK prices jumped by 17 per cent. Britain has vast reserves of shale gas trapped in rocks thousands of feet underground which can be extracted in the controversial fracking process. It got under way in Lancashire three years ago and had to be halted after two small earthquakes but has now re-started. Exploratory drilling near the village of Balcombe, West Sussex, last year was abandoned after the site was overrun by protesters who believe fracking could ruin the countryside and contaminate water supplies. Drilling did get underway in Balcombe, Sussex, last year but was abandoned after protester flooded the site . Yesterday the Prime Minister said the military action by Russia meant that ‘energy independence’ should become ‘a tier one political issue from now on, rather than tier five’. Asked whether it was Britain’s duty to secure its energy independence by embracing fracking, he said: ‘Yes, I think it is.’ He added that one of the best ways of addressing ‘people’s uncertainties and worries’ is to show them shale gas wells in action as soon as possible. ‘By the end of this year there should be some unconventional gas wells up and running that we can demonstrate and I think  the enthusiasm for it will grow,’ he said. ‘I’m confident we’ll win the argument.’ Ministers are expected to hand out dozens of licences for shale gas drilling this summer, and a map of Britain’s reserves suggests every county except Cornwall could see some drilling.","Cameron says Britain has a duty to step up gas production .

"By . Martin Robinson . A mother who killed herself in Asda was bereft after the death of her daughter from a heart defect and told family 'my life is not worth living' before she died, it emerged today. Sobia Yousef, 36, stabbed herself in the neck in the supermarket's kitchenware aisle in Shipley, West Yorkshire, on Tuesday morning in front of shoppers and staff. The death of her child Mehwash, nine, who had struggled with a hole in the heart from birth, had 'triggered a collapse in her mother's mental state'. Tragedy: Sobia Yousef, 36, left, stabbed herself in the neck in Asda this week after failing to cope with the death of daughter Mehwash, nine, right, who died last October from a rare heart condition . Mehwesh, who had a sister, Aqsa, 14, and brother Shaweeb, 12, had a number of heart operations in her short life but experts said she would never make it to ten. Ms Yousef's brother Intiaz Ali said: 'When doctors told my sister there was nothing they could do to save her daughter she changed. Sobia would not eat or drink for days and would not leave her bedside for two months'. Mr Ali also accused social services of 'abandoning' his sister and ignoring the family's pleas to have her sectioned. 'She had tried to harm herself and said that life was not worth living after Mehwash died', he said. 'We don't want any other family to go through what we have. Everybody has let us down'. Tragic: Sobia Yousef, 36, died in front of horrified staff and shoppers in the kitchenware aisle of Asda in Shipley, West Yorkshire, on Tuesday morning . Shock: The victim was found lying in an aisle after injuring herself in the neck. She could not be saved . Four days of official mourning have started at Ms Yousef's mosque in Frizinghall, Bradford. Bradford Councillor Imdad Hussain said she had undergone treatment at Lynfield Mount psychiatric hospital after her child passed away last year. 'It is a great tragedy which has left the whole local community and far beyond  in shock,' he said. 'It is such a terribly sad way for anyone to end their life. 'Sadly it seems that she lost her nine-year-old daughter some five months ago and it was that which triggered the collapse of her mental state. 'Her daughter had been born with an illness and the doctors only gave the baby a year to live. 'However she managed to stay alive until she was nine and there was a very special and close bond between the mother and daughter.' Investigation: Police shut off the supermarket after the incident, said to be driven by the woman's 'collapse in mental state' He said the care and treatment she received from mental health professionals needed to be examined. He said: 'Questions have to be asked of the authorities and organisations involved over what support was being given.' One eye-witness said: 'One of the shop's first aiders was trying to give CPR. 'One of the young men who works there actually saw the woman stabbing herself in the throat. He's in terrible shock'. The store was cordoned off for the majority of Tuesday as police forensic teams worked inside. West Yorkshire Police were alerted at around 8.37am to the store, along with paramedics. A spokesman for the police force said the woman was pronounced dead at the scene.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . After cutting the price of a pint, George Osborne would have hoped to be cheered by Britain’s drinkers. But the Chancellor found himself accused of patronising hardworking people with a Tory party advert claiming ‘they’ enjoy bingo and beer. Today he tried to repair his man-of-the-people reputation with a visit to a pub, where he was pictured slightly awkwardly sipping a pint - but committed the sin of taking a gulp before the ale had settled. Chancellor George Osborne supping a a pint of Sunbeam ale, alongside Conservative MP for Wolverhampton south west Paul Uppal (left) and chief executive Ralph Findlay (right) during a visit to Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton . Cheers! Mr Osborne held his pint aloft, with it still setlling, during his visit to Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton . Mr Osborne used last week’s Budget to halve duty on bingo to 10 per cent and take a penny off a pint of beer. In an apparent bid to wood blue collar voters, the Conservative party produced an advert to promote the policy which stated: ‘Bingo! Cutting the bingo tax and beer duty to help hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy.’ But the use of the word ‘they’ was widely criticised, with the Lib Dems call it ‘silly’ and Labour saying it was ‘condescending’. Mr Osborne rushed to insist that he plays bingo as a ‘happy participant’, and let it be known that he sometimes calls the numbers. At the weekend it emerged the advert was drawn up and signed off by Mr Osborne and his team in the Treasury. 'PR disaster': Grant Shapps tweeted this Tory party advert about beer and bingo cuts in today's Budget - which spawned numerous spoofs online . During a tour to promote measures in the Budget, Mr Osborne also visit Boal Aluminium UK . Mr Osborne said he was cutting energy bills for manufacturers, as he toured with Treasury minister Nicky Morgan, the MP for Loughborough (centre) and Paul Hatton, production manager at Boal Aluminium UK . But in an attempt to win back the support of beer drinkers he was pictured supping a pint today. Mr Osborne was pictured with a sipping the top out of a pint of Sunbeam ale during a visit to Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton. Sunbeam is described as a ‘gloriously zesty blonde beer with a 4.2% ABV brewed to be easy drinking and refreshing with a clean long finish’. Writing on Twitter, Mr Osborne said: ‘Great to visit Marston's brewery in Wolverhampton with @pauluppalmp. They're creating 3,000 new jobs.

Sarah Moyes, 27, who uses the Twitter handle @moyesy, has received a constant flurry of abusive and hurtful messages since the beleaguered boss took over the Premier League club from Sir Alex Ferguson last year. However, fed up of fans venting their fury at her after Man U’s 3-0 defeat to rivals Manchester City on Tuesday, the comedy club worker pointed out she was no relation and politely asked people to stop. Sarah Moyes, 27, who uses the Twitter handle @moyesy, has received a constant flurry of abusive and hurtful messages since the beleaguered boss took over the Premier League club from Alex Ferguson last year . Sarah Moyes, who is no relation to Manchester United boss David Moyes, asked fans to stop sending the messages on Tuesday after the Premier League club's defeat to rivals Manchester City . Miss Moyes, from Falkirk, Scotland - who happens to have a brother called David – wrote: ‘I am no relation to the football manager David Moyes. Can people please stop mentioning me in tweets, I'm pretty sure he has his own account.’ But, it only seemed to make things worse and her message went viral after it was retweeted nearly 5,000 times - including by football legend Gary Lineker to his 2.25m followers. She said: ‘It just went crazy after that. Most of the messages are jokey ones like “tell your dad he should be sacked”. ‘But there have been a couple of really horrible ones. ‘I had one that called me quite a few horrible names and told me to die, that was pretty extreme. ‘There have been quite a few messages saying “just change your name”, but I've been called Moyesy since I was a teenager.’ Confused fans have even branded Miss Moyes a ‘disgrace to MUFC’, accused her of 'ruining Man United' with her 'useless tactics' and demanded her resignation.

"Claim: Sam Laidlaw, the chief executive of Centrica, today said that an Ofgem investigation into energy companies increased the risk of blackouts . The boss of Britain's largest energy company today warned that the country could face blackouts thanks to an investigation into the Big Six suppliers. Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of British Gas's parent company Centrica, suggested the probe would deter investment in infrastructure and delay the construction of new power stations. His claim was met with a furious response from consumer groups, which accused Mr Laidlaw of 'unnecessary scaremongering' and added: 'There's no immediate prospect of the lights going out.' Energy Secretary Ed Davey insisted that more than a dozen new infrastructure projects were in the pipeline and blamed the Big Six for failing to invest enough in their own power supply resources. The regulator today announced that it has asked the competition authority to launch a comprehensive probe into British Gas and its five main rivals. The investigation was prompted by Ofgem's findings that the energy firms have quadrupled their profits in the past four years as customers became reluctant to switch suppliers. Mr Laidlaw told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that the inquiry, projected to take two years, would make companies and investors reluctant to commit to major infrastructure projects, putting Britain's energy supply in jeopardy. Asked if there was a possibility of the lights going out, he said: ‘We hope they won’t but there is an increasing risk. 'A lot can be done in terms of demand management, but building new gas-fired power stations does take four years and that’s the time pressure that we are now up against - and we’ve just added another two years onto this. Profits: British Gas, owned by Centrica, has seen its profits rise over the past few years . Bills: The cost to customers has risen from £1,095 to £1,232 over a four-year period . 'The concern of this inquiry is that . unfortunately, to do it thoroughly, is going to take two years. This . happens at a time when we’ve already had five years of uncertainty, from . an investment point of view, in terms of putting through electricity . market reforms. 'So the . big concern is whether we’ll have a further two-year period of no . investment at a time when Britain’s energy security is a matter of . increasing concern.’ Mr Laidlaw expresses fears that the investigation would force Centrica to split its infrastructure and supply arms, suggesting that the possibility would deter the firm from investing in power generation. 'It's an inevitable consequence because the risk of investing in that space – because you might have to divest in a couple of years - has gone up,' he said. The energy boss told ITV News that Britain would be reliant on foreign countries for 70 per cent of its gas by 2020 thanks to the depletion of North Sea reserves. Last month, Centrica chairman Rick Haythornthwaite warned that public opposition to the big energy firms could cause blackouts, saying: 'I think it is immensely damaging, not just for Centrica, but for the nation - I think the reputation of Britain as a place in which to invest is under threat.' Defence: Ed Davey said Mr Laidlaw was 'absolutely, totally wrong' and predicted a robust future for energy . Sam Laidlaw, whose father was chairman of BP, is an Eton-educated oil executive who became chief executive of Centrica in 2006. Since starting at the firm, which owns British Gas, his pay packet has risen to nearly £5million as Centrica's profits have soared and customers have seen ever-increasing bills. He has been criticised for accepting a series of multi-million-pound bonuses at a time when recession-hit consumers were spending more of their income on gas and electricity. Mr Laidlaw owns three homes - a Chelsea town house, a Cotswolds mansion and a holiday flat on the Isle of Wight. Last year it emerged that he had installed a second swimming pool in the grounds of his Oxfordshire house, using more energy to heat it than the average family uses in a year. He is not the first Centrica official to threaten blackouts - last week, chairman Rick Haythornthwaite warned that public opposition could prompt the firm to cut back on investment in power generation. Energy Secretary Ed Davey hit back at . Mr Laidlaw's claim, blaming Centrica for under-investing and insisting . that other companies were keen to build new energy infrastructure. 'He is absolutely, totally wrong and I can prove it,' he told Today. 'We have 14 contracts for power generation over the next 15 years. What we are seeing in Britain is a big investment in energy. 'It is true that companies like Centrica are not investing as much as we might like them to but we are seeing independent energy generation firms like Siemens coming in in their place.' Mr Davey added: ‘We’re seeing record levels of investment in this country, only this week, we saw 14 final bids for our 15-year contracts to build new power stations – biomass, offshore wind and so on. ‘We’re actually seeing an investment boom. It isn’t simply from people like Centrica, it’s a lot of independent generators coming. 'Some of the Big Six have pulled out, Sam Laidlaw’s company pulled out of the Hinkley Point Sea nuclear project but that’s going ahead with EDF. They pulled out of an offshore windfarm, Race Bank, but a Danish offshore wind company is going to build that.’ Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch, said: 'This is unnecessary scaremongering. We have over 10 per cent of gas plants mothballed, and the capacity auctions planned for later this year could help bring these back into use. 'Also, the life of 90 per cent of our nuclear generation fleet has been extended, so, while we will need new generation, there is no immediate prospect of the lights going out.' Ofgem claimed that the investigation announced today would 'give people more confidence' by clarifying the regulatory environment. 'The current market and political uncertainty is already creating concern among investors,' a spokesman said. 'The alternative of waiting to see the impact of our reforms would leave the prospect of a reference as a risk to investment for a longer period. Chief executive Dermot Nolan added: 'This will provide clarity to make sure the lights stay on for two years, five years, 10 years, even 50 years.'","Ofgem announced today that it intended to launch a competition probe into Britain's biggest energy companies .

"By . James Chapman . 'The European Union has blood on its hands': Farage on TV with Clegg. His comments have led to accusations that he is siding with Vladimir Putin . Nigel Farage refused to back down yesterday after he was accused of siding with Vladimir Putin in claiming the EU has blood on its hands over the crisis in Ukraine. The Ukip leader provoked controversy by using a TV debate with Nick Clegg to insist that both Britain and Brussels are to blame for Russia seizing Crimea. Critics from all three main parties accused him of allowing his hatred of the EU to lead him into mirroring the arguments of Putin, which have prompted worldwide condemnation. But Mr Farage insisted the West had given false hope to people in Ukraine of closer ties with Europe in the full knowledge that it would antagonise Putin and prompt a military response. ‘I’m not sure how this is controversial: there is a clear pattern of behaviour on how Russia reacts to eastward EU expansion and it’s not with invitations for a tea party and a polite chat,’ he said. The Ukip leader said the Government had ‘geed up the EU’ to pursue an ‘imperialist, expansionist’ policy which had meant leading people in the Ukraine to believe that their future could lie with Europe. ‘They actually toppled their own elected leader,' he said. ‘That provoked Mr Putin, and I think the European Union frankly does have blood on its hands in the Ukraine.’ Mr Farage said later that he did not support the Russian invasion of Crimea, but insisted: ‘If you poke the Russian bear with a stick he will respond.’ Former Ukip leader Lord Pearson backed Mr Farage, saying: ‘Russia has been making it known for years that it couldn’t, can’t and won’t tolerate the Crimea coming under the sphere of influence of the corrupt octopus in Brussels.’ Mr Clegg, who clashed with Mr Farage on jobs and immigration in the first of two TV debates on the EU, said Ukip’s claims were shocking and an insult to democracy campaigners in Kiev who rose up after President Viktor Yanukovych rejected an association deal with the EU, preferring closer ties with Russia. Dozens were killed in the violence. ‘It shows quite how extreme people can be, like Nigel Farage, when their loathing of the European Union becomes so all-consuming that they even end up siding with Vladimir Putin in order to make their point,’ Mr Clegg told LBC radio. Russian soldiers and their dog in Crimea: Mr Farage said later that he did not support the Russian invasion of the Black Sea peninsula, but insisted: 'If you poke the Russian bear with a stick he will respond' International Development Minister Lynne Featherstone said of Mr Farage: ‘I expected him to be populist, to twist the facts and to blow his dog whistle on immigration. ‘What I didn’t expect was to hear him taking his talking points straight from the Kremlin. When the subject of Ukraine came up, Nigel Farage’s answer was “I agree with Vlad”.’ Mr Clegg faced his own difficulties after claiming in the debate that only 7 per cent of UK law originates in Brussels. It emerged that the Deputy Prime Minister’s figure relates only to primary legislation and the true figure is estimated at between 15 per cent and 50 per cent. ANALYSIS By DANIEL HANNAN, Conservative MEP . FARAGE CLAIMED: Seventy-five per cent of our laws come from the EU. CLEGG CLAIMED: It’s only 7 per cent. Seat of power? As much as half of Britain's laws are rooted in edicts handed down by the European Union, according to to a Commons Library briefing note . THE FACTS: Farage’s figure is an estimate based on two others – a survey by Germany’s Federal Justice Ministry which looked at every law passed in Germany and found 84 per cent emanated from Brussels, and the opinion of Luxembourg’s European Commissioner Viviane Reding who said the figure was 70 per cent. Farage, in effect, split the difference. Clegg said his 7 per cent figure was in a House of Commons Library briefing note. In fact, it mentioned the figure of 6.8 per cent only as a proportion of the UK’s primary legislation directly made by the EU. It added that several other laws were generated by EU rules, concluding: ‘All measurements have their problems and it is possible to justify any measure between 15 per cent and 50 per cent or thereabouts.’ VERDICT? Farage’s figure was sloppy, but Clegg’s was downright dishonest. CLEGG: Three million jobs are linked to our trade with the EU. If we were outside, those jobs would be at risk. FARAGE: We buy much more from the EU than we sell – £150billion a year compared to £100billion – and it’s inconceivable that the other EU states would jeopardise their exports to us simply because we withdrew from their political arrangements. THE FACTS: Clegg’s three million figure is a decade old and, in any case, the pro-European who came up with it has since disowned it. No one seriously claims that if Britain withdrew from the EU we would be excluded from the common market. Almost every other non-EU country – from Iceland and the Faroe Islands to Macedonia and Turkey – trades freely with the EU. Farage was right to point to the balance of our trade with the EU, which has been negative in 39 of the 40 years of our membership (while we have run a cumulative surplus with the rest of the world). VERDICT? Clear win for Farage. Clegg's claim that a withdrawal from the EU could send millions marching to the Jobcentre doesn't stand up . CLEGG: A Ukip leaflet had suggested that 29million Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants might settle in Britain whereas, in fact, the two countries’ joint populations are not even 29million. FARAGE: The figure had changed because a couple of million had already emigrated to other EU states. In any case, every one of the EU’s nearly 500million people has the right to settle in the UK. THE FACTS: The combined population of Romania and Bulgaria is 27.5million. Provisionally, the Office for National Statistics puts the total number from the two countries living in the UK (including those who had arrived before restrictions were lifted in January), below 200,000. Farage is right that the free movement of people is an inescapable requirement of EU membership – though this does not qualify them to free benefits. Ukip damaged its case by its hysterical predictions at the end of last year, and Clegg is right to point out that EU migrants to Britain have, so far, generated more in tax than they have claimed in welfare. VERDICT? Win on points for Clegg.","Ukip leader refuses to back down after criticism from three major parties .

Green MP Caroline Lucas has appeared in court today charged with blocking a highway and breaching the public order act after being arrested during an anti-fracking protest last year. Lucas arrived at court this morning along with a crowd of around 100 activists who waved flags, danced, and shouted slogans. As the court was shown footage of the moment Lucas was arrested, there were gasps and hisses from demonstrators in the public gallery. DVD footage taken during demonstrations against energy company Cuadrilla in Balcombe, West Sussex, showed Lucas being asked to move from an emergency access entrance where she was sitting arm-in-arm with other protesters. Despite warnings that she would be arrested, the 53-year-old did not move because she wanted to show solidarity to the other protesters, the trial at Brighton Magistratesâ€™ Court heard. An officer was heard asking her if there he was anything he could do which would make her move. After she refused she was taken away by police. Prosecutor Jonathan Edwards told the court a large camp had been formed around the entrance to the drilling site and that people had started locking themselves to each other, gates or vehicles. He said because of the number of protesters a lot of police officers were drafted in and section 14 of the Public Order Act invoked, which would stop demonstrators blocking access to the site. But on August 19, 300 demonstrators gathered outside the site meaning the main road had to be closed, the court heard. The court was told that at 1.10pm a loud hailer was used to read out the section 14 order to protesters and officers then entered the crowd to explain what was required. Lucas was arrested in August last year while taking part in an anti-fracking protest in Balcombe, West Sussex . Supporters danced, shouted slogans and waved banners outside court, and hissed when footage of the moment Lucas was arrested was shown inside the courtroom . Copies of the order were also given to demonstrators and police DVD footage showed Lucas with the order in her lap. Sussex Police temporary chief constable Giles York, who was deputy chief constable during last year's protests, told the court the order had been put in place after he was told up to 2,000 people from climate camp No Dash For Gas would be arriving at the site. He said: 'I thought it was necessary to give the officers at the scene the option of enforcing the section 14 order.' 'Trying to manage large crowds is very difficult. It's not merely a case of saying ""can you clear the entrance please"".' During police interview, the MP told police that when she sat down at 10.30am that day there was no indication of a designated area for protesters. She said had scanned the section 14 notice when it fell into her lap and understood the gist of it, but did not move because she wanted to show solidarity to the other protesters, the court heard. Mr Edwards told the court that the other defendants will argue that the section 14 notice was unnecessary, unreasonable and disproportionate and that they were unclear or unaware of the conditions imposed. Police say that Lucas ignored a section 14 order, banning activists from blocking access to the Cuadrilla site, and left a designated area for demonstrators . During a previous police interview Lucas said there was no indication of a designated area for protesters that morning, that she understood the gist of the section 14, but didn't move in order to show solidarity . Around 100 supporters gathered outside the court before the trial, including politician and former page 3 girl Marina Pepper and Vanessa Vine, a Balcombe resident and founder of Frack Free Sussex. They waved placards and banners, danced, sang and played music, cheering as Lucas and the other defendants walked up to the court building together. The defendants stopped briefly outside for Sheila Menon to read a statement on their behalf. She said: 'We are here to defend ourselves. Balcombe is the start of a major struggle over the search and exploitation of yet more fossil fuels - and the stakes could hardly be higher. 'The latest science suggests that as much as 80 per cent of known fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground if we are to have any hope of avoiding dangerous climate change.' Hydraulic fracturing - or fracking - involves pumping water and chemicals deep into the ground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas. Four other demonstrators who are on trial with Lucas (not pictured) are expected to argue that the section 14 was unnecessary, unreasonable, and disproportionate, according to the prosecution . Supporters of fracking argue it will slash energy costs, but opponents argue that it harms the environment, pollutes drinking water and will make the country further reliant on fossil fuels . It has been credited with slashing energy prices in the US, and has been hailed by supporters - including Chancellor George Osborne - as a way to cut bills and secure the UK's energy future. However, opponents have voiced fears that it could harm water resources, the surrounding environment and cause small earthquakes. Lucas, from Brighton, is charged with wilful obstruction of the highway and breaching Section 14 of the Public Order Act. Josef Dobraszczyk, 22, from Bristol, Ruth Jarman, 50, from Hartley Wintney, near Hook, Hampshire, Sheila Menon, 42, from north east London, and Ruth Potts, 39, from Totnes, Devon, are also in the dock charged with the same . offences. All five defendants deny the charges. The trail continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Brighton Green MP Caroline Lucas has appeared in court today .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . Shaving sales: The growing popularity of beards and the three-days stubble look has hit sales of Procter and Gamble grooming products . Procter and Gamble says the growing trend among men for beards and moustaches has hit their profits in the second quarter of the financial year. Sales of its grooming products such as Gillette razors were flat but the company was hopeful that the rising popularity of male body grooming - shaving on areas other than thew face - would offset the dip in profits. The company's chief financial officer Jon Moeller said that the growing popularity of the three-day stubble look in established markets such as America had hit sales of Gillette razors and shaving cream and Braun electric razors. But he hoped to take advantage of the growing trend for 'manscaping'. He told AFP: 'While the incidence of facial shaving is somewhat down, the incidence of body shaving is up, and we can take advantage of that and plan to do that as well.' The dip also coincided with 'movember' a charity scheme that encourages men to grow a moustache for the month of November. Procter & Gamble's second-quarter net income fell 16 percent to $3.43billion as the world's largest consumer products maker also suffered from a stronger dollar and flat sales in other areas. Sales in male grooming were flat, and sales of beauty products were down 15.5 per cent on a year ago. But its adjusted earnings beat Wall Street expectations and the company insisted its outlook remains optimistic. The Cincinnati-based company, whose products range from Tide detergent to Crest toothpaste and Gillette razors, is in the midst of a turnaround plan that includes focusing on its most profitable core businesses and cutting costs to save $10 billion by fiscal 2016. Out of fashion: Sales of Gillette razors have remained flat as men increasingly opt for the three day stubble look . Procter & Gamble, like other consumer products makers, has been trying to drive market share amid slow growth in developed markets. Emerging markets have been a growth driver, but there have been signs that the emerging market growth rate is slowing too. P&G said its sales results were in line with the overall consumer products market growth, from flat to up 1 percent in developed markets and up 7 to 8 percent in developing markets. Its market share growth overall was flat, and it held or grew market share in about 55 percent of its product and country categories. Excluding restructuring costs in the latest period, earnings were $1.21 per share, a penny above expectations of analysts surveyed by FactSet. Revenue rose less than 1 percent to $22.28 billion, short of the $22.34 billion analysts expected. The company reiterated that it expects 3 percent to 4 percent sales growth excluding acquisitions and currency exchange, and 5 percent to 7 percent earnings per share growth, excluding one-time items. Oppenheimer analyst Joseph Altobello said that second quarter results were largely as expected, with ""reasonably healthy"" sales and volume growth boosted by cost cuts. ""While encouraged by these results, we believe the necessary improvements at P&G will take time and the stock seems to already reflect further momentum,"" he said. He kept his ""Market Perform"" rating on the st . Procter and Gamble shares fell by 15 per cent to $79.18 on the news.","Sales of Gillette razors flat as 'incidence of facial shaving is down'

"By . Jamie Carragher . He has been voted the world’s best player and is an icon for club and country. He is rewriting the record books and has won a treasure chest of trophies, including the biggest in club football. Cristiano Ronaldo has enjoyed a career that 95 per cent of players could only dream about but, for all that, it is lacking a game or goal to catapult him alongside the greatest there have been. Think about those who occupy football’s highest echelon, the names that span the ages: Pele and Alfredo Di Stefano, Diego Maradona, Johan Cruyff and Marco van Basten, on to Zinedine Zidane and Lionel Messi. No 1: Ronaldo shows off his Ballon d'Or award at the Santiago Bernabeu back in January . Iconic moment: Pele is held aloft in the Maracana after inspiring Brazil to 1970 World Cup glory . One-man show: Diego Maradona is best remembered for winning the 1986 World Cup with Argentina . The common bond is a defining moment. Di Stefano won five European Cups with Real Madrid, scoring in every final. With Maradona, it’s the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. For Van Basten, that volley against Russia to help win the 1988 European Championship. If scoring two goals to win the World Cup for France in 1998 wasn’t enough for Zidane, four years later against Bayer Leverkusen at Hampden Park he conjured a volley from the gods — possibly the greatest goal in the Champions League era — to give Real their ninth European Cup. Messi sits easily alongside them. He, remember, has scored goals to clinch two Champions League finals, strikes in Rome and at Wembley that glossed all his other extraordinary achievements. I’ve always felt the greatest need those distinguishing moments. Do not take my argument as a criticism of Ronaldo. He is a player for whom I have the utmost admiration and I can’t wait to see him in action on Sunday in El Clasico, the biggest game in football. Real and Barcelona always have the best players in the business. All-time great: Real Madrid's Alfredo di Stefano scores in the 1960 European Cup final . Volley good show: Marco van Basten hammers home his memorable goal in the Euro 1988 final . Best in the business: Zidane's wonderstrike at Hampden Park in 2002 confirmed his star class . That tag sits easily with Ronaldo, who is producing numbers not seen since the 1930s era of Dixie Dean. He moved past Ferenc Puskas in midweek with a double against Schalke, taking his tally to 242 goals in 236 games. Of those, 171 have come in La Liga. His ratio and consistency are extraordinary. He is made for El Clasico. If he initially found games against Barcelona difficult, he now thrives on them. And not even Messi has achieved what Ronaldo has done in this fixture, scoring in six consecutive matches. That shows how many levels he has raised his game. When he came to England, he had skill and speed but I never worried about playing against him. He didn’t have a great record against Chelsea or Liverpool, only scoring two goals against us, and one of those was a penalty in a 4-1 defeat. What I would say, though, is that in his final two years with Manchester United, he got as close as anyone to matching the levels set by Thierry Henry. Winner: But Ronaldo's performance in the 2008 Champions League final was not up there with Zidane's in 2002 . Strong and quick, two great feet and powerful in the air, he blossomed because his greatest strength is his work ethic. Look at his physique — he has got that from extra work in the gym, striving to keep ahead of the game. How about those free-kicks? Ronaldo’s technique for getting the ball to dip viciously has only come through practice. He will work twice as hard as some players with half his ability. You could see how much winning the Ballon d’Or (above) for a second time meant to him, when he was overcome with emotion. But, privately, I suspect he will feel a defining moment now could make him one of the best of all time, not just one of the best of his generation. So, how does he do that? I don’t believe Portugal will win the World Cup but he has the potential to be top scorer in Brazil. You only have to consider his hat-trick against Sweden in the play-offs last November to appreciate the added dimension he gives to his national side. Magic moment: Lionel Messi celebrates scoring in the 2011 Champions League final at Wembley . That leaves the Champions League. People will say Ronaldo has scored in a Champions League final but neither his goal nor  performance in Moscow defined that game in the manner of Steven Gerrard and Didier Drogba respectively when Liverpool (2005) and Chelsea (2012) won it. Real will be confident of reaching the semi-finals now after being drawn against Borussia Dortmund, and if Ronaldo could lead them to the final in Lisbon, he would have the perfect stage to deliver the performance of a lifetime. His first couple of seasons at the Bernabeu were complicated because Real were competing with the greatest Barcelona team of all time but, even still, his trophy haul of one La Liga title and a solitary Copa del Rey does not do justice to his talents. It is looking like he will win La Liga again this season but is that enough for Real, given their history in Europe? Is it enough for Ronaldo? If he was never to win the Champions League with Real, how would their supporters view him? On the brink of greatness: Could the Champions League final be Ronaldo's stage? That’s why I feel he needs something else to set him apart and that’s why a triumphant display in Lisbon on May 24 could be his destiny. Should he get the goal to give Real their 10th triumph in the finest competition of all, he would finally have the legacy his work and desire so richly deserve. Moyes faces big dilemma over £37m Mata . Manchester United got a great lift when they beat Olympiacos on Wednesday with the kind of pacy, energetic performance you expect of them. The displays of Ryan Giggs and Danny Welbeck in that 3-0 win, however, mean David Moyes faces a couple of big decisions, because their input came from positions Moyes has tried to strengthen by spending £27.5million on Marouane Fellaini and £37m on Juan Mata. You could see the impact Giggs and Welbeck had on Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie. United suddenly had pace and penetration in their movement, while Giggs’s brilliant range of passing gave them space to run into and opportunities in front of goal. Masterclass: Ryan Giggs was outstanding in the heart of United's midfield on Wednesday night . Oh, Danny boy: Welbeck put in an impressive shift for United in Mata's absence . So it will be interesting to see how Moyes deploys his two major signings going forward and how he shapes his team, as you cannot imagine he has spent £65m for them to be bit-part performers. Neither Fellaini nor Mata are quick and on a pitch as big as the one at Old Trafford, a lack of pace is always highlighted. Mata reminds me of Dimitar Berbatov. He was brilliant for Tottenham and he looked every inch a Manchester United player before he signed. But White Hart Lane has a smaller pitch than Old Trafford and Berbatov didn’t have the speed to get around it. Similarly, Mata stood out at Stamford Bridge, which is also tight. There is no doubt he has talent but does Mata have the legs for Old Trafford’s wide open spaces? Back in action: Mata is expected to return for United against West Ham on Saturday . My top five... Escape Artists . This has been a season when the clubs frantically fighting relegation have changed managers in the middle of the campaign to try to save themselves. Will West Bromwich’s Pepe Mel, Felix Magath of Fulham or Cardiff’s Norwegian import Ole Gunnar Solskjaer be as successful as this quintet? 1 Joe Royle (Everton 1994-95): Royle was already a club legend before he pulled Everton back from the brink. They were bottom when he took over from Mike Walker in November 1994 but finished five points above the relegation zone and won the FA Cup for good measure. The Great Escape: Joe Royle (second left) celebrates Everton's 1995 FA Cup triumph . 2 Alan Curbishley (West Ham 2006-07): When he arrived six months after West Ham had taken Liverpool to the wire in the FA Cup final, Curbishley (right) looked to have jumped on to a sinking ship. Seven wins from the last nine matches, including a  1-0 win at Old Trafford, saw him beat the odds. 3 Roy Hodgson (Fulham 2007-08): It wasn’t as bleak for Hodgson as the situation now facing Magath, but Fulham had won just twice and were 18th in the table when he was appointed in December 2007. Twelve points from their final five fixtures saw them stay up. 4 Harry Redknapp (Portsmouth 2005-06): It was a controversial call to bring Redknapp back after he had spent some of the last season at Southampton — but it worked a treat. Pompey finished four points clear of the drop zone. 5 David Pleat (Luton 1982-83): Pleat has to make the line-up because I vividly remember him running across Maine Road, wearing brown shoes and dancing a jig, after he had saved Luton and condemned opponents Manchester City to the drop. Last-gasp: Pleat (centre) tries to keep the peace after he ran on the pitch following Luton's win at City in 1983 .","Cristiano Ronaldo is in the form of his life heading into Sunday's Clasico .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Cronyism row: Former Labour MP James Purnell has hired Godric Smith, a former Balir spin chief, to the BBC . The BBC was accused of ‘stuffing its senior ranks with ex-Blairites’ yesterday after it hired one of the former prime minister’s spin chiefs as a key PR adviser. Godric Smith – Tony Blair’s official spokesman between 2001 and 2004 – was handed a contract thought to be worth at least £100,000 by former Labour minister James Purnell, who himself joined the BBC in February. The latest appointment reignited concerns over the corporation’s links with the Left leaving it open to charges of political ‘cronyism’ and prompting one Tory MP to brand the BBC the ‘Blairite Broadcasting Corporation’. Mr Smith’s public relations agency Inc – only founded in April – has been hired  to ‘provide external perspective and expertise’ to the BBC’s own communications team. The deal was signed off by the corporation’s new strategy chief Mr Purnell, a government whip under Mr Blair before becoming culture secretary and then work and pensions secretary. Former Guardian deputy editor Ian Katz was also appointed editor of Newsnight in May. Last night MPs warned that Blairites are ‘very rapidly infiltrating’ the BBC and criticised the corporation for failing to run an open recruitment process. It is also believed Mr Smith’s agency, Incorporated London, was hired without a formal tender. In February, the BBC came under fire for handing Mr Purnell his £295,000 job without interviewing any other candidates. Tory MP Philip Davies, who sits on the culture, media and sport committee, warned the new appointments would exacerbate political bias. He said: ‘The BBC is indulging in Blairite cronyism. Lord Hall [director general] has recruited his New Labour friends and they are recruiting their New Labour friends. The BBC is biased enough as it is. Now it is becoming the Blairite Broadcasting Corporation. It’s a joke. The only problem is it’s not funny.’ Former Prime Minister Tony Blair pictured with former senior adviser Godric Smith . John Whittingdale, Tory chairman of the same Commons committee, said Mr Smith’s contract ‘looks like another old pal appointment’, adding: ‘When there have already been concerns expressed about the left-wing leanings of the BBC, I do think this appointment certainly adds to the impression that the BBC is staffed by a centre left, Blairite clique. ‘It was an unwise appointment for the BBC to make.’ Tory MP Rob Wilson added: ‘It is deeply worrying the BBC is stuffing its senior ranks with ex Blairites and Labour sympathisers.’ Although Mr Smith was a civil servant rather than a Labour Party employee, he was a key figure in Downing Street during Mr Blair’s time in office. After succeeding Alastair Campbell as the PM’s official spokesman, he became head of strategic communications. His appointment follows a string of recent top jobs for left-wing officials at the BBC. When Mr Purnell was appointed in February, critics said it was ‘unprecedented’ to hand such a job to a partisan figure. A BBC spokesman insisted that  the contract to Mr Smith’s agency complied with its own guidelines. He added: ‘The BBC has appointed Inc to provide external perspective and expertise on a number of marketing and communications projects. This is a vital part of the way in which the BBC manages its reputation.’","Godric Smith hired by James Purnell, who recently joined BBC .

Mr Cameron said: 'Bob Crow’s Tube strike is plain wrong and he should call it off today. 'His shameful plans will bring misery to millions of hardworking families in London. Ed Miliband should condemn the strike immediately — no ifs and no buts,' he told the Evening Standard. The London Chamber of Commerce suggests the action will cost £50million-a-day, or £200million across the four days of strikes. The Prime Minister's strongly-worded attack comes after London Mayor Boris Johnson clashed with Mr Crow on live radio.

'totally pointless' and admitted that he had not spoken directly to Mr . Crow since 'a few years ago'. He said: 'I can't possibly sit . down and talk to Bob Crow when he is not negotiating with our team, . with the London Underground staff and they are threatening a totally . pointless and, definitely will be, debilitating strike.' Appearing . on LBC 97.3, he said: 'There are no compulsory redundancies here. Nobody is being forced out and actually we have so far had more than . 1,000 expressions of interest in voluntary redundancies, so we are . already there.' But minutes later Mr Crow appeared as a called on the mayor's phone-in to claim he would 'love' to call off the strike. 'We are not here to score points - all we want is an opportunity to negotiate about the Tube,' Mr Crow said. 'We are asking you to listen to our point of view. We would love to call the strike off.' Mr Crow accused the mayor of refusing to suspend the ticket office closures. But Mr Johnson replied: 'That is complete nonsense. We are more than happy to engage on these issues. Of course there are job losses involved but there are no compulsory redundancies. 'We have already had more than 1,000 people showing an interest in voluntary redundancy. 'Call off this pointless strike which will do nothing other than cost your members their wages.' Mr Crow said later it was clear the mayor was still refusing to meet unions. Labour's shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: 'Nobody wants strikes and both sides should now get back around the negotiating table and sort this out as a matter of urgency. 'It is disappointing that the mayor and Transport for London have not reached a resolution with the unions ahead of this strike.' The chief executive of a central London casino attacked the strike, saying it would hit an industry exhibition being attended by representatives from around the world. Simon Thomas, chief executive of Hippodrome Casino in Leicester Square, said it was 'frankly embarrassing' that the exhibition at the ExCeL Centre would be disrupted by the industrial action. 'Gaming industry executives from across the world are in London this week and it is outrageous that this strike is being held. 'Just when the economy is recovering we have this prehistoric attitude, which is not welcome.' Mr Crow and Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) general secretary Manuel Cortes have accused Boris Johnson of refusing to meet them to discuss the closure of ticket offices, and the pair went to City Hall to try to confront him. The Mayor's official spokesman said: 'Mr Crow and Mr Cortes are now grandstanding. If they were really serious about meeting the mayor they wouldn't have called a strike in the middle of a consultation, a strike that 70 per cent of members haven't voted for. 'Instead they could have engaged constructively with TfL before we ever reached Acas, where only yesterday they refused a fresh offer of dialogue which would involve extending the consultation period. The mayor's door is open if they call off this pointless strike.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Old habits die hard: An unhealthy lifestyle - along with the fact that we are all living longer - will contribute to a rise in cancer rates, according to research . The number of people suffering cancer will almost double worldwide within the next 20 years because of our unhealthy lifestyle, according to new research. Britain and other rich nations will see a surge in tumours affecting the lung, breast, prostate and bowel owing to unhealthy lifestyle factors and an ageing population. Higher-income countries tend to have greater levels of obesity and alcohol consumption and lower levels of exercise, which boost cancer risks. Meanwhile, less well off countries will face a dramatic rise in forms of the disease caused by infection, such as cervical cancer. In the first study of its kind, scientists calculated the global burden of 12.7million new cases in 2008 will increase to 22.2 million by 2030 - more than 75 percent more. Dr Freddie Bray, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in Lyon, France, said: 'Cancer is already the leading cause of death in many high-income countries and is set to become a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the next decades in every region of the world. 'This study serves as an important reference point in drawing attention to the need for global action to reduce the increasing burden of cancer.' The developing world will feel the brunt, with the poorest countries experiencing a projected rise of more than 90 percent. Dr Bray and colleagues analysed varying patterns of incidence and mortality of different types of cancer between countries as measured by the United Nationâ€™s Human Development Index (HDI) which is based on life expectancy, education and gross domestic product per head. They found disease rates and the burden of some types of cancer such as cervical and stomach seem to be mainly declining in countries changing towards higher levels of human development. Living for the moment: Drinking to excess can create problems for us later in life (Posed by models) But the reduction is likely to be offset by a substantial increase in the types of cancer more associated with a â€˜Westernisedâ€™ lifestyle including breast, prostate and bowel tumours. The study published online in The Lancet Oncology used data from GLOBOCAN, a database compiled by the IARC comprising of estimates of cancer incidence and mortality in 2008 in 184 countries worldwide. The seven most common forms of the disease are lung, breast, bowel, stomach, prostate, liver and cervical. The researchers said countries with a low HDI, mainly those in sub-Saharan Africa, currently experience a high incidence of cancers associated with infection, particularly cervical cancer and, dependent on the region or country, liver and stomach tumours. But countries with a higher HDI such as the UK, Australia, Russia, and Brazil have a greater number of lung cancer cases caused by smoking, and forms of the disease triggered by reproductive risk factors, obesity and diet such as breast, prostate and bowel tumours. The study also revealed prostate and breast cancer rates appear to be rising in most countries currently with medium, high or very high levels of HDI whereas stomach and cervical cancer are mainly falling. The researchers said the results provide a startling indicator of likely global cancer trends over the next few decades. The research follows a World Cancer Fund report published earlier this year that warned new cases of cancer could rise by 30 per cent in the UK by 2030, due to unhealthy lifestyle choices and an ageing population.","Britain will see surge in tumours affecting the lung, breast, prostate and bowel owing to unhealthy lifestyle factors and an ageing population ."

"By . Emma Innes . A premature baby born weighing just 1lb has defied the odds to reach her first birthday - despite being so small she had to be kept alive in a sandwich bag. Miracle baby Lucia Sansbury weighed less than half a bag of sugar when she was born more than three months early. She also needed emergency treatment to repair her bowel and laser surgery to save her eyesight. Lucia Sansbury was so small when she was born that she had to be put in a sandwich bag to keep her warm . She was so small that medics had to improvise by placing her in clear plastic sandwich bag to keep her warm. One year on, little Lucia celebrated the first birthday that her parents Emma and Steve Sansbury feared she would never see on February 19. The couple from Redruth, Cornwall, endured five failed IVF treatments and two miscarriages before Lucia arrived 13 weeks early. She was delivered at the Royal Cornwall Hospital under the supervision of renowned consultant Aylur Rajasri. Mrs Sansbury, 39, said: ‘We all knew she would be small but I don't think anyone expected her to be quite that small. ‘Staff at Plymouth said she was the size of a 22-week gestation baby.’ Emma Sansbury (pictured with Lucia now) gave birth at 27 weeks but Lucia was the size of a baby at 22 weeks . Lucia had to have bowel surgery and laser eye surgery after her very early birth . The careers adviser added: 'I had to have an emergency caesarean. She would not have survived a normal birth. They kept her inside me as long as possible because every day helps. 'When she was born they basically said it was a 50/50 because she was so small. They needed to get a line into her to deliver the medicine and if that failed she would die. 'They wanted to see how she reacted when they got her out to see if she was a fighter and if she was they would do everything they could. 'She cried the moment she delivered, then she wriggled. It was only the tiniest little cry but she was making an incredible effort - we knew then and there she really was a fighter.' Doctors have realised Lucia was small for her age because her mother's placenta was not functioning properly. Lucia, who now weighs 14lbs, spent the first eight weeks of her life battling for survival at Derriford Hospital, in Plymouth, before being transferred to St Michael's Hospital, in Bristol. Lucia is now one and seems to be healthy but it is not yet known if she has suffered long-term health problems . In total, she spent six months in hospital before being well enough to go home. She had to have a damaged section of her bowel removed and a temporary colostomy bag fitted while her bowel matured. She also underwent laser surgery on her eyes. Mr and Mrs Sansbury celebrated Lucia's first birthday last week with a party for family and friends. The family also asked people to donate money to the Cots for Tots appeal, which buys specialist incubators, and to Derriford Hospital. It may be years before they know if Lucia is suffering from any long-term problems. Mrs Sansbury said: ‘Lucia's lungs are really good but we won't know if there are any other problems for possibly years. When she was born, Lucia weighed less than half a bag of sugar . ‘Lucia is lovely and when your baby has had to fight just to survive, you are just glad you have them regardless of what problems may come.’ Mr Rajasri, a consultant in maternal and foetal medicine who specialises in high-risk pregnancies, said: ‘They were an incredible family to work with and they were very brave. ‘I call Lucia my miracle baby. Their story really shows the difference we can make.’ Mrs Sansbury added: 'We are just so grateful to all the medical staff who helped us. They were just so brilliant. 'There is no doubt Lucia would not have survived the pregnancy without what consultant Raji did. 'We had been trying for a baby for three years and this was out sixth IVF attempt. 'IVF is a rollercoaster and I certainly wouldn't want to go through it all again. But when I look at Lucia I see it that it was all worthwhile. 'She's feisty and brave - a real little fighter. I'm so proud of her. Babies can be incredibly resilient things.'","Lucia Sansbury, now one, was born prematurely at just 27 weeks .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Anderson Cooper has tweeted his amazement at hearing his late father's voice for the first time in more than 30 years after a recording of a 1970s radio show was posted online. Wyatt Cooper was an author, actor and screenwriter who suffered a heart attack while undergoing open-heart surgery and died on January 5, 1978, at the age of 50. After hearing the recording of his father’s voice on Tuesday, Cooper tweeted: ‘Extraordinary. This is the first time I am hearing my father’s voice since I was ten years old.’ Family portrait: The Coopers photographed in their Long Island home in 1972.

The death of his father while he was still a boy is a tragedy that Cooper says has been a major influence on how he has lived his life. He considers his father's book . Families to be ‘sort of a guide on...how he would have wanted me to live . my life and the choices he would have wanted me to make. And so I feel . very connected to him.’ Cooper was born on June 3, 1967, in New York City, the younger son of Wyatt Cooper and heiress and New York socialite Gloria Vanderbilt.

"By . Jane Fryer . PUBLISHED: . 13:25 EST, 14 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:34 EST, 14 March 2014 . Barely three hours into our stay in Copenhagen, and we are obsessed. Not just with all that pickled herring and its alarming tendency to repeat on you. Or the wonderful restaurants and dark bread and handsome architecture and the very attractive men. Or even the alarming number of gigantic, wiry red beards bobbing about the streets. Apparently big, red beards are all the rage at the moment, which is serendipitous for the British Museum’s new Viking exhibition which opened in London this month. No, our obsession is a little shallower. Drama: Picturesque Copenhagen felt like a huge movie set for Scandi-drama fan Jane Fryer . Because, if you’ve watched as many Danish box-sets as my husband and I — three series of The Killing, two of Borgen and two of The Bridge, for starters — Copenhagen is one enormous film set. Everywhere you look, it’s familiar. The Parliament buildings, where Borgen’s Prime Minister Birgitte Nyborg click-clacks about in very tight suits and shiny heels, negotiating like mad with the Centre Left, or the Moderates, or whoever it is this week. There are the docks, bound to be overflowing with murder victims. And the bridge to Sweden which The Bridge detectives Saga and Martin whizz over every ten minutes in their quest for national security in both Denmark and Sweden. Sadly, we never quite made it to the five-mile long Oresund Bridge — we were planning on taking the train to Malmo while we alternately sang the haunting theme music to The Bridge and said ‘tak’ (Danish for ‘thank you’) to each other, but for some reason we just couldn’t leave the opulent splendour of the brilliantly luxurious Hotel D’Angleterre. (I have never stayed in a hotel room with quite so many soft towels or Bang & Olufsen products). Famous locals: The Danish city is the backdrop to popular TV dramas The Bridge, featuring detectives Martin Rohde and Saga Noren (l) and The Killing whose main character Sarah Lund (r) has become a global style icon . Tense: Popular show Borgen follows the political dramas of (l-r) Katrine Fonsmark, Birgitte Nyborg Christensen and Jeremy Welsh . Over the past few years, Copenhagen, Denmark and indeed, pretty much everything Scandinavian (apart from perhaps their 22 million intensively farmed pigs), has become super cool. They boast Noma and Geranium — two of the best (and most expensive) restaurants in the world, amazing social welfare (thanks to astronomical taxes), endless happiness (Danes routinely come out top on global happiness surveys — although worryingly, they’re also in second place for the number of anti-depressants consumed per capita), fabulously stylish design, Lego and, more recently, the slew of TV drama series that have taken us all by storm. Even their royal family is cool. Queen . Margrethe II (who’s been on the throne since 1972) studied at Cambridge, . the Sorbonne and the London School of Economics, speaks Danish, . English, French, Swedish and German, is an accomplished painter and . fashion designer and, aged 73, is a committed chain smoker — though not . in public any more. Award-winning: Copenhagen restaurant Noma is often hailed as one of the world's best . The shops (particularly Illum — a bit . like Liberty, but calmer, sleeker and more stylish) are quirky and . eclectic, and full of things you desperately want to buy, shouldn’t . because the exchange rate isn’t great and then do anyway. Such . as my husband’s new (very slim-fitted) shirt covered in daisies. And . the enormous industrial-style pendant lights we ordered as soon as we . got home. And the three vast loaves of the world’s best (and probably most expensive) sourdough bread from the Meyers Bageri on Kongensgade (owned by Claus Meyer of Noma) which we rammed into our hand luggage and have been eating ever since. The Danes are big on cosiness — or Hygge, as they call it. They’re the masters of attractive ambience — candles, wonderful lighting, pleasing lines and smooth wood, even in McDonald’s. Given time was short over a weekend, we spent it mostly being ‘cosy’. From the launchpad of our incredibly central hotel, we concentrated our efforts in an array of cafes, wine bars (particularly the brilliant Ved Stranden 10, near Christiansborg Palace), restaurants and, thanks to visiting in the middle of the ‘Wondercool Copenhagen jazz and art festival’, experienced Danish ‘supergroup’, the Mountains (surprisingly good) and the truly wonderful Danish pianist Carsten Dahl. Harbour view: Frederik's Church is part of the city's 'masculine and pleasing' architecture . Even my husband — who with a name like Miles Davis knows his jazz — was impressed. So impressed (and refreshed, courtesy of the Ved Stranden wine bar) that he didn’t notice when the lovely waitress at the Jazzhus Montmartre accidentally charged us for someone else’s dinner.‘It seems a bit expensive. Everyone knows Copenhagen’s not cheap, but £76 for two glasses of red wine.’ And it is expensive. Of course it is. It’s Denmark. But it’s worth it. And the best thing about it is that, while it’s all lovely and stylish, it’s not that super-sleek Italian stylishness where you end up feeling dowdy and lumpy by comparison. It’s far more accessible. The architecture is masculine and pleasing, without being twee. The people are attractive (particularly, it turns out, the red-bearded Viking crew), but not ridiculously so. And joy of joys, they drink enthusiastically, smoke like chimneys (perhaps the reason they have the highest cancer rates on the planet) dance badly and are highly cultured. This is, after all, a people who, back in the dark ages ironed their clothes, combed their hair and scooped wax from their ears with specially designed spoons. Scene of the crime: The imposing Oresund Bridge between Denmark and Sweden . Unlike Italians, you can actually imagine living among them, fancying them, them fancying you. It helps, of course, that they all speak English better than we do and are incredibly friendly. Our last (herring-free) morning was spent mostly making a list of all the things we’d do the next time we come — hug the Little Mermaid, potter around the Tivoli Gardens (closed in winter), visit the extraordinarily beautiful old Stock Exchange building, have dinner in the brilliantly bouncy Cafe Victor on Ny Ostergade — and gushing to our taxi driver Hans about how brilliant all the Danish murder TV series are. ‘It’s always good to be good at something,’ he says. ‘And murder’s as good as anything, isn’t it? But here we mostly watch Midsomer Murders and Cash In The Attic — that’s a very good programme. You should watch it some time.’ Picture perfect: Pretty painted houses line the Nyhavn canal . British Airways (0844 493 0787, www.ba.com) flies to Copenhagen from . Heathrow, from £104 return. Double rooms at the Hotel D’Angleterre, . dangleterre.dk start at £392 room only.","The Danish city is the backdrop to Borgen, The Bridge and The Killing .

The two can then be seen arguing inside a nightclub before up-and-coming grime artist . Joshua is caught on camera leaving on his own at 10.41pm. Scroll down for video . Armani Mitchell (circled) is seen entering a nightclub minutes before he stabbed Joshua Ribera to death . Just . seconds later, Mitchell strides out purposefully and follows his love rival across the car park. He then pulled out a four-inch flick knife and plunged it into Joshua's chest - piercing his heart - before sprinting . away. A court heard as the teenager lay dying, he managed to whisper 'Switch' - the . nickname of his attacker - to paramedics who were treating him. Shouting . broke out in court as Judge William Davis QC convicted Mitchell of murder - prompting two members of the public gallery to be arrested on suspicion of . contempt of court. Sentencing Mitchell a . minimum of 18 years, Judge Davis QC told him: 'You did not . intend to kill Joshua Ribera. 'Whatever it was that caused you to quarrel that night had built up over a matter of minutes. 'Neither of you had intended really serious harm to each other until the fatal moment. 'I . accept there was a lack of premeditation. Before you used the knife you . had already been struck once by Joshua Ribera in an earlier incident. He paced around looking for Joshua, an up-and-coming grime artist, who had been seen with his arms around Rudie Lee, the mother of Mitchell's daughter, at a memorial service . Then Mitchell (circled left) is seen confronting Joshua Ribera (circled right) before saying 'do you want me to wet you up?' - a street term for stabbing . Finally, CCTV captured Mitchell (circled foreground) following Joshua into the carpark (circled far right) where he was fatally stabbed . 'Immediately before you used it you were struck by him again. 'Your . criminal activity really only lasted for about 30 seconds, from the . time it took to leave the club, when you took out the knife to the . moment that you used it.' The pair had both been paying their respects to 16-year-old Kyle Sheehan - who was stabbed to death in 2012 - at a memorial service on September 20 last year. But an argument between the teenagers escalated throughout the night which led to Mitchell threatening Joshua saying 'Do you want me to wet you up?' - a street term for stabbing. He was then ejected by security staff but CCTV shows him returning to the TC's nightclub in Selly Oak, Birmingham 15 minutes later wearing a different set of clothes. After the attack, Joshua was taken to the city's Queen Elizabeth Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery but he died in the early hours of September 21. Mitchell, of Birmingham, handed himself in to police later that day and admitting attacking Joshua but claimed he had never intended to kill him. He pleaded not guilty to murder but was found guilty on Thursday following a four-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court. Tragic: Tributes were paid to 'kind-hearted' Joshua Ribera, 18 (left). Armani Mitchell, also 18, was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, a minimum of 18 years, at Birmingham Crown Court . Detective Inspector Gary Plant, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Joshua Ribera needlessly lost his life, he was just 18 years of age and had a very promising future in the music industry, he had everything to live for' During the trial, the court heard the two had previously been friends and Mitchell had even appeared in one of Joshua's rap music videos. But there had been recent 'jealousy and bad blood' between the pair over Mitchell's ex-partner and the mother of his young daughter. One 16-year-old witness who saw the fatal attack on the night told the court: 'I saw Armani swing at Josh upwards. He lunged at him. I could not see anything in his hand. 'I ran straight away to Josh who had backed off. He was saying, ""What are you doing?"" 'He took off his top and showed me. Then I saw lots of blood. I put my arm around him.' Giving evidence, Mitchell claimed he had only intended to scare Joshua and was unaware he had stabbed him until the following day. Paying tribute to her son after the hearing, Joshua's mum Alison Cope, 40, said: 'I have never known anyone loved as much as Josh. 'He was truly a genuine and unique person, so kind-hearted, so full of life and he had blossomed into a beautiful young man that anyone would be very, very proud of. 'He was an amazing and special person. No one had the right to take him from this world as he didn't want to go, he wanted to live, to love and to be successful. 'He was ambitious and truly beautiful inside and out. I loved him with all my heart and soul and now my heart and soul are broken without him. 'Josh loved life and had matured so much in the last 12 months, he knew exactly where he wanted to be with his life and to be an honest positive member of society.' Detective Inspector Gary Plant, from West Midlands Police, added: 'Joshua Ribera needlessly lost his life, he was just 18 years of age and had a very promising future in the music industry, he had everything to live for. After his death, Joshua's album 2 Real, recorded under the name Depzman, topped the iTunes hip-hop chart . 'Armani Mitchell has been convicted of his murder, after inflicting one single stab wound to the heart. 'This murder has impacted greatly upon a lot of people, not only the friends and family of Joshua, but those of Armani too. 'Both families are devastated, as both have lost someone close to them. Albeit in different ways, both families are victims to knife crime. 'I hope that in time the pain that is being felt from Joshua's death will ease, but for certain it will not totally go away.' Rapper Joshua was a talented grime artist better known by his performing name 'Depzman' and pals said he was on his way to fame. He already had an album available on online music stores and several of his videos regularly attracted thousands of hits elsewhere on the internet. After his death, friends and fans pushed his album '2 Real' to top the iTunes hip-hop chart as they downloaded it in tribute. Star rapper Wretch 32 also tweeted: 'R.I.P depzman.

Scientists in Mexico's Laguna Ojo de Liebre, or Scammon’s Lagoon, discovered the dead calves, believed to have been miscarried as a result of their disability. Conjoined twins have occurred in other species, notably fin, sei and minke whales, however, research has not found any published cases of conjoined gray whale twins. Scroll down for video . Scientists in Mexico's Laguna Ojo de Liebre, discovered the dead gray whale calves, believed to have been miscarried as a result of their disability. The carcass is only about seven feet long, versus the normal 12 to 16 feet for new-born gray whales. Alisa Schulman-Janiger, an American Cetacean Society researcher, pointed out that the twins were severely underdeveloped and wondered whether the birth or stillbirth might also have killed the mother. The twins’ carcass has been collected for study. Images were posted by the Guerrero Negro Verde Facebook page, with the translated statement: ‘Unfortunately, the specimen died. [Its] survival was very difficult.’ New discovery: The conjoined calves could be the first documented case of Siamese twin gray whales . Unfortunate tale: The twins were so underdeveloped it is believed they were miscarried by their mother who may also have died giving birth to them . Step forward for science: The seven feet long carcass has been collected by scientists for study . Migration: Pacific gray whales travel south from the Arctic to Mexico for the winter months, during which time it is believed the twins were born . Gray whales are arriving in the lagoons along the Baja California peninsula, after a nearly 6,000-mile journey from Arctic home waters. They give birth during the southbound journey, or in the lagoons, and nurse their calves for several weeks before embarking on their northbound journey back to the Bering and Chukchi seas. According to NOAA, the Pacific gray whale population numbers about 21,000. Most calves are born during the last week of December and the first two weeks of January.","Conjoined gray whale calves found dead in Mexican lagoon .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A newly-released report has revealed that two of Governor Chris Christie's aides were romantically involved leading up to last year's traffic closures. Bridget Anne Kelly, who infamously sent an email saying 'time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee', was reportedly dating Christie's former campaign manager Bill Stepien throughout much of his re-election race. The report, released today by a law firm Christie hired to investigate the scandal, said that the two had been a couple for months but had called things off a month before the George Washington Bridge lane closures. Under examination: Bridget Anne Kelly, the Christie aide who sent the infamous 'time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee' email, was reportedly dating one of her colleagues for months before the scandal . Close: Bill Stepien (left) was Christie's campaign manager until April when he stepped down and Kelly took over, and it appears that is when their romantic relationship took off . Stepien, 36, worked as the Republican governor's deputy chief of staff and then when he left the post in April to become Christie's campaign manager, he was replaced by Kelly, 41. 'At . some point after Stepien’s departure to run the campaign, Kelly and . Stepien became personally involved, although, by early August 2013, . their personal relationship had cooled, apparently at Stepien’s choice, . and they largely stopped speaking,' the report by Randy Mastro states. 'Because Stepien was her ""benefactor,"" Kelly relied heavily on him during this transition' ahead of their August break up. The . report also concluded that the governor was not involved in a plot to . create gridlock near a major bridge as part of a political retribution . scheme. The taxpayer-funded . report released by Mastro, a former federal prosecutor, relies on . interviews with Christie and other officials in his administration and . 250,000 documents, many of them emails and text messages. Chris Christie's government funded lawyer claims the New Jersey governor had nothing to do with the George Washington Bridge scandal . 'We . found that Governor Christie had no knowledge beforehand of this George . Washington Bridge realignment idea,' Mastro said at a news conference. His report comes out ahead of any results from independent investigations by federal prosecutors and a special committee of state lawmakers. Some of the key figures would not cooperate with Mastro's investigation, leading Democrats to question the credibility of the report and its thoroughness. Assembly Select Committee on Investigation Co-Chair John Wisniewski released a statement effectively calling the report an attempt by Christie to move past the issue without critically examining the scandal. 'Lawyers hired by and paid by the Christie administration itself to investigate the governor’s office who then say the governor and most of his office did nothing wrong will not be the final word on this matter,' he said in a statement. During a media conference call Thursday, Wisniewski said that the mention of Kelly and Stepien's romantic entanglements was 'irrelevant' especially because neither were interviewed for the report so there was no clear connection between their love life and the lane closures. 'It is very difficult to tell who is telling the truth when you don't hear from both sides,' he said. 'It reads more like a novel than a work of fact.' Defending the report at a news conference Thursday, Mastro said, 'We believe we have gotten to the truth or we wouldn't be reporting it.' The September closure of lanes near the bridge that caused four days of massive gridlock in the community of Fort Lee have become a major scandal for Christie, a possible 2016 Republican presidential contender. Christie said on a radio show Wednesday that the events will not affect his decisions about his political future. In his view: Governor Christie's office hired Randy Mastro, a former federal prosecutor, to investigate the scandal and the report released Thursday declares clears Christie of wrongdoing . The lawyer hired by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to review a traffic-blocking scandal that has engulfed Christie's administration released this report which a published report said clears the governor of any role in the plot . The report, issued at Mastro's New York law office, concludes that former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey official David Wildstein and ex-Christie aide Bridget Kelly were behind the closures and that they were targeting Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich. But it did not conclude why they wanted to hurt the Democrat and said there was no evidence that it was because he refused to endorse Christie for re-election last year. Mastro says that Kelly, who did not cooperate with the report, tried to cover her tracks when Christie began asking what happened last year by asking a colleague to delete an email about the plot but the other staffer retained the email anyway, the report says. Mastro also says that Wildstein suggested he mentioned traffic issues in Fort Lee to Christie at public event during the lane realignment. Wildstein says Christie did not recall it being brought up and if it was, it would not have registered as significant to Christie — something Christie has said before. The report also finds that a claim by Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer, that Christie's administration told her that Superstorm Sandy would be tied to a private redevelopment plan, is 'demonstrably false'. A spokesman for Zimmer did not immediately return a call. Mastro calls for Christie's office staffers to cease using personal email accounts for official business, eliminating the office where Kelly had worked and appointing an ethics officer in the governor's office. He also recommends major changes to the structure of Port Authority, an agency jointly run by the states of New York and New Jersey.","Report reveals that top Christie aides Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Stepien were romantically involved from April to August of last year .

The HMAS Success is leading the mission to find wreckage from Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 and deliver closure to the families of the doomed passengers, but experts warn the recovery operation is complicated and may be beyond the Australian warship's means. The Success was dispatched to locate two objects spotted by an RAAF Orion aircraft, a mission made even more crucial by the announcement from Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak that MH370 crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, killing all 239 people on board. The search was further complicated by adverse weather conditions Tuesday, but clearer conditions today paved the way for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) to resume the hunt for debris. The Success has yet to locate objects seen from the air. The 218 crew on board the HMAS Success have been tasked with trying to locate wreckage from the doomed airliner MH370, after several air crews and satellites spotted large objects in the Indian Ocean. The airliner was ruled to have crashed within the southern search zone, killing everyone on board . Spotlight search: The HMAS Success is spearheading the marine sweep for wreckage of the MH370, as families of the passengers struggle to confront the reality they loved ones were killed . A member of staff at satellite communications company Inmarsat, whose data led Malaysian authorities to conclude the plane definitely crashed in the Indian Ocean, points to a section of the search zone where radar pings were detected from the doomed plane . The vessel, which measures 515 feet (157 metres) in length and carries a crew of 218, is capable to some extent of recovering debris from the ocean. But defence expert John Blaxland from the Australian National University told News Corp the recovery mission may require intervention from the more heavily US Navy. 'It's not something weâ€™re good at,' he said. 'It's something we need the US Navy for. [But the mission is] at the limit of anyone's capability.'

'Morale is good and they are focused on the tasking we've been assigned to search for and locate any debris.

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated  Press Reporter . New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said that undergoing a weight-loss surgery just over a year ago was a 'life-changing decision.' Appearing on his monthly TownSquare Media radio show Wednesday night, Christie said he works out four days a week and has achieved better health. The 51-year-old governor has not revealed how many pounds he's shed so far, but he has become noticeably slimmer since secretly undergoing the stomach banding surgery last February. Scroll down for video . Then and now: It is estimated that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (pictured left in August 2012) has shed close to 100lbs (pictured Tuesday) since undergoing a Lap-Band surgery last February . Progress: The 51-year-old Republican said he works out four days a week and has achieved better health . He said he enjoys riding a stationary bike but does not like doing side-lift exercises with dumbbells. The possible 2016 Republican presidential candidate has said he's struggled with being overweight his entire adult life. According to a medical report released by Christie’s doctors last October, the governor has been struggling with high blood pressure and asthma, but was otherwise in good health. Nowadays, everywhere Mr Christie goes, he is showered with compliments on his trimmer figure from his constituents. ‘He looks amazing! He looks very healthy and happy and vibrant,’ Shannon Ruvelas told NJ.com said after a recent town hall meeting in Berkeley Township. ‘I’m expecting he’ll continue to look better.’ In response, the Republican governor usually smiles and says that he 'feels great.' Looking good: Christie, who is estimated to have shed around 100lbs so far, is getting compliments from constituents wherever he goes . While the usually outspoken Christie has kept mum about his goal weight, experts said he has lost 100lbs since last year. The 5-foot-11 politician underwent Lap-Band surgery in February 2013 and has since slimmed down to an estimated 320lbs. Amid speculations that the portly Mr Christie went under the knife with an eye to a potential presidential run in 2016, the government has maintained that his sole objective was to lead a healthier lifestyle. During yesterday's TownSquare Media radio show, Christie said he has not ruled out throwing his hat into the ring two years from now despite his aides' involvement in a traffic-blocking plot that has engulfed his administration. Watch more of Governor Christie's interview at TownSquare Media . Still a contender: Christie said he has not ruled out running for president in 2016 despite the politically damaging Bridge-gate scandal involving his aides . He said that nothing that has happened 'would make me think any differently about my ability to pursue that job or to perform in it.' The 51-year-old was considered an early front-runner for the Republican nomination, but his ranking has slipped since the Bridge-gate scandal broke. Mr Christie insisted he did not know about the political payback plot orchestrated by his aides, who blocked traffic near the George Washington Bridge apparently to punish a Democratic adversary.","Christie, 51, underwent Lap-Band surgery February 16, 2013 .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A new record for the longest ever table tennis rally has been set by a father and son who played for an incredible eight hours and 40 minutes. Peter and Daniel Ives continuously hit the ball 32,000 times, without even stopping for a toilet break, during the challenge on Sunday at Plumstead Radical Club in London. The pair were aiming to play for 10 hours but stopped when 50-year-old bricklayer, Mr Ives, missed the shot and the ball hit his finger. Scroll down for video . Daniel Ives, left and Peter Ives, right who have broken the world record for the longest ever table tennis rally, which last eight hours and 40 minutes . The father and son completed the feat by drinking . energy drinks, eating Jaffa Cakes and even taking painkillers, due to . their aching shoulders to beat the previous record by just 10 minutes. The challenge was broadcast live on the internet to more than 7,000 table tennis fans. Daniel Ives, of Bradley Stoke, Bristol, said: 'The last five minutes was very nerve-wracking heading towards the record. The father and son completed the challenge by eating Jaffa Cakes and drinking energy drinks and even taking painkillers for their aching muscles . The pair broke the previous world record by 10 minutes and each player hit the ball an average of 16,000 times during the rally . 'The whole room went completely silent. Then there was a huge cheer when we passed the mark. 'I have never put so much concentration into one thing, I had to remain focussed every second throughout. 'It was so difficult getting to the record and the last five minutes felt like hours. The pair kept the rally going for eight hours and 40 minutes, breaking the previous record by 10 minutes. Each player hit 16,000 shots during the challenge, meaning a total of 32,000 shots were completed. As table tennis burns around 272 calories an hour, the pair will have burned around 2,359 calories each. Jaffa Cakes, energy drinks and pain killers were consumed to keep the record attempt on track. They have now raised £1,400 for charity by completing the feat. 'We wanted to continue until 10 hours but I think when we got past the mark we were so relieved to get there we just broke down and our concentration lapsed. 'Our playing just relaxed and ten minutes later the ball hit my dad’s finger and it was all over. 'The eight hours drove us absolutely insane. We did three practice sessions of five hours and they felt like a lifetime but this was so much more intense. 'But we had a lot of people there with us for the record and there was a lot of support. 'My shoulder was killing me and I only got through it with energy drinks and painkillers and Jaffa Cakes.' The father and son were aiming to beat the previous record of eight hours, 30 minutes and six seconds set by Americans Max Fergus and Luke Logan in August 2013. Despite initially starting well, at the six hour mark, the pair were starting to suffer shoulder and wrist pain. But they battled through hitting the ball roughly once every second - meaning each player played around 16,000 shots. As playing table tennis can burn around 272 calories an hour, the pair will have burned around 2,359 calories each. Mr Ives, a coach at the Bristol Table Tennis Academy for Sport, added: 'It feels great having broken the world’s longest table tennis rally for a sport everyone has played. 'I’m involved with the sport everyday through my coaching so it is cool to say I’m the record holder for the longest rally.” The 24-year-old, who has been playing the sport for 14 years, first came up with the idea during a conversation with his father on New Year’s Eve.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie treated a standing-room crowd to a stinging indictment of the Democratic Party and its biggest names on Thursday. And spectators at the Conservative Political Action Conference who saw him speak say the speech marked the beginning of a presidential campaign. 'Our ideas are better than their ideas,' Christie said of political progressives in a speech that hit all the top-tier political hot buttons including abortion, organized labor, government entitlements adn the Obama administration's economic policies. And he made a point of praising Scott Walker, Rick Scott and Rick Snyder, the Republican governors of Wisconsin, Florida and Michigan – all likely 2016 swing states where the eventual GOP nominee will spend considerable time. 'For sure, he's running,' CPAC attendee Justin Borreggine, a New Jerseyan, told MailOnline. 'At this point, is there any doubt?' 'It's really going to happen,' said Ron Ozarowski, attending the event in his home state of Maryland. He put the odds of a Christie candidacy at 'about 80 per cent.' Scroll down for video . New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie took shots at Democrats and sounded like a presidential contender at the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, D.C. CPAC is an annual event that brings thousands of right-wing activists to the nation's capital to hear politicians and conservative thought leaders . Outside the ballroom at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center near Washington, D.C., MailOnline polled 20 self-professed conservatives who heard Christie speak. All 20 said they expected him to get into the 2016 race for the White House. Only three said they wished he wouldn't. It's a stunning turnaround for a blue-state governor who was banned from last year's CPAC event because of his hearty embrace of President Barack Obama, who worked to provide New Jersey with much-needed disaster aid after Superstorm Sandy. On Thursday, thousands of the nation's most driven right-wingers gave him near-unanimous standing ovations both before and after his remarks. But Christie, bruised by a scandal involving allegedly intentional traffic jams targeting a mayor who opposed him, gave his adversaries more ammunition to use against him. Without naming them directly, he gave an unmistakable defense of David and Charles Koch, the liberal-incensing billionaire industrialists known for supporting conservative and libertarian causes. Oops: The no-politicking rule is being loosely enforced at CPAC this year . Possible contenders: Christie (C) bumped into Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (L) in the VIP area at CPAC on Thursday; both could be GOP primary contenders two years from now . A slimmer-than-before Christie appealed to anti-Democrat sentiments, saying 'Our ideas are better than theirs' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid lashed out at the Koch brothers this week on the Senate floor. 'The oil baron Koch brothers are very good at protecting and growing their prodigious future and fortune,' he said. 'There’s nothing un-American about that. But what is un-American is when shadowy billionaires pour unlimited money into our democracy to rig the system to benefit themselves and the wealthiest one percent.' Christie took Reid head-on and cast him as a cynical opponent of job-creators. 'What they're for in Washington D.C.,' he said, is – the leader of the Senate Democrats stands up and rails against two American entrepreneurs.' 'Harry Reid should get back to work,' Christie jabbed, 'and stop railing against great Americans who are creating jobs.' 'The fact is,' he added in a call to arms, 'that we have to take these guys on directly.' Christie committed one unforced error that may come back to haunt him: a claim that the Democratic National Convention has never hosted a speaker who opposed abortion rights. The CPAC crowd ranges in age from millennials to baby boomers, including some who yearn from the pre-Watergate 'Tricky Dick' Abortion is on the back-burner at CPAC this year, failing to command a panel discussion or a keynote speech topic, but Christie brought it up in an attempt to paint Democrats as ideologically rigid . Forgiven? Christie was banned from last year's CPAC because he pumped up Obama's image in an election season following the flow of post-hurricane federal aid dollars . 'At our national convention, we’ve had people like Tom Ridge and Colin Powell and Condi Rice speak at our national conventions. Even though I don’t agree with their position on abortion,' he said. 'Tell me, sir,' Christie continued, recounting a conversation with a liberal constituent, 'the last pro-life Democrat who was allowed to speak at a Democratic convention? By the way, don’t strain yourself, because there’s never been one. They’re the party of intolerance, not us.' But Reid, the Senate majority leader from Nevada, is pro-life. So are former Louisiana Democratic Senator John Breaux and former House Democratic Whip David Bonior of Michigan. All were frequent DNC speakers. Christie never mentioned Hillary Clinton, one likely Democratic presidential nominee, but set aside a minute of his time at the podium to attack President Barack Obama's economic policies as 'the cold, hard hand of the government determining winners and losers.' 'We don't have an income inequality problem; we have an opportunity inequality problem,' Christie said. He also lashed out at news outlets in a thinly veiled slap at the negative coverage his 'Bridgegate' scandal has brought. 'We have to stop letting the media define who we are and what we stand for,' he said to vigorous applause. Both CNN and MSNBC cut away from the speech less than three minutes in.","MailOnline took an informal poll of 20 random CPAC attendees who heard Christie speak: All 20 said he's running for president .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A teenager's hand was 'almost severed' after another youth attacked him with a machete outside a restaurant in a upmarket part of London last night. Restaurant staff rushed to help the 18-year-old, who also had a knife, as blood poured from his wrist, splattering the pavement on Upper Street, Islington, at around 6pm. Another youth, said to be in his late teens, was stabbed in the arm and both were taken to hospital suffering from what police said were 'non-life threatening' injuries. Violent assault: A teenager's hand was reportedly nearly hacked off in the attack in Islington, north London . Shocking attack: This CCTV footage shows the wounded man holding his left hand as blood pours from it . Restaurant manager Ferat Disha said the blood was 'shooting' out of the youth's wrist after last night's attack . First aid: Staff from a nearby restaurant on Upper Street rushed onto the street to help the bleeding man . They were later both arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. The wounded man was helped by Ferat Disha, manager of the Blue Legume restaurant opposite Islington Town Hall, after he collapsed in the doorway of a nearby shop. Mr Disha, who ran out with napkins to help staunch the blood flow, said one of the youths had a professional-looking knife, while the other had a machete or axe. 'A lorry driver who saw it all said they charged at each other so maybe they knew each other,' he told the Evening Standard. 'The guy with the axe hit him on the wrist - blood was shooting out of his arm.  His hand was almost off, it was that bad.' Frederico Perez, manager of the Comedor Steakhouse, said: 'It happened next to the restaurant I work in and the man was cut very, very badly - there was so much blood on the pavement. 'There was a couple eating outside and it happened in front of them.  The manager of the restaurant next door ran out with a white cloth to help because there was just so much blood.' Bloodied pavement: The youth was taken to hospital with what police said were 'non-life threatening' injuries . He added: 'I called an ambulance but somebody else had already called one.  It was such a shocking thing to see - even the senior police said they were shocked by it.' He said officers had taken his restaurant's CCTV to examine the footage of the incident. Mr Perez added: 'This is such a nice area - we have never had anything like that happen here before.' Local councillor Paul Convery said . the victim had suffered a 'serious laceration to the hand' in what is . believed to be a gang-related attack. He added: 'This . gang on gang attack took place in one of Islingtonâ€™s most crowded . streets at a time when dozens and dozens of people were returning from . work and starting to socialise, and that is very worrying.' Ferat Disha, manager of the Blue Legume, rushed with a cloth to stem the flow of blood from the wound . A Scotland Yard spokesman said both men were in their late teens and said one had suffered 'arm injuries' while the other had 'stab wounds to the back'. He said a knife had been recovered from the scene and that the force's Trident Gang Crime Command were investigating.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Banning elderly people from swimming pool lanes, fairground rides or mobile phone shops is illegal under discrimination laws, the equality watchdog has warned. Shops, leisure centres, nightclubs, theatres and guest houses are warned against discriminating against customers on the basis of their age. New guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission sets out dozens of ways companies, charities and public bodies could fall foul of the law. Older people cannot be banned from swimming pools just because they swim too slowly and might get in the way, the eq2aulity watchdog has warned . A fairground which bans the over-70s from a centrifuge ride because memory problems means they will forget safety rules would be breaking the law. A theatre would be guilty of age discrimination if it only gives entry to a variety show to people who remember what life was like during the Second World War. If gym imposed a fitness test for new members to do 30 press ups it could be breaking the law. The guidance suggests a . 70 year-old-man could provide 'statistical evidence from a reputable source . that people in his age group are unlikely to be able to do 30 press ups . as upper body strength decreases with age'. 'If the gym cannot objectively . justify the requirement, it will be unlawful,' the guidance adds. A school swimming pool which bans a man in his 80s because they think he ‘will swim so slowly that he will get in the way of other pool users’ would also be in breach of the rules. Fairgrounds and pubs cannot turn people away based solely on their age, the guidance states . A six-week consultation has now begun on the new guidance, before it is approved by Parliament. Mark Hammond, chief executive of the EHRC, said: ‘We hope the supplementary Code will be valuable and helpful to businesses, public authorities, courts, lawyers and advocates and we want to hear from as many people as possible so we can provide the best possible guidance. ‘This consultation will enable us to refine and improve our final product and provide high quality, relevant assistance in complying with equality laws.’ The guidance explains the law on age discrimination, but there are many opt-outs, exemptions and concessions which can apply. It is possible to give less favourable treatment to certain age groups if it has a ‘legitimate aim’ which includes outcomes that are ‘socially positive or in the public interest’. This includes allowing people of a certain age to socialise together, for instance at an over-50s social club or an under-30s rambling group. It also covers the right for ‘people of certain age groups to enjoy peace and quiet or enabling them to enjoy music at high volume’. The Equality and Human Rights Commission has produced new guidance on age discrimination for business, charities and state bodies. It says the 70-page rule book is needed to ensure customers are protected and firms know the opt-outs and exemptions that can be used. Here are some of the examples included in the new guidance, which will be voted on by Parliament: . A man of 50 wearing jeans tries to enter a club which generally attracts a much younger clientele. The person on the door turns the man away stating that he does not meet the club’s dress code. It later emerges that on the same evening a 25 year old man in jeans was allowed in by the same person. This is evidence that the reason why the 50 year old was excluded was not primarily because of his dress but because of his age. It is likely to be direct age discrimination if the club which bans under 25s refuses to admit  a man age 30 because from his appearance they (wrongly) assume  he is under 25. The manager of a mobile phone shop decides that the shop will no longer deal with retired customers. This age group tends to need more support and guidance from staff when they buy phones, and the manager wants to cut back on staff numbers to reduce overheads. The aim of reducing costs alone would not be a legitimate one. The aim of less favourable treatment should not be based on a stereotype about age. Sometimes a service provider may have some aims that are legitimate mixed with aims that are illegitimate, such as those linked to stereotypes. A fairground concessionaire believes that people over 70 have memory problems. This belief leads the concessionaire to ban them from the centrifuge ride because he thinks they will not remember safety instructions. While the aim of reducing health and safety risks is legitimate, the concessionaire’s belief about this age group is based on a stereotype rather than on supporting evidence. Therefore the aim of reducing safety risks for this age group cannot be a legitimate one. A variety theatre performance restricts admission to people who can remember what life was like during the Second World War. It claims this is a neutral requirement. The reality is that only people who were alive during the War will gain admission. This policy could amount to direct age discrimination against those too young to satisfy the requirement, unless it can be objectively justified. A secondary school has a swimming pool which it allows members of the public to use at weekends when pupils are not at school. When a man in his 80s wants to use the pool, the school’s life guard refuses to let him do so because he thinks the man will swim so slowly that he will get in the way of other pool users. This is likely to amount to direct age discrimination by the school, unless it can be objectively justified.","New guidance launched on how to avoid breaking age discrimination law .

When the local zoo in the western Siberian city of Barnaul decided to add to its animal quota, they decided that what would enhance its visitors’ experience would be a boomer – a male kangaroo. Thus Chuck was welcomed to its new home last summer and zoo director Sergey Pisarev checked its passport to ensure all was in order. ‘Chuck was born on March 19, 2012. It was initially very active, cheerful, ate the usual food: apples and dandelions,’ said Mr Pisarev. Chuck the kangaroo, with a joey in its pouch in a zoo in the western Siberian city of Barnaul. The zoo bought the kangaroo in 2013, believing it to be male . Then came the bombshell. ‘Zoo staff called me this morning and told me that a cub appeared in his pouch. Everyone was shocked,’ said the director. Kangaroo pregnancies are a hit and miss affair by all accounts and can easily be missed. ‘The embryo develops into a pouch, and it is almost impossible to understand the whole process. The cub is six inches now and is well. Its mother probably needs to be renamed Chucky Chuck,’ Mr Pisarev added. The young mother and the baby live in a heated room. When the average night temperature in the street rises above 10 degrees, they will be released into a cage. ‘We're going to buy another kangaroo. Right now we want to buy a male to create a complete family,’ the zoo director said.","Chuck is two years old and is identified on its passport as male .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A Chinese restaurant has removed two naked 50ft statues of Buddha from its roof just two days after putting them up because they offended believers. The statues were a reference to a old Chinese wives' tale involving Buddhist monks, which features one of them scrambling over a wall to try some soup. Buddhist followers, known for their . peaceful ways, were so angered by their religions leader being used as an advert that they began protesting . outside the eatery, demanding the figures be taken down. Li Tsui has removed two 50ft naked Buddha statues from the roof of his restaurant just two days after putting them up because they offended local Buddhists . The images were a reference to an old Chinese wives' tale, in which a Buddhist monk jumps over a wall to try some soup. A poet supposedly remarked that Buddha himself would have done the same . According to the legend a scholar . travelling by foot used to carry ingredients for the soup in a clay pot, . and heat them up when he stopped for rest. The story goes that while warming the dish near a Buddhist temple, one of the monks could not resist the smell and jumped over a wall to try it, causing a poet among them to remark that Buddha himself would have done the same. Li Tsui, who owns the restaurant in Jinan, in China's Shangdong province, said: 'I didn't intend to offend anyone and in fact there is a very popular dish that we also make here known as Fotiaoqiang, which is extremely popular in this part of the world and everybody eats it. There are various different versions of the tale, but it is thought to be a fake designed to help sell Fotiaoqiang soup - served at Mr Tsui's restaurant - which translates as 'Buddha leaps off the wall' Buddhist followers were said to be so angry at the depiction of their spiritual leader climbing over the building that normally pacifist followers started protesting outside . 'The dish translates as ""Buddha leaps off . the wall"". I simply meant to advertise that and as everybody knows the . dish didn't think that would be a problem.' While different versions of the story are told across the whole of China, it is likely to be made up as a marketing trick in order to sell the expensive meal. Recipes for the soup also differ, but usually include a variety of expensive ingredients, such as venison, shark fin, sea cucumber, shiitake mushrooms, herbs such as ginseng and wolfberries, Shaoxing rice wine, bamboo shoots, pork, duck, quail's eggs and stock. Mr Tsui has since apologised, saying that because the dish was popular he thought the statues wouldn't offend anyone . The ingredients are combined in a large clay pot, covered with wine and stock and then boiled very slowly for a long time. It is a delicacy which is not widely available, and must usually be bought from specialist restaurants, such as the one owned by Mr Tsui.","Restaurant owner Li Tsui unveiled the two 50ft statues last week at his restaurant in Jinan, Shangdong province .

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Associated  Press Reporter . By far the most captivating character in the far-flung saga of California state senator turned accused arms trafficker Leland Yee is the flashy suit wearing, mustachioed 'reformed' San Francisco crime boss Raymond 'Shrimp Boy' Chow. The beloved Yee's arrest shocked residents throughout a community that largely adored him Wednesday, but the flashy suit and mustache sporting Chow's was simply another twist in his life's tale of ruthless crime and redemption. But just how much of a twist remains a source of debate. While the FBI's exhaustive report on his crimes call Chow the Dragonhead leader of a fearsome triad, local authorities think his days of power have long ago devolved to a life of petty crime. Scroll down for video . Holding court: Raymond 'Shrimp Boy' Chow is perhaps the most colorful character among those arrested Wednesday as part of a wide snaring of San Francisco Chinese mafia figures that included a beloved state politician . According to the FBI's 137-page complaint made public Wednesday, Chow is the leader - the dragonhead - of one of the most powerful Asian gangs in North America, one that stretches out from San Francisco to the shores of Hong Kong and mainland China. They say Chow's gang lured state Sen. Leland Yee into its clutches through money and campaign contributions in exchange for legislative help, as Yee sought to rebuild his campaign coffers to run for California secretary of state. Checkered history: Chow has been in and out of prison since arriving to California from Hong Kong in 1976. He was by most accounts a brutal enforcer for a fearsome San Francisco-based triad. But the 54-year-old has claimed to have gone legit since serving out his last stint in 2003 . Born in Hong Kong in 1960, Chow came to the United States at 16 and was reportedly nicknamed 'Shrimp Boy' by his grandmother, in part due to his small stature. After dropping out of high school, Chow rose within the ranks of the local Hop Sing Tong gang and became the hired muscle who shook down illegal gambling parlors in the narrow alleyways of the nation's oldest Chinatown. His star rose even higher after he and his crew survived an infamous 1977 shooting at a Chinatown restaurant that left five dead and about a dozen people injured. Chow then spent a few years inside San Quentin Prison for a robbery conviction, and after his release, he started working with the Hong Kong-based Wo Hop To triad, one of numerous Chinese underground societies linked to organized crime. Chow has admitted that as a gang leader, he ran prostitution rings, smuggled drugs and extorted thousands of dollars from business owners in the 1980s. 'He was given like an unofficial position of being a leader, but to say he was sophisticated, no. He was more like a forceful brute,' said Ignatius Chinn, a former California Department of . Justice agent who spent years investigating Chow in the early 1990s. 'If he didn't get his way, he would just beat the door down and that was how we put cases on him.' Prominent figures: The 5-foot-5 and forever smiling Chow is seen her with then-Mayor Gavin Newsom. He began appearing at events for at risk youth where he urged them, sometimes to the applause of figures like Sen. Dianne Feinstein, to stay away from gang life . Crime boss? The FBI says their investigation revealed Chow was the revered Dragonhead of an international crime syndicate the entire time he was touting his own story of redemption . Although he ultimately was convicted of gun charges and sentenced to 25 years to life in the 1990s, Chow cut a deal to win release and returned Chinatown several years ago, pledging to stay straight. His work with at-risk youth soon won accolades from prominent politicians including former city mayor Gavin Newsome and U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein. That's when Chow's own political star had begun rising. Around 2008, he began meeting with at-risk youth to talk with kids about how to stay on the straight and narrow said Rudy Corpuz Jr., executive director of the youth-led violence prevention organization United Playaz. 'He wasn't just the average guy on the street corner when he had that life, he was somebody you wouldn't mess with. And he's little so people were like, ""Damn, that little guy had that much power?""' said Corpuz Jr., who said Chow's redemption story helped change hundreds of young lives for the good. In 2009, Chow summed up his journey toward redemption in a press conference at San Francisco City Hall. 'All the criminal past I had, I cannot deny that,' he said through his ever-present grin. 'But today I do not represent crime. I do not represent violence and gangs.' The many faces of Shrimp Boy: While authorities . never believed he'd cleaned up his act, California investigators are . slow to believe the FBI's blanket assertion that Chow was a full fledged . Chinatown crime boss . 'He was given like an unofficial position of being a leader, but to say he was sophisticated, no. He was more like a forceful brute,' said Ignatius Chinn, a former California Department of Justice agent who spent years investigating Chow in the early 1990s. 'If he didn't get his way, he would just beat the door down and that was how we put cases on him.' While the local authorities never believed claims Chow had cleaned himself up, Chinn told the LA Times that his other claims--of his vaunted status within his international crime operation--were no more based in reality. 'The local gangsters have a saying: 'Follow the shrimp if you don't want to eat,' Chinn told the LA Times. The complaint alleges that Chow used his position as the dragonhead of the Ghee Kung Tong to launder money, receive and transport stolen property and traffic in contraband cigarettes during a FBI sting. Several years ago, undercover FBI . agents assigned to Chow infiltrated the organization, and ultimately . snared Yee and his campaign consultant Keith Jackson along with two . dozen others, including Chow. The . three were arrested Wednesday during a series of raids in Sacramento . and the San Francisco Bay Area that also netted additional members of . the tong. Yee, free on $500,000 bail, withdrew Thursday from the race for secretary of state. Chow was denied bail because he was deemed a flight risk and a danger to the public. Jackson was denied bail, too. Shocking: Investigations into Chow's activities, at least in part, helped lead authorities to California state senator Leland Yee, who was arrested Wednesday on charged of corruption and for allegedly offering to introduce an undercover agent to Muslim separatist arms dealers . Secret society: An agent with the FBI removes boxes from the Ghee Kung Tong building, which houses the Chinese Freemasons early Wednesday. Investigators believe the group was led by Chow . Charged: Chow appears in this courtroom sketch from Wednesday.

"By . Ryan Gorman . A five-year-old California boy is dead after being run over by a bus as he darted across a busy road to meet his mother outside school in front of dozens of horrified witnesses. Alan Fernandez was trying to cross the street in front of Tuolumne Elementary School, in Modesto, just after class let out Thursday afternoon, police said. The nightmarish incident occurred in front of fellow students and parents at the end of the school day. He never used a crosswalk, the bus driver never saw him running across the street mid-block, the kindergarten student never had a chance – he was pronounced dead at the scene. Horrific: A city bust hit a five-year-old boy in front of a Modesto elementary school . ‘He dashed out between two cars right into the bus,’ Nancy Haverly told KMAX. ‘[His mother] was just going spastic, but you can understand it, because she was so upset.’ Haverly added that mortified parents and school administrators were scrambling to shield other young children from seeing the boy’s lifeless body lying bloody in the street. ‘The other kids were coming out. The parents were trying to keep the kids from seeing it, making them look away.’ Parents of students at the school told the Sacramento Bee the street in front of the entrance becomes chaotic in the moments after class lets out. Busy: The road in front of Tuolumne Elementary School is always busy, parents say . Vigil: Friends and family gathered Wednesday night to pay respects to the young boy . ‘It’s a problem all the time,’ said Carol Arayas, ‘there’s nowhere to pick up the children.’ Gary Haerly ran to do CPR on the boy, but was unable to revive him, he told the paper. ‘It’s asinine for a city bus to go through the school zone,’ he griped, adding that the incident could have been avoided with only a few turns. ‘This street is just always filled with cars, they’re everywhere,’ another parent told the paper. Modesto schools superintendent Pam Able offered her condolences in a prepared statement. Memorial: Candles could be seen at the spot the boy was hit by the bus . ‘We are heartbroken over this horrific accident,’ she said. ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with the family. Grief counselors are on site and will continue to be on site as long as they are needed.’ The incident had been cleaned up by the time older students were let out at 2.40pm that afternoon – kindergarten is normally only a half-day – and things had already returned to normal, according to the Bee. School crossing guards were at their normal posts, cars buzzed by and parent’s’ vehicles lined the busy street honking for their children to run through the rain to their rides home. Friends and family held a vigil Wednesday night and left candles and flowers at the spot the young boy died.","Alan Fernandez was hit by the bus as he ran across the busy street to meet his mother .

As the charges are so serious, the case, and any bail application, can only be dealt with at the Crown Court, the defendant was told. Ben Southam, prosecuting, told the court: ‘Mr Chua faces 34 allegations. I would ask that the case be sent to the Crown Court for a bail and preliminary hearing next week. ‘Mr Chua is not able to apply for bail here given the nature of the allegations. ‘Bail will, in any event, be opposed by the Crown.’ In summer 2011, Rebecca Leighton, a 30-year-old nurse at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport was arrested and charged with the murders. After six weeks on remand she was released and all charges dropped. Police then went back to re-examine the evidence and arrested Chua, who emigrated to the UK from the Philippines more than ten years ago, in January 2012.

Hamburg airport, where almost all flights were cancelled late on Thursday, was open for business today but cautioned that there would be cancellations because of wind and snow. Trains northwards from Hamburg to Denmark and some other destinations were cancelled. Tidal floods that hit Hamburg in the early morning were akin to those that drenched the city in 1962, causing the worst flooding in living memory. But higher and better coastal defences along the North Sea these days meant the impact of this week's storm on the city was negligible, with no reports of major damage or loss of life. A further tidal surge is expected to hit Hamburg this evening. Also today, a high-speed rail line running 300km between Germany's two largest cities - Hamburg and Berlin - was blocked by debris on the tracks.

Patrick Olivier, a professor of human-computer . interaction at Newcastle University who has worked on the prototype, . said: ‘It allows you to use everyday gestures or move your fingers to . interact with a whole host of electronic devices and not just in the . home. It is more than just a remote control, in the future everyone . would have just one wrist-sensor to control all their gadgets. ‘The idea is that you programme it to . recognise a hand movement, such as turning a knob, and this will then . control the volume on the device it is connected to. Or a thumbs up . could answer the phone – the user can choose any gesture that suits . them.’ The sensor straps to a user's wrist, and monitors the movement of their hand looking for key preprogrammed gestures.

David Kim, a Microsoft Research PhD . student at Newcastle University, said: ‘Ultimately, we would like to . reduce Digits to the size of a watch that can be worn all the time. ‘We wanted users to be able to . interact spontaneously with their electronic devices using simple . gestures without even having to reach for them. ‘Can you imagine how much easier it . would be if you could answer your mobile phone while it’s still in your . pocket or buried at the bottom of your bag?’","Gadget can track the movement of the hand in 3D and look for gestures to change channels or operate a mobile phone .

South Korean rhythmic gymnast Soo-ji Shin was invited to throw the ceremonial first pitch at a recent game in the Jamsil Stadium in Seoul  and pitched an acrobatic ball that left even the boys in the dugout gaping.

Some of them were probably wishing they had such flexibility on the field. From all reports, Shin's gymnastics career is going very well - she competed at the Beijing 2008 Olympics.

"By . Ashley Collman . Every little girl dreams of being a princess, and 12 blissfully ignorant women will get the chance to 'fulfill' that dream on a new reality show set to premiere later this Spring. 'I Wanna Marry ""Harry""' will follow a dozen American single ladies as they fight for the chance to marry Prince Harry while living with the younger brother of Prince William at Englefield House in Berkshire. But little do the women know that ""Prince Harry"" is just average English 'bloke' Matthew Hicks, made over to look like the redheaded royal. Royal wedding: In new reality series 'I Wanna Marry ""Harry,""' 12 American women will fight for the chance to wed Prince Harry, who will actually be played by an impersonator named Matthew Hicks . Will they believe it? Hicks does share a likeliness to Prince Harry, but will all the women believe he's truly royal? Hicks will keep up the prince charade for the entire show, and only break the news about his real identity at the very end. 'Will he be able to convince them he's regal, and if he does, will they fall for the crown or fall in love with the real him?' the show's tagline reads. The show is being produced by Ryan Seacrest and ZigZag Productions and was put into development last August under the secret title 'Dream Date'. 'I wanna Marry ""Harry""' will debut on May 27 at 8pm EST on Fox. The show is in the same vein as Joe Millionaire, another dating reality show that aired in 2003. Getting serious: The real Prince Harry is actually engaged in a long-term relationship with girlfriend Cressida Bonas, with rumors circulating that he'll pop the question soon . On Joe Millionaire, the women were convinced that they were competing to marry Evan Marriott, the heir to a million-dollar fortune. At the end of the series, the last two women were informed that Marriott was not a rich man, but just a working-class construction worker. The woman who decided to stay with Marriott once his secret was spilled was rewarded with a surprise $1million dollars, and though the pair didn't last they did split the prize money. Joe Millionaire was thought up by Fox producer Mike Darnell, who also ordered 'Harry' before leaving the network in May. The show will now be tun by British-born Simon Andreae.","'I Wanna Marry 'Harry' will follow 12 American who believe they are vying for the party prince's heart .

"By . Arthur Martin . Funding: Experts who advise the Government on sugar consumption are under fire after it was revealed they receive funding from confectionery giants, including Coca Cola . Experts who advise the Government on sugar consumption were under fire last night after it was revealed they receive funding from confectionery giants. Five out of eight members of a committee tasked with helping to tackle Britain’s obesity epidemic have  ‘worryingly close’ ties with the food industry, it was claimed. They include chairman Professor Ian Macdonald – one of the country’s leading nutritionists – who works as a paid advisor for Coca-Cola and Mars. Yesterday critics said those who sat on the so-called ‘sugar committee’ could not be trusted because many of them are ‘in bed’ with food manufacturers. The row comes as food giants are being urged to cut sugar in products amid fears it has become the ‘new tobacco’. Doctors and academics say sugar levels must be reduced by at least 30 per cent to halt a wave of disease and death. The typical Briton consumes 12 teaspoons of sugar a day – and there are nine in a can of Coca-Cola and eight in a 51g Mars Bar. Professor Macdonald is paid £6,100 to sit on two advisory boards for Coca-Cola and also receives a larger payment for advising Mars. But in 2009 he faced concerns over a potential conflict of interest and stood down until 2012. His research at Nottingham University has now received more than £1million in the past three years from the food industry, including £300,000 from Mars. Funding also comes from Unilever – the world’s largest ice cream manufacturer. The disclosures yesterday prompted calls . for the scientist to resign from the panel because of an ‘unacceptable’ conflict of interests. Simon Capewell, from campaign group Action on Sugar, said: ‘It’s like putting Dracula in charge of a blood bank. If Ian Macdonald doesn’t step down, there will be real concerns that their recommendations will be prejudiced by commercial factors rather than scientific public health priorities.’ Cardiologist Aseem Malhotra added: ‘I don’t think that anyone who is in bed with the food industry should be advising the Government.’ Other committee members with ties to the sugar industry include Ian Johnson, a consultant for Swiss chocolate multinational Barry Callebaut. Professor Ian Young and Professor Julie Lovegrove have also received funding from the sugar industry, while David Mela is an employee and a shareholder of Unilever. All eight members are paid for their work on the committee. Sweetener: The involvement of big business in official advisory boards exists in other industries, too . In an interview with Channel 4’s Dispatches programme, Professor Macdonald denied that he is too close to food companies. He claimed it was important to confer with the industry and said he never discussed any of his government work with Coca-Cola or Mars. Last night Public Health England said advisers must declare any potential conflicts of interest and be ‘independent and professionally impartial’. A spokesman said there were processes in place to ensure ‘transparency and integrity’. A report to be published later this year by the committee on the health impact of sugar consumption could have a massive impact on the food industry.","Experts under fire for being paid to advise firms like Coca Cola and Mars .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Backing: Western nations have admitted to Syrian opposition they don't want to remove President Bashar al-Assad  from power for fear Islamist militants will takeover . Western nations have admitted to the Syrian opposition that they cannot remove President Bashar al-Assad from power as it would risk Islamist militants taking control of the war-torn country. Officials revealed it will likely be essential to keep Assad's Alawite minority in any transitional administration. The message, delivered to senior members of the Syrian National Coalition at a meeting of the anti-Assad Friends of Syria alliance in London last week, was prompted by rise of al Qaeda and other militant groups. They have taken over a border crossing and arms depots near Turkey belonging to the moderate Free Syrian Army, the sources told Reuters. 'Our Western friends made it clear in London that Assad cannot be allowed to go now because they think chaos and an Islamist militant takeover would ensue,' said one senior member of the Coalition who is close to officials from Saudi Arabia. Noting the possibility of Assad holding a presidential election when his term formally ends next year, the Coalition member added: 'Some do not even seem to mind if he runs again next year, forgetting he gassed his own people.' The shift in Western priorities, particularly the United States and Britain, from removing Assad towards combating Islamist militants is causing divisions within international powers backing the nearly three-year-old revolt, according to diplomats and senior members of the coalition. Like U.S. President Barack Obama's rejection of air strikes against Syria in September after he accused Assad's forces of using poison gas, such a diplomatic compromise on a transition could narrow Western differences with Russia, which has blocked United Nations action against Assad, but also widen a gap in approach with the rebels' allies in the Middle East. Conflict: Much of Syria, including Aleppo pictured yesterday, has been left in ruins as a result of the three-year revolt against Assad . Ongoing conflict: Western nations are said to be concerned at the rise in activity among Islamist militants in the country . The civil war pits Assad and many Alawites, backed by Iran and its Shi'ite Muslim allies, against Sunni Muslim rebels supported by Turkey, Libya and Sunni Gulf Arab states. Unlike in Libya in 2011, the West has ruled out military intervention, leaving militant Islamists including al Qaeda affiliates to emerge as the most formidable rebel force, raising alarm among Washington and its allies that Syria, which borders Israel and Iraq, has become a centre for global jihad. Saudi Arabia and Turkey, however, believe that tackling militants is less of a priority, with Sunni power Riyadh in particular furious at what it considers U.S. appeasement of Assad and his Iranian Shi'ite backers. Riyadh sent only a junior diplomat to the Friends of Syria meeting in London. Also signalling differences with Washington, opposition activists in Syria have said that Turkey has let a weapons consignment cross into Syria to the Islamic Front, the rebel group that overran the Bab al-Hawa border crossing last week, seizing arms and Western equipment supplied to non-Islamists. Peace talks are due to start in Switzerland on January 22. The Coalition has agreed to go to the talks while insisting on Assad's immediate removal, but a Middle East diplomat said opposition leaders should be 'more creative' in their tactics - notably in agreeing to take part in transitional arrangements that would leave Assad's fellow Alawites in key positions. Destruction: Buildings shown reduced to rubble in Aleppo yesterday after an alleged airstrike with explosive barrels from forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad . Free Syrian army members remove a body from rubble after an airstrike in the Al-Shaar area in Aleppo yesterday . 'For Geneva to produce an arrangement acceptable to the United States and Russia, the opposition would have to accept taking part in a transitional administration with a strong Alawite presence,' the diplomat said. 'Assad may or may not stay as president but at least he will have diminished powers. 'If the opposition rejects such a deal, they will lose most of the West and only have Saudi Arabia, Libya and Turkey left on their side.' A second member of the Syrian opposition, who is in touch with U.S. officials, said Washington and Russia appeared to be working in tandem on a transitional framework in which Alawites would retain their dominant role in the army and security apparatus to assure their community against retribution and to rally a unified fight against al Qaeda with moderate rebel brigades, who would be invited to join a restructured military. He criticised U.S. and European officials for continuing to indulge in rhetoric that Assad has no future role to play in Syria, without spelling out how his rule will come to an end. 'Even if Assad is sidelined and a Sunni heads a transitional authority, he would have no power because neither Washington nor Moscow appears to want to end the Alawite control over the military and security apparatus,' he said. Still at war: Members of Islamist Syrian rebel group Jabhat al-Nusra take pictures of damaged buildings in the Al-Shaar area in Aleppo . Free Syrian army members fix damage caused by an airstrike in Aleppo. Peace talks are due to begin in January . A senior Western official said that Russia and the United States have discussed which government officials - and up to what level of seniority - could be retained in a transitional phase but that they had not agreed any fixed blueprint. A declaration last week by the 11 leading Western and Middle East countries opposed to Assad blamed the Syrian leader's military crackdown for the rise of Islamist militants but said the opposition must uphold democratic values. Islamists 'undermine the Geneva ... process and threaten Syria's territorial integrity as well as international and regional security,' the Friends of Syria said in a statement. Aafak Ahmad, a former Syrian intelligence official who defected to the rebels two years ago and is in contact with U.S. and Russian officials, said Moscow wanted an Alawite to lead the military in any transition. 'Russia is not sticking to Assad but the red line for Moscow is the preservation of the Syrian army,' he said. 'It realises that, with five decades' experience in the army and security, the Alawites are best placed to fight Islamist militants. 'The political solution has to be gradual and involve a collegiate leadership. If Alawites are assured that there will be no retribution against their lives and property they would accept that Assad and the first line of his lieutenants leave.'

"By . Dan Bloom . China's deadly pollution has joined its Great Wall and achieved the dubious honour of being seen from space. Fluffy white clouds over the world's fastest-growing economy are surrounded by a thick, grey pall of smog in a satellite photograph which lays bare the perilous state of the country's skies. Released by NASA, the image, taken on a day pollution reached highly dangerous levels earlier this week, shows a dense band swirling 750 miles from Shanghai to Beijing and billowing out across the East China Sea. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . It takes your breath away: This satellite image shows smog stretching 750 miles from Beijing (top centre) to Shanghai (bottom right). Clouds are white and smog appears as grey swirls. When this photo was taken on December 7, harmful particles in Beijing were at 480 micrograms per cubic litre of air, almost 20 times WHO guidelines . Only mountaintops appear to be saved from the smog, which remains at highly hazardous levels in some of China's smaller cities today. Suzhou, which lies a few miles from Shanghai and has more than a million citizens, currently has a composite Air Quality Index (AQI) pollution level of 411. Safe levels are below 50. More... Beijing to demand that pilots are able to 'land blind' as China's pollution problem means flying into smog is now a regular occurrence . Shanghai smog hits crisis point: Children ordered indoors and visibility limited to a few dozen metres with air pollution 24 times WHO safety levels . There's no smog without ire: Thousands condemn Chinaâ€™s state media for publishing an article saying its polluted air makes people funnier and more intelligent . In nearby Wuxi, one and a half million citizens are in almost as much danger, with an AQI level of 399. Chinese authorities announced yesterday that pilots would have to 'fly blind' in visibility as poor as 400 metres, to bring an end to catastrophic delays caused by the fog. Fewer than one in five flights leave on time from Beijing Capital International Airport, according to a travel industry monitor - the worst delay record of any international airport. The new rules will take effect on January 1. Sea of smog: The tops of buildings peek out through a thick band of pollution in Lianyungang, Jiangsu Province, which has an air quality measure of 155. The limit is 50 . Grey pall: This photo shows buildings in Lianyungang, where schools have had to be closed. State media was condemned for trying to put a positive spin on the problem . Hazardous: In Shanghai, the iconic skyline including the 1,535ft Oriental Pearl Tower (right) appeared marooned by a thick swirl of smog, leaving citizens at risk of cancer . Pea-souper: Shanghai was barely visible through the dirty air in this photo, taken on Monday. The pollution is attributed to coal burning, car exhaust, factories and weather . Beijing also plans to replace its oil-burning buses with greener models by 2017 to help clear the smog, the state news agency Xinhua said. Nearly 14,000 new buses powered by electricity or natural gas will be bought to replace two-thirds of Beijing's bus fleet and halve carbon emissions. Air pollution in Beijing hit unprecedented levels in January when particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) shot up to a staggering 755 micrograms per cubic litre - 38 times the level recommended by the World Health Organisation. A few days ago, that figure once again hovered around 400 in Shanghai and Beijing, posing serious risk of cancer and lung diseases to the 26 million people crammed into the two sprawling cities. Citizens were ordered to stay indoors and construction workers had to abandon their posts as visibility dropped to just a few dozen metres. The PM2.5 figure was lower today as it appeared the latest wave of severe pollution was clearing, at least for now. Danger: A motorcyclist tries to go about their business in Fuyang, Anhui Province, where the AQI pollution level is currently 245 or 'very unhealthy'. Below 50 is safe . Citizens: This woman wore a mask as she stood in Beijing's Tian'anmen Square. Citizens were told to stay indoors this week and builders had to abandon their posts . Pollution: A woman wearing a mask on a bridge in downtown Shanghai on December 5, when the latest pea-souper began. Authorities are to introduce low-carbon buses . Ghostly: Some residents obeyed orders and stayed in their homes and wore masks, but others were fascinated by the way the skyline took on an otherworldly dimension . Covered up: Women wear improvised cloth masks to protect themselves from the band of smog in Xuchang, Henan Province, where pollution has reached harmful levels . The PM2.5 index is around 170 in Shanghai and 92 in Beijing, but these levels are still classed as dangerous to human health - especially for people with conditions like asthma. The World Health Organisation limit is 25. China's worsening air quality is a result of it chasing economic growth at all cost in the past 30 years, a pursuit that turned it into the world's second-biggest economy, but which also poisoned much of its air, water and soil. Rising public concern over the health dangers of China's air pollution has worried its stability-obsessed leaders, who fear the issue may become a rallying point for wider dissatisfaction. Desperate measures to curb pollution include only allowing half of cars on the road at any time - alternating odd and even numberplates - and closing schools when the smog is particularly heavy. Meanwhile, state media was condemned for trying to put a positive spin on the problem. The tabloid Global Times claimed smog could be . useful in military situations because it could hinder the use of guided . missiles, while another outlet listed five 'unforeseen rewards' for smog - . including aiding the Chinese sense of humour. Although almost everything on Earth can be seen from space thanks to satellites and advanced cameras, the folklore that the Great Wall of China was the only man-made structure visible to the naked eye was exposed as a myth. China rewrote school textbooks in 2004 about the ancient monument, which Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei searched for without success for more than 21 hours while he was in orbit. People wearing masks walk along The Bund in Shanghai earlier this week. The heavy smog which lingered in northern and eastern parts since last week has begun to lift . Bleak: A street cleaner goes about his business in downtown Shanghai, despite pollution which far exceeds WHO rules - at almost 40 times the limit in January . Home to the world's fastest-growing economies, much of south east Asia is plagued by pollution. This photo shows haze hanging over downtown Hong Kong this week . Superpower: Even on a normal day, many Chinese cities have dangerously high pollution levels. This photo of downtown Beijing was taken on November 2 this year .","Satellite image released by NASA shows thick grey smog spreading 750 miles from Beijing to Shanghai .

"By . Dan Bloom . A comet which could become the brightest for a century is racing into our inner solar system, to the delight of astronomers. Comet ISON will pass exceptionally close to the sun in just under a fortnight, creating a spellbinding cosmic spectacle as ice in its body vapourises and forms a distinct bright tail. At least, it will if the heat does not blast the comet to smithereens - which scientists warn is not out of the question. Cosmic show: Comet ISON, which is heading to within 600,000 miles of our sun on November 28 . The comet was discovered in September last year by two amateur astronomers using Russia's International Scientific . Optical Network, ISON, who marvelled at how bright it was even beyond Jupiter's orbit. On November 28 it will pass just 621,000 miles from the sun's surface - 150 times closer to our star than we are. It will be more than 100 times closer to the sun than the Hale-Bopp comet, one of the brightest of the last century which was visible with the naked eye for a record 18 months, passed at its peak in 1997. As it blasts towards the sun, the intense gravitational pull will make it speed up to 234 miles per second. The sun's rays will also heat the ball of ice, metal and rock to 2,760 degrees Celsius, making it much brighter than most comets - with some scientists claiming it could outshine the moon. ISON is named after the International Scientific Optical Network, used by a pair of Russian astronomers to detect the comet in September 2012, but it officially is known as C/2012 S1 . An image taken and annotated by astronomers in Maryland, U.S., showing the tail pointing away from the sun . Some have warned that the intense pressure on the comet could simply blast it apart, as the heat melts not just the ice but also rock and metal. However, recent calculations have shown ISON is more likely than not to survive. Over the weekend, amateur astronomers . began posting the first pictures of the comet on the Internet that were . taken with just binoculars or small telescopes. Pilot Brian Whittaker wrote on the SpaceWeather.com website: 'I . finally saw Comet ISON for the first time using small binoculars! It was . faint, but is predicted to brighten and move each day! Exciting!' It is expected to be visible to the naked eye in early mornings throughout December and during the night in January. It is currently passing through the constellation Virgo in the east of the morning sky. Comets are believed to be frozen remains left over from the formation of the solar system four and a half billion years ago. Supercomet: ISON could prove brighter than Hale-Bopp, pictured, which lit up the skies in 1997 . ISON, which has never visited our inner solar system before, has emerged from the Oort Cloud, a reservoir of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit. These balls of ice are occasionally 'bumped' by the sun's gravity out of the cloud and into a flight path that brings them into the inner solar system. The vast majority of comets are invisible to the naked eye, but the most famous is Halley's Comet. That is because it is the only comet which visits often enough and shines brightly enough to be seen by most people in their lifetime. It comes to our inner solar system between every 75 and 76 years and last visited in 1986. Among other things, it inspired the name of 1950s rock and roll outfit Bill Haley and His Comets.","Comet ISON will skirt 150 times closer than us to the sun on November 28 .
It will either light up in magnificent spectacle... or be vapourised .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It is widely recognised that a pet can be your best friend and also do wonders for your health. But it seems there is no end to their abilities because researchers say they can also make you a more caring person. A US team found that young adults who had a strong attachment to pets reported feeling more connected to their communities and relationships. It is widely recognised that a pet can be your best friend and also do wonders for your health. But it seems there is no end to their abilities because researchers say they can also make you a more caring person . Dr Megan Mueller, a developmental psychologist at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine near Boston, questioned more than 500 people aged 18 to 26 on their attitudes and interaction with animals. Their answers were compared with responses they gave on questions that measure characteristics such as competence, caring, confidence, connection and character, as well as feelings of depression. The study, published in the journal Applied Developmental Science, found that high levels of attachment to an animal were associated with feeling connected with other people, having empathy and feeling confident. Dr Mueller said: ‘Our findings suggest that it may not be whether an animal is present in an individual’s life that is most significant but rather the quality of that relationship. ‘We can’t draw causal links with this study but it is a promising starting point to better understanding the role of animals in our lives, especially when we are young.’ A US team found that young adults who had a strong attachment to pets reported feeling more connected to their communities and relationships . Young adults who cared for animals reported engaging in more 'contribution' activities, such as providing service to their community, helping friends or family and demonstrating leadership, than those who did not. The more actively they participated in the pet’s care, the higher the contribution scores. The study, published in the journal Applied Developmental Science, also found that high levels of attachment to an animal in late adolescence and young adulthood were positively associated with feeling connected with other people, having empathy and feeling confident. Dr Mueller said that to learn more about how and if interacting with animals is linked with positive youth development future studies need to look at specific features of human experiences with animal experiences, as well as how these relationships develop over time, and include a larger, more diverse sample.","US team questioned 500 people aged 18 to 26 on attitudes and interaction .

"By . Sam Webb . An asylum seeker who is married to a British man is fighting for her life in hospital after an overdose  just days before she was due to be sent back to Nigeria. May Brown, a 19-year-old college student, fled to Britain from her home country three years ago after witnessing her father's murder and being subjected to sexual abuse. She settled in Weymouth, Dorset, where she met her husband, Michael Brown, 12 months ago and the couple married last December. Mrs Brown, who was a games maker at last summer's Olympics and has two university offers to study law, applied to stay in the UK but despite her marriage her application was rejected. Asylum seeker May Brown (right) is fighting for her life in hospital after an overdose days before she was due to be sent back to Nigeria. Border officials say her marriage to Michael (left) is a 'sham' Mr Brown, 34, said UK Border Agency officials believe their marriage to be a 'sham' with no'emotional attachment'. His wife was told she would be flown back to Nigeria tomorrow. She was so distressed at the prospect of returning to her home country she took an overdose of medication. Her mother-in-law, Helen-Claire Brown, found her collapsed on the bathroom floor on Monday morning with a note to her husband saying she 'couldn't live without him'. The teenager was rushed to the Dorset County Hospital in Dorchester where she remains in a coma in intensive care. Happy day: The couple on their wedding day. Miss Brown wrote that she couldn't live without her husband . May wrote: 'I am deeply sorry that I had to go this way, without even saying goodbye. 'The UK immigration has finally driven me insane. They've pushed me too far this time and I can't take the pain any more. 'I don't want a life or a future you won't be part of. I love you so much, more than life itself and can't endure the agony of not being with you. 'Please forgive me for ending it this way. It's better to die with my dignity than be subjected to torture and undignified death back in Nigeria.' Before she took the overdose, May had said she feared her abusers would kill her if she returned to the African country because she witnessed her father's death. Helen-Claire Brown, Miss Brown's mother-in-law, said the 19-year-old is part of the family and blasted border officials as 'heartless' She said: 'If they send me back to Nigeria they are signing my death warrant, they will cut my life short because I will be killed. 'I have found peace with Michael, he gave me a reason to live. I have got a family here and we don't claim any benefits. 'Michael works and I am studying to become a barrister, we have not harmed anybody.' Mr Brown, a former soldier who now works for a removals company, insisted the couple's marriage was genuine and slammed the UK Border Agency for its treatment of his wife. He said: 'May is the most beautiful, kindest, loving person I have ever met. I can't live with myself if anything happens to her. 'She is the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with and you can't pretend something like that. 'All we want is a life together. But I'm so angry that is being taken away from us.' Mother-in-law Helen-Claire, 59, added: 'May is a part of our family and the way the immigration service has treated her is so, so wrong and heartless. 'She came here on a student visa and has applied for asylum because she fears for her life if she goes back. 'What kind of world do we live in when a 19-year-old girl who has been through so much already feels she has no other choice but to kill herself?' Miss Brown is studying public affairs at Weymouth College and hopes to go to university and become a barrister. A Home Office spokesman said: 'We cannot comment in detail on this case while legal proceedings are ongoing. 'In cases where people are found to have no right to remain in the UK they should leave voluntarily or face removal.'","May Brown fled Nigeria after witnessing father's murder .

"By . Laura Williamson . and Craig Hope . West Ham are braced for another blow, with Fulham set to make a £7.5million approach for Ravel Morrison and fellow midfielder Mohamed Diame. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is under huge pressure heading into Saturday's trip to Cardiff. He will be loath to lose Morrison but, as Sportsmail revealed on Friday, the former Manchester United youngster is unsettled at Upton Park and has told friends he is ready to quit the struggling club. Fulham manager Rene Meulensteen, who worked with Morrison at United’s academy, is hoping to complete a double swoop before the end of the month. East to West: Ravel Morrison could be tempted by a link-up with former mentor Rene Meulensteen at Fulham . Hot property: Morrison has played 15 times for West Ham this term, scoring three goals . The Dutchman refused to be drawn on a bid for Morrison but, when asked if the England Under 21 star was a player who needed special attention, he said: ‘Yes. It’s our responsibility as a coach to create the right environment. Ravel is a very talented player. He loves football and is a delight to coach.’ Morrison’s contract at West Ham expires at the end of next season and he is reluctant to sign a new one. The Manchester-born midfielder announced his arrival on the Premier League stage with a stunning solo goal in West Ham’s win at Spurs in October. And Meulensteen says he always expected as much from Morrison. ‘It’s not a surprise that he’s flourished and is doing well,’ he added. ‘There is so much more to come from him. ‘When you’re a young player and you’ve proved that you can play at this level then you want to get playing; you want to keep on going.’ Back then: Meulensteen coached Morrison at Manchester United, and could reunited with the youngster . Praise: Meulensteen praised Morrison on Friday, saying the youngster was a pleasure to work with . Fulham, who entertain Sunderland this afternoon, will also look to include Diame in the deal. The Senegal midfielder is also out of contract next summer and Meulensteen said: ‘Any player that could be interesting for us and would really, really strengthen us, we will have a good look at. ‘It would be daft not to, that’s why the transfer windows are there. If things can be done and it’s possible then we’ll look at it like any other club.’ Fulham’s Costa Rica forward Bryan Ruiz will be allowed to leave — he is in talks with Real Betis over a loan move — but Meulensteen is keen to retain leading goalscorer Dimitar Berbatov. The Bulgarian looks set to return to the starting line-up today, and his  manager said: ‘If he left, we would lose  quality, experience, that special aspect that makes him stand out from the  others. He can do things, turn things on, pull things out the hat. He is an exceptional player.’ Hard times: Hammers boss Allardyce watches his side go down 6-0 to Manchester City on Wednesday night . Fulham have won two from three in the league to move two points clear of the drop zone and Meulensteen said: ‘The quality has been there and it is starting to pay off. Hopefully that will be the same against Sunderland, this is a huge game for us.’ Meanwhile, Sunderland’s Vito Mannone admits their form is even baffling the players. The former Arsenal goalkeeper, who made several key saves in Tuesday’s 2-1 Capital One Cup semi-final victory over Manchester United, said: ‘It is a funny game. Somehow we produce great  performances against the big clubs. We all talk with each other and we can’t find the reason why we don’t beat the teams around us. Humiliation: Morrison looks down in the dumps after West Ham were thrashed 5-0 at Forest in the FA Cup . ‘We were told to enjoy the semi-final because we had nothing to lose in a game against one of the best teams in the country. We have to approach every game in the same way. I am tired of  saying we have the team to compete, good ability and a good squad. 'You can tell when we play these games that we don’t beat these big clubs with luck. That’s four in a row. ‘We need to have the same attitude against the smaller teams.

"By . Katy Winter . A generation of singletons have lived their lives by the self-help relationship manual 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus'. Detailing the essential differences between the sexes, the book, written by John Gray in 1992 became an international best seller. But it appears the forerunner for the book was actually penned 350 years ago, as a text comes to light explaining the fundamental differences in men and women when it comes to love and romance. The forerunner for the 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus' book that was written 350 years ago has come to light . The text is called 'The Art How to Known Men' and outlines the physical and emotional differences between the two sexes, as seen in the Victorian period . Written to help those in the Jacobean period understand each other, the text is called 'The Art How to Known Men' and attempts to outline the physical and emotional differences between the two sexes, as perceived in the Victorian period. It was originally written in French but was translated into English in 1665 by an author named John Davies. Originally written in French, the book reveals that single women had many of the same concerns over 100 years ago . The book, which was discovered on a shelf, will be sold at Dukes in Dorchester for an estimated £300 . As well as chapters on the soul (that is generally ‘inclined towards good’), the book contains a detailed section on the physical differences between men and women and on the different types of men a woman may meet in her quest for love. It compares the male form to that of a lion, with large mouths, thick hair and hard and musculous flesh. Women, on the other hand have a 'fair appearance which hides an infinite multitude of defects' including weakness, jealousy, distrust and ungratefulness. While men were built with 'heat and drought' women 'received a little more 'cold and moisture'. A generation of singletons have lived their lives by the self-help relationship manual 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus' The author, John Davies, goes on the describe other physical differences between the two genders. He describes woman as being 'lower and smaller' than man and that her eyes are large and black 'betraying a certain mildness and modesty'. He stated that weakness appeared in the female voice and 'all her motions' The rare book has spent years gathering dust on a shelf at a house in Dorset. The owner had no idea what it was until he took it to Duke's Auctioneers of Dorchester, Dorset. Amy Brenan, a spokeswomen for Duke's, said: 'This could well be the first 'Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus' book. It is a really early piece of social history. 'It forms the basis of what we now see as men and women, although nowadays the lines are much more blurred than they were back then. 'In the 17th century there was a definite distinction between the sexes and people genuinely believed what they read in this book. 'However, the book does try to question these beliefs so it would have been quite radical for the time. 'There are chapters in the book dedicated to the physical, mental and emotional differences between the sexes. 'When we read this book in the 21st century where women are equal to men, the author's description of either sex is almost comedic, however, it was intended as a serious text. 'At the time there would have been many versions printed but over time they may have been thrown away or lost.' The introduction to the small, leather-bound book explains it is '...an Art, comprehending whatever contributes to the discovery of their most secret inclinations, the motions of their souls, their virtues and their vices. An Art, which will bring to those that shall attain it the greatest satisfaction and advantages imaginable.' It is to be sold at Dukes in Dorchester, Dorset, for an estimated £300 on April 10.","'The Art To Know Men' was written by John Davies in 1665 .

"By . Sara Smyth . Every responsible animal lover knows it’s one of the first things to teach a pet - how to respond to their own name. But new research shows that although cats recognise their owners’ voice, they choose to ignore when they are being called because of the way the species evolved. A new study from the University of Japan suggests that because cats are able to ‘domesticate themselves’ they haven’t relied on the human voice for instruction over the centuries. Independent: A new study from the University of Japan suggests that because cats are able to 'domesticate themselves' they haven't relied on the human voice for instruction over the centuries . They have a reputation for being an aloof and independent species- in contrast to their canine counterparts. And the study proves that cats are now unresponsive to their owners because they didn’t need to take notice of humans throughout the evolutionary process. Researchers found that when owners couldn’t be seen and called to their cats by name, the pets moved their heads in the direction of the noise and pricked up their ears in response. When the same experiment was carried out with a stranger’s voice, the cats were found to be significantly less responsive. In both cases, they recognised the call and choose not to respond to it. Atsuko Saito and Kazutaka Shinozuka, the researchers who led the project, said: ‘This cat–owner relationship is in contrast to that with dogs. ‘Cats do not actively respond with communicative behaviour to owners who are calling them from out of sight, even though they can distinguish their owners’ voices.’ Relationship: Historically speaking, cats, unlike dogs, have not been trained to obey a human's orders . The study tested twenty cats at home and analysed their responses to each call by measuring their movement, vocalization and eye dilation. The reason for the cats indifference is believed to be rooted in the early domestication of the species. ‘Historically speaking, cats, unlike dogs, have not been domesticated to obey humans’ orders. Rather, they seem to take the initiative in human–cat interaction.’ Genetic analysis shows that the common ancestor of the modern housecat was Felis silvestris, a small wildcat that came into contact with humans more than 9,000 years ago. The species is then thought to have domesticated itself without answering directly to humans. Despite their independence, cats are reported to be as affectionate as dogs by their owners. The study said that ‘the behavioural aspect of cats that cause their owners to become attached to them are still undetermined. ‘Dog owners and cat owners do not differ significantly in their reported attachment level to their pets’.","Research by the University of Japan says cats are self-domesticated .

The study examined the connection between first names and the achievements of their bearers, discovering that Paul, Alan and Richard also have a better chance of striking it rich. Name game: Researchers found that men called John, David or Steve are more likely to do well in business than those called Tony, Matthew or Jimmy. The late Steve Jobs, the former Apple CEO, was one such example . Men named Fred, Brian and Ben were amongst the least likely to hit the business big time, along with Ed and Alex. Peter and Andrew have a good chance of doing well, unlike those going by Kevin and Sam. Magical: Men called Daniel have experienced the most luck. Here is Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe . A spokesman for domain name site Siteopia.com, which commissioned the study, said: ‘Although we shouldn’t do it, there is a tendency to make an assumption about someone, perhaps before we’ve even met them. ‘Traditional strong names seem to have more luck in business – even though we don’t get to choose our own first names.’ Barry, George and Harry, however, would probably do better to avoid entrepreneurship. Giles is currently earning the highest annual salary, of more than £42,000, and Alex the lowest, at just over £22,000 a year. Gareth is also a high earner at £39,000 a year, as is Martin on nearly £36,000. Nigel will have attended the most interviews and had an average of five rejections.

"By . Lydia Warren . and Associated Press . An elderly man whose wife of more than 40 years was killed in the Washington mudslide on Saturday has spoken out about his devastating loss. Gary McPherson, 78, and his wife Linda were sitting beside each other in their recliners at their Snohomish County home on Saturday morning when the mile-long mudslide tore through. After being thrown through the mud and debris, McPherson's first thought was for his wife. 'I keep trying to talk to Linda, but they tell me she must have been gone by then,' McPherson, who did not break a single bone, told KIRO-TV as he sobbed. Scroll down for video . Devastated: Gary McPherson, 78, wipes away tears as he recounts being dug out of mudslide debris as he called out desperately for his wife of 40 years, who did not survive . Ordeal: He was sitting on his recliner chair beside his wife on Saturday when the ground pulled them in . Yelling for his wife to dig, he grabbed a wooden stick from a broken chair, pushed it upwards and moved it from side to side until he could see a small hole of light. 'I kept yelling at Linda to dig,' he told KOMO. 'I was all balled up, but this one hand was free and I had a stick so I just kept digging and digging and digging with this stick until I could see a light and shoved that sucker up through there. And started waving it back and forth.' He continued to wave the stick until he was found by emergency crews. He kept asking for his wife, but they told him to relax - perhaps a sign they already knew she was dead, he said through tears. His heartbreaking account comes as officials said on Thursday that they expect the number of fatalities to rise 'substantially'. Sixteen bodies have been recovered, and by Wednesday night, nine more had been found. On Thursday, the family of a four-month-old baby, Sanoah Huestis, said her body had been found. The McPhersons daughter, Kate, said she is struggling to grasp that her mother is dead and says that she keeps texting her 'that I miss her, that I want her to be here. And it's not fair that she's gone'. Her . parents met as they carried out oceanography research on a ship . departing Nome, Alaska and had been married for more than 40 years. Mrs . McPherson was the Darrington librarian. Victim: 69-year-old Linda, the town librarian, was likely already dead when her husband yelled out to her . Idyllic: The McPhersons lived on the family farm, which had been in their family for five generations . Wreckage: The entire farm - including this home shared by Linda's sister's family - was destroyed . 'We were just two people that meshed,' her husband remembered. 'She was gentle, but persuasive. She was a planner.' Hope of a miracle discovery of a . survivor has faded as the search entered its sixth day Thursday, . replaced by acknowledgement that some families may not be able to bury a . body. Authorities have been able to . eliminate 140 people from the list of the missing, said Snohomish County . Emergency Management Director John Pennington. That left 90 confirmed missing, with . another 35 who authorities are unsure were in the area when a hillside . collapsed Saturday morning 55 miles northeast of Seattle. Becky . Bach watches and waits, hoping that search crews find her brother, his . wife, her 20-year-old great-niece and the young girl's fiance. 'Realistically . ... I honestly don't think they're going to find them alive,' Bach . said, crying. 'But as a family, we're trying to figure out what to do if . they find no bodies.' Devastation: An aerial photo taken on Monday shows the mountainside to days after the slide . Hunt: Searchers watch as a piece of heavy equipment moves debris at the scene of the deadly mudslide on Wednesday, as authorities warn that bodies of some victims may never be recovered . Sadness: Darrington Fire District 24 volunteer firefighters embrace each other on Wednesday after saying a prayer for the victims and survivors of the massive mudslide . Doug Massingale, whose baby granddaughter's body was recovered on Wednesday, said he was struggling to think about the lives lost. 'It's stressful to think about,' he said. 'A little baby that hasn't gotten a start yet in life. It's too much.' Authorities said they expected to . update the toll Thursday morning, but trying to recover every corpse . would be impractical and dangerous. The . debris field is about a square mile and 30 to 40 feet deep in places, . with a surface that includes quicksand-like muck, rain-slickened mud and . ice. The terrain is difficult to navigate on foot and makes it . treacherous or impossible to bring in heavy equipment. To . make matters worse, the pile is laced with other hazards that include . fallen trees, propane and septic tanks, twisted vehicles and countless . shards of shattered homes. The knowledge that some victims could be abandoned to the earth is difficult to accept. Loss: On Thursday, the family of a four-month-old baby, Sanoah Huestis, said her body had been found . 'We have to get on with our lives at some point,' Bach said. Bach spoke via phone about a wedding the family had planned for summer at the rural home that was destroyed. And how, she wondered, do you plan a funeral without a body? 'We'll probably just have a memorial, and if they find the bodies eventually, then we'll deal with that then,' she said. A death certificate, issued by the state, is legal proof that someone has died. Families often need them to settle their affairs. The authority to issue them starts with a county medical examiner or coroner, said Donn Moyer, spokesman for the Washington State Department of Health. If and when it appears there is no chance of finding someone, people can ask the county to start that process. Huge scale: Air Force personnel join civilian workers in efforts to find missing persons on Wednesday . Destroyed: A rescue worker walks across the debris pile from the mudslide in Oso on Thursday .

Darrington Fire District 24 volunteer firefighters Jeff McClelland, left, and Eric Finzimer, who were first responders to the massive mudslide burst into tears while talking to the media on Wednesday . Two Washington National Guard Blackhawk helicopters arrived at the site Wednesday to relieve sheriff's helicopter crews that had been working since Saturday. The Blackhawks' sole mission is body removal, said Bill Quistorf, chief pilot for the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office. Other survivors began to grow impatient Wednesday that they weren't allowed to return to the sites of their homes to search for their valuables and keepsakes. 'This isn't right. All of us who are still alive need to have access and find what we can of our lives,' said Robin Youngblood, who said her son-in-law was turned away from the slide site.

"By . Jonathan Petre . One of England’s most senior police chiefs has called for an end to the war on drugs. Durham Chief Constable Mike Barton said all drugs, including heroin and cocaine, should be decriminalised and made available through the NHS – destroying the power base and income of criminal gangs. Mr Barton acknowledged drugs were ‘bad’ but compared the  current policy to the prohibition of alcohol in 1920s America  that gave rise to Al Capone and the mafia. He said efforts to reduce illicit drugs had ‘comprehensively failed’ and the effect of criminalisation of the trade had been to put millions of pounds into the pockets of criminals. Reform: Durham Chief Constable Mike Barton has urged for a rethink in the way drugs are policed, comparing our current laws to 1920's American prohibition . He said last night: ‘If an addict were able to access drugs via the NHS or something similar, then they would not have to go out and buy illegal drugs. Buying or being treated with, say, diamorphine [heroin] is cheap. It’s cheap to produce it therapeutically. ‘Not all crime gangs raise income through selling drugs, but most of them do in my experience. So offering an alternative route of supply to users cuts their income stream off. Drugs should be controlled. They should not, of course, be freely available. ‘I think addiction to anything – drugs, alcohol, gambling, etc – is not a good thing, but outright prohibition hands revenue streams to villains. Since 1971 [the Misuse of Drugs Act], prohibition has put billions into the hands of villains who sell adulterated drugs on  the streets. ‘In my force area we have 43 organised crime groups on our radar. Most have their primary source of income in illicit drug supply, all of them are involved  in some way. ‘These criminals are often local heroes and role models for young people who covet their wealth. ‘Decriminalising their commodity will immediately cut off their income stream and destroy their power,’ Mr Barton said in an  article in today’s Observer. ‘Have we not learned the lessons of prohibition in history? The Mob’s sinister rise to prominence in the US was pretty much funded through its supply of a prohibited drug – alcohol. That’s arguably what we are doing in the UK.’ Access: Chief Constable Barton called for cocaine to be made available on the NHS, saying that the criminalisation of drugs like it has put millions of pounds into the hands of criminals  (file picture) Mr Barton, an experienced crimefighter who was appointed to the chief constable post earlier this year after serving as assistant, said addicts should be treated rather than criminalised. He said: ‘If you started to give a heroin addict the drug therapeutically, then we would not have the scourge of hepatitis C and Aids spreading among needle users, for instance. I am calling for a controlled environment, not a free-for-all.’ He is not the first chief constable to call for a change in drug policy. In 2010, Tim Hollis, chief constable of Humberside police, said the criminal justice system could offer only a ‘limited’ solution to the scourge of drugs.","Durham Police chief Mike Barton called for a relaxation of drug laws .

"By . Martin Robinson . Financial pain: Ryanair has revealed a £28m loss in the last three months of 2013 - at a time where its boss Michael O'Leary promised to stop 'p****** off' passengers . Ryanair has recorded a £28.7million loss in the last three months of 2013 despite its controversial boss promising to stop 'p****** off' its customers. The Irish airline, Europe’s largest by passenger numbers, issued its first profit warnings in a decade last year on the back of weak winter bookings. The carrier said today it lost £28.7million (35million euros) in the three months to December 31, its worst performance in its traditionally weak third quarter since 2008. Chief Executive Michael O’Leary said the loss was due to lower average fares and weaker sterling. This is its worst end of year results since 2008, and the airline has already promised to bring in allocated seating after years of complaints. From this month travellers can pay five . euros - £4.23 - to choose their seat while the rest will be allocated in . the 24 hours prior to departure. It remains on course for profits of around £420 million (510million euros) in the year to March 31. 'Market pricing remains soft but is no longer declining,' Mr O'Leary said. The flamboyant tycoon, 52, decided last November to . remove himself from the public eye in a bid to 'stop unnecessarily . p****** people off', adding: 'I'm getting in the way'. Mr O'Leary, who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair for almost 20 years. The budget airline - which has been criticised for treating its . passengers 'like the enemy' - has recently been forced to issue its . second profits warning in two months. Decline: However, the budget airline - which has been criticised for treating its passengers 'like the enemy' - has recently been forced to issue its second profits warning in two months . Outspoken: Mr O'Leary, who has gained a . reputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair for . almost 20 years. He has seen it through two decades of extraordinary . growth . Pay-per-pee . In 2009, Mr O’Leary announced that passengers could be asked to pay as much as a pound to use the bathroom during a flight. 'We’re thinking of putting a coin slot on the toilet so people may have to spend a pound to spend a penny,' he told the BBC Breakfast show. When asked if he would charge more than a pound, he replied: 'If someone wanted to pay £5 to go to the toilet I would carry them myself. I would wipe their bums for a fiver.'Vertical seats . A year later, the controversial tycoon asked customers whether they would think of vertical seats, akin to bar stools with seatbelts. His theory was that by removing 10 rows of seats and replacing them with 15 rows of vertical seats, flights could carry 30 per cent more passengers and slash costs by 20 per cent. Reservation charge . Ryanair has announced it will begin to allocate seats from next year - but it will still cost almost £5 if you want to choose it yourself. From February travellers can pay five euros - £4.23 - to choose their seat while the rest will be allocated in the 24 hours prior to departure. Who needs co-pilots? Mr O'Leary once remarked that co-pilots were only there to 'make sure the first fella doesn’t fall asleep and knock over one of the computer controls'. He declared aviation authorities should axe the 'unnecessary' position and instead train a member of cabin crew to act as 'back-up' should anything happen to the pilot mid-flight. Over the autumn the outspoken tycoon . was bombarded on Twitter after agreeing to host a question-and-answer . session from customers. He posted a picture of himself on the social networking site dressed as a leprechaun before fielding tweets. Many . customers told Mr O'Leary what an ‘a***hole’ they thought he was - with . user Andrew Riddell asking him: 'Have you by any chance just hired . British Gas's former head of publicity you Plum'. The . Ryanair boss replied: 'Hey, don't call me plum. Pudding would be more . accurate!', before later admitting: 'I'm an a***hole. But they still . love me.' Mr O'Leary also claimed he was a 'Neanderthal' who . believed men should not feel any pressure to help bring up their own . children. He also compared himself to Jesus and insisted Ryanair only punishes customers who fail to comply with its rules. Only . ten days earlier, he had declared that a passenger who complained at . being charged to print out a new boarding pass was 'stupid'. But he has since promised to end his airline's 'over-abrupt' culture. He has said strict hand-luggage . restrictions would be relaxed to allow ‘small ladies’ handbags’ and . airport shopping to be carried onto the plane in addition to the stated . allowance. Mr O’Leary . also pledged not to overly penalise passengers who make a ‘genuine . mistake’ – such as forgetting to bring their boarding card, which often . results in a £70 charge to reprint them. He said that Ryanair was ‘evolving’ and becoming more ‘sophisticated’. He added: ‘In the past we have said, “That’s the policy – go to hell”. That culture needs  to evolve.’ EasyJet has been growing its revenues when compared to its rival. Having fun: Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary poses in a leprechaun hat and beard as he fields questions on Twitter last month, but later got a hammering off customers . Anger: Some Twitter users took the opportunity to vent their frustrations about the company . Ryanair flew six per cent more passengers in the last three months of 2013 compared with a year earlier, but revenue was flat due to the fall in ticket prices. British rival easyJet by comparison increased revenue 7.7 percent on passenger numbers growth of 4.2 percent in the same period. It has been being voted the worst of the 100 biggest brands serving the British market by readers of consumer magazine Which?. Deputy Chief Executive Michael Cawley said the changes had not yet had an impact on profit, but that there signs the strategy was starting to bear fruit. 'There has been a very positive reaction ... particularly in terms of forward bookings which we have never had as substantially ahead,' he said.","Budget airline says passenger numbers were up but fares were down .

While his father and siblings have still not been found, Jacob's mud-covered blond hair was visible among the debris when a Snohomish County Helicopter flew overhead soon after.

"By . Tim Shipman, Deputy Political Editor . PI Pickles: A source said Tory Communities Secretary Eric Pickles is being compared to a private investigator . No one can accuse Communities Secretary Eric Pickles of not taking his job seriously. While most ministers seem content with shaping national policy, Mr Pickles took direct action when he saw a group of travellers heading towards his constituency. He gave chase in his car and bravely confronted them after they pulled on to a cricket pitch. Mr Pickles – who has brought in a raft of measures aimed at preventing itinerants from setting up camp on greenfield land without permission – first noticed their convoy turning off a motorway as he drove towards his home. He then followed them and watched as the 40 travellers with their 15 caravans moved on to the cricket pitch at around 10pm last Thursday. The minister pulled over and asked them what they thought they were doing. Unhappy with their answers, he then called in the police and local council to deal with them. One Tory source said the minister’s actions had led to Commons wags comparing him to a private investigator. He said: ‘We’re calling him P. I. Pickles. People in Whitehall know you don’t mess with Eric. This is a great example of local people taking action.’ After police got involved, the travellers were issued with a Section 61 eviction notice and told to leave the field in Mountnessing, Essex. If they had failed to do so, they could have been hit with unlimited fines under new rules introduced by Mr Pickles. However in an apparent act of vengeance, some of the travellers returned the next day and wrecked the cricket square, forcing Mountnessing Cricket Club to cancel a match set for the weekend. Witnesses said the travellers drove up and down the wicket, making hand-brake turns to wreck the grass. The club’s groundsman said: ‘It was obvious they were doing all they could to plough up the pitch and do as much damage as they could. ‘It was just very lucky we haven’t had rain for a while and the surface was hard. If we had had any rain that would have been it – it would have turned into a ploughed field. ‘Someone had tried to dig some initials around the crease of one strip, but he had given up because the ground was too hard.’ Last night Mr Pickles told the Mail: ‘I’m pleased that they have gone but such appalling behaviour clearly demonstrates we are dealing with a small minority of people who have no respect for the law. ‘This Government is clamping down on unauthorised traveller sites and the public want to see  fair play and planning rules properly enforced. ‘After seeing the trouble this has caused I’ve never felt it more important to protect our green belt land and the communities who live in and around it.’ Strict: Eric Pickles has brought in measures to stop travellers from setting up camp on greenfield land without permission . Karl Afteni, chairman of Mountnessing parish council, said £600 of damage had been done. He added that the club will close for a month and a further £1,500 will be spent on better security. ‘Nothing will stop a determined effort with machinery and power cutters but we must make it harder to gain unlawful access,’ he said. Under the Coalition, planning guidance on traveller sites has been tightened so that camps located in the green belt, whether they are temporary or permanent, are regarded as ‘inappropriate development’. Council chiefs have also been told that they ‘should strictly limit new traveller site development in open countryside’.","Tory Communities Secretary had 40 travellers and 15 caravans removed from Essex cricket pitch .

"By . Ap . It wasn't so long ago that David Hutchinson spent a month sleeping under a bridge while his wife and young daughter spent their nights at a domestic violence shelter.But this wasn't a case of domestic violence. The couple simply had no choice. There were just no shelters in Phoenix with room for another homeless family, and their top priority was finding a safe place for their daughter.The family is one of many in the U.S. that have been trying to raise children in the face of joblessness and homelessness. An annual survey released Monday by the Annie E. Casey Foundation shows the number of children living in poverty increased to 23 percent in 2011, after the recession. Safe place: David Hutchinson and his daughter are an example of the tremendous toll the recession took on families, particularly in the Southwest, where Hutchinson lived under a bridge in Arizona as his family stayed in a shelter . The Southwest has been hit particularly hard. New Mexico, for the first time, has slipped to worst in the nation when it comes to child well-being. More than 30 percent of children in the state were living in poverty in 2011 and nearly two-fifths had parents who lacked secure employment, according to this year's Kids Count survey.Nevada is ranked No. 48, followed by Arizona. Mississippi, which has traditionally held last place, made slight improvements in early childhood education while reading and math proficiency for some students increased, putting the state at No. 49. Hopeless: The annual survey by the Annie E. Casey Foundation shows that children living in poverty increased to 23-percent in 2011 following the U.S. recession . Hungry: Julie Morris stands with her three daughters while awaiting extras after the dining hall closed at the Family Gateway homeless shelter in Texas, where 337,000 children are homeless . In Arizona, charities and government programs were cut during the recession, making it more difficult for families to get by and rebuild, said Dana Wolfe Naimark of the Children's Action Alliance in Phoenix.'So many things were slashed just when people needed it the most,' she said. 'That is a key policy issue that we do have choices over. We can find ways to rebuild that investment. It's not OK to just throw up our hands and say, 'We can't.'""According to the Kids Count report, a lingering concern is the effect of unemployment on children, particularly long-term unemployment. Researchers found that more than 4 million workers were unemployed for more than six months, and more than 3 million were without work for a year or more.David Hutchinson and his family eventually ended up in Albuquerque. He has been looking for work for months. Finally, he landed a job just this week with a contractor who installs fire suppression systems.'If I wasn't so crippled, I'd be doing backflips,' he said, pointing to the rod and pins in his forearm, an injury that ended his career in the U.S. Navy. Texas: The Lone Star State has the largest number of homeless children, including six-month-old Maleya Nevills, who sleeps while her family eats dinner at the Family Gateway homeless shelter in Dallas . 'Freedom': Li Tina Cross lost her home while serving a six-month jail sentence and moved into the homeless shelter with her three children upon her release . His wife, Chelsea, said she knows her husband is ready to put aside any pain because the prospect of their family being able to move from Joy Junction, the shelter where they have been staying since December, hinges on a regular income.William and Elimar Roper are in the same boat. They and their four children have been at the shelter for about a year. William just landed a job in the kitchen and Elimar has graduated from the shelter's recovery program, which helps those addicted to drugs or alcohol.'We're happy because we've upgraded from being homeless to something that can help us stabilize. It's the first step,' Elimar Roper said.William Roper served in the U.S. Army for nine years and did tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. After the military, he worked as a janitor and then lost his job. The family's savings soon ran out, leaving them homeless.The Kids Count report shows the percentage of children whose parents don't have secure employment has been increasing. That's more than one-third of children in each of the four states at the bottom of the Kids Count list. Recession: Brian Morris was laid off from his construction job in April and the family was evicted from their Texas home when they could no longer make their rent payments. They now live in a shelter . Busy: Case worker Anastasia Nixon gives a tour to a new group of homeless women and children at the Family Gateway homeless shelter in Dallas, Texas . 'Growing up in poverty, it just has these terrible repercussions and you see these associations with much lower rates of high school graduation, lower performance overall in school, much lower rates of college attendance and the cycle perpetuates,' said Curtis Skinner, director of Family Economic Security at the National Center for Children in Poverty.Skinner said the center's research is showing a troubling trend in the aftermath of the recession: Poverty rates are rising in what used to be the middle class, in two-parent households and in families where parents have college educations.While there is a lag in the Kids Count data, officials in New Mexico, Arizona and Nevada believe some of their numbers will start to turn around in the coming years thanks to investments in education, particularly pre-kindergarten programs.New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez has pushed for doubling pre-K funding and funneling more money to early literacy and high school graduation efforts.'Clearly, doing things the way they've always been done hasn't worked for our kids,' said Enrique Knell, a spokesman for the governor. 'And reform efforts must include ending the practice of setting our children up for failure by passing them on to the next grade level when they can't read.'The well-being of their children has been the motivating factor for both the Hutchinson and Roper families. They want something better for their kids, and they say things are starting to turn around.'Finally, being to the point of stabilizing and being able to get the kids out of this environment, that's a good feeling,' Elimar Roper said.","The Southwest has been hit particularly hard .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . and James Tozer . Told she had cancer and then only a few weeks later that she was  pregnant, Angela Marsh faced an agonising choice. She could have immediate treatment and lose her child – or delay surgery until birth and risk the disease spreading. So instead Miss Marsh took a third option: a high-risk operation that is thought not to have been tried in Britain before. Worry: Angela Marsh, 27, feared she might never meet her son Zachary after being diagnosed with cervical cancer while pregnant with him . It worked and yesterday she was preparing for the first birthday of Zachary, the child she thought she would never see. ‘It’s been such a tough time, but to have such a special, happy baby today is the best possible reward for everything we went through,’ said the 27-year-old. ‘Every time he smiles, it feels like he’s summing up our whole experience over the past 12 months and telling us everything’s going to be fine now.’ The barmaid was given the shattering news she had cancerous cells after her very first cervical screening test in May 2012. She was referred for surgery at the Christie Hospital in Manchester which, a month later, told her she was pregnant. It was then that doctors offered her the third option – trying to remove her cervix while not harming the unborn child. ‘They told me the operation hadn’t even been done in this country before,’ said Miss Marsh, who also has a seven-year-old son. Decisions: Mrs Marsh faced two impossible options - to abort her baby and then have a life-saving operation to remove her cervix, or delay surgery until the baby was born and risk the cancer spreading . Relief: But the pionnering option she went for involved  a high-risk operation during pregnancy without aborting her child. Mrs Marsh is believed to be the first woman in Britain to have the life-saving operation while pregnant . Mrs Marsh said: ¿It was an easy decision for me to make ¿ as far as I was concerned, I was just leaving it to fate to as to whether the baby survived or not' But the alternatives were losing the baby and knowing I might not be able to get pregnant again, or waiting until after he was born when it might have spread. ‘It was an easy decision for me to make – as far as I was concerned, I was just leaving it to fate to as to whether the baby survived or not.’ To give Zachary the best chance of survival, the operation at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester was delayed until 11 weeks into her pregnancy. Surgeons removed the cancerous cervix and rebuilt it using surrounding tissue. The extremely delicate procedure – normally undertaken only on women who are not pregnant but who want to be able to have a child – enables the foetus to remain in the womb. Although Zachary grew normally, Miss Marsh, from Bolton, became convinced the worst would happen. ‘I understood that even if the baby survived the initial operation, it would still be a high-risk pregnancy,’ she said yesterday. Mrs Marsh said: 'In order to cope, I worked on coming to terms with the scenario that I would have no baby at the end of this ordeal so I didn't have to grieve for it if the worst happened. It was extremely difficult for me and my whole family' Miracle: Zachery was sucessfully delivered by caesarean section, weighing a healthy 7lb 2oz . Birthday boy: Zachary will celebrate his first birthday next week, with a party at Wythenshawe's Macmillan Information and Support Centre . ‘In order to cope I worked on coming to terms with the scenario that I would have no baby at the end of this ordeal so I didn’t have to grieve for it if the worst happened. It was extremely difficult for me and my whole family. ‘As the pregnancy went on I began to accept I needed to buy some baby things, but there was no excitement in it. I left everything at other people’s houses so there was nothing in my home. As the weeks went by and the chances of my baby actually surviving improved, I still could not allow myself to believe everything would be all right.’ Zachary was successfully delivered by caesarean section, weighing a healthy 7lb 2oz. ‘Only when I heard him cry did I allow myself to hope that everything was going to be OK,’ added Miss Marsh. Delight: Celebrating Zachary's first birthday was a day the Marsh family never believed would come . ‘But straight away it was as if the past 12 months hadn’t happened – he’s been absolutely brilliant.’ Miss Marsh and Rick Norman, her shop manager partner, will next week celebrate Zachary’s birthday with a party at Wythenshawe’s Macmillan information and support centre. Julie Kiernan, the Macmillan nurse who cared for Angela, said: ‘We believe this is the first time this operation has been performed on a pregnant woman in this country. ‘Angela had a whole team around her to ensure the risks were minimised and her baby was given the best chance of survival.’ Miss Marsh is supporting Macmillan Cancer Support’s campaign to ensure no one faces cancer alone.

"By . Chris Pleasance . The MoD has spent £180million on hotels and car hire for top civil servants and officers, andeven signed off on £3,000 for a Sky Sport subscription. Officials spent £110million on hotels between 2009 and 2013, a bill . which went up by £3million in three years, and a further £69million on . cars. The total included a £5,500 bill for Andrew Manley, the chief executive of the Defence Infrastructure Organisation, for nearly 50 nights at the luxury New Hall Hotel and Spa in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands. Two of the biggest claimants were Andrew Manley (left) who charged £5,500 for 47 nights at the four star New Hall Hotel and Spa, and Bernard Gray (right) who racked up a £23,000 bill for 106 stays in Bristol and London . Mr Manley, who is paid around £200,000 a year,  spent 47 nights at the £155-a-night, four star spa, despite it being less than two miles from DIO headquarters which the MoD said he visited from his London office. The Sky Sports contract was bought for one small unit in Northwood, Hertfordshire, so that it could monitor 'global 24-hour news feeds'. According to The Sunday People another high-spender was Bernard Gray, the MoD's Chief of Defence Material, whose first task when he was appointed in 2010 was to reduce the equipment budget. Mr Gray claimed £23,000 on 106 stays in London and Bristol, despite his house being less than a 60 miles drive from both, and him being allocated a car and driver. The New Hall Hotel, where Mr Manley stayed, costs £155-a-night and is situated less than two miles from his department's HQ . The hotels budget has increased by £3million in three years despite the armed forces facing harsh budget cuts . TaxPayers Alliance chief, Matthew Sinclair, said: 'The MoD cannot afford to squander huge sums on luxury hotels while rank and file soldiers are being given their P45s. 'Taxpayers expect the defence budget to spent on protecting the realm, not stays at swanky hotels across the world.' The armed forces are currently facing the biggest cuts since the end of the Second World War, with troop numbers being reduced, pay being cut, and tanks, jets and warships being scrapped. Around 20,000 civil servants have also lost their jobs since 2011. A spokesman for the MoD said that £53million of savings had been made in the department last year, and that the cars budget had been reduced by 20 per cent. The revelations came after Labour MP Chris Evans tabled a parliamentary question on the issue of expenses.","MoD figures reveal it spent £180million on hotels and cars .

She put all her [negative] energy on me,' said Kira. 'After filming ended, they sent me to doctors. I'm still recovering,' she added, in an interview with New York Post. Meanwhile, Naomi's team have categorically refuted Kira's claims. 'We're sorry Kira is unwell and we hope she gets the help she obviously needs,' a source close to the model told Vogue.co.uk. 'Her allegations are absurd,' the source added. Kira, a former gymnast from Russia, appears on the American version of the show, which also has a British series.

Explaining the secret of writing product descriptions for dildos, editorial assistant Cazz Thornton plonks a plastic member onto a set of scales. It might sound bizarre but for Cazz, and the rest of the 130 strong workforce at Lovehoney, Britain's biggest sex toy retailer, this is business as usual. Scroll down for video . Inspection: Editorial assistant Cazz Thornton picks a selection of Lovehoney products at the Bath HQ . And its certainly not a job for the faint-hearted. From dealing with queries on butt plugs to dispensing advice on how to escape from a chastity belt and sending out more than 3,000 orders a day, the staff at the company certainly have their hands full. Now a new fly-on-the-wall series are to go behind the scenes at Lovehoney, shedding light on the goings on at the Bath-based retailer, whether developing new toys or fielding queries from customers. The business was founded in 2002 by a pair of former technology journalists, Richard Longhurst and Neal Slateford who identified a gap in the market for non-seedy sex toys for women, long before E.L James made whips and nipple clamps a regular part of the nation's sex life. After an initial £9000 investment, the company is now worth £30m. 'All of the websites were presented in a . really pornographic way and it was people coming from the porn world . into the sex toy world and trying to sell products that way online,' explains Longhurst of his eureka moment. Business brains: Neal Slateford (left) and Richard Longhurst (right) founded the company in 2002 . Returns: Andrea Bartlett (left) and Roy Aza (right) handle returned products with the help of some rubber gloves . 'We came at it from a totally different way - we're both internet nerds . and it's a female-friendly website.' Now he's hoping that sales will get another boost in the shape of the upcoming 50 Shades of Grey film, and hopes to cash in via the company's official 50 Shades range. 'It was such a blindingly obvious thing to . do,' explains Slateford. 'There's this massive best-selling book with loads of sex toys in it . and obviously, it has got to be good to get the license to do sex toys . based on the book.' Having approached author E.L James for approval, Lovehoney launched its 50 Shades range, which includes a spanking paddle, riding crop and love balls, in 2012 and recouped the initial investment within four months of the launch. Now, with filming for 50 Shades of Grey: The Movie well under way, the pair are excited about the retail possibilities and have sent a selection of products to director Sam Taylor-Wood in the hopes they'll feature in the film. 50 Shades of Hunk: Will 'Mr Grey' aka Jamie Dornan find himself wielding the 'Sweet Sting' riding crop? Official: Lovehoney produces the E.L James approved 50 Shades of Grey intimate accessories range . 'We've sent a 36"" bamboo cane, a red Swarovski crystal . nipple clamp and ostrich feather tickler [among other things],' explains Longhurst. 'It's a once in a lifetime . opportunity.' If they're used, however, it won't be the first time that a Lovehoney product has enjoyed a moment in the spotlight. 'We had one of our 50 Shades products, the Sweet Sting riding crop, in a Britney Spears video,' adds a gleeful Longhurst. 'It was for her smash hit song, Work . B***h.' Mischievously, he adds: 'Britney can obviously recognise quality when she sees it.' Although Longhurst and Slateford take centre stage, the new series looks set to make stars of the rest of the Lovehoney staff as well. Along with editorial assistant Cazz, later seen gamely packaging up a buzzing 'sex machine' to send to an eager reviewer, there's sweet former bank worker Chelsea who spends her days fielding inquiries about the correct way to use vibrating eggs, and Andrea Bartlett, doyenne of the returns department. Staff treats: Lovehoney staffer Mel Bartlett rummages through the company's very popular staff box . Donning rubber gloves as she unpacks an eye-opening selection of returned items, Andrea specialises in reading out the complaints, many of which are hilariously funny, straight-faced before offering a sympathetic quip to colleagues, Roy and Jax. 'This is Bam, one of our big boys,' she explains, a giant 12"" dildo drooping gently in her hand. 'It turned out to be too large so they sent it . back. Whatever floats your boat I suppose.' Reading from the accompanying note, she adds: 'Sorry to have to sent this item back - he is too big for a 4ft 10"" girl. If you could send me a six inch, that would be fine.' 'She probably took one look at it and crossed her legs!' laughs Andrea. Elsewhere in the company, Lovehoney staff are seen doing everything from compiling product reviews to giving their opinions on quirky items that range from the 'armadildo', an armadillo shaped member, to the 'winter willy warmer' and Slateford's latest invention, the vibrating finger.

"By . Lydia Warren . A Texas man has been put to death 11 years after robbing and fatally beating a delivery woman who had brought him doughnuts. Anthony Doyle, 29, was given a lethal . injection on Thursday for the death of Hyun Mi Cho, 37, who he beat with a baseball bat before stealing her car, phone and . credit cards in Rowlett in 2003. After the injection, Doyle took a few breaths and began to snore quietly before he stopped moving, the Dallas Morning News reported. He was pronounced dead 25 minutes later, at 6.49pm. Doyle did not make a statement before his death, a Department of Criminal Justice spokesman said. Texas ended its tradition of preparing a requested last meal for death row inmates in 2011. Scroll down for video . Executed: Anthony Doyle, 29, left, was put to death on Thursday for robbing and fatally beating Hyun Mi Cho, right, to death in Dallas in 2003. She was delivering food to his parents' house when he attacked her . No one from Cho's family attended the execution, but a friend of Doyle's and spiritual adviser he had picked were present. His execution came more than 11 years after Cho, a South Korea native, was killed while trying to earn money to care for her ill parents back home. She was delivering an order of doughnuts and breakfast tacos to Doyle's parents' home when she was attacked by the then 18-year-old. When placing the food order, the caller had apparently faked an elderly woman's voice and Cho was wary, but had delivered to the address before. But when she arrived, Doyle answered the door and invited her inside before demanding her money. Scene: After beating her with a baseball bat in his parents' home on this street in Rowlett, he dumped her body in a neighbors' trash can and stole her credit cards and car, which he was seen using . Responding that she had none, Cho was attacked with a baseball bat and her body was dumped in a trash can in an alley. Doyle then shared the food with friends. A neighbor taking out garbage discovered Cho's body. Police were already looking for her when she was found, and Doyle's sister told officers that she had found a brown spot on a carpet at her parents' house. Investigators found blood splatters on the ceiling and kitchen walls, and learned that Doyle had used barbecue sauce to try to cover the blood. He then tried to clean the scene and repaint the walls. Doyle, who was also seen driving Cho's car and trying to use her credit cards, was arrested at a friend's home in Dallas, then gave police a 10-page written confession. He told investigators he was under pressure from parents and his girlfriend to support his three-week-old daughter, but that he was unable to get a job. Scene: Doyle chose not to given a final statement before he was given the lethal injection at the state's death chamber in Huntsville, pictured, on Thursday. He was pronounced dead 25 minutes later . In an attempt to stop his execution, Doyle's attorney had argued that he deserved a new punishment hearing because jurors at his trial were presented with false evidence that was unknowingly false about his inability to be rehabilitated. Ahead of Doyle's execution, Texas, which has executed more people . than any other state since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, . obtained a fresh batch of its execution drug, pentobarbital, the . Department of Criminal Justice said, without revealing the . source. On Thursday, a state . judge ordered Texas to release the name of its new drug supplier and . the state attorney general's office said it would appeal the ruling. Other . U.S. states have been struggling to obtain the drugs after . pharmaceutical firms, mostly in Europe, imposed sales bans because they . object to having medications used in lethal injections. Oklahoma . has had to postpone two executions planned for this month because it . could not find drugs. Alabama said this week it has run out of one of . the main drugs it uses, stalling 16 executions. Attorney Lydia Brandt had argued the . defunct Texas Youth Commission, a military-style juvenile boot camp . where Doyle was sent, wasn't capable of delivering adequate . rehabilitation. The boot camp model designed to 'break behavior' is now . prohibited after abuses were exposed. She . argued that it was unlikely that Doyle would be sentenced to death if . he were on trial today, but prosecutors argued that Doyle had struggled . with discipline for years. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a . last-day appeal to block Doyle's execution. He was the fourth person . executed in the state this year and the 512th in Texas since the death . penalty was reinstated. Texas, which has executed more people than any other state since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, obtained a fresh batch of its execution drug, pentobarbital, the Department of Criminal Justice said this month, without revealing the source. On Thursday, a state judge ordered Texas to release the name of its new drug supplier and the state attorney general's office said it would appeal the ruling. Other U.S. states have been struggling to obtain the drugs after pharmaceutical firms, mostly in Europe, imposed sales bans because they object to having medications used in lethal injections. Oklahoma has had to postpone two executions planned for this month because it could not find drugs. Alabama said this week it has run out of one of the main drugs it uses, stalling 16 executions. Texas plans to execute five more inmates before the end of May - around the same number as every other state combined, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. But overall, executions have been on the decline in Texas, after hitting a peak of 40 in 2000. Since 2010, Texas has averaged about 15 executions a year, Reuters reported. The drop is due to the high costs of prosecutions and the availability of a sentence of life without parole. In recent years, there have been 10 or less. 'We are now very selective in what we choose to go after as death penalty cases, instead of deciding that every single murder that we try will be a capital case,' Susan Reed, the district attorney in San Antonio and a death penalty supporter, told Reuters.","Anthony Doyle, 29, chose not to give a final statement before he was given the lethal injection in Huntsville on Thursday .

"By . Damien Gayle . Chinese police detained at least 10 people for spreading rumours about the H7N9 bird flu as the death toll from the new strain of the virus rose to nine. Authorities held people in six provinces for posting 'fake information' online about new cases of the virus in their areas, the state-run Xinhua news agency said. The death toll and number of infections in China from the strain of bird flu first found in humans last month has ticked up daily. Pandemic: Workers from the local centre for disease control and prevention take part in a drill in Hefei city, Anhui province. China has arrested ten for spreading rumours about the latest bird flu outbreak . Biohazard: The death toll and number of infections in China from the strain of bird flu first found in humans last month has ticked up daily, sparking fear across the country . Nine people have died from the 33 confirmed cases of the virus, all in eastern China, according to data from the National Health and Family Planning Commission. State media quoted authorities as saying a vaccine should be ready within months. One man detained in Anhui was given seven days of administrative detention for fabricating posts about infections on Chinese microblogs, Xinhua said. The Xi'an public security bureau in Shaanxi province is investigating another man's posts, 'to prevent untrue information from causing public panic', Xinhua said. Scientists around the world have praised China for its handling of the deadly outbreak, but many Chinese are sceptical of the government's pronouncements about the H7N9 virus. The country has a history of public health scandals and cover-ups. The government initially tried to conceal an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which emerged in China in 2002 and killed about one in 10 of the 8,000 people it infected worldwide. Chinese Internet users have questioned why the government waited weeks to announce cases of the bird flu strain, but health officials said it took time to identify the virus, which was previously unknown in humans.

China's Communist Party is very keen to maintain social stability, but it has struggled to clamp down on rumours, which often spread quickly on the Internet. China found new cases of bird flu in five live bird markets in the eastern part of the country, a report posted on the website of the World Animal Health Organisation OIE showed today. China said the H7N9 avian influenza virus was found in three live bird markets in Jiangsu province, one in Anhui province and one in Zhejiang province, the report said. It did not specify in what kind of birds the virus was found. The three previous outbreaks reported last week were all in China's financial hub Shanghai. Nine people have died out of 33 confirmed human cases of the virus, according to data from the National Health and Family Planning Commission. The latest H7N9 victim was from Anhui province, the official Xinhua news agency said. Among the new cases are several from Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, at least one of whom is dangerously ill, it said. Authorities have detained people in the past for rumours, including 93 people accused of circulating information about the expected end-of-the-world apocalypse last December. Still, some commentators have noted that reports of a flu-like condition killing one person near Shanghai had been circulating on Chinese microblogs weeks before the government confirmed it was a case of H7N9. 'From this you can see if the government tried to cover up like in 2003 (SARS cases) but more and more of these posts surfaced, there would be no way to conceal it,' social media watcher and journalist Wu Heng told Reuters. The latest H7N9 victim was from Anhui province, Xinhua reported. Among the new cases are several from Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, at least one of whom is dangerously ill, the news agency said.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday that it was looking into two suspected 'family clusters' of people in China who may be infected with the H7N9 virus, potentially the first evidence of human-to-human spread. The new virus is severe in most humans, leading to fears that if it becomes easily transmissible, it could cause a deadly influenza pandemic. However, WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl told a news briefing in Geneva that so far there is no firm evidence of human-to-human transmission occurring which could spark a pandemic. Chinese health authorities have said the same.","Authorities hold people in six provinces for posting 'fake information'

"By . Fay Strang . Hugh Grant has become a father again for the third time, according to reports. The 53-year-old actor allegedly welcomed a baby boy into the world in September 2012 following a relationship with Swedish TV producer Anna Elisabet Eberstein. His arrival was just three months before the birth of his second child with lover Tinglan Hong, son Felix, according to The Sun. Hugh Grant, 53, is said to have had a son with Swedish TV producer Anna Elisabet Eberstein 16 months ago . A source told the paper: ‘They were pregnant with Hugh’s children at the same time. It’s an unusual arrangement.’ Miss Eberstein is reportedly living with her son in a £3million house near Grant's home in West London . However it is unclear whether Tinglan and Anna were aware of the fact they were both expecting the About A Boy star’s child. Hugh's involvement with Anna's child was only revealed when his full name - Hugh John Mungo Grant - appeared on the birth certificate after it was re-registered in December 2013. According to the paper, the space for the father’s name was left blank on the first certificate. The source told the paper: ‘Anna is . being supported by Hugh all the way. She lives in a very comfortable . property in West London and knows that Hugh is there for her. ‘Anna’s parents in Sweden know all about the relationship and she has their blessing.’ Tinglan, . who is the mother of Hugh’s daughter Tabitha, gave birth to Felix on . December 29 and registered the new arrival on Valentine’s Day 2013. According to the birth certificate, Felix Chang was born at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, West London . At the time the actor tweeted: ‘In . answer to some journos. Am thrilled my daughter now has a brother. Adore . them both to an uncool degree. They have a fab mum.’ Single man: Mr Grant is not believed to be dating anyone and devotes his time to the Hacked Off campaign . Miss Hong, above, and Miss Eberstein would have both been pregnant with Grant's children at the same time . He added a short while later: ‘And to be crystal clear. I am the Daddy.’ Felix’s . arrival came almost 17 months after Miss Hong gave birth to the . couple’s first child, daughter Tabitha Xaio Xi Hong Grant, at London’s . Portland Hospital, in September 2011. In an interview with American chat . show host Ellen DeGeneres, Grant admitted that while coming as something . of a shock, fatherhood had had a very positive ‘life-changing’ effect . on him. Other mother: Tinglan Hong is the mother of Grant's daughter Tabitha and son Felix . He said: . ‘Everyone was right all these years, saying: “Hugh, why don’t you have . some children? It changes your life.” Now that I have a child, it is . life-changing. I recommend it. Get some. ‘I . can’t pretend it wasn’t a little bit of a surprise. But it’s a very . nice surprise. In fact, the baby’s name in Chinese, because the mother’s . is Chinese, means ‘happy surprise’. Miss Hong, who was born in Zhejiang . province in eastern China and moved to Britain in 2003, is understood to . have met Grant in a Chelsea wine bar in 2008. The pair struck up an unlikely friendship before embarking on a relationship in January 2011. Tabitha’s . arrival was kept secret for two months until the actor’s spokesman . released a statement confirming the birth but adding that Grant – who . rose to fame in Four Weddings And A Funeral in 1994 – was no longer in a . relationship with Miss Hong. It read: ‘I can confirm that Hugh . Grant is the delighted father of a baby girl. He and the mother had a . fleeting affair and while this was not planned, Hugh could not be . happier or more supportive.’ Hugh dated Elizabeth Hurley for 13 years and remains close . to the model  - he is the godfather to . her son Damien. Following their amicable split he then started dating Jemima Khan for . three years.  He is currently believed to . be single. A spokesperson for Hugh Grant has been contacted for comment.

"By . Ruth Styles . With Michael Fassbender, Gemma Arterton and Sir Paul McCartney among fans of his work, it's safe to say that artist Chris Moon has no shortage of celebrity followers. Now the A-list favourite has turned his paintbrush on Hollywood for his third collection of paintings, A Splendid Isolation. The works, which will go on display in London for the first time on Friday, include versions of some of LA's most iconic sights as well as haunting depictions of the desolate desert panoramas that surround Tinseltown. Spectacular: The new exhibition by British artist Chris Moon offers an abstract take on Hollywood . Along with the pool at A-list favourite Chateau Marmont, Venice Beach, San Diego, Death Valley, and Las Vegas also get the Moon treatment, rendered lonely and haunting in his work. The East London-born artist has made a name for himself thanks to his woozily abstract style of painting and deconstructed landscapes. Described by Harper's Bazaar as 'a new art superstar', Moon, currently one of the UK's most important contemporary artists, was even favourably compared to Francis Bacon by AnOther magazine art critic Jean-Paul Pryor. Yet despite the beauty of his work, Moon says the drawings of Arthur Conan-Doyle - created after he was sectioned - were an early inspiration. Famous fans: Sir Paul McCartney (left) and 12 Years A Slave star Michael Fassbender (right) Big name supporter: Chris Moon with actress and long time fan Gemma Arterton at one of his exhibitions . Speaking to AnOther magazine, he explained: I think the drawings I had a book of were from his years in an asylum â€“ these bizarre interactions between human form and insects. 'My headspace was filled with this completely traditional form of painting infused with the completely surreal.' While his own work has a surreal quality of its own, his delicately rendered Hollywood tableaux are far from bizarre, and rather than getting him sectioned, are more than likely to win him a few more A-list fans. Michael Fassbender might just have to start paying more for his decor. A Splendid Isolation is curated by Gilly Fox and opens on 28th March at the new gallery space at Forge & Co on Shoreditch High Street. See chrismoonart.com for more information.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Councillor Steve Hayward still claims his £4,350-a-year allowance despite living in Thailand and insists he can do his job via email and Skype . A councillor is still claiming his £4,000-a-year allowance despite living 8,500 miles from his constituency in Thailand. Steve Hayward, a councillor for Ducklington, in Oxfordshire, insists he is still able to do his job via Skype and email, and . has no plans to stand down until the next election in May. Mr Hayward moved to Khao Lak, on the west coast of Thailand, from his home in Whitney in June, where he now helps run two restaurants as well as a rice and sugar farm. He said: 'I have kept in contact with council officers, fellow councillors, constituents and others who have contacted me over this time. 'Using the telephone, e-mail and Skype I believe I have an excellent record of replying quickly. 'It has been one of my busiest years and I have been able to quickly deal with four council housing allocations and able to help in several local planning issues, mostly with satisfactory outcomes. 'I have been lucky that fellow councillors have been able to help when immediate action was necessary, much the same as if I was driving my lorry or out of the area.' Mr Hayward's annual councillor allowance of £4,350 is being paid to him in monthly installments. The former mayor and lorry-driver has attended just one meeting since the move, and is unable to vote unless he is present, but insists he would fly back if he was required. Mr Hayward resigned from the Conservative Party last year after being sacked from a committee position and was deselected from his seat on Oxfordshire County Council. In June last year Mr Hayward moved to the resort town of Khao Lak on the western coast of Thailand . Mr Hayward now owns 10 per cent shares in two restaurants as well as a share of a rice and sugar plantation . Former chairman of Ducklington parish council Gordon Clack said: 'It . is outrageous. We keep hearing about cuts, but we never hear about cuts . to councillor expenses. 'I spent about 12 years on our parish . council and my home was an office, but I never claimed a penny. Now you . have professional councillors. 'I cannot see how he can do his job. If someone choses to live abroad surely the moral thing to do is to resign.' To seek council election a candidate . must, on the day of their nomination, be an elector in the local . authority area, own land or premises there, have their main place of . work there or have lived there for the whole of 12 months before the day . of the election. Current rules do not allow Mr Hayward to be ousted from his post as councillor for Ducklington (pictured) Once elected, a councillor does not have to resign if none of these criteria no longer apply. West Oxfordshire District Council chief executive David Neudegg said: 'The minimum legal requirement is for a councillor to attend at least one council meeting in any six month period to remain in office. 'A councillor cannot be disqualified by the district council if they move out of the area. It is up to them to decide whether they should continue or resign.'","Steve Hayward has been a councillor for Ducklington for 15 years .

"By . James Tozer . Louise Blackwell QC, defending Bill Roache (pictured), poured scorn on the idea that the actor turned from 'perfect gentleman' to a sexual predator and back again, she told the jury . The ‘spectre’ of Jimmy Savile and an unhealthy interest in sending celebrities to court for sex offences is haunting the trial of  William Roache, his defence counsel claimed yesterday. A ‘crisis of confidence’ following the exposure of Savile’s abuse explained why the allegations against the 81-year-old actor had been brought to court over alleged sex offences regardless of ‘worrying inconsistencies’ in his accusers’ accounts, a jury was told. But now the ‘buck stops’ with them and it is their duty to see ‘reason and fairness’ prevail and acquit Roache on all counts, his barrister argued. The prosecution has claimed Roache – who has played Ken Barlow in Coronation Street  since its launch – should be judged as the sex-obsessed ‘heart-throb’ he was in the 1960s and early 1970s when he allegedly targeted young girls, not the ‘lovely chap’ he is today. However Louise Blackwell, QC, representing the twice-married father-of-four, ridiculed the idea that the ‘perfect gentleman’ had once been a ‘risk-taking predator’. ‘How do you hide that and completely stop it for the next 42 years from 1972?’ she asked. ‘Well, you don’t.’ Giving her closing speech at Preston . Crown Court yesterday, Miss Blackwell told jurors ‘the spectre of Jimmy . Savile hangs over this case’, saying it had ‘infected’ the trial. Roache, pictured arriving at court today with his family, is accused of using his fame and popularity to exploit 'starstruck' youngsters in the late 60s and early 70s . Roache denies all the charges and has told the jury at Preston Crown Court he has no knowledge of any of the women he is supposed to have assaulted . Ms Blackwell reminded the jury of the glowing testimonies given about the defendant by his co-stars, Ann Kirkbride, who plays his on-screen wife Deirdre Barlow, and Helen Worth, also known as Gail Platt . ‘Jimmy Savile is like an elephant in the room,’ she went on. ‘You can’t ignore it.’ Miss . Blackwell said the entire investigation into the allegations against . Roache showed ‘an unhealthy interest in the concept of celebrity’. ‘We . say everything in this case suggests that when allegations are made . against a celebrity, the Jimmy Savile crisis of conscience means that a . fair investigation does not take place.’ She . insisted there were damning inconsistencies in the women’s accounts. She said the first woman to come forward and accuse Roache of raping her . and taking her virginity was unsure how old she had been at the time. Miss . Blackwell said it was ‘just not possible’ for a woman not to remember . when her first experience of sex happened when it allegedly involved a . ‘horrid’ rape by a famous actor. ‘It totally lacks sense and credibility,’ she said. Miss . Blackwell also highlighted Roache’s evidence that he didn’t own a . gold-coloured Rolls-Royce – in which one of the attacks is said to have . taken place – until almost 20 years later. She . said this was a ‘fundamental flaw’ in the case which showed the alleged . victim and her sister – who is also a complainant – had ‘got their . heads together’ before giving evidence. Roache, . from Wilmslow, Cheshire, denies two counts of rape and four counts of . indecent assault against five girls aged 16 and under, saying he has no . knowledge of any of the  alleged victims. He has been found not guilty of a further count of indecent assault against one of the girls on the direction of the judge. The trial continues.

"By . Rebecca English, Royal Correspondent In Colombo . Prince Charles steered clear of criticising Sri Lanka's record on human rights on Friday as he made his first address to a Commonwealth summit on behalf of the Queen. The closest the Prince came to referring to allegations of torture, kidnap and other abuses was when he said the gathering needed to address the ‘security’ of its members nations and referred to the ‘touch of healing’ the 53-nation body can bring. Although the Queen is Head of the Commonwealth she has decided to scale down her long-haul international travel and asked her son to represent her at this year’s Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Scroll down for video . Jovial: President Mahinda Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka laughs with Prince Charles, Prince of Wales as David Cameron looks on during the Commonwealth Heads of Government 2013 Opening Ceremony on Friday . But the Colombo-based gathering has turned into a political minefield, with Canada and India pulling out of the summit in protest at alleged war crimes and attacks against his own people by Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaska. Charles, who is normally nothing less than outspoken about issues close to his heart, will have to bite his tongue as the Queen is required to stay publically neutral on such issues, although critics of the regime are putting increasing pressure on him to raise concerns with the president privately. In his opening speech, Charles said: ‘At the personal request of The Queen, I am delighted to be addressing you this morning on behalf of the Head of the Commonwealth. Diplomatic: Prince Charles avoided referring to referring to allegations of torture, kidnap and other abuses by the Sri Lankan regime when he made his inaugural Commonwealth speech . Seated from left to right Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Prince Charles and Commonwealth Secretary General Kamalesh Sharma, with heads of the commonwealth nations . ‘Her Majesty's deep affection for the Commonwealth, and the special importance she has attached to it throughout her reign, are well known to you all. And if I may say so, those very sentiments have been an ever-present cornerstone in my own life also. It is therefore my particular privilege and pleasure to be representing The Queen at this, the 2013 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. ‘I am especially pleased to be back among the people of Sri Lanka who, in recent years, have confronted great adversity. My last visit here, in 2005, came just weeks after the devastating tsunami had struck these shores. I visited communities affected by the disaster and met many of the relief workers who were doing so much to help rebuild broken lives and livelihoods. ‘I recall my admiration for the fortitude shown by them all at that time and commend the progress that has been made since in healing those dreadful scars.’ Momentous: Prince Charles giving his speech as a representative of Queen Elizabeth . He said that in the early days of the Commonwealth, India's Prime Minister Nehru declared that the body ‘seemed capable of bringing a touch of healing' to the management of contemporary world problems. ‘More than 60 years later, we should not need to be reminded of the many troubles that beset our world, some of them previously little understood, nor should we underestimate the importance and responsibility of the Commonwealth's role in addressing them,’ he said. He said the Commonwealth Charter, signed earlier this year, which enshrines human rights in the values of member states, was designed to ‘light the path of all those involved in the work of the Commonwealth.’ Grand entrance: President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Prince Charles walk onto the stage . He added: ‘At this CHOGM, and guided by that spirit, the Commonwealth is being charged to confront the many issues affecting the security and well-being of its nations and peoples. ‘The Queen wishes you well in these vitally important deliberations.’ He concluded: ‘Ladies and gentlemen, each one of us is here because of the hope and the trust we place in the Commonwealth to bring that “touch of healing” to our troubles and deliver the very best future for our people.’ In his own speech, however, Mr Rajapaska was bullish in defence of his handling of the bitter civil war against the island’s Tamil-dominated north. Handshake: President Mahinda Rajapaksa greets David Cameron ahead of the Commonwealth Heads of Government 2013 Opening Ceremony . Hundreds of ethnic Tamils protested in the main northern city of Jaffna before British Prime Minister David Cameron's arrival, demanding answers about the thousands who went missing near the war's end in 2009 between soldiers and ethnic Tamil rebels . He said: ‘We in Sri Lanka are stepping into a new era of peace, stability and renewed economic opportunities that have long been denied to my people due to the menace of terrorism that existed for nearly three decades. ‘In ending terrorism in 2009 (when the civil war with Tamils in the north ended) we asserted the greatest human right of all - the right to life. ‘I'm happy to say that in the last four years there has not been a single terrorist-related incident anywhere in Sri Lanka.’ He added that the Commonwealth ‘should not be a punitive or judgemental body’. The Duchess of Cornwall arrives for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who hosted the last summit and passed over the chairmanship to Sri Lanka's President, urged the president to grasp the bull by the horns, saying that recent events in South Africa and Ireland showed that ‘intractable’ problems could be solved. Before the Prince made his speech to open the summit, the heads or representatives of the 53 member nations were announced one by one and took their places on the stage. Britain’s Cameron was seated two rows behind the Prince, with the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Gordon Darcy Lilo, on his right and Rwanda's President Paul Kagame on his left. Mr Cameron gave President Rajapaska a round of applause when he came onto the stage at the conference theatre (which is also named after him). The Prime Minister has defied calls to boycott the Commonwealth summit and today will put his concerns - including demands for an independent inquiry into alleged war crimes by state forces - directly to the Sri Lankan president in a face-to-face meeting. As many as 40,000 civilians are estimated to have died in the final months of the regime's 26-year fight with Tamil Tiger separatists according to the UN, which wants an international probe if no new inquiry is held. Mr Rajapaksa rejects claims his forces indiscriminately shelled Tamils fleeing the intense fighting as the Tigers - themselves a brutal guerrilla movement - were defeated and of battlefield executions and rapes. Among the VIPs in the audience were three of the president's brothers, who are the Speaker, Defence Secretary and Minister for Economic Development, and his three sons, who all play for the national rugby team, of which one is captain. Meanwhile, The Duchess of Cornwall declared herself a ‘huge fan’ of the Harry Potter books and films on an official visit to a public library in Colombo. Camilla, who supports several literacy initiatives in the UK, described author JK Rowling as ‘brilliant’ and said she was very sad when the seven-book series came to an end. While her husband tip-toed his way through the minefield that is Commonwealth politics, the Duchess spent the morning at Colombo’s Public Library’s where she recognised the achievements of children from all religious and ethnic backgrounds - Tamil, Sinhalese, Christian and Muslim – in an annual writing competition. She also presented a prize to Shenuka Corea, the overall winner of the 2012 Commonwealth Essay Competition, which has been run by the Royal Commonwealth Society since 1883. It is the world's oldest and largest essay competition and is open to all Commonwealth citizens aged 18 or under, offering young people the opportunity to make their voice heard on a global platform. Wearing a pretty cream and beige Anna Valentine dress, the Duchess arrived to a lively traditional local welcome, featuring brilliantly clad dancers and drummers, before chatting with several of the talented youngsters. Krishnavi Rathnaranjan, 14, who wrote an award-winning essay on ‘why reading makes you perfect’ told her that JK Rowling was her favourite author. Camilla replied: ‘Oh I love Harry Potter. Have you read all the books and seen the films? I was very sad when it finished. She is a brilliant writer.’ The Duchess was also asked to light a ceremonial candle before the official prize giving ceremony. Referring to her husband, who almost set his jacket alight yesterday when he brushed past an oil burner, she said: ‘I hope I don’t set this alight. We’ve already had enough trouble.’ As she left Camilla thanked everyone and promised to return. ‘I hope I will be back before too long,’ she said. The Duchess is keen to promote the benefits of reading. Her Royal Highness is Patron of the National Literacy Trust, BookTrust and First Story, all of which are UK charities that help to promote literacy in young people.","Event is a political minefield with Canada and India boycotting it .

"By . Richard Shears In Sydney . and Lucy Crossley . Three minke whale carcasses lie on the deck of a Japanese ship in a picture which campaigners say proves the country is guilty of ‘medieval butchery’. It was taken from a helicopter flown by activists in an area of the Southern Ocean designated a protected zone for whales. Bob Brown, of the Sea  Shepherd organisation which clashes each year with Tokyo’s ships, said: ‘It’s just a gruesome, bloody, medieval scene  which has got no place in this modern world.’ Scroll down for video . This photograph of three dead minke whales was taken by anti-whaling campaigners after they allegedly caught the Japanese vessel inside an internationally-recognised sanctuary . Militant anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd says it spotted the Nisshin Maru sailing through the protected Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary during the annual whaling season . As the Sea Shepherd's helicopter flew above the Japanese ship, campaigners shot footage of the blood-streaked deck and the carcasses of three dead minke whales . Japanese ships catch and kill hundreds . of whales in the Southern Ocean each year despite having agreed, under . pressure from the US, to an international moratorium on commercial . whaling. They cite a 1946 treaty which they claim exempts hunting  the mammals for scientific research. Mr . Brown said Sea Shepherd boats had caught up with five of Japan’s . whaling vessels and had photographed evidence of  their illegal . activities inside the internationally recognised whale sanctuary – an . area of 50million square kilometres surrounding Antarctica and close to . Australian and New Zealand waters. Sea Shepherd said that another whale, also believed to be a minke, was being butchered on board . The commercial hunting of whales is prohibited in the sanctuary, which was designated by the International Whaling Commission in 1994 . Clashes between whale poachers and . activists have become increasingly aggressive, with water cannon fired, . ships colliding and protesters boarding one of the whaling vessels. Activists have urged the Australian and New Zealand governments to take . action. Dr Brown said: 'There's . three carcasses on the ship, a fourth carcass has been cut up. There's . blood all over the place, meat being carted around on this factory ship . deck, offal and innards being dumped in the ocean.'. New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully denied whaling was taking place within his country's maritime jurisdiction, saying the site was considered international waters, as he condemned the 'pointless and offensive' practice. 'The New Zealand government has repeatedly called on Japan to end its whaling programme. We reiterate this message today,' he said. Sea Shepherd said they had spotted the Japanese fleet today and captured evidence that four whales had been slaughtered, alleging the ships were found inside the sanctuary . Japan is allowed to catch the animals under a 'scientific research' loophole in the moratorium on whaling . Japan's fisheries agency said its programme was being conducted 'in line with a research plan submitted to the IWC'. 'We are not aware of the existence of a whaling sanctuary so we don't want to comment on their arguments,' an agency spokesman said of Brown's claims. The Japanese foreign ministry said research whaling was 'not a violation or an abuse of a loophole in the international convention'. 'Quite the contrary, this is a legitimate right of the contracting party under Article VIII of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling,' it said. Dr Brown described 'massive violence' against the whales, using grenade-tipped harpoons to catch them, and said Sea Shepherd would do 'all it peaceably can to prevent this grotesque and cruel destruction', also urging Australia and New Zealand to take action. Japan's fisheries agency said its programme was being conducted 'in line with a research plan submitted to the IWC' Peter Hammarstedt, captain of the Sea Shepherd ship Bob Barker, said Japan had shown 'flagrant disregard for international law' by continuing whaling . 'There is nothing scientific about this, it is butchery,' Dr Brown said. 'The one thing that's missing here is gumption - a bit of spine in Canberra and in Wellington to put an end to it.' Australia has taken Japan to the International Court of Justice seeking to have its research whaling programme declared illegal, with a ruling due this year. Peter Hammarstedt, captain of the Sea Shepherd ship Bob Barker, said Japan had shown 'flagrant disregard for international law by continuing their illegal whale hunt while the world patiently awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice'. Sea Shepherd left Australia for their 10th annual harassment campaign of the Japanese fleet last month, sending three ships to tail and run interference against the harpooners. High-seas clashes between the two groups are common, resulting in the 2010 sinking of the Sea Shepherd vessel Ady Gil. Australia will be monitoring confrontations between the pair from a government jet which is due to fly surveillance missions over the Southern Ocean between January and March. However, Dr Brown said there had so far been no sign of the aircraft.","Campaigners say they spotted vessels in Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Paedophile Jimmy Savile may have stayed in a caravan on school grounds during a roadshow tour in the Seventies, it has been revealed. Lawyers investigating sex abuse claims are now looking into Savile's activities at the unnamed school, in West Bridgford, Notts. where it is thought he stayed during the height of his TV fame. The lawyers are also looking into allegations that Savile would often park his van off the A1 in Grantham and trawl the area looking for victims. Lawyers are investigating claims that Savile parked a caravan on the grounds of a school in West Bridgford, Notts. while touring the UK in the 1970s . Last year a Nottingham woman claimed she was molested by Savile during a . roadshow at Saxondale Hospital, near Radcliffe-on-Trent in 1971. In 2012 it was also revealed that Scotland Yard investigated the pervert . for molesting a young girl in his mobile home at BBC Television Centre. In total seven complaints made to Notts Police about Savile have been referred to Operation Yewtree. In 2012 a woman claimed she was sexually assaulted in the motor home (pictured) while it was parked at the BBC Television Centre in London . Emma Jones, from law firm Leigh Day which is acting on behalf of some the alleged victims, said: 'We are interested in Savile's activities in south Nottingham and his apparent interest in schools and hospitals between Grantham and Nottingham. 'Anyone with any knowledge should come forward to the police so a full picture of his crimes can be established.' A report into the alleged abuse of 1,000 children by Savile on BBC premises is also expected to be published in the middle of the year. Law firm Leigh Day are also looking into allegations that Savile parked his van just off of the A1 near Grantham and then prowled the area looking for victims . The NHS is carrying out its own investigation looking into Savile's activities at 32 hospitals across the country. Savile, who presented Top Of The Pops and Jim’ll Fix It, died aged 84 in October 2011, a year before the allegations were broadcast in an  ITV documentary. A report by Scotland Yard and the NSPCC found he used his celebrity status to ‘hide in plain sight’, with 214 criminal offences recorded against him across 28 police forces. The report also revealed that Savile abused his victims at medical sites including hospitals, mental health units – and even a hospice.","Lawyers are probing Savile's activities at a school in West Bridgford, Notts.

"By . Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent . Young people are failing to find work because they lack ‘grit’, a minister has warned. Nick Hurd insisted that ‘social skills and discipline’ are every bit as essential for success as qualifications – yet they are not being taught in schools. The minister for civil society also said he was struck by the ‘crushingly low’ self-confidence of many youngsters and the effect this has on their employment prospects. Minister for Civil Society Nick Hurd said 'social skills and discipline' are as important as qualifications for success but they are not being taught in schools . His provocative comments came in response to the revelation that the number of 16- to 24-year-olds classed as ‘Neets’ –  or ‘not in education, employment or training’ – has risen to an estimated 1.09million. Of these, 47 per cent are not looking for work and are classed as economically inactive. And at a time when there are 529,000 job vacancies – up 56,000 in a year – it is estimated that some 640,000 Neets have never worked at all. Mr Hurd, son of former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, said: ‘What we see in survey after survey is employers saying qualifications are important, but that just as important to us are so-called soft skills, character skills, the ability to get on with different people, to articulate yourself clearly, confidence, grit, self-control, these kind of qualities, and they are saying we are not seeing enough of this in kids coming out of school. Nick Hurd said youngsters lack 'grit' and many have 'crushingly low' self-confidence . ‘Something’s going wrong, this is a critical time in their lives to be stretching and challenging them and make them feel engaged.’ He added that the current estimate of 1.09million Neets was a ‘horrible number and it’s been high for too long’. He said: ‘The longer they stay out of work, the bigger the problem that becomes.’ A report from the Institute for Public Policy Research last week estimated that some 640,000 Neets had never even had a job. Spencer Thompson, an economic analyst at the Left-wing think-tank, said: ‘We know from countless surveys of employers that they value employability and that those skills are lacking among young people. ‘They need people who turn up on time, look presentable and know how to present themselves in an interview.’ A separate report from the British Chambers of Commerce also revealed how many bosses are ‘disheartened, if not downright frustrated’ by school leavers. Mr Hurd last week visited the National Citizen Service, a volunteering programme for thousands of 16- and 17-year-olds which the Government hopes will help them develop the skills needed for the workplace. The scheme involves two weeks of team-building skills while living away from home, then the youngsters return to run a charity venture of their choice in their local area. It will be carried out by 34,000 young people this year, and following a funding boost from the Government ministers hope that 150,000 youngsters will have completed it by 2015. Charities and MPs have questioned whether the money spent on running the scheme – £62million in the 2012-13 financial year – could be better invested in services to help disadvantaged youngsters. But as no participant pays more than £50, . Old Etonian Mr Hurd said those of all backgrounds could benefit from . it. He added: ‘This is not for disadvantaged young people, it’s for kids . from both ends of the spectrum, which is very powerful in breaking down . misconceptions and building confidence. The number of 16 to 24-year-olds not in employment, education or training has risen to 1.09million . ‘The workplace has changed and most of the jobs I know require dealing with different types of people, communication skills. We need to raise our level of aspiration, show young people what they can do.’ Mr Hurd said 95 per cent of recruits told him they would otherwise be ‘on the sofa’ and the programme had ‘changed their lives’. He added: ‘I’ve been so struck over the years by how crushingly low sometimes confidence and self-esteem are among young people and it’s amazing what impact you can have in just three weeks.’ Describing a group who completed the programme last year, he said: ‘There’s a definite before and after effect in terms of their ability to articulate and present themselves. 'The skills employers tend to talk about are social agility, the ability to get on with different types of people, and resilience, the ability to stick with things. ‘NCS is not a silver bullet, we need to create more jobs, but it plays a part alongside apprenticeships and traineeships and what we’re doing to improve our schools.’ The Education Select Committee estimates extending NCS to half of 16-year-olds would cost £350million a year – more than all youth services provided by local authorities. Sir Terry Leahy, Tesco chief executive, said employers were being left to 'pick up the pieces' Bosses have frequently claimed that young people are unable to find work because they are not taught the right skills at school. Sir Terry Leahy, who at the time was boss of Tesco, delivered a stinging attack on the education system in 2009. He called it ‘woeful’ and said employers were too often ‘left to pick up the pieces’.Sir Terry told an industry conference in London: ‘One area that Tesco is particularly concerned about is education. ‘As the largest private employer in . the country, we depend on high standards in our schools. Sadly, despite . all the money that has been spent, standards are still woefully low in . too many schools. Employers like us are often left to pick up the . pieces.’ He added: ‘From . my perspective there are too many agencies and bodies, often issuing . reams of instructions to teachers, who then get distracted from the task . at hand: teaching children.’ Sir . Stuart Rose, at the time the Marks & Spencer chairman, made similar . comments only a week later, claiming school leavers were ‘not fit for . work’. He said too many young people were leaving school without a basic grasp of the three Rs.In an outspoken attack, the retailing boss said: ‘They cannot do reading. They cannot do arithmetic. They cannot do writing.’ Sir Terry, who was brought up on a Liverpool council estate and educated at a grammar school, was the only one of four brothers not to leave school at 16. He rose to the position of chief executive at Tesco after starting his career at the supermarket chain stacking shelves and washing floors.","Nick Hurd said 'social skills and discipline' important as grades for success .

"By . Arthur Martin . and Hugo Gye . Claims: Dave Lee Travis, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court today, says he had to sell his house to fight assault allegations against him . Dave Lee Travis told a court he has a ‘cuddly nature’ but denied being a ‘sexual predator’. Speaking from the witness box yesterday, the former Radio 1 DJ said he ‘loves women’ because they are ‘wonderful’ and have  ‘fabulous shapes’. The 68-year-old said he did not have a predatory nature with women, but admitted he did ‘hug a lot of girls’. ‘If I like someone I will hug them and give them a kiss because the whole world needs that,’ he told the court. ‘Perhaps hugging is something which can be misconstrued by some people or if people are looking for an excuse they can say “he touched us”. I did hug a lot of girls. ‘But nowadays you can’t do that apparently … So it is an unfortunate trait I suppose.’ Travis described his colourful career as a ‘big name’ DJ at Radio 1 – but told Southwark Crown Court he could not do what he wanted. Travis spoke of his passion for photography and admitted he has taken pictures of naked and semi-naked women for a book he published. But he insisted that the pictures were not ‘tacky’ and said he did not use his hobby to prey on women. ‘I love women,’ he told the jury. ‘I think they are wonderful.’ He added: ‘Women just have such fabulous shapes and I wanted to utilise those shapes.’ Among the allegations against him, Travis is accused of  sneaking into a Radio 4 studio and groping a presenter as she introduced Woman’s Hour live on air in the early 1980s. Denying the attack, he said: ‘I would be at a bit of a loose end understanding it to be quite honest with you.’ He said he would have been hauled before a station boss if he had dared to interrupt a Radio 4 programme. On the stand: A sketch of Travis giving evidence in his own defence at the court today . On trial: The veteran former DJ denies assaulting 11 alleged victims over a period of more than three decades . ‘I agree I was a big name in Radio 1, but there were quite a few big names. You did not do what you wanted at the BBC,’ he said. Years later he met the woman at a party where he took a photograph of her. He . said: ‘Everything seemed to be fine. That was a serious thing that in . her mind had happened. Why would she suddenly be posing and smiling for . me and for the camera? ‘I . thought she was great, I thought she was fabulous, a really nice lady. That’s why I don’t get this. On the rare occasions I met her, I thought . she was superb.’ Denial: Travis said that although he loves women's 'shapes' he is not a sexual predator . Travis, . who is being tried under his real name of Dave Patrick Griffin, was also . questioned over claims he pushed his hand up the skirt of a newsreader . while he was working for Classic Gold radio station in the early 2000s. ‘This is not something you would do if you are a normal human being,’ the DJ told the court. ‘It’s astonishing because I even thought, and I said to police, that she was wearing trousers.’ When . asked about whether it had ever been suggested he had a reputation for . being a ‘sexual predator’ at the station, he said: ‘No, no one said a . thing about it. ‘You can’t sexually assault a woman and expect people would not say anything. I would fully expect to be kicked out.’ He . added: ‘I’m sorry, but this is my reputation I have spent 50 years . building up – I’m not going to let it all go to pot over something a kid . made up.’ Travis insisted . he left Classic Gold in 2002 due to disagreements over music selection, . and not as a result of allegations of sexual assault. Travis, . of Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, denies 13 counts of indecent assault . dating back to between 1976 and 2003, and one count of sexual assault in . 2008. The trial continues. Dave Lee Travis cried himself to sleep after being accused of assaulting women and said the allegations had ruined his life and career, a court heard today. The veteran DJ claimed he had been 'screwed backwards' by the claims, telling police his wife Marianne was ill with breast cancer at the time they emerged. He also said he had been forced to sell his home to fight the allegations, which he said had been made up by his accusers in a bid to 'make money'. Today jurors heard extracts from a police interview with Travis on September 18 last year, 10 months after he was first arrested. Couple: Travis said that his wife Marianne, right, was suffering from breast cancer at the time the allegations first surface . 'Mr Travis said that for 10 months he . had lost his money, work, his health, he has had back and knee . operations and had suffered stress,' said junior prosecutor Teresa Hay. 'Worse . still, his wife had suffered breast cancer. She was through it now but . stress is bad for someone who is going through that. 'This . was costing him his job, his living and everything he has built up over . 50 years. For him these allegations don't stand up. He and his wife had . suffered badly.' He said his accuser was 'out to make money' and asked: 'Why wait 20 years until it comes out in one-sided press coverage?' 'This is just someone else who can smell money and is jumping into the game to see what they can get out of it,' he told police. Ms Hay said Travis told police that 'he has been screwed . backwards - he is selling his house to pay for solicitors and . barristers. 'People might think he is a millionaire but his bank account is non-existent. 'His . life has changed for the worse and he is full of anger. Even if he is . acquitted he still won't be free. He has cried at night.' Home: Travis told police he had been forced to sell his house in Buckinghamshire, pictured, to pay his legal bills . The . jury heard that Travis was questioned in relation to allegations that . he groped a woman while dancing the Lambada at two British Airways . parties in the early 1990s. He . told police he would provide musical entertainment at such parties, . often wearing fancy dress, but could not remember those events in . particular. Asked about claims that he had told . the woman she had 'won the keys to his room', he claimed it was not the . type of thing he would say. He went on: 'It is just because she saw a picture of me in the paper next to Jimmy Savile. It is nonsense.' Travis . also told police that he had 'great sympathy' with rape victims and had . been involved in attempts to stop it in his work for children's . charities. 'But he didn't see the similarity between this and grabbing a girl's bum in a dance,' Ms Hay said. The . court has previously heard claims that Travis molested a teenager at a . Showaddywaddy concert and assaulted a woman in the BBC studio while . broadcasting his Radio 1 show. He . is also accused of attacking a theatre worker in his dressing room . while appearing in panto, stopping only when one of the Chuckle Brothers . walked past. Dave . Lee Travis groped a journalist's bottom while they were playing a . flight simulator game on his computer, a court heard today. The . German woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was visiting his . home in Buckinghamshire to interview him about Beat Club, a TV show . which he once presented. She . told jurors she was 'embarrassed and taken aback' by the DJ's 'sleazy' behaviour during the alleged incident in August 2005, which followed a . 90-minute interview. Travis invited the woman to play his favourite game and stood behind her as she began to play, the court heard. 'That's when he put his hand on a . shoulder, ran it down my back and rested it on the left cheek of my . bum,' she said. 'It was an extremely uncomfortable moment. 'I was completely taken aback, it was just unexpected. I felt it was sleazy, there was absolutely no option for me than to move. 'I was rather embarrassed and I was embarrassed for him about this kind of behaviour, it was just so inappropriate.' Star: The claims against Travis date back to the height of his fame as a DJ and presenter in the 1970s . The reporter said that after the incident she 'pretended it didn't happen', while Travis appeared 'sheepish'. She asked Travis to give her a lift to the local train station, where she took a photograph of the pair together. 'I . did feel it was a really embarrassing situation and it was, I guess an . attempt to make light of the situation,' the woman told the court. She said that the DJ 'pulled her towards him and we ended up standing cheek to cheek', adding: 'That's not the photograph I wanted. 'I have interviewed many, many famous people in my journalistic career and most of the time they are pleasant people. 'My only explanation was that he must have felt really sheepish about what happened. 'I think the situation was so awkward, it was obvious this elderly gentleman who I had never heard of before completely crossed the line. It must have been embarrassing for him.' The alleged victim confided in her partner but did not complain about the incident, saying 'it would have been very difficult' to lodge an official complaint. 'For me the situation was so embarrassing, it was so strange, I didn't feel I wanted to complain to someone,' she said. 'I sometimes thought in retrospect it would have been the smarter or braver thing to do at the time.' She eventually came forward after hearing of Travis' arrest in November 2012. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Former Radio 1 DJ is accused of 14 counts of assault over three decades .

"By . James Chapman, Daily Mail Political Editor . Iain Duncan Smith last night called on Ed Miliband to ‘immediately’ say what cuts Labour would make to keep within a legal cap on welfare set by the Government. The Work and Pensions Secretary said the Labour leader’s decision to back the new long-term limit was a ‘scam’ unless he was prepared to say how he would fund the scrapping of the so-called bedroom tax. A group of 13 Labour MPs, including former frontbenchers Diane Abbott and Tom Watson, rebelled against their party’s backing for the Government’s plan. Demand: Iain Duncan Smith (left) has called on Ed Miliband (right) to 'immediately' say what cuts Labour would make to keep within a legal cap on welfare set by the Government . But the measure, which means overall welfare spending cannot rise above inflation from a fixed limit of £119.5billion until 2020, passed easily in the Commons, by 520 votes to 22. A radical new limit – to be set every five years, and taking effect next year – will include housing benefit, tax credits, disability benefits and pensioner benefits, although the state pension and jobseekers’ allowance will be excluded. Governments will have to respond to any breach of the cap by cutting welfare in what Chancellor George Osborne describes as a ‘limit on the nation’s credit card’. Under the legislation, any increase on one part of the welfare budget will have to be offset with cuts elsewhere. A Commons vote will have to be held if the cap is breached and the Government does not want to respond by cutting spending. Pledge: Labour has already pledged to reverse cuts in housing benefit for council tenants with spare rooms - dubbed the 'bedroom tax' by critics . An incoming Labour government will be free to set a higher cap at the start of the next parliament, but would have to change the law if it wanted to unpick the system altogether. Labour has already pledged to reverse cuts in housing benefit for council tenants with spare rooms - dubbed the ‘bedroom tax’ by critics. Mr Duncan Smith said reversing the housing benefit cuts would mean Labour would immediately breach the cap as it would cost £460million. ‘They have to say immediately now what would they actually reduce in that spending to be able to afford that otherwise they are voting to break the cap immediately,’ the Work and Pensions Secretary said. ‘I think there’s a bit of a scam going on. Because what they are trying to persuade their own backbenchers is, “Don’t worry, we won’t implement this as it stands”. ‘They have to tell us whether they would make savings to cover getting rid of the spare room subsidy.’ Ed Miliband suffered a fresh blow yesterday when a poll showed that fewer than a fifth of voters think he is fit to be prime minister. A YouGov survey said that just 19 per cent could imagine him in Downing Street and only 26 per cent of voters think Labour is ready for government.","Work and Pensions Secretary says Ed Miliband should 'immediately' say what cuts Labour would make to keep within a legal cap on welfare .

"By . James  Nye . A Salvadoran thug who executed his 19-year-old ex-girlfriend and let fellow gang members shoot her terrified two-old-son as he grabbed his leg for help has been added to the FBI's 'Ten Most Wanted Fugitives' list. MS-13 gang member Juan Elias Garcia, 21, whose last reported sighting was somewhere in Honduras in 2011, is the fourth person sought by federal authorities in the Long Island killings of 19-year-old Vanessa Argueta and her 2-year-old son Diego Torres, said George Venizelos, the FBI assistant director of the New York field office. Garcia, who is 5 feet 4 inches tall, and weighs 125 pounds is a native of El Salvador and is the first MS-13 gang member to make the bureau's most wanted list. He allegedly brought Argueta to the woods of Central Islip, Long Island in February 2010 under the ruse of taking her to to dinner, Venizelos said. Scroll down for video . Most wanted: Juan Elias Garcia, an alleged member of the MS-13 gang, is seen in an undated picture released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on March 26, 2014.  Garcia, 21, has been added to the FBI's list of 'Ten Most Wanted Fugitives' for his role in the 2010 killing of his girlfriend Vanessa Argueta and little Diego Torres (right) Argueta was accompanied by two other reputed MS-13 members who had received permission from the gang's leader to carry out the killing, Venizelos said. One of them shot her in the chest and head because of alleged threats made toward Garcia by rival gang members to whom she had ties, according to Venizelos. Her son who witnessed his mother's death began crying the thugs shot him in the head — but the wound proved not fatal and the terrified boy grabbed Garcia’s leg. Then another gang member, Adalberto Ariel Guzman, shot him in the head a second time, killing the boy. 'Once on his feet, Diego saw Garcia, a familiar face in the crowd, and clutched onto his leg. However, the violence did not stop. Guzman fired the second shot that struck Diego in the head and killed him,' Venizelos said. 'Garcia decided that penalty for disrespecting the gang was death,' Venizelos said. 'While crime and gang-related activity often goes hand in hand, the execution-style murders of Vanessa and her 2-year-old son is a new low even for MS-13.' Announcement: US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Loretta Lynch (2nd L, at podium) and FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge George Venizelos (3rd L) announce that Juan Elias Garcia (R, in poster), also known as 'Cruzito', from El Salvador, has been added to FBIs Ten Most Wanted list . Heinous crime: US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Loretta Lynch (L) and FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge George Venizelos (R) announce that Juan Elias Garcia has been added to FBIs Most Wanted . Garcia, who was only 17 when the crime took place, is alleged to be a member of the violent Mara Salvatrucha gang, known as MS-13, and is believed to be hiding in El Salvador, authorities said Wednesday. 'MS-13 is the most violent gang here of any of the street gangs,' said Special Agent Reynaldo Tariche, who investigated the case with other members of the FBI's Long Island Gang Task Force. Authorities say Garcia had a romantic relationship with Argueta, but she had ties to rival gangs. Last October, the Treasury Department designated MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, as an international criminal organization. It has a strong presence throughout the country, particularly in areas with substantial Salvadoran populations such as Southern California, the District of Columbia and northern Virginia. The gang also is allied with several Mexican drug cartels. Recently added: Garcia, a native of El Salvador is the first MS-13 gang member to make the bureau's most wanted list . There is a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to Garcia's arrest, authorities said, cautioning the public not to take action themselves but instead to call the FBI or local law enforcement. Garcia also has ties to Nicaragua, Guatemala and Panama, they said. MS-13 is the largest and most violent street gang on Long Island, with more than a dozen chapters there, said Loretta Lynch, the U.S. Attorney for New York's Eastern District. Garcia was indicted on seven counts that included murder, murder conspiracy and firearms charges last month, shortly after he turned 21, and lost federal juvenile protection status that had prevented authorities from naming him publicly, Lynch said. Rene Mendez Mejia, who pleaded guilty to the murders, and Adalberto Ariel Guzman, who was found guilty at trial, are awaiting sentencing, Venizelos said. Gang leader Heriberto Martinez, who allegedly sanctioned the killings, was charged in connection with the murders and other crimes and has been sentenced to three life terms plus 60 years, he said.","A reputed member of the murderous international gang known as MS-13 was added to the FBI's list of 'Ten Most Wanted Fugitives'

"By . Anna Edwards . A brain-damaged father who was left to lay in urine-soaked sheets and covered in faeces in a NHS hospital in an 'appalling' case of neglect that was secretly filmed by his family. Grant Clarke's wife Binny used a camera hidden in an iPod connector to record what happened while she was not there after he said he was being mistreated by carers. The 43-year-old was left permanently paralysed down the left hand side of his body after suffering a massive brain haemorrhage. Scroll down for video . A nurse was filmed cleaning vulnerable Grant Clarke's feeding tube with a pen, while he helplessly watched her . Grant Clarke's call button was ripped from his hand by a nurse after he called for someone to help him and change his urine-soaked sheets . Binny was devastated to discover the 'appalling' treatment he was receiving when she played back the film. It showed him being left for hours lying in his own urine and his bell being ripped from his hand so he was left unable to call for help. It also revealed a nurse cleaning his feeding tube with a pen while he helplessly watched and staff giving him drinks - despite being strictly instructed to keep Grant on a nil by mouth diet. Mr Clarke, the director of an IT company, suffered a severe brain haemorrhage in May last year when he collapsed at work. He was treated at two major hospitals before being sent to West Kent Neuro-rehabilitation Unit at Sevenoaks Hospital in Kent. But it was there that he allegedly suffered the neglect, and his family became deeply worried about him. His partner Binny, 42, said: 'He became depressed and his mood got lower and lower. He became a completely different person and was in an absolute mess. 'We would visit him and he would smell mouldy and of urine because they were not cleaning him. 'He was left in his own urine and faeces, it was very distressing. She claimed staff failed several times to help him visit the toilet and eventually she decided to secretly film him after she discovered him sobbing about his alleged treatment. Mrs Clarke, a mother-of-three, installed a secret camera and filmed his treatment over ten days - and was appalled at the results.

'We subsequently created a robust action plan to address all concerns and the trust has met with the patient’s family on several occasions. 'Of the three members of staff suspended, one was subject to disciplinary action and has already left the trust.

"By . Martin Robinson . Row: Number 10 Downing Street and David Cameron were allegedly told in advance that David Miranda would be held at Heathrow . David Cameron was today pulled into the row over the detention of the partner of a Guardian journalist after it emerged Downing Street had advance warning of the operation. The Prime Minister was reportedly told David Miranda would be stopped at Heathrow Airport on Sunday because he was allegedly carrying 'highly sensitive stolen information that would help terrorism'. Mr Miranda's partner Glenn . Greenwald is the Guardian journalist who reported on America's internet . spying programmes which were exposed by the fugitive whistleblower . Edward Snowden. He was stopped under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 as he changed planes . on a journey from Berlin to his home in Brazil. A Downing Street source said Number 10 . was 'kept abreast of the operation ' to detain David Miranda, but denied . any political involvement in the decision, adding: 'The Government does . not direct police investigations.' The Home Secretary was also . briefed prior to the nine-hour detention, while the White House has also . admitted that President Barrack Obama was also given a 'heads up', it . was revealed. But Theresa May said that it was not for her to tell the police who they should or should not stop at ports, or who they should arrest. She said:'I was briefed in advance that there was a possibility of a port stop of the sort that took place. 'If it is believed that somebody has in their possession highly sensitive stolen information which could help terrorists, which could lead to a loss of lives, then it is right that the police act and that is what the law enables them to do. 'But we live in a country where those decisions as to whether to stop somebody or arrest somebody are not for me as Home Secretary, they are for the police to take, that's absolutely right that they have their operational independence and long may that continue.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ordeal: Glenn Greenwald (left) walks with his partner David Miranda (right) through Rio de Janeiro Airport on Monday . The 28-year-old Brazilian has now launched a challenge over the police's legal basis for holding him and taking his property. Schedule 7 applies only at airports, ports and border areas, allowing officers to stop, search, question and detain individuals. Mr Miranda claimed he was held for nine hours by agents who questioned him about his 'entire life' and took his 'computer, video game, mobile phone, my memory card - everything'. The Guardian has admitted he had been carrying 'journalistic materials' and they paid for his flights, but said he was not employed by them. While in Berlin Mr Miranda stayed . withe American film-maker Laura Poitras, who has apparently been helping . the Guardian get through the Snowden documents. The . use of this terror law has been criticised by Mr Greenwald - the . reporter who interviewed American whistleblower Edward Snowden - as a . 'profound attack on press freedoms and the news-gathering process', and . has sparked widespread debate on the use of terror laws. A Guardian News & Media spokesman today said the Guardian is 'supportive' of Mr Miranda's claim. The . newspaper's editor Alan Rusbridger told the BBC: 'We will have to work . out if that is legal or not, and that will be subject to legal . challenge, I believe, by Glenn Greenwald and David Miranda because it's . not clear that he was actually committing any offence in carrying . material through Heathrow. 'I'm not aware of what that offence is.' Together again: Glenn Greenwald stands with David Miranda as they wait for the lift at Rio de Janeiro Airport . Back: David Miranda (second left), partner of Glenn Greenwald (left), speaks to the media in Rio de Janeiro . Revelations: Edward Snowden roiled American intelligence agencies and upended US relations abroad with his disclosures of highly classified programmes that allow the US to collect millions of pieces of data . He . went on: 'I think there will be a legal challenge to the use of this . very controversial bit, this Schedule 7, of the Terrorism Act and its . use to obtain journalistic material. 'A . lot of journalists the world over fly through Heathrow and I think some . of them now are going to be quite anxious about how the British . authorities regard this bit of Britain that is not quite Britain but is . Britain.' Schedule . 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 allows police officers to stop, search, . question and detain individuals travelling through a port, airport or . border area. It is to . determine whether that person is or has been involved in the commission, . preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Stopping . an individual does not necessarily mean that the officer believes the . person is a terrorist - in fact, it does not require any reasonable . suspicion that they might be one. Detention . is permitted for up to nine hours before an arrest or release must be . made. But last month the Government said the maximum detention period . would be lowered to six hours. An . examining officer may require a person to answer questions or provide . certain documents - and failure to do so may be considered an offence . under the Act. The Home Office . has defended the decision to detain David Miranda under terrorism laws, . saying the Government and police 'have a duty to protect the public and . our national security'. Scotland . Yard has defended the use of the Terrorism Act to detain Mr Miranda as . he changed planes on a journey from Berlin to his home in Brazil as . 'legally and procedurally sound'. And . the Home Office appeared to back the decision as a spokesman said: 'The . Government and the police have a duty to protect the public and our . national security. 'If . the police believe that an individual is in possession of highly . sensitive stolen information that would help terrorism, then they should . act and the law provides them with a framework to do that. 'Those who oppose this sort of action need to think about what they are condoning. 'This is an ongoing police inquiry so we will not comment on the specifics.' Mr Rusbridger has also revealed that 'shadowy' Government figures were sent in to destroy hard drives owned by the newspaper. In . a comment piece in the paper, he said he held a series of meetings in . which he was asked to destroy all Edward Snowden-related material. According . to the Guardian Downing Street sources allege that David Cameron had . approved to attempt to get the data because he feared that the . newspaper's computers could be hacked and the information used by . terrorists or other enemies of the state.","David Cameron 'kept abreast' of detention of David Miranda, sources say .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . These extraordinary documents show how a real-life Dad’s Army hoped to defend their small village from any invading troops during the Second World War. In September 1943, Lt Col Sir Morgan Crofton compiled the scrapbook of hand-drawn maps and orders to defend the picturesque village of Beaulieu, New Forest, Hampshire. He was leading an unlikely army of farmers, doctors and drivers who clearly took their role in protecting the village, with a population of around 500, very seriously. One map created by Lt Col Sir Morgan Crofton which details how Beaulieu, New Forest, would have been defended by the Home Guard during the war. Marked on the maps are dots where men would be stationed . Another map shows how the Dad's Army would be stationed throughout the village and where they would be able to fire snipers or machine guns in event of attack. It also shows road blocks - marked with dotted lines . The Home Guard were also responsible for defending Fawley oil . refinery, road and rail links, and fuel supply lines through the New . Forest National Park. The detailed plans show how the men planned to 'harass' and . 'hinder' the approaching enemy while obeying their orders to 'hold their position to . the last man and last round.' Their . sacrificial efforts were meant to give the regular British forces time . to manouevre into a position- where they were better placed to thwart the . attack. However, much like the characters from the hit BBC comedy, the group would have been rather ill-equipped to cope with a potential Nazi invasion. Historians today said the Home Guard would have had a 'cat in hells chance' of repelling an invading force. Lt . Col Crofton, who died in the 1950s, was originally second in command of the 9th . (Forest) Battalion. A typed document - with 'secret' stamped on the top - details the troops' responsibilities. It says they are to prevent airborne or seaborne raiders from damaging installations . The maps and other documents were part of a scrapbook made by Lt Col Crofton, pictured. Despite all his efforts, however, historians say the group would have had a 'cat's chance in hell' of defending the village . In perhaps a comparable role to Home . Guard company commander Captain George Mainwaring in television show Dad's Army, he later became the . commander of the nearby 28th . (Bay) Battalion. His . scrapbook contains dozens of previously unseen official documents - many . stamped 'secret' - that he produced for his troops. It . contains defence plans, letters, and orders showing a series of machine . gun posts, tank traps, road blocks, snipers and a mine field. One of the book’s most detailed plans is a hand-drawn map showing how the pretty village of Beaulieu was turned into a defensive garrison. In the event of an invasion, a group of 44 men were to be stationed at five pillboxes, roadblocks and numerous firing positions from local buildings. The firing positions included the Montagu Arms - now a Michelin Star restaurant and hotel - and a wall with firing holes at Beaulieu Abbey. Some remains can still be seen today, including four of five bunkers which can be seen in the village’s former dairy, mill, and garage. The members of the 28th (Bay) Battalion - which was led by the Lt Col Crofton, pictured in centre front. One of the men's designated firing positions was the Montagu Arms - now a Michelin Star restaurant and hotel . The members of the beloved fictional television series Dad's Army, including Clive Dunn and James Beck . One typed document - headed New Forest District Defence Scheme and with a red 'secret' stamp - outlines the troops’ responsibilities. It says: 'The task of all tps (troops) under Comd (command) is to prevent enemy seaborne and or airborne raiders damaging vital Installns (installations) or equipment, and to destroy, harass, and delay any enemy who set foot in HAMPSHIRE. 'All tps will be allotted a definite role and will hold their positions to the last man and last round. 'THERE WILL BE NO WITHDRAWAL.' Lt Col Crofton, right, would have perhaps played a similar role to Home Guard company commander Captain George Mainwaring, left, in BBC television series Dad's Army . Lt Col Crofton’s son, Major Edward Crofton, has now loaned the scrapbook to the New Forest Remembers World War II Project run by the New Forest National Park Authority. Gareth Owen, from the project, said: 'We’re very grateful to the Crofton family for this unique collection full of top secret orders and maps that probably should have been destroyed once it was read. 'Yet they were kept and they offer a real insight into how the Home Guard operated in the New Forest. 'The image we have of the Home Guard, due largely to Dad’s Army, is of a shambolic if well-intentioned group playing at being soldiers. According to the maps, men would be stationed at these gun holes in a stone wall in the village of 500 . A pill box from World War II in Beaulieu where more men would have been stationed according to the plans . 'However the documents in the Crofton book show how well-organised and dedicated the Home Guard were and how they were willing to give their lives to delay the advance of any invading German force.' 'They were of a mature age and not suited to jumping in an out of trenches but they were highly skilled individuals. 'It is unlikely they would have been much resistance to an invading force, but they would have harassed them enough to have delayed their progress, and could have given them a black eye. 'That would have been crucial in giving the full time British forces enough time to get into position further back. 'Some of the Home Guard would have known they did not have a cat in hell’s chance of beating the Germans, while others believed they could have sent them packing. 'To say they were like lambs to the slaughter is unfair, but it is likely they would have suffered casualties and were clearly prepared to sacrifice their lives if needed.' Major Crofton, from Petersfield, Hampshire, said: 'A lot of the documents in the book were marked top secret so they probably shouldn’t have been kept. Home Guard re-enactor Dale Johnson, Hugh Crofton, and Gareth Owen from the New Forest Remembers World War II Project, which is now looking after the collection, look at the scrapbook . 'But knowing my father I don’t think many would have questioned him hoarding them. 'I’m very glad they were not binned. We’re very lucky.' In the past two years, the New Forest Remembers World War II Project has unearthed more than 1,300 previously-unseen documents, maps and photos as well as record more than 72 hours of oral histories. The entire project, including the contents of the Crofton book, has now been digitised into an online archive. Julian Johnson, Chairman of the New Forest National Park Authority, said: 'The project has been a great success. Fascinating tales of royal visits, prisoners of war and secret bombing tests have come to light to give us a fuller picture of that time. 'The digital portal will provide a lasting legacy for future generations to discover more about this fascinating period.'","Collection of plans made by resident Lt Col Crofton in case of Nazi attack .

"By . Martin Robinson . A ban on books being sent to prisoners designed to stop smuggling of drugs and other contraband has today been criticised by the Chief Inspector of Prisons. Nick Hardwick says the Government is trying to 'micromanage' Britain's jails and the restriction on reading materials should be 'considered a mistake'. Pressure on Justice Secretary Chris Grayling to perform a U-turn is increasing daily, with even senior Tory colleagues calling the ban 'unenlightened'. Disapproval: Chief Inspector of Prisons, Nick Hardwick, left, says banning sending of books to jails is a mistake, ramping up further pressure on Chris Grayling, right, to perform a U-turn . It was brought in as part of a new . ‘incentives and earned privileges’ regime introduced by the Ministry of . Justice. But it has led to a chorus of criticism, including from some of Britain’s best known authors. An extraordinary letter damning the ban was signed by Jeffrey Archer, Salman Rushdie, Britain’s poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy, Alan Bennett, Julian Barnes, Ian McEwan, David Hare, Irvine Welsh, Joanne Harris, Sarah Waters, Ian Rankin, Nick Hornby and Deborah Moggach. Now the prisons boss Nick Hardwick has added his voice to the campaign. 'The problem in this case is trying to micromanage this, with the centre describing very detailed lists of what prisoners can and can't have,' he told the Independent. 'I think that's a mistake. 'I think that once the policy intention is clear, how that's implemented should be left much more to the discretion and the common sense of governors, so that they can reflect the needs of their particular prison population'. Critics: Ian Rankin, left, and Mary Beard, right, are two big names who have come out against the new prison scheme . Backing: Other signatories include Salman Rushdie (left) and Britain's poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy (right) The . scheme has caused uproar among writers and civil liberties groups - one . of which likened it to measures seen at the Guantanamo Bay detention . camp. They argue there should be no restrictions on access to books in . prisons, supposed to be places of rehabilitation and education. The new regime prevents prisoners . being sent parcels, previously allowed at the discretion of jail . governors, except in exceptional circumstances such as for provision of . medical supplies. Reform campaigners say that as well as books, other . items, such as underwear and stationery, are being restricted. Inmates . have to buy items from prison shops instead. Attack: Civil liberties groups say that the Ministry of Justice is trying to impose a policy used at Guantanamo Bay, but the Government says it will stop the flow of drugs . The . Justice Secretary has insisted that parcels being sent into . prisons had been a vehicle for ‘contraband’ and there were not enough . staff to check them all properly. He insisted prisoners could access . books from jail libraries and could purchase more using money earned by . working inside. ‘Parcels . are an obvious conduit for getting drugs into prisons. If we allowed . all prisoners to have access to parcels from home, it would be an . impossible volume of post to go through systematically,’ Mr Grayling . said. ‘What we have done is set out rules . that say when people can have parcels from home.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A splash of colour in an otherwise dreary hospital ward can brighten up even the most difficult of days. But according to a survey, nine out of ten NHS hospitals do not allow patients to have fresh flowers by their bed – despite three out of four people opposing a ban. Increasing numbers of hospitals have introduced the rules to address concerns about spreading germs, aggravating allergies and creating extra work for nurses. NHS bosses say flowers can aggravate patients' allergies and spread germs between the sick . However the poll of 3,700 Britons discovered that around 90 per cent said flowers can dramatically improve someone’s mood when they are unwell, and almost half thought they would speed up recovery. Just over three-quarters of people surveyed disagreed with banning the gifts. There is no official ruling from the Department of Health on whether flowers should be allowed in wards. However the poll, carried out by craft supplier Country Baskets, contacted 105 hospitals – and found there was a fresh flower ban in 97 of them, with others discouraging visitors from bringing bouquets. Country Baskets spokesman Venessa Hodgson said: ‘We appreciate the concerns around taking flowers on to wards. But there are real, proven benefits to giving flowers to people who are unwell.’ Psychologist Emma Kenny added: 'There are many studies that show the psychological impact that flowers can have on a person's recovery or general well-being. 'In a hospital environment it is vital that patients are kept feeling as upbeat and positive as possible.' Country Baskets has now launched the 'Power of the Flower' campaign with Britain's first artificial flower vending machine in St James's Hospital in Leeds. Despite the ban, the vast majority of patients think blooms should be allowed on wards .","NHS bosses say bringing flowers into hospitals can spread germs .

"By . Daniel Martin . Ed Miliband likes to portray himself as a man of the people, emphasising his humble origins as the comprehensive-school educated son of immigrants. But only days after dodging questions about his personal wealth and sneering at David Cameron’s fortune, it has emerged that the Labour Party leader is so rich he can afford to live in a £2.3million house – with a £400,000 mortgage. Land Registry documents also show the Milibands have remortgaged their house in north London with Barclays, the bank he savaged for its role in the interest-rate rigging scandal. Man of the people? Ed Miliband with actresses Catherine Tyldesley, Michelle Collins and Michelle Keegan on the set of Coronation Street after his party conference . In his leader’s speech at his party conference on Tuesday, Mr Miliband attacked the Prime Minister for his personal wealth while lambasting him for reducing the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p. He said: ‘Next April, David Cameron will be writing a cheque for £40,000 to each and every millionaire in Britain . And here’s the worst part. David Cameron isn’t just writing the cheques. He is receiving one. He’s going to be getting the millionaires’ tax cut.’ The Labour leader underlined his class-war tactics in a party political broadcast contrasting his comprehensive school education with that of Eton-educated Mr Cameron. But Mr Miliband is far from poor. He lives in a house, in the name of his wife Justine Thornton, which is worth up to £2.3million – a rise of £700,000 in the three years since it was purchased. Ed Miliband lives in a house, in the name of his wife Justine Thornton (pictured left), worth up to £2.3million. She earns around £200,000 a year . Miss Thornton is an environmental law expert on around £200,000 a year, while Mr Miliband earns more than £130,000. He is also wealthy because of an inheritance from his Marxist father Ralph and his share of the value of the former family home. He used this money and the proceeds of a flat he bought in the 1980s for £100,000 to purchase a house in Hampstead for £650,000. In 2009 he sold this for £740,000. At the same time, Miss Thornton sold her home for £630,000, and the pair combined their resources to buy their townhouse for £1.6million. Mr Miliband contributes to the loan repayments, but his name is not on the deeds. Documents show Miss Thornton switched the mortgage from Clydesdale Bank to Barclays in September. It is likely the couple will have negotiated reduced monthly repayments in a new deal, concluded just last week as Mr Miliband prepared for the Labour Party conference in Manchester. In the summer, Mr Miliband repeatedly called for the resignation of former Barclays boss Bob Diamond after revelations about the extent of the Libor-rigging scandal at the bank. He went further than any other politician, calling for a criminal investigation and a judge-led inquiry into the banking industry, saying: ‘We need the strongest punishment.’  The day after his conference speech, Mr Miliband faltered on TV when he was asked about his own wealth. He insisted: ‘I am not going to be getting the top-rate tax cut.’ It came as Conservative MP Rob Wilson dubbed him ‘Millionaire Miliband’ after claiming his home was worth £2million. Ed Miliband has re-mortaged his home with Barclays who he criticised heavily for its role in the interest-rate rigging scandal . Property experts estimate the four-bedroom semi-detached family home is worth more than that. A similar house in the same road is on the market for £2.3million. A Labour source said: ‘The point Ed Miliband is making is not that it is wrong to be wealthy. The point he is making is: if the Prime Minister is bringing in a millionaires’ tax cut, he should say whether he stands to benefit from it.’","He attacked the Prime Minister for his personal wealth but the Labour leader is far from poor .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A New York man allegedly found sitting in a car with a loaded rifle, machete and a container of gasoline was charged on Friday with threatening to kill George W. Bush after professing a romantic interest in the former president's oldest daughter, prosecutors said. Benjamin Smith, 44, of upstate New York was arrested in Manhattan by the U.S. Secret Service, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. 'Bush will get his,' Smith screamed as he was taken into custody, according to the complaint. Deranged: Barbara Pierce Bush, 32, appears to be the object of Benjamin Smith's affections . Later, when asked about his marital status, he told agents he was divorced and 'working on a relationship with Barbara Bush.' At a preliminary hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrea Griswold told U.S. Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman the government believes Smith was referring to the former president's daughter and not Bush's mother, who shares the same name . It is a crime under federal law to threaten a current or former president. On Thursday, the man's mother called police to report she had found a threatening note in the home she shares with her son and that a rifle was also missing, the complaint said. In the clear: Smith's defense attorney argues that former President George W. Bush (center, First Lady Laura Bush on left and daughter Barbara on the far left) was not in any real danger because he was not actually in New York City when Smith was caught . 'I'm going to work for George W. Bush and the Pentagon,' the note said, according to the government. 'I have to slay a dragon and then Barbara Bush is mine.' The Secret Service tracked him using his cell phone to Manhattan, where they arrested him early Friday morning. It was not clear why Smith went to New York City or where the former president and his family were at the time. Smith's defense lawyer, Peggy Cross-Goldenberg, said the note and Smith's outbursts did not constitute a 'true threat.' The judge also conceded it was 'unclear' a jury would find Smith guilty. 'Admittedly, there is some inconsistency in the notion that the way to win Barbara Bush's affections is to kill her father,' Pitman said.","Benjamin Smith, 44, allegedly sought to kill the 43rd president to get close to his daughter Barbara Pierce Bush .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Prime Minister David Cameron said he did not want to see 'people's love divided by the law' Legalising gay marriage says ‘something deeper about the sort of country we are’, David Cameron said ahead of the first weddings this weekend. The Prime Minister said he backed the change because he ‘didn't want to see people's love divided by law’. Hundreds of gay and lesbian couples are expected to tie the knot in the coming weeks, with the first ceremonies held this Saturday. The law was changed last year, when more than 130 Conservatives MPs voted against the bill but it was passed with the support of the Lib Dems and Labour. Mr Cameron said: ‘Making marriage available to everyone goes beyond individual relationships, proposals and weddings– it says something deeper too about the sort of country we are. ‘This is a country with proud traditions of tolerance, respect and equal worth. With this reform we are being true to those values. ‘In turn we are sending a powerful message to young people growing up who are uncertain about their sexuality: we are telling them that they are equal.’ Mr Cameron has previously admitted gay marriage has been deeply unpopular within Tory ranks. But in an article ahead of the first ceremonies taking place on Saturday, Mr Cameron said he was ‘pleased’ that the commitment people make to each other will now be recognised as equal. The Prime Minister said: ‘I backed this change because I didn't want to see people's love divided by law. There is something special about marriage. ‘It is a declaration of commitment, responsibility and stability that helps to bind families. The values of marriage are give and take, support and sacrifice – and it is right that same sex couples will now be able to be a part of it.’ First: Same-sex weddings will be able to take place in England and Wales from Saturday March 29 . In the article with Attitude . Magazine’s commemorative edition to mark the legialstion, Mr Cameron . said he had been touched by the personal stories of those affected. ‘I . am pleased that the love people have for each other – and the . commitment they want to make – will now be recognised as equal,’ he . said. David Cameron gave his interview to Attitude magazine's commemorative edition . ‘This is an important . change brought home to me by a mum in my constituency recently who said: . “I've got a straight son and a gay daughter and I now know I'm going to . be able to go to both of their weddings”.’ The . first gay weddings were not expected to take place until later this . year or early 2015, but changes were rushed through for the first . ceremonies to be held on March 29. Same-sex . weddings in some British embassies and armed forces bases overseas and . military chapels are expected to be allowed from June. By . the end of the year couples who entered civil partnerships will be able . to convert them into a legal marriage by the end of the year. But Mr Cameron warned: ‘We of course would be foolish to think that all problems with equality have been solved. ‘The UK may be rated as the best place in Europe for LGBT equality – but there still remains much more to be done. We press ahead– for example- with our work on homophobic bullying in schools and we continue to challenge governments where outright persecution of gay people is commonplace. ‘All that is left is to send my warmest congratulations to all the couples who will shortly be getting married – and to wish you every possible happiness in the future ahead.’","Ceremonies expected across the country on Saturday March 29 .

"By . Richard Spillett . Two months ago, more than 25 square miles of Somerset was under water in some of the worst flooding the area has ever seen. Around 7,000 homes were inundated with dirty water around the UK as transport networks were crippled and villages were cut off by the relentless, rising waters. The army was called in to the deal with the disaster as authorities struggled to get a grip on the unfolding crisis in January and February this year. At one point, rescue services were pumping out more than 7.3million tonnes of water a day, with insurers later estimating the disaster caused more than Â£1billion worth of damage. The Environment Agency is set to begin a Â£5.8million plan to clear an eight-kilometre stretch of the rivers Tone and Parrett next week, as locals in Somerset try to put their lives back together.

"By . Leon Watson . A care assistant who drunkenly drove the wrong way along a motorway for four miles has been spared jail. Katy Homer, 27, admitted drink driving and dangerous driving and was told she had committed a 'very serious driving offence' which passed the custody threshold. But when sentencing her judge Michael Dudley handed her a four-month jail term, . suspended for 12 months. Scroll down for video . Katy Homer, 27, leaves Wolverhampton Crown Court after receiving a four-month jail term, suspended for 12 months and a driving ban of three years . A lorry driver is forced to swerve out of her way after drunk Katy Homer joined the southbound carriageway and started heading north . Footage of the incident shows oncoming drivers flashing their headlights and moving out of the way. She was given 180 hours of unpaid work and a year’s . supervision by probation services for the dangerous driving offence. For driving with excess alcohol she was . given a month in prison, also suspended for 12 months, to run . concurrently, banned from driving for three years, and ordered to pay . £200 costs. Footage of the . incident played in Wolverhampton Crown Court showed oncoming lorry . drivers flashing their headlights as Homer drove her Vauxhall Astra . north on a southbound section of the M5 in the West Midlands. Alka . Brigue, prosecuting, said one lorry driver later told police of the . moment he saw the headlights of Homer’s car approaching him at speed and . head-on along the slip road. She said: 'It left him feeling scared. 'It . was his daughter’s birthday - he envisaged that somebody would be . killed, and that he might never see his wife and daughter again.' Ms Brigue said that, at the last moment, Homer 'swerved' across to the hard shoulder, avoiding a collision. Homer (pictured) admitted driving with excess alcohol and dangerous driving at Wolverhampton Crown Court . Traffic . police stopped Homer after she eventually exited the M5 in West . Bromwich in the early hours of December 4 last year, having joined the . motorway at the previous junction in nearby Oldbury. Officers . were dealing with a crash when they spotted Homer, of Halesowen, West . Midlands, leaving the motorway, busy with HGV traffic, using an entry . slip road. Ms . Brigue said the police first tried to wave her down as she twice went . the wrong way around the roundabout junction, and eventually halted her . by stepping out into the road and flashing their torches. CCTV footage released by West Midlands Police shows Homer careering the wrong way down the carriageway . Homer was given 180 hours of unpaid work and a year’s . supervision by probation services for the dangerous driving offence . Ms Homer was sentenced after she pleaded guilty to charges of drink driving and dangerous driving . Homer, . her eyes red, was breathalysed and later blew a reading of 79 . micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, which is more than . twice the legal limit of 35mcg. Malcolm Fowler, in mitigation, said his client was of previous good character and was 'deeply, bitterly ashamed' of her actions. He said friends, family and her GP all attested to the behaviour being 'wholly out-of-character' for the single mother-of-three. However, . he added Homer had been dealing with a depressive illness which may . have been affected by a 'disastrous relationship' with a former partner. He . said: 'Everything indicates that against very considerable personal . adversity the defendant has kept in very reasonable work and been an . extraordinarily good mother to her three children.' Mr . Fowler said it was 'these pressures, with the under-tow of depression' that went some way towards explaining why she got in her car drunk and . drove the wrong way along the motorway. He . added the impact on Homer, whose driving licence was previously clean, . had hit 'very hard' and he claimed had led to one of her children being . bullied at school. Homer’s . father, who was in court supporting his daughter, was 'a professional . driver', Mr Fowler added, and the crimes had no doubt therefore brought . particular 'dishonour and shame'. Speaking after sentence outside court, a remorseful Homer said she was 'sorry' for her actions. Her . father, who gave his name as Robert, added: 'She’s sorry for what she . has done and she just wants to put this behind her now and focus on the . children'. Commenting on the . case, Inspector Dave Southam, of West Midlands Police, said: 'There is . no doubt how serious this incident could have been. 'CCTV footage from the time shows other vehicles having to move out of the way. 'Thankfully, . due to the time of day, the motorway was not as busy as it otherwise . might have been and so no significant harm was caused to others. 'Ultimately . driving whilst under the influence poses a risk to both the driver and . others on the road - regardless of whether it is on a motorway or a . quiet side street, and this case will hopefully serve as a warning to . others who make the dangerous mistake of getting behind the wheel after . they’ve had a drink.'","Katy Homer, 26, drove her Vauxhall Astra north on the southbound M5 .

"By . James Chapman . A nurse who blew the whistle on one of the worst NHS scandals is to draw up compulsory training for all staff on how to raise the alarm on neglect, patient safety and high death rates. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will today announce that Helene Donnelly, who worked in A&E at the notorious Stafford Hospital, is to be brought in as a senior adviser to ensure NHS staff can bring any concerns to light. Mr Hunt will say that raising the alarm about poor care will be part of mandatory training. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) will today announce that Helene Donnelly (right), who worked in A&E at Stafford Hospital, is to be brought in as a senior adviser to ensure NHS staff can bring any concerns to light . He argues that creating a culture of ‘compassion, openness and transparency’ across the National Health Service is vital to prevent a repeat of the scandal at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, in which as many as 1,200 patients died from neglect. Between 2004 and 2008, Mrs Donnelly raised nearly 100 formal complaints about treatment of patients at Stafford Hospital until, in frustration at being ignored by managers, she turned whistleblower. She became a key witness at the subsequent public inquiry which was damning of the neglect, indignity and shoddy care that was endured by patients. Mrs Donnelly said: ‘There has been much talk, but now is the time for action. ‘We must truly empower and support all NHS staff to raise concerns, and part of this is about ensuring they know how to do so and what to do if their concerns are ignored. ‘That’s why I’m delighted to be working on new mandatory training about whistleblowing, so that all staff will know what to do if they see care slip below the high standards we would all expect.’ The Health Secretary will also announce a plan to reduce ‘avoidable harm’ in the NHS by half over the next three years. As many as one in five patients in some hospitals suffer from problems such as bed sores, falls, blood clots or the wrong medicines being administered. Mr Hunt says that halving the incidence of avoidable harm could save up to 6,000 lives over the next three years. He will confirm the introduction of a new ‘duty of candour’ – meaning that NHS organisations must notify the patient about incidents where ‘significant harm’ has occurred and provide an apology. ‘Speaking out should never be confused with a lack of commitment to NHS values or “running down the NHS”,’ he will say. ‘The highest form of commitment to our NHS is surely the courage to speak out against the system when the system gets it wrong. ‘We need to equip staff with the skills and confidence to speak up. ‘It is my ambition that the NHS should become the safest healthcare system anywhere in the world. ‘I want the tragic events of Mid Staffs to become a turning point in the creation of a more open, compassionate and transparent culture within the NHS.’ Mrs Donnelly became a key witness at the subsequent public inquiry which was damning of the neglect, indignity and shoddy care that was endured by patients and led to the shut down of the trust . Despite Government attempts to encourage more staff to raise concerns, MPs heard this week that just over half of NHS employees would feel confident to speak out regarding abuse. Margaret Hodge MP, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said there was still a ‘culture of fear’ across the public sector against raising the alarm. She added that it was only thanks to a whistleblower that it emerged that private firm Serco was fiddling figures for its out-of-hours GP service in Cornwall, and yet the firm had ‘rifled’ through staff lockers to try to find the person who had leaked the information. Charlie Massey, a senior Department of Health official, said: ‘We have a huge amount to do in getting into a position where staff feel confident that actions will be taken as a result of speaking up.’ Mr Hunt, who is in America, will announce the new measures to empower NHS staff in a speech at the Virginia Mason Hospital in Seattle, which has adopted strict measures to improve the quality of care that have seen it become one of the safest for patients in the world.","Raising the alarm about poor care will become part of mandatory training .

"By . Laura Clark . Nick Clegg’s free school meals plan was in disarray last night after it was savaged by headteachers. They blasted ‘ludicrous’ official advice that infants could be asked to choose their meals two hours ahead, eat at 11am and have cold lunches. The guidance from the Department for Education even says parents might be brought in to chop vegetables. Nick Clegg' free school meals plan was in disarray after it was  savaged by headteachers . From September, all children between four and seven will qualify for free lunches under the £1billion scheme announced by the Deputy Prime Minister at the Lib Dem autumn conference. Heads have already warned they do not have the facilities to cope. The guidance responds with positive case studies and the suggestion that schools make ‘lunchtime part of the curriculum’ and lengthen or stagger lunch breaks. But Gail Larkin, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘This policy was a nice soundbite and took us all by surprise – it just wasn’t thought through properly. 'One school that has been trialling this has had to start lunches at 11am and finish at 2pm – it’s ridiculous.’ Jim Holditch, head of Godinton Primary in Ashford, Kent, insisted the tips were worthless. ‘They are not addressing the problem that we have, which is lack of capacity,’ he said. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg eating lunch with children from  the Walnut Tree Walk Primary School in London. But heads have blasted 'ludicrous' official advice that infants could be asked to choose their meals two hours ahead, eat at 11am and have cold lunches . ‘It’s being done so badly the Government could end up with a monumental own goal. The motivation is less about children’s welfare and more about election promises. ‘How much of break time would be taken up getting children to pick what they want for lunch? That frankly is a ludicrous solution. ‘Has anyone from the DfE ever tried to get 60 four-year-olds to choose at break time what they want for lunch and to remember by the time they get up to the serving hatch – or not to change their mind when they see the food laid out in front of them?’ He also questioned advice suggesting that menus be simplified: ‘The recipes aren’t complicated. We’re not having chateaubriand. It’s spaghetti bolognaise etc etc. I’m not sure there’s much mileage in that.’ Mr Holditch has asked his local authority for a share of £150million made available by the Coalition to help schools improve kitchens and dining halls. But his likely allocation will be nowhere near enough to cover the renovations to kitchen and dining facilities he needs. He said the guidance showed the initiative could not be delivered without detrimental effects on other aspects of school life, such as PE. The guidance ‘toolkit’ suggests that schools ‘set aside extra time to help children learn how to use cutlery as part of their curriculum’. From September, all children between four and seven will qualify for free lunches under the £1billion scheme announced by the Deputy Prime Minister at the Lib Dem autumn conference . It highlights a school where pupils are taught about the food they are eating, encouraged to eat more fruit and vegetables and shown how to use knives and forks. Further case studies include a primary that relies on parent volunteers to ‘prepare vegetables and bake cakes for its in-house lunch service’. The toolkit notes that putting up ‘brightly coloured posters’ will improve the dining hall environment. It also tells heads to control noise levels by playing music, rewarding quiet pupils or supervising children more closely. Mr Clegg’s initial hope that all 1.5million meals would be hot has been abandoned, with the DfE confirming schools will able to provide cold lunches as long as they meet nutritional standards. For schools with too many children to feed in an hour, the advice is to ‘lengthen or stagger lunch breaks’. The toolkit, written with an introduction by Lib Dem schools minister David Laws, notes that schools which took part in a free meals trial scheme found they ‘could get it right after a few weeks’ by being flexible about how they organised their lunch hours. At St Lawrence Primary in Hurstpierpoint, West Sussex, there is no kitchen and all pupils eat packed lunches in their classrooms. Head Paul Dyer said: ‘The status quo here works extremely well. I can see a situation where millions of pounds will have gone into this but that money will be squandered.’ Graham Stuart, Tory chairman of the Commons education select committee, said the free meals policy should have been thought through more carefully. ‘It does show the dangers of Nick Clegg pitching into education policy without being aware of the realities in schools,’ he added. He urged the Government to step back from the September deadline. But a spokesman for Mr Clegg said: ‘Pilots of universal free school meals run by the Department for Education and Department of Health started in 2009 and ran for two years. ‘Evaluation showed clear benefits for all in terms of educational attainment and healthy eating, but in particular for the poorest children. The plans are fully tested, well designed and properly funded. ‘Every child deserves the best possible start in life, and at the same time we are doing all we can to help ease the pressure on household budgets.’ A spokesman for the DfE said: ‘We are providing more than £1billion to ensure children get a healthy meal in the middle of the day. 'We’re also making sure that schools are not left out of pocket by putting £150million on the table.’","From September children aged four to seven will qualify for free lunches .

"By . Katy Winter . They are one of the most formidable pairings in the fashion industry: the hottest model of the moment and one of most iconic designers of all time. But it seems that while they have undertaken numerous successful projects together, and she fronts his campaigns and closes his catwalk shows, Karl Lagerfeld does not consider model Cara Delevingne to be ‘beautiful’, at least not in the classical sense. The 80-year-old powerhouse, who has sat at the head of Chanel since 1983, said that Cara is ‘not a standout beauty’. Scroll down for video . Karl Lagerfeld appears on the catwalk with Cara Delevingne after his SS 2014 Haute Couture collection for Chanel during Paris Fashion Week. The model is one of the 80 year old designer's favorites . Cara also helped closed Chanel's AW14 show in Paris at the beginning of the month, walking hand-in- hand with Karl down the 'runway' which was set up as a supermarket aisle . Speaking to the Guardian, Karl said that Cara’s looks are based on her ‘strange’ proportions. ‘Was it Bacon who said, 'There is not beauty without some strangeness in the proportions'?’ he said. And it seems that he also is not a fan of two of Cara’s favourite pastimes; tattoos and selfies. Karl said that while Cara is not a 'standout beauty', her 'strange proportions' give her charm . He says: ‘They are this horrible thing where you are distorted. The chin is too big, the head is too small. No, this is electronic masturbation.’ And while it seems barely a week goes by without either Cara herself, or another young star, getting a new inking (and of course sharing it on social media), Karl disapproves. ‘Tattoos are like sleeping in a printed T-shirt, you will never get clean again,’ he says. However, the pairing of Cara and Chanel is unlikely to end soon, despite the 21-year-old admitting she has no plans to stop adding to her collection of body art. The French fashion house’s favourite model closed Chanel’s AW14 show in Paris at the beginning of the month, walking down the runway with Karl on a huge set designed to look like a very stylish supermarket. Karl, well known for his theatrical shows - which have previously featured giant icebergs and even an underwater kingdom - transformed the French capital's Grand Palais into the world's chicest and most luxurious grocery store.","Karl said he doesn't think Cara is a 'standout beauty'

"By . Suzannah Hills . Emotional: Oscar Pistorius sheds a tear during the cross examination of witnesses in his murder trial . Oscar Pistorius today broke down into tears as a ballistics experts described how bullets fired by the athlete killed his girlfriend. Captain Chris Mangena told Pretoria High Court how Pistorius was standing at least seven feet from . the closed toilet door when he shot through it at a 'slightly downwards angle', killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Captain Mangena said the bullets entered . the toilet door below the shoulder level of Pistorius, if he were . standing without prosthetic limbs. Pistorius has always maintained he was on his stumps when he fired. Prosecutors do not dispute the . assertion, after initially alleging he was on his prosthetic limbs when . he fired a total of four shots, three of which hit 29-year-old Ms Steenkamp. Captain Mangena said that only one of the four shots ricocheted inside the lavatory, hitting the wall twice and breaking the tiles. But he said the other three bullets 'disappeared somewhere between the door and the wall,' adding that he believed that had hit the 'target' straight away. It is believed Ms Steenkamp was by the toilet in the bathroom when she was killed, but it has not yet been established during the trial whether she was sitting down on it. Captain Mangena said he used thin rods and the beam from a laser mounted on a . tripod to try to determine the trajectory of the bullets through the . door. He also described . entry and exit wounds on Ms Steenkamp's right arm and her head, and . bruises on her chest where a 'projectile' struck without penetrating. It comes as a gun expert today said the athlete, who has passed a test on gun safety, 'broke every rule in the book' when he shot his girlfriend. Pistorius, 27, is charged with . premeditated murder for killing Reeva Steenkamp, 29. SCROLL DOWN TO WATCH VIDEO . Oscar Pistorius is seen with tears running down his face on the twelfth day of his trial for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Tuesday . Pistorius puts his thumbs in his ears as evidence about Reeva Steenkamp's head wounds is read to the court . Pistorius covers his eyes in the dock as bloody scenes following the shooting of his girlfriend are shown at the High Court in Pretoria, South Africa . Aftermath of the killing: This picture of Oscar Pistorius, bare-chested and covered in blood from the waist down, was taken by police shortly after the Paralympian shot Reeva Steenkamp at his home . Shocking: Blood can be seen down the athlete's left arm and on his shorts apparently from when he carried his dead girlfriend down the stairs after shooting her in the bathroom . Horrific: Blood is splattered all over the toilet where Miss Steenkamp was shot by Pistorius . He denies murder and says . he shot his girlfriend accidentally, thinking she was an intruder in a . toilet cubicle in the bathroom of his home. Pistorius claims he then struck the toilet door . with a cricket bat to get to Steenkamp after realizing what he had done. But Andre Pritorius, the man who wrote . the gun safety exam that Pistorius and all South Africans take before getting . licensed to own a gun, told ABC News . that shooting Steenkamp through a bathroom door violated a key rule on . the test which states a shooter must know what or who the target is. He . said: 'That came as a big surprise to the general public because ... he . got the answers correct when he took the test not too long ago, but . unfortunately the night of the shooting he's broken every rule.' Meanwhile Pretoria High Court was . told earlier on Tuesday how police crime scene pictures appear to suggest key . evidence was moved by officers which would be a breach of investigation . procedures. Evidence: The bullet holes and shattered wood where Pistorius struck the door are clearly seen here . Clues: Based on the angle and height of the four bullet holes seen here, Pistorius fired his gun on his stumps, the court heard . Olympic and Paralympic track star Oscar Pistorius leaves court after listening to the cross examination of witnesses in his murder trial . Pistorius is accompanied by relatives as he leaves the high court in Pretoria after an emotional day of hearing evidence . In the spotlight: Pistorius is photographed by members of the public as he leaves the court . Warrant Officer Bennie van Staden took hundreds of photos of the scene at Pistorius's Pretoria home in the hours after the double-amputee athlete killed Miss Steenkamp before dawn on February 14 last year . The . pictures included blood marks found in the property, bullet casings, a . gun and a cricket bat found inside Pistorius's bathroom. Police photographer van Staden . admitted some of the photos suggest evidence had been moved by officers during . the evidence gathering process. The . revelation came as chief defense lawyer Barry Roux challenged previous . police witnesses, seeking to uncover contradictions and reported mishaps . to support his argument that officers bungled the investigation. Roux . minutely examined many photos taken by van Staden and another police . officer and pointed out that objects at the crime scene had been moved . and were in different positions in photos. Roux . also used time of day records on the images to show that the two . policemen taking photographs were in the same room at points, even . though van Staden testified he was working alone. Roux . compared photos of the bloody bathroom scene taken by van Staden with . photos in the bathroom taken by another policeman, identified as a Col. Motha. Both were in the bathroom at that time, according to the times . shown on the images. On trial: Oscar Pistorius checks his mobile phone as he sits in the dock waiting for the proceedings of his murder trial to begin at the High Court in Pretoria, South Africa, on Tuesday .

Pistorius is pictured in the dock on Tuesday . Graphic: A police picture taken at the scene of the cricket bat Pistorius says he used to break down the toilet door after he accidentally shot Miss Steenkamp. The court heard on Tuesday that police photographs suggest the bat was moved by officers in violation of investigation procedures . Testimony: Police photographer Bennie van Staden admitted in court on Tuesday that images from the scene at Pistorius's home suggest there was 'movement of the bat' Pistorius' lawyer also asked van Staden to explain differences in photographs of . the 9 mm pistol that Pistorius used to shoot Steenkamp through a closed . toilet door, and of a cricket bat that the Paralympian used to hit the . door. 'It seems there was movement of the bat' in the interval between two photographs taken by van Staden, Roux said. 'It seems like that,' van Staden conceded. The . police photographer also acknowledged that two photographs of the gun . indicated that a mat underneath it could have been shifted. Roux said one photo also differed from the other because it showed a wooden splinter on the gun handle. Two . other photos of objects on the bedroom floor next to Pistorius' bed . showed tissues, what was identified as a CD or disc and a remote control . were in different positions. Van Staden said he did not know who moved them, but he remembered the disc was previously under the bed. 'How does it happen that there's such a great disturbance of that scene?' Roux asked. Chief defence lawyer Barry Roux (pictured left) questions police photographer Bennie van Staden (pictured in the witness stand) during the murder trial of South African Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius . Splatter: Pistorius says he used the bat to break down the door to get to his model girlfriend after shooting her, he claims, by mistake thinking she was a burglar . Crime scene: This image shows the bathroom where Pistorius fired the fatal shots and the toilet in the background where Miss Steenkamp was hit by three bullets . Roux . was trying to build a picture of a cluttered and confused crime scene . with many officers working on it and possibly contaminating the . evidence. Van Staden has . said he also took nine photographs of Pistorius soon after the shooting, . with the athlete seen in some of the images standing in blood-stained . prosthetic legs and wearing blood-soaked shorts in the garage of his . home. Van Staden's . testimony on Tuesday was delayed by over an hour to give the policeman . time to collect photo records and discs at the defense's request. Van .

Mr Nightingale had agreed to give his ex-wife a quarter of his holding in the profitable business, based in Dublin, but claimed last July the shares had declined in value by nearly 20,000 times. The case has been hit with multiple delays after Mr Nightingale, a qualified lawyer, claimed he did not even have the money to pay his lawyers. Philip Cayford QC, for Mr Nightingale, said his client had managed to 'borrow' some funds to pay for his services. The couple, both immaculately dressed, have three children together, but failed to even make eye-contact at the hearing.

Sobia Yousef, 36, died in front of horrified staff and shoppers in the kitchenware aisle of Asda in Shipley, West Yorkshire, on Tuesday morning. Friends believe the death of her child five months ago caused a 'collapse in her mental state'. Tragic: Sobia Yousef, 36, died in front of horrified staff and shoppers in the kitchenware aisle of Asda in Shipley, West Yorkshire, on Tuesday morning . Shock: The victim was found lying in an aisle after injuring herself in the neck. She could not be saved . Four days of official mourning have started at her mosque in Frizinghall, Bradford. Bradford Councillor Imdad Hussain said she had undergone treatment at Lynfield Mount psychiatric hospital after her child passed away last year. 'It is a great tragedy which has left the whole local community and far beyond  in shock,' he said. 'It is such a terribly sad way for anyone to end their life. 'Sadly it seems that she lost her nine-year-old daughter some five months ago and it was that which triggered the collapse of her mental state. 'Her daughter had been born with an illness and the doctors only gave the baby a year to live. 'However she managed to stay alive until she was nine and there was a very special and close bond between the mother and daughter.' Investigation: Police shut off the supermarket after the incident, said to be driven by the woman's 'collapse in mental state' He said the care and treatment she received from mental health professionals needed to be examined. He said: 'Questions have to be asked of the authorities and organisations involved over what support was being given.' One eye-witness said: 'One of the shop's first aiders was trying to give CPR. 'One of the young men who works there actually saw the woman stabbing herself in the throat. He's in terrible shock'. The store was cordoned off for the majority of Tuesday as police forensic teams worked inside. West Yorkshire Police were alerted at around 8.37am to the store, along with paramedics.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Sales of fresh fruit and vegetables slumped last year, suggesting that shoppers are wasting less food. Britons bought 91,000 tonnes fewer vegetables and nearly 40,000 tonnes less fruit in 2013 but price rises – especially for potatoes – meant the value of sales increased. However, the hot summer and mild winter saw consumers buy more salads. Sales of fresh fruit and vegetables slumped last year, suggesting that shoppers are wasting less food . The drop in sales of fruit and vegetables  – of which health experts recommend we should eat five portions a day – could be attributed to greater awareness of food waste, with Government figures showing that 15million tons of food are discarded every year in the UK. Avneet Chana, analyst at consumer experts Kantar Worldpanel that released the figures, said: ‘Vegetables volume decline is driven by potatoes. Volume decline in potatoes is further driven by younger shoppers moving to other carbohydrates such as rice and pasta.’ Laurence Olins, chairman of produce supplier Poupart, suggested the variation in sales could also be down to changes in consumer behaviour. He told The Grocer magazine: ‘Consumers are shopping on a tighter budget and they are cannier – they are buying more frequently and in smaller quantities, and they are wasting less.’ Britons bought 91,000 tonnes fewer vegetables and nearly 40,000 tonnes less fruit in 2013 but price rises - especially for potatoes - meant the value of sales increased .","Britons bought 91,000 tonnes fewer vegetables last year, figures show .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . A government health campaign to get people to stop eating cheese has been condemned as 'unbelievably stupid' by farming ministers who fear for the impact on Britain's dairy industry. A Whitehall row has erupted over the Department of Health campaign designed to encourage people to cut down the amount of  saturated fats in their diet. The controversial Smart Swaps campaign has also faced criticism for giving money-off vouchers for fizzy drinks and ready meals. The Smart Swaps campaign urges people to give up full-fat food and drink for healthy alternatives . The Department of Health-backed scheme gives money off low-fat snacks . The Smart Swaps campaign was launched by Change4Life, run by Public Health England, last month. It encourages people to switch from unhealthy food and drink to low fat, low sugar alternatives. People who sign up are sent money off vouchers, fridge magnets and a ‘Smart Swapper’ wheel containing advice on how to eat more healthily. The advice includes using 'reduced fat cheese' in several recipes, including pizzas, fish pie and even sandwiches. A magnet reads: 'Reduced fat cheese, if you please.' But senior Tories in the Department for . Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have warned that a planned poster . campaign would alienate farmers, the dairy industry and the makers of . full-fat cheese – including those in key marginal constituencies. Farming minister George Eustice has complained to Jane Ellison, the public health minister, about the campaign. A . source said: ‘You could have had posters going up in farming areas that . were badly flooded telling people to cut down on the amount of cheese . they buy. It was unbelievably stupid.’ David Cameron's official spokesman today refused to get drawn into the dairy row. 'I don't make it my job to give people advice from here. Public health advice is made, including around dairy advice, and that I what I will stick to. 'My answer, whether it is hard, soft, crumbly or flaky, is to point you to the advice that exists,' he told a regular briefing of journalists. Ministers clashed in Westminster over the Change4Life campaign which calls on people to switch to skimmed milk and buy reduced-fat cheese . The Government last night denied . saying that cheese  was ‘bad’, and said it remained supportive of . Britain's £10 billion dairy industry. The . Department of Health said: ‘The Change4Life Smart Swaps campaign… does . not suggest that dairy is bad for you. The smart swaps campaign includes . five recommended smart swaps, one of which was switching to low fat . cheese. ‘We are clear . that milk and cheese can be enjoyed as part of a healthy and balanced . diet which also supports the UK’s £10billion dairy industry employing . more than 5,000 people.’ It comes amid a growing debate over whether saturated fats are actually harmful. Earlier . this month researchers at Cambridge University said that giving up . fatty meat, cream or butter was unlikely to improve health. Earlier this month MailOnline revealed how the Smart Swaps campaign had come under fire for giving free advertising to junk food firms. Shoppers were being offered money off fizzy drinks, tinned vegetables and ready . meals with vouchers sent to more than 100,000 people who want to improve . their diet. The government was accused of ‘endorsing’ companies like Pepsi and .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . and Tim Shipman . Ed Miliband is facing a growing revolt over this leadership, after his poll lead over the Tories evaporated and four in 10 voters branded him ‘weird’. The Labour leader is under pressure from all sides in the party after a lacklustre response to the Budget and slumping to only one point above the Conservatives in three different opinion polls. One MP called for Mr Miliband to stop ‘just talking about the state’, while a group of left-wing think tanks urged him to explain what he would actually do if he became Prime Minister. Some 41 per cent of voters think Ed Miliband is 'weird', compared to only 27 per cent who thought the same of David Cameron . The Labour lead over the Conservatives has narrowed dramatically in recent days, and is down to just one point in three different polls, including this one from YouGov for the Sunday Times . A string of MPs and influential party thinkers say he needs ‘bolder’ ideas and cannot try to coast to victory complaining about the cost of living. Members of the Shadow Cabinet told the Mail that his top team is split over whether to ‘go big or go small’ to woo voters over the next year. Allies of policy chief Jon Cruddas broke cover yesterday to demand he ‘goes big’ with a more radical set of policies. They believe general election coordinator Douglas Alexander is encouraging Mr Miliband to be more cautious, in the belief that winning 35 per cent of the vote next year will be enough for victory. In further dispiriting news for the Labour chief, a survey revealed that voters think he is the ‘weirdest’ party leader in Britain. The YouGov poll for BuzzFeed showed that 41 per cent think Mr Miliband is either ‘very weird’ or ‘somewhat weird’. Just 34 per cent thinks the same of Nick Clegg and only 27 per cent believe that David Cameron is weird. The survey, which looked at the public’s perception of the leaders’ personalities, also found 36 per cent of the population believe Mr Miliband would have been bullied at school. A third also think he would have been an unpopular student and 57 per cent said he would have been the hardest-working pupil. But the more pressing concern for Labour MPs is that another YouGov opinion poll put the Tories on 36 points, just one point behind Labour, while a Survation poll had the Conservatives on 34 points – also only one point behind. More than half of under-24s think Mr Miliband is weird, the YouGov survey for BuxxFeed found . A third of people suspect that Mr Miliband was bullied at school, and only 16 per cent thought he was popular . Yesterday a Populus poll put Labour on 35 per cent, again only one point ahead of the Tories on 34 per cent. Mr Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls are still trailing far behind the Conservatives when voters were asked which party they trust to run the economy. A senior Labour frontbencher said: ‘Our economic offering was already seen as weak by some voters. Ed’s lame response has not helped with that. ‘Some people seem to think that we can just coast to victory. This poll should be a wake-up call.’ And a member of the Shadow Cabinet described the ‘pretty intense debate’ with those wanting to think big calling for a ‘distinctive, more radical platform for voters’. He added: ‘And if we win we will have a firmer platform to tackle the problems Ed has identified with predator capitalism. You can either have a mandate to do something interesting or you can try to creep over the line not offending anyone.’ Responding to last week’s Budget, Mr Miliband recycled several tired attacks on the Tories, accusing them of being ‘out of touch’ members of the ‘Bullingdon Club’ with little idea of how normal people are affected by cuts. But a Labour MP said: ‘People just don’t take any notice of all the posh Tory boy attacks. They want to know what we are actually going to do.’ An alliance of think-tanks and Left-wing intellectuals provided a fresh blow to the Labour leader, writing a joint letter to Mr Miliband questioning his sense of direction. Labour leader Ed Miliband has faced criticism for his 'lame' response to last week's Budget . Ed Miliband is seen as the most honest leader, while Lib Dem Nick Clegg is the least honest . The 19 leading figures from groups such as Fabian Society, Compass, Policy Network and Progress expressed unease that Labour’s leader may not secure a mandate for the kind of reforms they believe Britain needs. They argued that Britain needs ‘transformative’ change, adding: ‘If Labour plays the next election safe and hopes to win on the basis of Tory unpopularity, it will not have earned a mandate for such change.’ Neal Lawson, of the think-tank Compass, said Labour needed to ‘shape up, be bolder and more radical’. Labour MP Simon Danczuk warned Mr Miliband had to be ‘much stronger’ when communicating his message to voters. He told BBC Radio 4’s Westminster Hour: ‘We have to talk less to ourselves and more to the wider public. ‘We're sometimes seen as just talking about the public sector, just talking about the state. ‘I think we need to cut the soundbites and really talk more about small business, about entrepreneurialism, about people's aspirations there, because...  the general election will be very much about the economy and as a party we need to get onto the front-foot talking about how we can support some small businesses, not least because they are the backbone of the return to the successful economy.’ Another radical accused Mr Miliband of being on the back foot after George Osborne’s plans to overhaul pensions. Even an ally admitted that cost of living issues will not be enough to win a majority in 2015 as wages will begin to overtake prices later this year. Labour sought to downplay the polls, saying the Tories were ‘always going to get a bounce out of the Budget’. A survey by ComRes last night put Labour five points ahead of the Tories on 36 per cent, although the party’s lead has  shrunk by eight points. Mr Miliband faces a fresh headache this week when around 15 of his MPs are expected to defy his instructions to vote for the Government’s welfare cap.","Voters also think Miliband was bullied and unpopular at school .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . London Mayor Boris Johnson said he backed the freedom for people to spend their money however they wished, even if it meant being foolish . If people blow their pensions on luxuries and end up living in a rusted Lamborghini eating dog food that is ‘their look out’, Boris Johnson has claimed. The London Mayor defended plans to allow people approaching retirement to withdraw all of their pension pot as a lump sum, instead of having to use it to provide steady income for the rest of their lives. Mr Johnson said the changes to annuities announced in last week’s Budget is ‘all about trusting people to run their own lives’. Up to 400,000 people will benefit immediately from the coalition's radical pensions shake-up, David Cameron has said. Under the changes workers nearing retirement will be allowed to withdraw the cash they have built up in private pension pots. With no need to take out an annuity - paying regular sums for the rest of their life - pensioners will be free to spend their nest eggs as they like. If follows anger from pensioners about the dismal payouts that annuity providers offer. Critics claimed the law was needed to stop people squandering their money because they do not realise how long they will live. Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb said last week he was ‘relaxed’ about how people use the money, adding: ‘If people do get a Lamborghini, and end up on the state pension, the state is much less concerned about that, and that is their choice.’ Today he received the backing of Mr Johnson, who said the remarks ‘made me stand on my chair and cheer’. The Conservative Mayor of London said that when people reach a pensionable age they should be allowed to run their own lives, and ‘not be treated like children’. ‘It may well be that buying a Lamborghini is not always the right move,’ he said in his Daily Telegraph column. ‘There may indeed be some foolish old . people who end up living in a rusting and motionless Lamborghini and . eating tins of dog food, because they have gone for the luxury car . without making adequate provision for the rest of their needs. ‘There might be some pensioners who spent their declining years plying the streets with a Lamborghini minicab. ‘As . I am sure Steve Webb meant to imply, the Lamborghini option is not . going to be for everyone – not when the average pension pot is £25,000. ‘But . the point is that it is their look-out; it is their savings; it is up . to them to decide what to do with it. It is that sudden rush of freedom – . the empowerment of millions of people – that naturally appals the . left.’ People should be free to buy Lamborghini with their pension pot if they want to, says pensions minister Steve Webb . Chancellor George Osborne announced moves to scrap rules that force most pensioners to use their direct contribution funds to buy an annuity, even though the rates can be poor. Although most of the reforms will apply from April next year, a number will be brought in from Thursday to ensure people close to retirement do not miss out. Individuals with total pension savings of £30,000 or less will be able to take the full amount as a lump sum, nearly double the current £18,000 limit. The minimum annual income required to access a pension fund flexibly will also be cut from £20,000 to £12,000, while access rules will be eased so people with substantial pots can draw higher incomes. But Mr Johnson risked fuelling concerns about a housing market boom by saying ‘huge numbers’ of people would now sink their retirement savings into property. The coalition argues that hundreds of thousands of people will benefit from the decision to scrap rules that force most pensioners to use their direct contribution funds to buy an annuity, even though the rates can be poor. Mr Cameron will use an event with meeting Saga members in Brighton today to insist the changes represented core Tory values. Speaking ahead of his visit, the Prime Minister said: ‘This is about our values. It's about backing those who work hard, save and do the right thing. ‘And it's about saying that the best people to look after their money are those who earned it in the first place. ‘Labour have been all over the place. First they come out with the patronising nonsense that people can't be trusted to spend their own money sensibly. Then they back our plans. Then they're not sure. ‘So the contrast is clear: while Labour dither and flail around for ideas, we have made long-term changes that will give millions greater security in old age. ‘Labour ignored Britain's savers, we are on their side. Labour punished those who work hard and play by the rules, we are on their side. ‘This is an historic change - the biggest revolution in pensions and savings for 100 years - and I'm proud the Conservatives have delivered it.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband made no mention of the pension changes in his Budget speech in the Commons last week, and the party has appeared contradicted about its response. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves insisted the party backed the shake-up in principle. ‘We support reforms to the pension market, so people can get a better deal and have more flexibility, especially at the moment, when people are just not getting a very good deal on their annuity,’ she told Sky News' Murnaghan programme. She argued that the Government had not ‘gone far enough’ in the Budget, and should also impose a cap on fees and charges by pensions and annuities firms. But shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna declined to say whether Labour would vote in favour of specific legislation. And shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie said there were ‘some serious concerns underneath the scrutiny’ of the policy.","Around 13million are to have right to spend private pension how they want .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . President Barack Obama dismissed the idea of Russia as a threat -- and said his bigger fear is a nuclear weapon in Manhattan. Obama made the remarks while speaking at the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague. 'Russia’s actions are a problem,' he said. 'They don’t pose the No. 1 national security threat to the United States. I continue to be much more concerned when it comes to our security with the prospect of a nuclear weapon going off in Manhattan.' Scroll down for video . Fears: Barack Obama said he was not too worried about Russia, but ' more concerned when it comes to our security with the prospect of a nuclear weapon going off in Manhattan' Threat: Mr Obama was speaking at the Nuclear Security Summit at The Hague in Holland . Obama then continued, speaking about efforts to eliminate that threat 'in a consistent way.' '[...] . Which is part of the reason why the United States, showing its . continued international leadership, has organized a form over the last . several years that’s been able to help eliminate that threat in a . consistent way,' he said. The remarks were made in response to a reporter who asked if Mitt Romney's 2012 concerns about Russia's geopolitical power were valid. Obama seemed to dismiss the idea, and said that Russia was merely a 'regional power.' 'Russia is a regional power that is threatening some of its immediate neighbors — not out of strength, but out of weakness,' he said. During the summit Obama, also praised the 'fundamental shift' in international efforts to fight nuclear terrorism as 35 countries pledged Tuesday to turn guidelines on nuclear security into national laws. At the close of a two-day summit, the group also agreed to open up their security procedures to independent review, a further step toward creating an international legal framework to thwart nuclear terrorism. The move is a joint initiative sponsored by host country the Netherlands, along with past summit hosts the United States and South Korea. Mr Obama also held a joint news conference with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte . Obama, seen here speaking with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, said Russia's actions 'don¿t pose the No. 1 national security threat to the United States' 'I believe this is essential to the security of the entire world,' Obama said at a press conference wrapping up the summit. He added that more still needs to be done: 'Given the catastrophic consequences of even a single attack, we cannot be complacent.' All 53 countries that participated in the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague agreed Tuesday to keep looking for ways to ensure that nuclear material doesn't fall into the hands of terrorists. But the pledge to adopt nuclear guidelines into law and undergo external checks was endorsed by just 35 nations, including France, Britain, Canada, Japan, Israel and the three summit hosts. Notably absent from that agreement were Russia, China, India and Pakistan. North Korea and Iran didn't even attend. 'We need to get the rest of the summit members to sign up to it, especially Russia, and we need to find a way to make this into permanent international law,' said Miles Pomper of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. Since Obama launched the summits in 2010, the number of countries that have enough material to build a nuclear weapon has fallen from 39 to 25. When pressed about Russia's geopolitical power, Obama -- seen posing for a group photo -- said it was merely a 'regional power' threatening neighbors 'out of weakness' This summit featured new reduction commitments, with Japan, Italy and Belgium pledging to reduce their stocks of highly enriched uranium and plutonium. Other groups of nations pledged to step up efforts to prevent trafficking of nuclear material, boost maritime security and to develop low-enriched uranium for research reactors instead of the highly enriched, weapons-grade nuclear fuel currently widely used. 'I'll close by reminding everyone that one of the achievements of my first summit in 2010 was Ukraine's decision to remove all of its highly enriched uranium from its nuclear fuel sites,' Obama said. 'Had that not happened, those dangerous nuclear materials would still be there now. And the difficult situation we're dealing with in Ukraine today would involve yet another level of concern.' Obama went on to conclude that 'the more of this material we can secure, the safer all of our countries will be.' The summit statement also reminded countries to consider the potential threat posed by cyberterrorism. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the nuclear summit was crucial at a time when 'international stability and security are being put into question in a very serious manner"" — another reference to the Ukraine crisis. 'It is therefore all the more important to show that we are united in our commitment to a multilateral order based on peace and the unequivocal respect of the rule of law,' he said. Michelle Cann of the Partnership for Global Security said Tuesday's deal was significant because it marks 'a change in the way security is done.' Cann said the gains from reducing nuclear material will likely trail off in the future. In absence of a global treaty on nuclear security, the next phase in improving security will be for groups of like-minded countries to lead the way. That will put peer pressure among nations, she said, with none wanting to be seen as the most lax at safeguarding their nuclear material. Agreeing to external checks, conducted under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is especially important, she added.","Obama says he is 'much more concerned when it comes to our security with the prospect of a nuclear weapon going off in Manhattan'

The smaller grey moon is shown passing behind the larger white dot of our planet, to the right. When the Nasa probe flew past . Earth after performing a series of deep space manoeuvres it  received a boost in speed of more than 8,800 mph setting it on course to reach Jupiter by 4 July, 2016. Scroll down for video . A new video that shows Earth and the moon travelling through space together for the first time has been released by Nasa. The larger white dot pictured here is Earth, while the faint grey dot is the moon . The Juno spacecraft was launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on 5 August, 2011. It first performed a series of deep space manoeuvres before returning to Earth for a flyby. When the spacecraft flew past Earth on 9 October this year it received a boost in speed of more than 8,800 mph. This set it on course to reach Jupiter by 4 July, 2016. After . Juno arrives and enters into orbit around Jupiter, the . spacecraft will circle the planet 33 times, from pole to pole and use . its collection of science instruments to probe beneath the gas giant's . obscuring cloud cover. Scientists will learn about Jupiter's origins, internal structure, atmosphere and magnetosphere. Professor John Jorgensen, who was involved in the project, told MailOnline the footage was taken over a four-day period. He added the camera was programmed to take an image every 2.5 minutes during every 5 rotations of the spacecraft. One of Juno's sensors, a special kind of camera designed to track faint stars, was able to give a unique view of the Earth-moon system. The result was low-resolution glimpse of what Earth would look like to a visitor from afar. ‘If Captain Kirk of the USS Enterprise said, ""Take us home, Scotty,"" this is what the crew would see,’ said Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator at the Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio. ‘In the movie, you ride aboard Juno as it approaches Earth and then soars off into the blackness of space. ‘No previous view of our world has ever captured the heavenly waltz of Earth and moon,’ he added. The cameras that took the images for the film are located near the pointed tip of one of the spacecraft's three solar-array arms. The images used to make the video were taken by the Juno satellite, pictured, as it passed Earth in October, on its way towards Jupiter. One of Juno's sensors, a special kind of camera designed to track faint stars, gave a unique view of the Earth-moon system for the first time ever . They are part of Juno's Magnetic Field Investigation (MAG) and are normally used to determine the orientation of the magnetic sensors. These cameras look away from the sunlit side of the solar array, so as the spacecraft approached the system's four cameras pointed toward Earth. Earth and the moon came into view when Juno was about 600,000 miles away - about three times the distance between the Earth and the moon. Timing the shots was vital as Juno was traveling almost twice as fast as a typical satellite and the spacecraft itself was spinning at two revolutions per minute. To assemble a movie that wouldn't make viewers dizzy, the star tracker had to capture a frame each time the camera was facing Earth at exactly the right instant. The frames were sent to Earth, where they were processed into video format.

"By . Ryan Gorman . An Oregon woman leading police on a high speed chase ended it by jumping off a bridge. Rebecca Humphries, 26, of Troutdale, ran numerous red lights and stop signs and drove erratically Wednesday while leading police on a frenetic chase in a stolen car before she jumped off a bridge – she sustained serious injuries but will survive the plunge. A MailOnline review of court records showed she had reason to run, her criminal record contains dozens of counts including drug possession and theft charges. A collection of mushots: The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office made this series of mug shots showing Rebecca Humphries over the years . Dashcam video released by the Troutdale Police Department shows Ms Humphries taking multiple squad cars on a joyride through the suburban Portland town. The career criminal even crashes into some bushes before slamming on the gas and high-tailing it away before police can catch her. The ensuing chase reached speeds of up to 60 miles per hour, police said. ‘I was trying to return the car to the guy that was in retaliation for me ditching it,’ Ms Humphries told KATU from her hospital bed. ‘I started to get pulled over and got scared and 'fight or flight' kicked in and I jumped.’ The chase: The bridge can be seen just ahead, police had no idea what was about to happen . The approach: Ms Humphries jumped out of the moving car and ran to the bridge's railing . The climb: She didn't even look back towards the cop car before scaling the guard rail . The chase then takes an unexpected turn when she comes to a bridge and slows down enough to jump out of the vehicle while it is still moving. Ms Humphries climbs over the bridge’s railing and jumps into the ice cold Sandy River more than 30 feet below, according to the Oregon Herald, without even the slightest hesitation. ‘I looked down, but I didn't hesitate,’ Ms Humphries recalled. ‘I just jumped… It didn't look as far when I looked down, as it did when I looked up.’ Rescue workers eventually pulled her from the water and took her to a local hospital where she is receiving treatment for broken vertebrae, KATU reported. She is expected to make a full recovery. Just before the dismount: She was on the railing for only a split second before disappearing over the side and into the water below . On a better day: The Stark Street Bridge is only 35 feet above the water . ‘Really, jumping from that bridge, in itself the distance to the water is dangerous - for somebody to jump that distance,’ a police spokesperson told KATU. ‘And into freezing water also, I have no idea what was going through her head.’ Ms Humphries was cited for numerous traffic violations, police said. No further information was provided, and MailOnline was unable to reach a police spokesperson. She may have ran because she has a lengthy criminal record spanning at least 26 charges including multiple theft and criminal trespass convictions, as well as four felony heroin possession convictions – two filed only four days apart in 2012. The troubled woman also has also been convicted of a litany of traffic offenses.","Rebecca Humphries fled from police in a stolen car .

"By . James Slack . A senior Tory MP has accused Nigel Farage of ‘fake sincerity’ as he urged the Prime Minister not to try to ‘out-Ukip Ukip’ on immigration. Mark Field warned his party not to get into a bidding war with Ukip on the eve of the televised debate between Mr Farage and Nick Clegg. He said: ‘If you can fake sincerity, you’ve really got it made. There is a bit of that to the smoking a fag and having a pint of beer’. A senior Tory MP has accused Nigel Farage of 'fake sincerity' as he urged the Prime Minister not to try to 'out-Ukip Ukip' on immigration . Mr Field also accused Ukip – whose leader is regularly pictured drinking real ale in pubs, or with a cigarette – of wanting to stick ‘two fingers up to the entire political class’. And he warned against aspiring to live in the Britain of the ‘1950s’. Mr Field spoke out at the launch of the new group Conservatives for a Managed Migration group - which wants David Cameron to scrap his target to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’. Only two other named Tory MPs supported the launch, despite claims there were up to 20 backers. Mark Field warned his party not to get into a bidding war with Ukip on the eve of the televised debate between Mr Farage and Nick Clegg . Mr Field said other colleagues had privately given him their support, but did not wish to go public because of the threat posed by Ukip in their ‘back yard’. The City of London MP said Conservative election hopes were being jeopardised by the party’s ‘relentless focus’ on immigration. He said Mr Cameron’s ‘undeliverable’ pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands was helping fuel a public perception that his party was ‘fundamentally hostile’ to immigrants. He pointed to ‘alarming’ figures suggesting Polish nationals living in the UK were three times more likely to vote Labour in May’s European elections despite being natural Conservative supporters. He warned it was ‘hard to believe this is unrelated to perceived Conservative hostility’. Mr Field conceded that representing the ethnically-diverse and business-heavy Cities of London and Westminster seat made it easier for him to speak out on the issue without fearing for his political future. But he told MPs facing a serious Ukip challenge: ‘I do think that a good dose of authentically telling it like it is would a better approach rather than trying to second guess where Ukip are on the emotive issues of Europe and our future in the European Union.’ The Tories’ goal of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands by the end of the Parliament looks almost certain to be missed after the most recent figures surged year-on-year by more than a third to 212,000 in the 12 months to September 2013. Mr Field said the Prime Minister was right to continue pursuing the target for the moment but that the party must ‘go into the next election campaign with a more pragmatic and more nuanced offering.’ Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage will hold a radio debate on EU membership on LBC at 7pm today, hosted by Nick Ferrari . He added: ‘We cannot out-Ukip Ukip on immigration, and nor should we try to on immigration, especially as we will not be able to match their offering of withdrawal on the EU’. Mr Field insisted his new group was ‘not designed to be in any way disruptive’. The two other named Tory MPs supporting the group were Brooks Newmark and Ben Wallace. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage will hold a radio debate on EU membership on LBC at 7pm today, hosted by Nick Ferrari. A second hour-long debate between the men will be shown on BBC2 from 7pm on Wednesday, 2 April, and will be hosted by David Dimbleby.","Mark Field warned his party not to get .

"By . Rob Preece . Murdered: A painting of teenager Rebecca Aylward, apparently showing blood coming from her head, has been covered up by art exhibition organisers after the girl's mother called it 'sick and disgusting' Controversial paintings of a schoolboy and his ex-girlfriend, who he murdered for a bet, have had to be covered up at an art exhibition after the victim's mother described them as 'sick and disgusting'. Sonia Oatley, 50, protested after pictures of her daughter's teenage killer Joshua Davies went on display at an arts and culture festival in Wales. Another of the images at the festival appeared to show Sonia's 15-year-old daughter Rebecca with blood coming from her head. The pictures, which have been covered up with white sheets, were on show only 10 miles from the spot where Davies bludgeoned Rebecca to death with a rock in October 2010. Davies, now 17, was jailed last year after a court heard that he carried out the brutal killing for a bet with a schoolmate to win a full English breakfast. The paintings, by artist David Rees Davies, went on display at the National Eisteddfod arts and culture festival in Llandow, Vale of Glamorgan. Organisers initially resisted calls to cover them up, saying they were 'not in the business of censorship', but they relented after Mrs Oatley complained. Mrs Oatley said: 'I feel like throwing a pot of red paint over them. 'It’s sick and disgusting that a painting like this can go on show so soon after my daughter was murdered. 'Some of Rebecca’s school friends were due to go to the exhibition - they would have been in tears if they had seen this vile picture.' Blocked out: The controversial pictures by David Rees Davies have been covered following anger at his subject matter . Sick: The exhibition - titled People I know, People I used to know and people I'd rather not know - features paintings of murdered school girl Rebecca Aylward . Schoolboy killer Davies had broken up with Rebecca but later lured her to woodland near his home in the village of Aberkenfig, South Wales. He used a rock the size of a rugby ball to kill her then went home as if nothing had happened. Rebecca’s body as found the next day after Mrs Oatley reported her missing. Advice: A notice at the art festival warns visitors of the content of the exhibition. Organisers have decided to cover the controversial paintings . The artist used Davies's police mugshot to create one of the controversial paintings. He said it was a 'crime of passion' by a tortured young man driven mad by his girlfriend’s rejection and unrequited love. And he wrote 'Cariad' on Davies’s forehead - the Welsh word for 'love' or 'darling'. But the murder trial heard Davies had a 'deep-seated hatred' of Rebecca and had boasted to friends that he was plotting different ways to kill her. Mrs Oatley, of Maesteg, Bridgend, accused the artist of ignoring the facts. She said: 'What right has he got to say things like that because it is not true. Anger: Killer Joshua Davies smiles as he arrives at court during his trial, left, and Sonia Oatley, centre right, mother of tragic teen Rebecca Aylward with her young son Jack and teenage daughter Jessica . 'It was heard in court - this was not a crime of passion it was premeditated murder. 'If the artist had said evil on Davies’s forehead then maybe I could have accepted it. 'But ""Cariad"" - that is totally wrong.' The Oatley family's local MP, Huw Irranca-Davies, said: 'The original decision to exhibit these paintings has caused deep distress, and should not have happened at all. 'This has shown immense insensitivity and bad judgement dealing with a matter that is not only local but very recent and very vivid, not least for the families involved. 'The decision late in the day to cover these pictures from public view will be of scant consolation to those affected, knowing they have been on display for several days.' The paintings form part of a series of works called 'People I know; People I used to know; and People I’d rather not know'. Festival organisers said they were not aware of the identities of those in the paintings when the submission was received or when they were  independently selected for the open exhibition at this year’s gallery.","Paintings showing killer Joshua Davies and his 15-year-old victim Rebecca Aylward went on display at exhibition in Llandow, Vale of Glamorgan, Wales .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Whether placenta facials, vajazzling or fish pedicures, recent years have seen bizarre beauty treatments become the norm. But, as NY Magazine has revealed, toe-curling beauty treatments aren't as modern as most of us think. From Elizabeth I's toxic lead make-up to poisonous eye drops made from deadly nightshade, historic beauty treatments were just as bizarre as their modern equivalents. But what's in the compact? Berthe Morisot's 1877 Young Woman Powdering Her Face . Most were also considerably more gruesome, among them a painful-sounding method for lengthening the lashes championed in an 1899 edition of The Dundee Courier. Under the headline Irresistible Eyes May Be Had By Transplanting The Hair, the piece explains how longer eyelashes can be achieved by having hair from the head sewn into the eyelids. The article concludes: 'Eyebrows are doctored in the same way, but there is not so much pain associated with the process as there is in transplanting eyelashes.' If that's not enough to leave you feeling ready to go bare-faced, a particularly dangerous method of removing excess hair might do the trick. Within a year of Wilhelm Roentgen's discovery of the X-ray in 1895, doctors and dermatologists were using them to treat everything from excess hair to acne. But while the treatment did indeed remove hair, getting rid of it required as much as 20 hours under the X-ray, which led to everything from burns to cancer. Dangerous: A vintage ad for Dr Campbell's Safe Arsenic Complexion Wafers and Fould's Arsenic Soap . Not clever: X-rays were used as a treatment for excess body hair while mercury was thought to cure spots . Although the side effects of prolonged exposure to X-rays were noted in a 1909 report, it wasn't until 1920 that the consequences were fully understood. And X-rays weren't the only radioactive beauty treat embraced by women in the late Victorian period and early 20th century. Radium itself was used as an ingredient in expensive skincare, with one 1915 ad, for a company called Radior's range of rouge, night cream and skin soap, reading: . 'An ever-flowing Fountain of Youth and Beauty has at last been found in the Energy Rays of Radium. 'When scientists discovered Radium they hardly dreamed they had unearthed a revolutionary ""Beauty Secret."" 'They know it now. Radium Rays vitalize and energize all living tissue.' But while it took time for the deadly results of radium and X-rays to be revealed, other popular ingredients for beauty potions took effect more quickly. Poison: Like arsenic and mercury, Belladonna leaves could be deadly but were once used in eye drops . Lead: The Darnley portrait of Elizabeth I highlights her pale complexion created using lead make-up . Particularly dangerous was arsenic, a fast acting poison used by Victorian women to achieve pale, perfect skin. Unfortunately for those who used it, it achieved the effect by killing off red blood cells and also made users go bald. Although those who used readymade potions such as Dr MacKenzie’s Improved Harmless Arsenic Complexion Wafers weren't immune, those who attempted to make their own by soaking the arsenic off fly paper tended to feel the ill-effects more quickly. Unlike arsenic, there was no DIY way to create face cream based on mercury, although that didn't stop hundreds of thousands of women from being poisoned by lotions made from it. Before safer cures for spots were invented, the dangerous substance was used to cure acne - and syphillis - despite the fact that mercury is easily absorbed through the skin and causes birth defects, kidney and liver problems, fatigue, irritability, tremors and depression. And that wasn't all. Hair pomade made from rodent-attracting lard and make-up that contained lead remained big business until well into the 20th century. So will future generations remember modern treatments as bizarre and deadly? With traces of mercury and lead still found in some products, and poisonous formaldehyde used in keratin blow-drys, it seems likely. An ordinary fine needle is threaded with a long hair, generally taken from the head of the person to be operated upon. The lower border of the eyelid is then thoroughly cleaned, and in order that the process may be as painless as possible rubbed with a solution of cocaine. The operator then by a few skilful touches runs his needle through the extreme edges of the eyelid between the epidermis and the lower border of the cartilage of the tragus. The needle passes in and out along the edge of the lid leaving its hair thread in loops of carefully graduated length.When this has been done another length of hair is sewed through the lid until finally there are a dozen or more loops projecting. By this time the effect of the cocaine has been lost, and the operator is obliged to desist, and put off further “sewing of hair” for another sitting.The next step in the process is cutting off and trimming the ends of the loops, and the result is a fine, thick, long set of eyelashes. It is the finishing touch, that is to come, that makes them look like nature’s own. When they are at first cut they stick out in the most singular fashion, giving the person operated upon the most uncanny look. The operator’s next step is to take curling tongs, made of silver, and no larger than knitting needles, and to give them the curve which is essential to perfect beauty. Then the eyes are carefully bandaged, and kept so until the following day.

"By . Anna Edwards . A widow has spoken for the first time about the horrific death of her husband who was eaten by his friends after the party got lost at sea in bitter temperatures for nearly two months. Olga Kurochkin, 37, said her life had been ruined by the terrible fate of Andrei whose remains were found in the pitiless eastern reaches of Siberia. Two members of the four-strong party survived the ordeal and, after carrying the head of 44-year-old Mr Kurochkin through the wild, told police they had eaten the man from Saratov after he froze to death. Forensic analysis of Mr Kurochkin's body parts revealed that sections of flesh had been carefully sliced away while joints had been butchered. Andrei's heartbroken wife Olga (pictured on their wedding day) said: 'I never expected such horror could come into my life' after she learned what had happened to her spouse . Olga (pictured with daughter Alyona and husband Andrei) says that her life has been totally ruined and that she only has a few remains of her partner . Speaking to The Siberian Times Mrs Kurochkin said: 'I never expected such horror could come into my life. It has ruined . not just my life, but also the lives of all our relatives, and we are a . big family. 'Can you imagine what I have left? One foot with toes, one finger, and the back of his skull with some hair. 'This is it. This is all I have left . from the man I loved. Having just these remains, how can I say goodbye . to him? I have got almost nothing to cry over. 'I can't think about it, I am losing my mind with this.' Mrs Kurochki, who has a daughter Alyona, 21, is suing survivors Alexander Abdullaev, 37, and Alexei . Gorulenko, 35, for emotional distress. She also wants a criminal prosecution brought against them. 'I don't want to suspect them of murder, this would be just . too much,' she added. 'But I do want them to be punished for what they did, because it is just outrageous to leave it like this. 'Now I want these cannibals to be punished. I fear our police is not keen to investigate this case properly. 'Our law does not say a word about . cannibalism, it is not a crime, so our two survivors can be punished . only for defiling a body and perhaps leaving a human being in danger. 'The . (police) report did not leave me any hope, now I can be sure my husband . Andrei is dead and his body was found there in the taiga. 'I am sure they have eaten him. Now we know that Andrei died somewhere else and they dragged the body . all the way through the snow, eating it step by step. 'But together with the remains of my husband there were also found the bones of animals. 'If they could kill animals, why would they need to try eating a human body? And why did they carry his head with them?' Mr Kurochkin set out with his friends from Dipkun village, Amur region, on an epic fishing trip-of-a-lifetime to eastern Siberia on August 8 last year. Survivors Alexei Gorulenko (pictured) and  Alexander Abdullaev are being sued for emotional distress by Olga Kurochkin after they admitted to eating him . Olga and her daughter will have to live with the gruesome fact of how Andrei died . Catastrophe struck early in to their . trip when their jeep sunk in a frozen river leaving the party stranded . in one of the most isolated spots in the world. All . four took refuge in a remote hunting lodge, which they used as a base . for a number of weeks, until they exhausted its food supplies. They . did not seem in any rush to escape from the taiga, despite losing their . fishing tackle and the vehicle, in which they had often slept. During . this period they encountered a number of hunters who had vehicles and . walkie-talkies. At least one let them use his satellite phone. As conditions worsened they began walking back to civilisation at the beginning of October. They left a note in a hunter's house saying they had sheltered under the owner's roof and eaten all his food. They also left 3,000 roubles – around £60. Their progress back to civilisation was haphazard. Had . they been fit and properly equipped, they could have covered the . distance in a matter of days, even with the snow and sub-zero . temperatures. But it took almost seven weeks before two of them were found some nine miles from Dipkun. In . this time it is known all four took refuge in another empty hunter’s . shack near the Daurka River, an area described by locals as lonely and . macabre. In recent years, seven dead bodies have been found there. They were found in the Sakha Republic by a Russian Emergencies Ministry rescue helicopter which saved their lives. Abdullaev eventually confessed to the authorities that they had eaten Mr Kurochkin. 'He died by himself. He froze to . death. Only after that did we start eating him,' Abdullaev told . Neryungri police in the Sakha Republic. 'At one point they were surviving on moss and sawdust. A lie detector test proves they were desperate,' said one official. While he is now assisting investigators, Gorulenko escaped first . to Chita, then Moscow, and then vanished altogether ten days ago, say . reports. The other fisherman in the group Viktor Komarov, 47, has still not been found. Survivors Alexander Abdullaev and Alexander Abdullaev (pictured being rescued) had been missing for nearly two months after their jeep sunk in a frozen river stranding the ice-fishing party in one of the most isolated spots in the world .

'This is a private affair, and we have no comment whatsoever,' spokesman Bruno Neve told the International Herald Tribune. It was first revealed that Albert fathered an illegitimate child in a book published in 1999, and middle-aged artist Ms Boël is adamant that she is the child in question. Sad farewell: Queen Paola appeared to be overcome with emotion at one point during their visit to the French community in Liege . She has given a series of interviews with the media in both Belgium and France, insisting she is driven by the desire for vindication rather than any claim on the king's fortune. 'I am deeply saddened, but I believe blood can work wonders,' she was quoted as saying last month. 'I don't believe that my legal action will end all discrimination against me or my family, or mend my personal relationship with my father, but with DNA proof there will be undeniable certainty about my identity,' she said in a statement as she launched legal proceedings. To date two court hearings have taken place - both behind closed doors. 'No comment': King Albert II, third from left, is preparing to hand the throne to his son Crown Prince Philippe, seen left in a family photograph in Brussels . Ms Boël's mother, Sybile de Selys Longchamps, has backed her daughter's efforts to have her alleged royal lineage recognised, and says she had an affair with the king lasting 18 years. Albert's marriage to Queen Paola is understood to have been turbulent at times, with the couple spending long spells living apart over the years and coming close to divorce in the past. The royal family will no doubt be hoping Ms Boël's statements both in and out of the Brussels courtroom - among the artist's creations is a sculpture comprising the words 'love' and 'child' separated by a heart topped with a crown - will not overshadow tomorrow's historic occasion. Belgium's political and social elite will gather to see the monarch sign a declaration of abdication and his son Prince Phillippe, 53, will be sworn in as Belgium's new king.","Artist Delphine Boël, 45, insists she is the daughter of Albert II of Belgium .

The mother of TV pitchman Don Lapre, who reportedly committed suicide in his jail cell days before he was due to stand trial for massive fraud, has claimed prison official's had taken her son's anti-depressant medication away. Shirley Cleveland said her 47-year-old son, who was found dead in his prison cell in Florence, Arizona, on Sunday, was being treated for severe depression before he was arrested for allegedly defrauding 220,000 people of $52million. Lapre, the self-proclaimed 'King of Infomercials,' had attempted suicide in the past, Ms Cleveland told TMZ. Scroll down for video . Dead: Don Lapre, 47, of Phoenix, Arizona, was charged with running a nationwide scheme to sell essentially worthless Internet-based businesses . When she learned prison guards in . Florence, Arizona, had taken his medication away she called his lawyer . and pleaded for her to intervene, Ms Cleveland told the site. Lapre's mother said the jail gave him another medicine, but it did not treat his depression. TMZ also reported that Ms Cleveland insisted her son, a father of two, was innocent of all charges. Lapre . was awaiting a trial after being indicted on 41 charges stemming from a . nationwide scheme to sell what was billed as 'The Greatest Vitamin in . the World.' Federal . prosecutors alleged that 226,794 people were promised lucrative . commission checks for selling vitamins and recruiting others to the . business, but said it was a worthless venture for most who signed up. The federal grand jury indictment, made public in June, revealed that that the internet-based businesses had lost investors an estimated $51.8million. Needed medication: Lapre's mother said her jail officials took her son's anti-depressants off him . Infomercial king: He was found dead in his cell at a prison in Florence, Arizona, on Sunday - just two days before his trial was due to begin on Tuesday . Tragic: Don Lapre, 47, was found dead in his Arizona jail cell on Sunday . The U.S. Marshals Service confirmed he . died in an apparent suicide while in federal custody but the death . remains under investigation. However there was a 'large amount of . blood' in the cell where he was found and so it appears he cut himself, . law enforcement sources told TMZ. A grand jury had indicted him on counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud and promotional money laundering. When Lapre failed to arrive for his . arraignment that month a warrant was issued for his arrest and he was discovered less than 24 hours later. Authorities . found him in a gym with a cut in his groin and they believed at the . time he had attempted suicide by trying to slice his femoral artery. Last week, Lapre's attorney filed a . motion at U.S. District Court in Phoenix seeking to get him released . from jail pending his trial, scheduled for next year, the Arizona . Republic reported. The . motion said that Lapre was no longer a flight risk and would have access . to a psychologist to monitor his medication and mental status. Jokes: David Spade's impression of Don Lapre on Saturday Night Live . 'I . can't tell you what his state of mind was,' Patricia Gitre, Lapre's . attorney, told the Arizona Republic 'It was a difficult time for him, . obviously.' The charges carried potential fines of . between $250,000 and $500,000 per count and federal prison terms of . between five and 25 years. The company said it would support the . hundreds of thousands of people it recruited to start up online . businesses selling vitamins. But investors were allegedly misled as the company tried to get them to purchase additional advertising and other services. Lapre was known for his emphatic . salesman style but the company was shut down in 2007 after customers . filed hundreds of complaints. Meanwhile he was personally paid more than $2.2million from the business between 2004 and 2007, the indictment said. Lapre was known for his television appearances on shows such as 'Making Money From A Tiny One Bedroom Apartment'. The pitchman, who referred to himself . on his website as 'The King of Infomercials', would recount his . hard-luck life story to viewers. He encouraged them to turn their lives . around like he had and is notorious for claiming he made $50,000 a week . from his one bedroom apartment. It was widely parodied - notably by David Spade on Saturday Night Live. In a rambling note on his website, Lapre said he did nothing wrong. 'I did not have the perfect company, but never once did I allow one thing to be done that would violate any law,' he wrote on donlapre.com. 'Nevertheless, because the majority of people did not make money ... I am left to fight a battle that will for sure destroy what energy I have left inside.'

"By . Fiona Macrae . It seems that men and women can't agree – even when asleep. A study of dreams found that even in the dead of night, the sexes are thinking about different things. While men have nightmares about fires, floods, wars and other disasters, women are jolted awake by thoughts about rows, lies and infidelity. Canadian researchers asked more than 300 men and women to write down the content of their dreams on waking each morning for up to five weeks. Researchers found men dream of fires, wars and disasters while women think about lies, rows and infidelity . They then zeroed in on nightmares – in which the person woke up mid-dream – and bad dreams, which while still disturbing were less intense. Diary entries on nightmares were longer than those for bad dreams and women wrote longer descriptions of their bad dreams than men. Nightmares were dominated with scenes of physical aggression, including kidnappings and murders.  Rows and fights, humiliation, infidelity and other forms of 'interpersonal conflict' formed the second most common theme. Feelings of failure and helplessness, including being late or lost, were also common, as were nightmares in which the dreamer became ill or died. Many also jolted awake after believing they could see or feel the presence of an evil force such as a monster, alien, vampire or ghost. The men studied were twice as likely to have nightmares or bad dreams about disasters. They were also plagued by images of infestations of insects. Diary entries on nightmares were longer than those for bad dreams and women wrote longer descriptions of their bad dreams than men . The women, in contrast, were more likely to have nightmares about rows, broken friendships and relationship fears, including infidelity. The study's authors, from the University of Montreal, said: 'Dreams of interpersonal conflicts may elicit a more intense emotional response thin women, leading to a greater proportion of such dreams ending in a nightmare awakening.' Writing in the journal Sleep, they added that their research is especially informative, as it used diary entries rather than tick list-type questionnaires to log the content of people's dreams. It is thought that everyone dreams.  Most people forget them straight away but heavy sleepers have better recall. Researcher Antonio Zadra said that nightmares can have serious consequences for health. He said: 'Nightmares are not a disease in themselves but can be a problem for the individual who anticipates them or who is greatly distressed by their nightmares. 'People who have frequent nightmares may fear falling asleep – and being plunged into their worst dreams. 'Some nightmares occur every night. 'People who are awakened by their nightmares cannot get back to sleep, which creates artificial insomnia.'","Canadian researchers surveyed more than 300 men and women .

These are the kind of dreams that top 'bucket lists', catalogues of experiences we want to achieve before we 'kick the bucket'. But it isn't just humans that have dreams to realise and goals to achieve: man's best friend does too. Besotted pet owners from across the country have, along with a group of dog behaviour experts, created a 'bucket list' detailing the 50 must-do experiences for every cool canine. Flopping in front of a roaring fire came top of the bucket list for dogs . Doing the 'Beethoven shake' and riding in a car should be experienced by every dog at least once in their lifetime . The achievements range from the lavish . (having a personalised kennel, staying in a boutique dog hotel), and the . loving (appearing in the family portrait, having a Christmas stocking), . to the more unusual (becoming an internet star and being a ring bearer at a . wedding, a task performed by Peaches Geldof's golden retreiver Parpy at her recent nuptials to Tom Cohen) and the downright ordinary (swimming in the sea, riding in a . car). With such an extensive list to complete, most of Britain's pooches have pawed their way through just a small number of the must-do items. In fact, a howling one in 12 adult dogs have not experienced any of the 50 activities, while just seven per cent have completed the bucket list in its entirety. Why should humans have all the fun, eh? So insurance company MORE TH>N, who commissioned the list, has created an app to help dogs and their owners find the best places to start ticking off their must-dos around the UK. The most basic of canine and companion . pleasures have seen a woefully low completion rate across the country. Some 20 per cent of dogs never having had the pleasure of bounding . through a forest. And over a quarter (26 per cent) never knowing what . it's like to attend a family picnic. Looking across the nation, it would seem that itâ€™s in-land areas that are home to the most quest-driven pups and owners, as more West Midlands dogs have completed the bucket list than any others (11 per cent). Chomping at their heels are dogs in the flat lands of East Anglia (10 per cent), while the four-legged friends that call the capital home take a respectable third place in the enrichment stakes (nine per cent). Talking about the campaign and the research findings, TV vet Marc Abraham said, 'Make no mistake about it, we're a nation of dog-lovers, but it seems a lot of owners have become stuck in a rut.

"By . Ashley Collman . An LAPD officer may have mistook a fellow officer's 'bean bag' shotgun for real gunfire when he shot a Corvette driver dead live on TV. Brian Beaird, 51, led police on an hour-long high-speed chase through the streets of Los Angeles last night but died from a gunshot wound after crashing his silver Corvette and trying to escape on foot. Video captured the moment when Beaird seemed to speed through a red light and crashed into the back half of a Nissan Maxima. LAPD is now investigating claims that when one officer fired a non-lethal 'bean bag' round, another mistook it for gunfire and used a real weapon. Scroll down to see the dramatic chase and crash: . The end of the road: The driver pictured escaping this totaled silver Corvette was fatally shot by police after leading them on a high-speed chase through Los Angeles Friday night . 'The suspect got out of the vehicle and at that point, something occurred that prompted the officer-involved shooting,' Lt Neiman said. When the car chase was broadcast live by KTLA-TV, video showed the man getting out of his car, running around the back of the Corvette and heading up East Olympic Blvd before being shot, clutching his stomach and falling to the ground. Lt Neiman says there was 'great concern that he was going to hurt someone severely'. LAPD Cmdr. Alexander Smith told 10news: . 'Policy dictates that the officer using the non-lethal bean bag shotgun . notify other officers so they don't think lethal force is being used'. He added that part of the investigation will be whether verbal warning was given. Beaird's brother John said during the chase, Beaird called his father asking, 'Why are they after me? I didn't do anything.' Officers from three police agencies tailed the man for more than an hour on Friday night starting at 9pm when police in South Gate attempted to pull him over for reckless driving and a possible DUI. Won't stop: The car chase started around 9pm in South Gate when police tried to pull over the unidentified driver of this silver Corvette for reckless driving and a possible DUI . Tracking: When the man refused to yield, police pursued the vehicle as it made its way through the streets of Los Angeles for more than an hour . When the driver refused to pull over, police followed him in cars and with a helicopter as he spend through Cudahy, Huntington Park, South Gate, Walnut Park and into South Los Angeles. Sky9's Meghan Reyes reported that the man was often driving without his headlights on and 'just driving in circles'. The man's corvette was also outfitted with special tires that resisted puncture when police tried to use a spike strip to stop him. Crash: The Corvette's tires were impervious to police spike strips so it was only when he rammed into another car that the chase came to a halt at the intersection of Olympic Boulevard and Los Angeles Street . Damages: The T-bone crash sent the other car barreling into a fire hydrant which sent water shooting into the air and spilling out onto the street . The chase finally came to an end around 10:30pm when he sped through a light and hit another driver crossing the intersection in front of him in a T-bone collision. The corvette spun all the way around before stopping on the side of the road at the intersection of South Los Angeles St and East Olympic Blvd. The other car was thrown into a fire hydrant which sent water shooting into the air and spilling onto the street. Police say the other driver was treated for non-life threatening injuries. On foot: After the crash, the DUI suspect tries to drive his totaled car but crashes it into a telephone pole while backing up and it won't move. He is then seen getting out of the car . Taken out: When broadcast live, the man was seen running around the back of his car before being shot by police, clutching his stomach and falling over on the sidewalk . Beaird attempted to back up his Corvette and continue driving but rammed into a light post and couldn't get the car to move. He stumbled out of the vehicle and attempted to run down East Olympic Blvd before being shot by police and crumpling over. CBS 2's Melanie Woodrow was at the scene, and reported seeing paramedics doing 'vigorous' chest compressions on the driver. His death was not confirmed until early Saturday morning.","Brian Beaird led police on an hour-long speed chase through Los Angeles .

"By . Jenny Hope . Hope: High doses of vitamin E could help people with Alzheimer's retain their independence for longer, claim researchers. (Stock image) High doses of vitamin E could help people with Alzheimer’s retain their independence for longer, claim researchers. A new trial showed that daily supplements slowed the functional decline of patients by around six months. It meant they could do everyday activities such as cooking, washing and shopping for longer than  those who did not take a dose. The benefits were also felt by those looking after them as time spent  in caring duties dropped by two hours a day. Professor Kenneth Davis, a US expert on brain disease who was involved in the study, said the trial showed that vitamin E should be offered to patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s. However, experts in Britain responded cautiously to the findings, warning about the dangers of ‘megadoses’ of the vitamin. Previous research has indicated a link with higher death rates but the latest study raised no such concerns. The US researchers, led by Dr Maurice Dysken, treated 613 patients, mostly men, with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s. All of them were already receiving medication for their symptoms. One group of 152 patients received a daily dose of 2,000 international units – which equates to more  than 1,300g – of alpha tocopherol, a form of vitamin E. Others received either a placebo pill, the Alzheimer’s drug memantine, or a combination of vitamin E and memantine. Over a period of 2.3 years, patients who took the supplements alone had an annual 19 per cent reduction in the extent to which Alzheimer’s affected their daily lives compared with the placebo group. The effect amounted to a  ‘clinically meaningful’ delay of  6.2 months in a worsening ability  to deal with daily activities such  as shopping, preparing meals  and travelling, says a report in  the Journal of the American Medical Association. Neither the drug nor a combination of memantine and vitamin E were as beneficial. The annual death rate for supplement users was 7.3 per cent  compared with 9.4 per cent for those taking a placebo. The change in functional decline was assessed using an internationally recognised scale that rates patients from  zero to 78. Compared with those taking vitamin E, the group taking dummy pills lost three or more units  on average. ‘A loss of this magnitude could translate into either the complete loss of being able to dress or bath independently, for example,’ said Dr Dysken, who described the supplement as a cost-effective treatment for Alzheimer’s. New lease of life: The treatment meant dementia sufferers could do everyday activities such as cooking, washing and shopping for longer than  those who did not take a dose. (Stock image for illustrative purposes) Vitamin E is an antioxidant that slows down processes that damage cells and in Britain the recommended daily amount is 12mg. The  upper ‘safe’ limit is between 700 and 800mg a day, while those in the study took almost twice as much. Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, sounded a word of warning. ‘This study does not report negative side effects from vitamin E treatment, but concerns have been raised from previous studies that high doses of vitamin E could have health risks,’ he said. ‘The trial shows some inconsistencies in the effects seen between each treatment group and the population studied was almost exclusively male. ‘It will be important for these findings to be replicated in larger, more balanced study groups. Until the findings from this trial have been replicated, we would not encourage people to take high doses of  vitamin E supplements to try to prevent or treat Alzheimer’s.’ Dr Doug Brown, director of research and development at the Alzheimer’s Society, said it was important for patients to seek advice from their doctor before considering taking supplements. ‘In this instance, the dosage of vitamin E taken by participants was much higher than the recommended daily allowance and was at a level that could be significantly harmful for some,’ he said. ‘While this study into the link between vitamin E intake and reduction in functional decline is of interest, it is by no means conclusive. More research is needed to see if vitamin E really does have benefits for people with dementia, and whether it would be safe to be taking such a high dose on a daily basis.’","U.S. experts says findings show the vitamin should be offered to patients .

"By . Ruth Styles . From the formidable looking Jeanne Granier, a French actress and soprano, to the winsome Gabrielle Réjane, the opera stars of the Victorian era were just as glamorous as the divas of today. The pair appear in a collection of more than 200 vintage photos newly released by the Royal Opera House, all of which date from the late Victorian and Edwardian periods. Other stars to appear in the collection, amassed by Gwladys Robinson, Lady de Grey, include Ernest Van Dyck, a Belgian tenor who died in 1923, and Félicia Mallet, a popular French comedian, singer and mime artist.

Many of the photos are signed and include personal dedications to Lady de Grey, later Marchioness Ripon, a long standing supporter of the Royal Opera House who enjoyed friendships with many of the era’s leading names and died in 1917. Lady de Grey was also partly behind the decision to rename what had been known as the Royal Italian Opera to the Royal Opera House in 1892 following a controversy over whether operas in languages other than Italian should be introduced.

They were and thereafter, opera-goers were treated to performances in French and German as well as English, and the chance to see some of Europe’s most celebrated stars perform. Among them were L’Enfant Prodigue [The Prodigal Son], which featured a score written by Claude Debussy, and a version of Aristophanes’ comedy Lysistrata featuring the beautiful Gabrielle Réjane in the title role. For fans of German opera, there were productions of Parsifal, Wagner’s lengthy epic based on the story of Percival, an Arthurian knight on a quest for the Holy Grail.

At the same time, the owners of the Royal Opera House chose to broaden its output to include ballet and pantomime, both of which still appear at the Covent Garden venue today. And it seems modern audiences haven’t lost their taste for the European operas pioneered by Lady de Grey and her friends. Later this year, the Royal Opera House will welcome a production of Die Frau ohne Schatten [The Woman Without A Shadow], a Strauss opera first performed in 1919 and still loved by audiences today.

"By . Ted Thornhill . There are still dangerously high radiation levels at Japan’s crippled Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear reactor – but now the plant’s owner is able to see the normally invisible threat. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has created a prototype ‘Super-wide Angle Compton Camera’ capable of creating images of gamma ray-emitting radioactive particles. This equipment is based on the gamma ray-observing sensor technology to be added to the agency’s next X-ray observation satellite, ASTRO-H. Radiation-seeker: The Super-wide Angle Compton Camera is capable of creating images of gamma ray-emitting particles . It is expected to be able to create visual images of radioactive particles that have collected at high altitudes such as building roofs where it is difficult to conduct measurements with existing equipment. It can also detect particles that have widely dispersed on the ground and residential houses. Last month  JAXA, the Japan Atomic Energy Agency and the plant’s owner, the Tokyo Electric Power Company conducted a successful field test of the camera at the Kusano area of Iitate village in Fukushima Prefecture. Threat assessment: Fukushima workers will be able to use the camera to pinpoint the normally invisible threat . The camera was developed for the agency¿s next X-ray observation satellite, ASTRO-H . The Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan triggered was triggered by a giant tsunami . Radioactive contamination from the Fukushima power plant disaster has been detected in the Pacific Ocean more than 370 miles off the Japanese coast. Samples of plants, plankton and ocean water showed levels of the liquid metal caesium were almost 1,000 times greater than normal. But although the readings, taken three months after the meltdown in March last year, were high radiation risks are only a tenth of those generally considered harmful to marine animals and human consumers. Dr Ken Buesseler, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, and colleagues said radioactive elements were detected in zoop . At the moment there is still fatally high radiation levels at the plant and much less water to cool it than officials had thought, according to an internal examination. The news has renewed doubts about the plant's stability and provoked fears the other two reactors that had meltdowns could be in even worse shape. A tool equipped with a tiny video camera, a thermometer, a dosimeter and a water gauge was used to assess damage inside the No. 2 reactor's containment chamber for the second time since the tsunami swept into the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant a year ago. The No. 2 reactor is the only one officials have been able to closely examine so far. The data collected showed the damage from the disaster is so severe, the plant operator will have to develop special equipment and technology to tolerate the harsh environment and decommission the plant, a process expected to last decades.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It's a case that, according to the IRS, is very black and white. The Michael Jackson Estate is accused of cheating taxpayers out of millions of dollars by allegedly undervaluing the wealth of the late pop great - and has been hit with a penalty of more than $702 million. New legal documents filed with the U.S. Tax Court in Washington, which were obtained by the L.A. Times, say that after Jackson died in June 2009, the executors of his estate valued the singers net worth at around $7 million. However the IRS are disputing the figure and claim MJ is actually worth $1.125 billion. According to legal documents obtained by the L.A. Times, the executors of Michael Jackson's estate valued the singers net worth at $7 million after he died in June 2009. The IRS now says the net worth was actually $1.125 billion . Much of Michael Jackson's memorabilia was sold at auction following his death, injecting millions into his estate . At the center of the IRS dispute is the value of Michael Jackson's 'likeness', or how his estate will make from companies and products using his image on merchandise, TV commercials, etc . As a result the agency has told executors that the estate owes $505 million in taxes and an additional $197 million in fines. Jackson's return was so inaccurate, the IRS said, that it qualified for a gross valuation misstatement penalty, which would allow the government to double the usual 20 per cent penalty for underpayment. Most of the dispute is centered around the value of Jackson's image, such as branded T-shirts, merchandise and using his likeness in television commercials. It also looks at the interest of a trust that includes the rights to some of his music and most of the Beatles catalogue, such as songs Yesterday, Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Get Back. The estate valued Jackson's likeness at just $2,105. But, stunningly, the IRS put it at $434.264 million. The estate put the value of the pop star's interest in the trust that owns the Beatles' and Jackson's songs at zero. The IRS put it at $469 million.

A general view of the train station at Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch in Los Olivos, California . One of two signs that mark the grand entrance to the Neverland grounds . The IRS also said Jackson's interest in another trust was worth $60.6 million, not $2.2 million, as the estate claimed. Tax experts said the Jackson estate would have hired appraisers to determine how much his assets were worth at the time of his death, including his likeness. However, with few estates valuable enough to have to file with the IRS, Jackson's worth is generally hard to measure. 'This is something unusual,' Andrew Katzenstein, an estate tax expert at the law firm Proskauer Rose, told the L.A. Times. 'He was one of the premier entertainers of our time. So there are really no comparables, and it leaves the valuation question open to a huge range of possibilities.' The Jackson estate would like have argued that, before he died, the singer had neither toured nor released a CD for several years, and his public image had been severely damaged by allegations of child molestation. Tax court documents show that Jackson had three Rolls-Royces and a 2001 Bentley Arnage that the IRS said were worth $250,000, not the $91,600 the estate placed on them . Michael Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest . A host of Michael Jackson memorabilia went on display at the O2 Bubble in London in October 2009 . This would have had a major effect on endorsement deals and whether companies would have waned to be aligned with the Jackson brand. But since his death, Jackson's music has had a renaissance. The estate had earned $475 million, according to a court filing in July 2012. Forbes magazine reported in October 2013 that Jackson was the highest-paid celebrity that year — dead or alive — earning $160 million. Much of the money, according to Forbes, came from two Cirque du Soleil shows based on Jackson's music, one at Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and another that tours the world. The tax court documents show that Jackson had three Rolls-Royces and a 2001 Bentley Arnage that the IRS said were worth $250,000, not the $91,600 the estate placed on them. The IRS also found other automobiles, saying that 'tangible personal property including vehicles not reported otherwise' were worth $47.467 million, instead of the $0 the estate reported. As the case unfolds in court, the Jackson estate may pay off its taxes by selling assets or asking the IRS if it could pay over 15 years.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . 2013 was a turbulent year for Francois Hollande. The French president's country has veered from crisis to crisis - with unemployment hitting 3.29million in December and the economy falling by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter of this year. Mr Hollande's proposal to introduce a top tax rate of 75 per cent has seen thousands taking to the streets in protest and - perhaps most damning of all - in recent polls he was slammed as the most unpopular presidents in recent history. And, if these pictures are anything to go by, it would seem Mr Hollande's lack of popularity has spread from his people to those in the public eye.

Desperate families still wait for news of the about 18 people still unaccounted for after a massive mudslide in rural northwest Washington state killed at least three people and forced evacuations because of fears of flooding, authorities said on Sunday. Snohomish County Fire District 21 Chief Travis Hots said at a news briefing that 'we suspect that people are out there, but it's far too dangerous to get responders out there on that mudflow.'

Also named by their families are Summer Raffo, who may have been trapped in her vehicle. 52-year-old husband, father, and grandfather Steve Neal is also unaccounted for. Authorities are also trying to determine how to get responders on the ground safely, Hots said, calling it as 'like quicksand.'

Several people - including an infant - were critically injured and as many as 30 houses were destroyed. The slide wiped out one neighborhood, where there were about 28 to 30 homes, authorities said.

Rescuers couldn't hear any signs of life once they got closer, and the decision was made to back out due to safety reasons, Hots said. The slide blocked the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River, which prompted an evacuation notice because water was rising rapidly behind the debris. Authorities worried about severe downstream flooding if water suddenly broke through the debris. Authorities said Sunday that residents could return home during daylight hours. The Snohomish County sheriff's office reported that two people had been killed at the scene. Authorities later said one of the people who had been rescued died at a hospital.

People who live in the North Fork's flood plain, from the small communities of Oso to Stanwood, were urged to flee to higher ground. Forecasters warned that flooding was also possible north of the slide area. The Weather Service said 'catastrophic flooding' was unlikely downstream, but authorities were taking no chances and urged people to leave. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee also proclaimed a state of emergency. He planned to visit the scene on Sunday. Pouring: Heavy rain over this past week likely contributed to the mudslide .

Bart Treece, spokesman for the Washington State Department of Transportation, said he didn't know how long the two-lane rural road would be closed. Drivers were advised to find another way to get between Darrington and Arlington, he said. Authorities believe the slide was caused by groundwater saturation from recent heavy rainfall. Pennington said the area has a history of unstable land. He said a slide also happened there in 2006. Pennington said Saturday's slide happened without warning.

"By . Emma Reynolds . These unsettling images show the skulls and wax-covered heads of Italian criminals lined up on shelves, some identified with labels that read 'thief' or 'murderer'. The macabre display at a museum in Turin, Italy, is the result of 19th-century physician and psychiatrist Cesare Lombroso's research on criminality. Many of the body parts were taken from prisons without the permission of family members. Inside the head of a criminal: Hundreds of skulls, some covered in wax, line the shelves at the museum . Guilt: Many of the wax faces in Cesar Lombroso's collection are labelled with their crime. Right, 'Killer of a wife' Now, hundreds of years later, some of the criminal's descendants and local communities are saying it is time to get the body parts back. Lombroso's work on criminal behaviour, now discredited, is nevertheless described by the Science Museum as laying the foundations for modern criminology. He moved away from the nature of the crime towards the individual's motivation and habits. In 1862, he began anthropometric measurements of 3,000 soldiers, gradually becoming interested in psychiatry and criminal anthropology. His 1876 book Criminal Man argued that some people were born criminals - it claimed they were ‘atavistic’, or throwbacks to a primitive stage of evolution. Lombroso believed ‘primitiveness’ could be read from the bodies and habits of such born criminals - for instance, facial features, body type and tattooing, which he saw as a particular sign of criminality. Lombroso's work on criminal behaviour, now discredited, involved taking anthropometric measurements . Bizarre: A wax-covered head with a tag reading 'Forger', left, and tools used for the theft, right . Death row: Many of the skulls on display in Turin were taken from jails without the family's permission . This emphasis on external marks and ‘primitiveness’ was part of a broader movement in the late 1800s, which believed biology and inheritance explained human behaviour. A great worry was that European ‘races’ were degenerating - slipping back to an earlier stage of evolution. From 1866 onwards, the year in which Lombroso began to work as a military doctor, he collected skulls, skeletons, brains and various other types of objects, which formed the core collection of a private museum, first housed at his home in Turin. To the collection of skulls of soldiers and civilians from all the various regions in Italy, he soon added craniums from far-off lands, and even those of criminals and madmen, which he collected in prisons and asylums. Strange: Lombroso believed some people were born criminals and had 'primitive' qualities . 'Throwback': Lombroso said criminality could be read in a face.

"By . Anna Edwards . Militants sewed a bomb into the stomach of a Central Reserve Police Force officer, hoping it would detonate once touched. In the latest bloody row between Naxalites and police, the improvised explosive device (IED) during an autopsy was discovered by doctors at a government hospital in Ranchi. Doctors conducting the autopsy of the CRPF officer, who was killed in Jharkhand's Latehar district, found a 1.5 kg unexploded bomb stitched inside the abdomen of Constable Babulal Patel. Bloody row: The Central Reserve Police Force have been battling with the Naxalites as the militants fight for land . The 29-year-old was among those killed in an ambush with Naxals three days earlier, the Times of India reported. Doctors became suspicious when they discovered the body, which was killed along with eight other CRPF personnel, one personnel from the state's special anti-Naxal force 'Jharkhand Jaguars' and three civilians in the clash. Mr Patel's body, which had to be inspected by bomb squad in an open field, contained an IED that exploded on being disturbed. The latest gruesome act by Naxalites followed a grisly protest in Latehar. Pictured, the Communist Party of India Maoists train to fight the government's military. The militants have been accused of sewing a bomb into an officer's abdomen . The Indian government has described the guerrillas as the country's most serious internal security threat . On Monday the militants, who have been clashing with police over land disputes since 1967, draped the body of a critically injured and incapacitated constable over a landmine. The next day the body was discovered in Karmatiya jungle by innocent villagers who died when they picked the body up and the bomb detonated. About 600 Maoists are suspected to be hiding in the jungles moving between Bihar and Jharkhand. The most recent grouping of Naxalites, known formally as the Communist Party of India (Maoist) (CPI-M), was born in 2004 when two left-wing groups merged together. It is unclear how many fighters, and how organised the groups in different states are. Figures suggest that out of India's 28 states, 16 â€“ mostly in the east and the centre â€“ have some group activity based there. The bitter row between Naxalites and police stems from conflict over land. The term Naxalites comes from Naxalbari, a small village in West Bengal. It was here that a section of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) started a violent uprising in May 1967. One group wanted to to redistribute land to the landless, using force if necessary. Soon after the declaration,  a sharecropper near Naxalbari village was attacked by a landlord's men over a land dispute. On May 24, when a police team arrived to arrest the peasant leaders, it was ambushed by a group of tribals and a police inspector was killed in a hail of arrows. From here, tribals and peasants supported the movement to start claiming land and start attacking local landlords. This conflict spiralled when terms set out in the India's Constitution's Schedules, which tried to limit what landlords could own, were not honoured. Zedong supported the movement, believing that Indian peasants and lower class tribals overthrow the government and upper classes by force.","Doctors discover 1.5kg bomb in Jharkhnd's Latehar district .

"By . Sophie Borland . and Michael Seamark . More than 800 patients suspected of having cancer were discharged from a  hospital by mistake. At least two of them died and a further 121 may have suffered life-threatening delays in diagnosis or treatment. A major probe has been launched into how the clerical errors went undetected for three years. MPs say they want managers at West Hertfordshire NHS trust to be held to account. It emerged last night that the man who was in charge at the time quit the Health Service just as the problems were coming to light. Two managers have been suspended after a hospital trust admitted discharging hundreds of suspected cancer patients by mistake. West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust said at least one person might have died as a result of the errors and 121 patients are yet to have their cases reviewed . Jan Filochowski, who had moved on to Great Ormond Street, suddenly left the London hospital in December, saying he wanted to pursue ‘other opportunities’. He takes with him a £3million taxpayer-funded pension pot. The mistakes affected 810 patients urgently referred to the West Hertfordshire trust for tests between 2010 and 2013 because their GP feared they had cancer. None turned up for their initial examinations however, possibly because they did not receive appointment letters. Given the urgency of their cases, staff should have contacted them immediately to arrange another slot. Instead, it is thought they were removed from the computer system with no further action taken. The blunders made some patients wait several weeks for diagnosis – with fatal results in two cases. Jan Filochowski, who had moved on to Great Ormond Street, suddenly left the London hospital in December, saying he wanted to pursue 'other opportunities' A review by the trust, which runs Watford, St Albans and Hemel Hempstead hospitals, found that 686 people were not harmed by the delays. It is investigating other 121 cases and speaking to doctors and relatives. The mistakes came to light in November when Samantha Jones, who took over from Mr Filochowski as chief executive last February, asked for a review of the system for booking cancer appointments. A few weeks later, Mr Filochowski, 62, announced he was going to retire just a year into his Great Ormond Street posting. The married father of two gave up a £280,000 annual salary, saying he wanted to focus on NHS consultancy and business books. He was handed a retirement lump sum payment of £412,000 on top of his £140,000-a-year pension – one of the most generous in the public sector. The mistakes came to light in November when Samantha Jones, who took over from Mr Filochowski as chief executive last February, asked for a review of the system for booking cancer appointments . Miss Jones said: ‘It is absolutely clear that the trust was not always following the correct administrative processes for these patients and we let them down. ‘These concerns date back a number of years and were identified as part of the new management team’s commitment to improve the way we administer and manage patient care. ‘I would like to apologise to each and every patient who has been affected and particularly to the relatives of those who have since died. ‘We have of course made significant changes to help prevent this ever happening again and will share the outcome of our investigations with those affected and with the wider public.’ A spokesman for the trust refused to comment on whether Mr Filochowski was at fault – but confirmed that two managers had been suspended. Richard Harrington, Tory MP for Watford, said: ‘There is absolutely no doubt that the trust’s failure to follow the correct administrative process for urgent referrals is unacceptable, and deeply wrong.’ He has written a statement with four other local MPs calling for proper accountability of senior bosses once the investigation has finished. Anne Main, Tory MP for St Albans, said: ‘This is an extremely worrying situation which may have health implications for my constituents. 'Frankly, the public deserve better when it comes to the NHS.’ A spokesman for the West Hertfordshire trust could not explain why the patients had not turned up for their appointments. He said in some cases letters may have been lost in the post, others may not have been told of the urgency by their GP, while others may have just forgotten to attend. An investigation has since been launched – overseen by Stephen Ramsden, of the Putting Patients First campaign – which will try to establish exactly how many people were affected. Speaking from his £1.3million home in Islington, North London, last night Mr Filochowski said: ‘I’m not prepared to comment having no knowledge about the issues and it being some time since I left the trust. I will try to find something out about this.’ There is widespread evidence that cancer patients in Britain are less likely to survive than those elsewhere in Europe due to delays in diagnosis and treatment.","A further 121 may have suffered life-threatening delays in diagnosis .

Disgusting: A homophobic family in New Jersey has refused to tip a gay marine-turned-waitress, scrawling on the check, pictured, that they 'do not agree with her lifestyle' Morales said the judgement began as soon as she introduced herself to the family. The mother, shocked by her short hair, allegedly exclaimed, 'Oh, I thought you were gonna say your name is Dan! You sure surprised us!' But it got worse when, after the family had paid the $93.55 check, she discovered they had left a note on the receipt. 'Sorry, I cannot tip because I do not agree with your lifestyle and the way you live your life,' the comment read. In an email, Morales said she was upset she'd served in the marines to protect such ignorant Americans and was concerned about the example the couple were setting for their children.

I feel sorry for their kids.' Morales later responded that it took every fiber of her being not to spit in the couple's food, but her faith in humanity was now restored.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . One in four Britons plan on sending a racy message or explicit photo to their partner before Valentine's day . As Valentine’s Day approaches, a study has revealed that one in four Britons will be sending a racy message or explicit photo to their partner. But lovers may want to think twice before hitting send on intimate content, according to one internet security provider, which says that many phones containing sexual content are insecure. New research reveals that just over half of adults who have exchanged intimate or sexually explicit content still have it stored on their mobile device, despite the fact that one in three do not even have the most basic password protection on their smartphones. Of those that do have protection, just over 40 per cent use the same details for multiple internet connected devices, increasing the likelihood these devices will be hacked. Shockingly, the U.S. version of the study also revealed that 16 per cent of Americans have sent a sext to a stranger, increasing the risk of reputational ruin. One in three people in the UK share personal passwords with a spouse or significant other. However despite this trust, almost half of those surveyed confessed to logging in to their partners’ social or app profiles and using their password to snoop on the photos and messages being exchanged. 'In this era of the ""always on"" consumer, the rules around privacy in dating have lost some social potency,' said Samantha Swift, Online Safety Expert at McAfee. Nearly half of those surveyed admitted to having rifled through a partner’s private online accounts. In an age when sharing content with thousands can take a matter of seconds, the risk of personal content leaking online has never been higher and whether a partner is trusted or not it’s vital to protect yourself and your devices,' she added.

One in three people in the UK share personal passwords (illustrated) with a spouse or significant other and 96 per cent trust their other half not to post intimate messages or sexts online . A U.S. study by the Californian security software firm found that while more than three quarters of sexts are sent to partners, 16 per cent of people have sent risqué material to a complete stranger. A quarter of those surveyed plan to send a racy message or explicit photo to their partner this Valentine's Day . 55% of people who have sent or received X-rated messages still have it stored on their mobile device, despite the fact that one in three don't have even basic password protection on their smartphones . The U.S. version of the study also revealed that 16 percent of Americans have sent a sext to a stranger. A third of people in the UK share personal passwords with a spouse or significant other and 96 per cent trust their other half not to post intimate messages or sexts online. But despite this trust, almost 50 per cent of those surveyed confessed to snooping on their partner's messages. Andy Jones, relationship expert and a former dating columnist said of the findings: 'We live in a risqué age, where celebrity sexting scandals are two a penny and snaps of private body parts go viral overnight. 'Behind every media leak, from Prince Harry’s infamous night in Vegas to Scarlett Johansson naked selfies, is a smartphone. 'We’re a generation living with digital baggage, whether you’re the victim of a hack or a vengeful lover, pictures leaked online last a lifetime. As a rule of thumb, if it’s something you wouldn’t want your family to see you probably shouldn’t share it!' Slightly fewer U.S. citizens (45 per cent) have stored racy pictures on their phones that their UK peers and approximately 70 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds have been sent a sext. Around a third of Americans do not protect their phone with a password. ‘Now, that's just asking for a social scandal,’ McAfee's Robert Siciliano wrote in a blog post. Furthermore, 40 per cent of Americans have also shared their bank details with a partner. New research reveals that 55 per cent of Britons who have sent or received intimate or sexually explicit content still have it stored on their mobile device - and many of them do not protect their device with a password leaving themselves open to embarrassment and upset if the pictures are released . While almost all of the 1,500 U.S. adults surveyed said they trust their significant other with intimate content they have sent, only a third have asked their partner to delete the information at the end of a relationship, raising the threat of a reputation sabotage by a vengeful ex. Gary Davis, vice president of McAfee consumer business, said: ‘With all the stories we’ve heard about intimate photos being leaked, it’s hard to believe people are still sharing their passwords.’ ‘Ultimately, they’re increasing the risks of these photos becoming public and possibly jeopardising their identity and reputation. Consumers must take precautions and use mobile security to ensure that what should be private stays private.’ The firm has advised people not to share passwords for their mobiles with others and to keep their content secure by avoiding using weak passwords that can be easily guessed, such as birthdays or numbers in a row. University students in committed relationships send and receive unwanted sexts out of necessity, a study claims . A study released before Christmas suggests that many racy photos and messages, known as sexts, are sent out of obligation to a partner, instead of for fun. Young people in committed relationships regularly send and receive unwanted sexts out of necessity and men are just as unenthusiastic about them as women, according to a study. U.S. scientists behind the study have dubbed the messages not sent for pleasure as ‘requisexts’. The research by Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne reveals that just as some couples go along with sex to please their partner or avoid an argument, the same is true of e-sex and sexts. It found 55 per cent of female participants admitted to sexting when not in the mood, while 48 per cent of men said they had done the same as a way to please a partner. The numbers are similar to a previous report about ‘compliant sexual activity’ which revealed that 55 per cent of U.S. women and 35 per cent of men had had sex to keep their partner happy when they weren’t feeling like it.","McAfee’s latest study found over half of Britons who have sent or .

The appointment spells the end of an exhaustive five-month search following Ballmer's resignation in August. Scroll Down for Video . Microsoft has officially named cloud-computing executive Satya Nadella, pictured, as its new CEO. Nadella, who has spent 22 years at the firm and was previously in charge of the tech giant's cloud software and services division, will replace exiting CEO Steve Ballmer . Nadella is a native of Hyderabad, India - where Microsoft has its largest non-U.S. research centre. Born in 1967 and educated in India and the United States, Nadella's tech career started at internet software pioneer Sun Microsystems. He joined Microsoft in 1992 and quickly climbed the corporate ladder with leading roles in the Office and Bing search-engine teams. He was promoted to run the company's server and tools unit in 2011. For the past seven months, he was the . executive vice president who led Microsoft's cloud computing offerings - . a new area for Microsoft, which has traditionally focused on software . installed on personal computers rather than on remote servers connected . to the internet. Nadella's group has been growing strongly, although it . remains a small part of Microsoft's current business. Experts say the move will signal a . focus on business users rather than consumers for the firm, which has . faced aggressive competition from Apple and Google for its software. Elsewhere, company founder Bill Gates is leaving his role as chairman to become technology adviser, and board member John Thompson will take his place. Nadella is only the third leader in the software giant's 38-year history, after Gates and Ballmer. Nadella, who is 46 and has worked at Microsoft for 22 years, has been an executive in some of the company's fastest-growing and most profitable businesses, including its Office and server and tools business. For the past seven months, he was the executive vice president who led Microsoft's cloud computing offerings - a new area for Microsoft, which has traditionally focused on software installed on personal computers rather than on remote servers connected to the internet. 'Satya is a proven leader with hard-core engineering skills, business vision and the ability to bring people together,' Gates said in a statement. 'His vision for how technology will be used and experienced around the world is exactly what Microsoft needs as the company enters its next chapter of expanded product innovation and growth.' The company said that Gates, in his new role as founder and technology advisor, 'will devote more time to the company, supporting Nadella in shaping technology and product direction.' Company founder Bill Gates, pictured, also announced he is leaving his role as chairman to become technology adviser, and board member John Thompson will take his place. There have been calls for months for Gates to step down from investors who believe Microsoft's co-founder is a block to radical change . The appointment of Nadella makes him . the most powerful Indian-born tech executive in the world and put him . alongside PepsiCo Inc's chief, Indra Nooyi, as the leader of a . well-known, large-cap U.S. corporation. Nadella's appointment comes at a time of turmoil for Microsoft. Founded . in April 1975 by Gates and Paul Allen, the company has always made . software that powered computers made by others - first with its MS-DOS . system, then with Windows and its Office productivity suite starting in . the late 1980s. But Microsoft has been late . adapting to developments in the technology industry. It allowed Google . to dominate in online search and advertising, and it watched as iPhones, . iPads and Android devices grew to siphon sales from the company's . strengths in personal computers. Its attempt to manufacture its own . devices has been littered with problems, from its quickly aborted Kin . line of phones to its still-unprofitable line of Surface tablets. Analysts see hope in some of the businesses Nadella had a key role in creating. Microsoft shares rose 32 cents to $36.80 (Â£22.58) in morning trading. Born . in 1967 and educated in India and the United States, Nadella's tech . career started at internet software pioneer Sun Microsystems. He joined .

That . unit now forms the backbone of Microsoft's cloud-computing platform, . which Nadella runs under his official title of executive vice president, . cloud and enterprise. Some . investors had campaigned for an external CEO who might be more likely . to shake up the company and reward shareholders with greater dividends . and share buybacks, but Parakh said that did not mean Nadella would be . unpopular with Wall Street. There have been calls for months for Gates to step down from investors who believe Microsoft's co-founder is a block to radical change and investor-friendly moves. Several people briefed on the CEO search process had previously told Reuters that Microsoft was down to a handful of candidates, including Nadella and Tony Bates, executive vice-president of business development, plus at least one external candidate. Analysts hope Nadella can maintain the company's momentum in the rapidly expanding field of cloud computing while minimizing the negative impact from Microsoft's unprofitable forays into consumer hardware.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Tiny bats in Central and South America use rolled-up leaves as ear trumpets to improve their hearing. Other than its use by humans, this is the first time this crafty technique has been seen in nature. The behaviour was observed in a species known as the Spix's disc-winged bats- distinguished by  suction cups on their thumbs and hind feet. Tiny bats in Central and South America use rolled-up leaves as ear trumpets to improve their hearing. Other than its use by humans, this is the first time this crafty technique has been seen in nature . These tiny bats can often be found nestled inside tapered, unfurling leaves of plants such as Heliconia or Calathea in groups of about five or six. Leaves of these plants only remain curled for around a day before they open up and the bats have to find a new home. To find where a group has moved to, Spix's disc-winged bats have a special social call. Bats on the outside of the leaves send an enquiry, while their friends send a response signal. The behaviour was observed in a species known as the Spix's disc-winged bats- distinguished by  suction cups on their thumbs and hind feet . Spix's disc-winged bats are distinguished by suction cups on their thumbs and hind feet which allow them to cling to smooth surfaces.They can be found in South America, and in countries including  Venezuela, Tobago, Trinidad, Brazil and Bolivia. They can often be found nestled inside tapered, unfurling leaves of plants such as Heliconia or Calathea. Leaves of these plants only remain curled for 24 hours before they open and the bats have to find a new home. While studying these bats, biologists Gloriana Chaverri and Erin Gillam from the University of Costa Rica in Golfito found that individuals inside the leaves were often unable to recognise calls made from their friends on the outside. They recreated the tapered leaf environment in a lab and found that the call emitted by flying bats was amplified to those inside the furled leaf. According to the researchers, the calls from outside the roost were amplified by as much as 10 decimals as sound waves were compressed down the tapered tubes- the same way an ear trumpet amplifies sound. But although flying bats almost always recognise their group members' response calls, bats inside a leaf seemed unable to tell the difference between the inquiry calls of friends and strangers. Chaverri claims this is because, as well as amplifying the sound, the leaf distorts incoming calls. She added that bats inside the leaves are likely to respond indiscriminately. The reason why bats can still find their group, claim scientists, is because the ‘response call’ is more complex and easier to identify, even if the quality of the sound is reduced by the leaves. The researchers now hope to study how characteristics of the leaf, such as length, width and plant species, affects sound transmission, and how bats may choose their roost because of this. According to the researchers, the calls from outside the roost were amplified by as much as 10 decimals as sound waves were compressed down the tapered tubes - the same way an ear trumpet amplifies sound .","Spix's disc-winged bats roost inside leaves of plants such as Heliconia .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It takes guts to appear on a reality show but even more so if that show is about weight and breaking into one of the most size-obsessed industries on the planet - dance. Hannah Baines, an 18-year-old business manager from Doncaster, is no stranger to hard knocks but refuses to let them stop her from pursuing her dream career in ballet. On the verge of giving up her dreams because she was deemed too fat to be a dancer, she says her appearance on Channel 4's Bigger Ballet proves once and for all that nothing should stand in the way of bigger girls desperate for a dancing career. Scroll down for video . Dancer: Hannah Baines, 18, has long dreamed of becoming a ballerina but her weight proved a problem . What's more, she adds, her role as Odette in the show's production of Swan Lake was a triumph in more ways than one; allowing her to finally beat the bullies who said she had no hope of becoming a dancer. 'I have danced since the age of three and I have always loved it,' she explained in an interview with the Mirror. 'It’s what I do, I live and breathe it, but I have always been bigger, which is my own fault because I like food too much.' Hannah, who is 5ft 3 and a size 18, added: 'I didn’t have a problem with my size when I was younger but when I got older I started going to dance competitions and people would laugh at me even though I was winning some contests. 'Getting laughed at for your dancing and size when you are so young made me feel horrible. It’s a terrible thing to do to a young girl.'

Cruising home: Co-star Carol used to dance for guests on cruise ships but has since let her ballet skills slide . Ballet has long been notorious for its emphasis on very slender dancers, with the average ballerina weighing somewhere between six and nine stone depending on height and muscle mass. Its looks-obsessed culture was excoriated in the 2010 film Black Swan which shone a light on the extreme lengths some dancers go to in order to remain slim, as well as the competitive pressure common to the genre. Those in the industry, however, say that the demand for slender dancers is not about glamourising very thin women; rather, the opposite. Speaking to industry title Pointe magazine in 2011, Peter Beal, artistic director of Pacific Northwest Ballet, said: 'This is a profession of athletes; it is a profession where we look so closely at the body. 'We enjoy looking at the body—healthy, beautiful bodies. Sometimes both the excess and the underweight are unappealing to look at. Childhood dream: Sarah, 38, from Leeds, danced as a child but regrets the decision to give it up . No nerves! Fellow plus size ballerina Emma Roby practices her pout backstage during Swan Lake . Ready for action: Hannah's co-star Carol gets ready to make her dance debut during Swan Lake . 'And I think dancers know that. I think they know when they’re in the zone. When they feel like athletes in peak performance condition. And that is the standard of the profession.' For Hannah, the jibes about her weight made her even more determined to succeed. 'Weirdly, it didn’t put me down, it made me want to be an even better dancer,' she reveals. Nevertheless, after being turned down for ballet school because, she believes, of her weight, she had almost given up on her dreams when the chance to be in Big Ballet came along. Taking the principle role of Odette was, she says, a dream come true and a vindication of the time and effort she has dedicated to dance. Twinkle toes: The cast show off their moves during a rehearsal for Swan Lake at St George's Hall in Bradford . Too short: 52-year-old Christine was deemed, at 4ft 11"" tall, too short to go to ballet school . 'It showed all the people who laughed at me that I can dance, I can do this.' she says. 'I loved every second of the performance.' Hannah, who has now applied for a dance course at the University of Manchester, adds: 'I felt really beautiful and it was such a liberating thing to do. 'The best part was right at the end when everyone was clapping and we got a standing ovation. It was just amazing.'

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Recreating life on Mars for two weeks in a Utah desert seems like child’s play compared to this project. Intrepid volunteers are currently getting prepared to live in Antarctica, one of the most hostile and remotest places on Earth. The Concodia team will be simulating life on Mars in the barren continent for nine months at an altitude of 3200 metres. Scroll down for video... Concordia research station in Antarctica is located on a plateau 3200 m above sea level. A place of extremes, temperatures can drop to ¿80°C in the winter, with a yearly average temperature of ¿50°C . Concordia is a joint French-Italian inland Antarctic research station run by the French Polar Institute and Italian Antarctic Programme. Every year it hosts a human research protocol coordinated by ESA. As Concordia lies at the very southern tip of Earth, the sun does not rise above the horizon in the winter and does not set in the summer. The altitude and location mean that the air in Concordia is very thin and holds less oxygen. Venturing outside the base requires wearing layers of clothes and limits the time spent outdoors. In addition, Concordia sits in the largest desert in the world. The air is extremely dry, so the crew suffer from continuously chapped lips and irritated eyes. No animals can survive in this region – even bacteria find it hard coping with the extreme temperatures. This means they’ll be living with a third less oxygen than is available at sea level. During the Antarctic winter, the crew will endure four months of complete darkness: the sun disappears from the beginning of May, and is not seen again until late August. Living in isolation with a European crew of 13 and in the world's most extreme environment creates an ideal opportunity to conduct research into the adaptation of human psychology and physiology. For the past summer months over 60 scientists and technicians have been working on research that can only be performed in the extremely cold, desolate desert of Antarctica. Wrapping up their work, aircraft are now ferrying equipment and people back to the coast where the weather is more agreeable. Once the sun sets below the horizon for four months in May, the region will really start to get cold. With temperatures reaching –80°C, fuel freezes and aircraft cannot land. Even bulldozers and other vehicles are stored unused in an underground shelter until the next summer. The altitude and location mean that the air in Concordia is very thin and holds less oxygen. Venturing outside the base requires wearing layers of clothes and limits the time spent outdoors . As Concordia lies at the very southern tip of Earth, the Sun does not rise above the horizon in the winter and does not set in the summer. The crew must live without sunlight for four months of the year . The core crew, the tenth team to spend winter at Concordia, will have to rely on their supplies for survival and their own legs to get around. Leaving the base to check on equipment or take snow samples is a hard enough undertaking in itself as multiple layers of clothing are required to keep warm and walking is strenuous owing to the lack of oxygen. Left to their own devices, the Concordia ‘DC10 crew’ have a few months to prepare for the onset of winter, cleaning the base and settling in to their habitat. Wrapping up their work, aircraft are ferrying equipment and people back to the coast where the weather is more agreeable . In the great open landscape covered in darkness, colours, smells and sounds are almost non-existent, adding to the sense of loneliness . Medical doctor Adrianos Golemis will be watching the crew and himself closely as their bodies and minds cope with the extreme isolation and environment. As a stand-in for a human outpost on another planet, ESA is researching crew behaviour and physiology in stressful environments. Unlike simulated isolation studies in other space analogues, the Concordia crew know that no one can help them for nine months – there is no quick exit back to civilisation. In the open landscape, colours, smells and sounds are almost non-existent, adding to the sense of loneliness . In a separate project to find out how humans would cope on Mars, an experiment organised by the Mars Society has attempted to recreate the daily routine of astronauts here on Earth. For two weeks in January, a group of intrepid space enthusiasts donned space suits and lived in isolation, surviving on rations and showering around once every three days. Among them was Elizabeth Howell, a University of North Dakota student, who heard about volunteers for the project through a fellow student. Speaking to MailOnline, she describes the unusual experiment as enlightening and at times overwhelming. ‘When I was in a spacesuit I felt like I was in an outside world,’ said Ms Howell. ‘It makes you think and behave differently.’ ‘There wasn’t much personal space,’ she said. ‘There were a couple of disagreements. Only little things, like noise in the kitchen when you have to work out what to do. We quickly found out that we need to talk about these things at the beginning.’ If an argument did occur, crew members couldn’t just step outside to cool off. Leaving the Habitat Module required a request to Mission Support a day in advance.","In just one week, the crew of Concordia will be left to their own devices .
They plan to conduct experiments in conditions similar to that of Mars .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Prince Charles and Prince William show off their language skills today in their first joint video appeal to help combat the illegal wildlife trade. The Royals decided their plea to save elephants, rhinos and tigers would be reinforced if they spoke directly to overseas nations where poachers kill endangered species for profit. So in the video, Prince Charles is heard for the first time speaking in Mandarin before using his Arabic and Spanish. Then his son speaks in Swahili and, more hesitantly, in novice Vietnamese.

Their video message is released today before the Royals address 50 world leaders at the Illegal Wildlife conference in London on Thursday. On the film, William calls for people to use social networking sites to condemn wildlife poaching and to help eliminate demand for ivory, rhino horn and tiger skins. Anti-blood-sports groups have, however, criticised the Prince for spending this weekend boar hunting with Prince Harry and friends on an exclusive estate in Cordoba, Spain, owned by William’s godfather, the Duke of Westminster. A spokesman for William declined  to comment on the ‘private’ visit, but  said: ‘The Duke of Cambridge has  for many years been a passionate advocate for endangered wildlife and  has campaigned tirelessly to help stop  the illegal poaching of rhino horn and elephant tusk.'

"By . Lucy Waterlow . and Ruth Styles . Simon Martin, 39, from Weston-super-Mare was still living with his parents when a chance meeting with a 69-year-old woman named Edna changed his life forever. 'I've never had any experience with any girl at all but I knew that I liked her,' he says shyly of the thunderbolt moment when he realised that this was the woman that he wanted to spend his life with. A decade on, Mr and Mrs Martin say they happier than ever and this morning, appeared on ITV's Lorraine to defend their age gap relationship. Scroll down for video . Happy: Simon and Edna Martin appeared on Lorraine to defend their unusual romance and 40-year age gap . 'Although because of the age, I tried to send Simon away, I was very glad he wouldn't go,' says Edna, now 78. Her husband adds: 'It was instant. Before we knew for certain, we decided to just . get together and find out if there was really something there. 'Neither of us wanted to upset the other one by making advances that we . thought might be unwelcome. 'Certainly in my case, I was definitely . scared I might make advances that were unwelcome. But we did find out . that we had something.' The pair also say their families had no problems with the unusual match with Simon telling Lorraine that Edna's son - who is older than he is - even calls him Dad. 'Yes he calls me Dad,' he chortled. 'He's 6ft-odd, while . I'm 5ft 3"" so I look up to him and I get a pain in the back of my neck! Bless his heart!' 39 year age gap: Edna and Simon Martin couldn't be happier . Close: The couple held hands throughout the appearance and say they enjoy each day they have . Anniversary: The pair will celebrate the anniversary of the day Simon proposed on Valentines Day . The couple appeared ahead of new documentary She's 78, He's 39: Age Gap Love, which premiers tonight on Channel 5. In it, the pair open their home to the camera in a bid to prove that true love can overcome even the largest of age gaps. When the pair met, Simon was 30 and still living at home with his parents in Birmingham but his lack of success in love . all changed when he met Edna and bonded with her over his love of organ playing. They snuck . off from an organ recital to share their first kiss under the pier and . have been inseparable ever since. 'I . can't imagine being without Simon, he's the first thing I see in the . morning and the last thing I see at night,' Edna told filmmakers. And . both say the age gap 'doesn't affect things in the bedroom', with Simon . joking they are 'at it like rabbits.' He added: 'You have to have a . sense of humour about sex as it's a ridiculous thing anyway.' But despite their active sex life, there will never be children - something that Edna feared could have kept them apart. 'I told him to leave me because it would mean he couldn't have children - but thank god he didn't,' she said. Edna . needs a walking aid to get around and she said her lack of mobility can . be frustrating. But Simon says it doesn't bother him and he doesn't . notice the physical differences in their ages, nor worries that he could . face decades without his true love. Love: The pair say it was love at first sight for both of them and reveal they couldn't be happier . He . explains: 'I have physically disabilities which mean my body has aged . faster than someone else my age. So I will probably have a shorter life . span. We'll just keep going as long as we can.' In . the meantime, the couple are looking forward to the future and will be . celebrating the anniversary of Simon's proposal next week. 'We've got two anniversaries because we . got engaged on February 14th,' Simon told Lorraine, adding mischievously: 'As I . recall, I wasn't wearing a lot at that time!' She's 78, He's 39: Age Gap Love, tonight on Channel 5 at 9pm . Happy couple: Fitness fanatic Joan, 69, and her boyfriend Phil, 29, say age doesn't matter to them . While Edna and Simon's union may be unusual, it is not unique, as the Channel 5 documentary proves. Also to appear in the documentary is pensioner Joan Lloyd, 68, who has had a relationship with Phil Absolom, 29 for the past 18 months. The couple who live together in Abergele, North Wales, became an item after meeting via Facebook. Joan had been married to her husband, David, for 50 years and they had four children . together. When he died of cancer four years ago, he made her . promise to keep living her life to the full and not become a lonely . widow. She explains: 'On his death bed he told me to get new boobs and a lovely toy boy. He told me, ""I'll . be looking down on you smiling, saying good for you Joan"". He made me . write it down in front of him and sign it.' Joan fulfilled her husband's dying wishes by getting a breast enlargement and went online to seek a new man. She . said: 'I get on with young people so I wanted a toy boy. I was going . for someone who would make me laugh and not make me feel like I'm older. I went on Facebook and got 700 messages from guys but they weren't what . I wanted.' However, she was then contacted by Phil. He said: 'When I first saw picture I was attracted to her so I sent her a message and it started from there.' Joan said: 'I thought, he's gorgeous, I wouldn't mind him.' The couple went on a date and hit it off instantly. 'My legs were like jelly I thought, ""he's the one I'm having,""' Joan recalls. Now she says they can't keep their hands off each other. 'We do a lot of kissing and cuddling. I do like having sex with him and he does as much as he can,' she said. 'I love him to bits and we get on so well.' Joan . said she likes to try and stay young for Phil by exercising daily and . using sunbeds as she believes a tan gives her a youthful look. She also likes to dress in 'sexy style clothes'. She explains: 'I like young stuff. People will say . you are too old to wear something like that leave it to the younger . people but that's not how I feel. I don't want to look like mutton . dressed as lamb but if I can dress young and it looks nice I'm me, I'll . buy it.' The pensioner . admits her desire to hold back the years is part insecurity over Phil . leaving her for a younger woman, particularly if he wants to start a . family. But he assured her: 'It costs half a million to bring up a kid today. Think what I could do with that.' She also found reassurance from his mother who was surprisingly content about her son dating a woman more than twice his age. 'I was insecure I kept thinking he would leave me. But I spoke to his mum . and she told me she had never seen him so much in love and that I . shouldn't worry,' Joan said. Phil added that his mother is happy he found Joan as he needs constant support because he has epilepsy. He said: 'My previous relationship . with girls my own age were terrible because they said they could handle . my epilepsy but deep down they couldn't. They would panic if I had a bad . fit. If I haven't met someone like Joan I would have been single for . the rest of my life. My mum is glad Joan looks after me.'","Simon Martin, 39, was still living with parents when he met Edna, 78 .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . This stunning panorama unveils a tapestry of stellar births and deaths spread across 50,000 light years. The dramatic scene was captured by the Hubble telescope and reveals more details about our mysterious nearby spiral galaxy Messier 83 (M83). While astronomers are poring over its features, Nasa has also enlisted the help of the public to understand exactly what they are seeing. Scroll down for video… . This new Hubble image shows the scatterings of bright stars and thick dust that make up spiral galaxy Messier 83, otherwise known as the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy . The galaxy, also known as the Southern Pinwheel, lies 15 million light years away in the constellation Hydra. Although it looks sprawling, Messier 83 is just under half of the size of the Milky Way. This galaxy is dramatic and unusual; it has hosted a large number of supernova explosions, and is thought to have a double nucleus lurking at its core. The stunning image is being used to support a citizen science project dubbed 'STAR DATE: M83' which is enlisting public help to estimate ages for approximately 3000 star clusters. This is a Digitised Sky Survey (DSS) image of the area around M83. Located some 15 million light-years away in the constellation of Hydra, it is one of the most visible galaxies of its type in our skies . Located some 15 million light-years away in the constellation of Hydra, it is one of the most visible galaxies of its type in our skies. M83's centre is mysterious and unusual; the supermassive black hole at its heart is not alone. This striking spiral displays a phenomenon known as a double nucleus - a feature that has also been spotted in the Andromeda Galaxy, the nearest spiral galaxy to us. This does not mean that Messier 83 contains two central black holes, but that its single supermassive black hole may be ringed by a lopsided disc of stars. As well as this double nucleus, Messier 83 has hosted six supernova explosions. This number is matched by only two other galaxies: Messier 61 (potw1324a) which also has six, and NGC 6946 (opo9910e), which tops the list with nine. Amateur scientists will use the presence or absence of the pink hydrogen emission, the sharpness of the individual stars, and the colour of the clusters to estimate ages. For instance, the newest generations of stars are forming largely in clusters on the edges of the dark spiral dust lanes. These brilliant young stellar groupings, only a few million years old, produce huge amounts of ultraviolet light that is absorbed by surrounding diffuse gas clouds, causing them to glow in pinkish hydrogen light. Gradually, the fierce stellar winds from the youngest, most massive stars blow away the gas, revealing bright blue star clusters and giving a ‘Swiss Cheese’ appearance to the spiral arms. These youngest star clusters are about 1 million to 10 million years old. The populations of stars up to 100 million years or older appear yellow or orange by comparison because the young blue stars have already burned out. Interstellar ‘bubbles’ produced by nearly 300 supernovas from massive stars have also been found in this Hubble image. By studying these supernova remnants, astronomers can better understand the nature of the stars that exploded and dispersed nuclear processed chemical elements back into the galaxy, contributing to the next generation of new stars. People interested in exploring this remarkable image, and in directly participating in a science project, can visit the project page for more details. This view of Messier 83 shows new Hubble data combined with ground-based data from the Giant Magellan Telescope, which shows a wider field of view so the whole galaxy is visible .","Also known as M83, the mysterious galaxy lies 15 million light years away .

"By . Ruth Styles . Tipping the scales at 43st, Zsalynn Whitmore, 43, from San Antonio in Texas was unemployed, housebound and miserable. Zsalynn, a mother of one, had grown so large that she couldn't walk more than 10ft and was too fat to cook or do the dishes. But after a tough run of bad luck, which included being made redundant, Zsalynn finally decided to do something about her obese frame and is well on her way to her goal weight of 200lbs [14st]. Scroll down for video . Overweight: Zsalynn tipped the scales at a staggering 43st (600lb) before deciding to change her life . Zsalynn had been a normal-sized child but began piling on the pounds at the age of eight. Although she initially embraced her size, after becoming a mother to her nine-year-old daughter, her weight began to spiral out of control, eventually leaving her housebound. 'Before I lost the weight I was basically unemployed and at home all the time doing nothing,' she explains. 'All day I just watched TV, I didn’t bother to cook or clean. I really didn’t do anything. It really made me feel worthless.' She adds: 'Not only was . I super-obese, I was knocking at death’s door. Just walking from my bedroom . to my living room would cause me to be breathing heavy.' Currently weighing in at 320lb [22st], Zsalynn has already lost almost half her body weight - helped along by the gastric band she had fitted last autumn. Difficult: Her bulk made it hard for her to do normal activities such as cooking and playing with her nine-year-old . Freak show: She says that constant staring in the street and cutting comments made her feel worthless . But her real goal is to get slim enough to work again - and to be able to go out in public without enduring quizzical stares from passers-by. 'Strangers would feel the need to tell me “oh my God you’re so fat”', she reveals. 'I would expect it from children because children are curious, but adults? 'I would be walking to a restaurant, or walking anywhere, and the whole table, everyone in the restaurant would turn and stare. I was kind of like a living freak show. 'It made me feel like I was something to be gawked at, something to be made fun of. It felt normal for people to make fun of me.' It's a far cry from her younger days when Zsalynn was proud of her size; setting up an organisation named NAAFA [The National Association to Advanced Fat Acceptance] and being squired around the world by men enamoured with larger ladies - her husband among them. But those days are long gone and now Zsalynn is determined to achieve her goal weight, for her daughter's sake if not her own. 30lb and counting: Zsalynn was told to lose 30lb by her doctor before she was allowed bariatric surgery . Better: After undergoing surgery to have a gastric band put in, Zsalynn says the weight has dropped off . 'My husband and I have been having a really, really hard time in our marriage and in our life and my daughter and I went and stayed at our family ranch, just the two of us, and that’s when I made the decision [to lose weight],' she explains. 'I had been unemployed for, I think, four months at that point and I just decided that in order for me to be able to live a healthy life, I had to do something about it. 'No-one was going to hire me at almost 600lbs. I wasn’t going to be able to get a job, so I lost [weight] to get a better life and not wind up in bed and half dead in two or three years time. 'I feel like I probably lost my job as part of some bigger plan in the universe to put me on this path to get healthy.' In a bid for extra motivation, Zsalynn signed up to appear on TLC documentary, My 600lb Life, which hits British TV screens tonight and charts her struggle to slim down. She is filmed having a gastric band put in but before that could happen, she was ordered to lose 40lb by doctors. Painful: Although the surgery caused her lots of pain, she's thrilled she can now play with her daughter . On the way: Zsalynn has now lost an astonishing 20st and hopes to reach a goal weight of 14st . 'Instead of eating the fast food at night I would eat a frozen diet dinner,' she explains. 'I ate two times a day and it would be a 300 calorie frozen meal each time. Then I had surgery and the weight just started falling off.' Now well on her way to her goal weight, Zsalynn has also added exercise to her daily regime. 'In the beginning it wasn’t like I could exercise a lot,' she admits. 'When I say exercising I mean I started being able to walk without running out of breath. I would walk to the mailbox to get the mail. 'I would park further away from my house rather than park in front of my house. I would park at the next house down -15, 20 extra steps per day. Now I go to the gym every day.' But although Zsalynn and her daughter are both thrilled about her increasingly healthy body, not everyone is quite so pleased. Slimmer: Zsalynn, who now weighs just 23st, with her husband. He is less happy about her weight loss . 'My husband, he loves me but he loves fat women so he’s really sad,' she reveals. 'He’s sad because the woman he married is not who I am now. 'We have conversations about this probably once a week, [about] how if I had told him that I didn’t want to be a 500lb woman [when I met him], he probably wouldn’t be married to me. 'But I didn’t know that then. I didn’t know that I wasn’t going to be able to walk and I wasn’t going to be able to breathe and I was going to be the main caregiver for our only child. There’s a lot of stuff that I didn’t know.' Zsalynn Whitmore appears on My 600lb Life, tonight at 9pm on TLC .","Zsalynn Whitmore, 43, weighed 43st before getting a gastric band .

'It’s about becoming your best and most attractive self and learning how to display your new qualities to the men or women you truly desire.'

His clients range in age from 19 to 50 and he even coaches people on how to keep the spark in their marriage alive.

The perverted pilot, who worked at the time for a regional airline carrier that contracts with Delta, told investigators he fell asleep with his hands in his lap and doesn't know how one ended up underneath the girl. Pascal's attorney . said his client was shocked over charges, and that he has a teenage . daughter of his own. The lawyer insisted any touching that occurred was . inadvertent. The startled young girl told authorities she elbowed . Pascal after waking up with his hand underneath her and asked, 'What the . hell are you doing?' She says he pulled his hand out from under her and said, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I was asleep, I have to use the bathroom.' The armrest that she had pushed down was in the upright position, she recalled. Pascal said he pulled up the armrest between him and the girl because . the man on the other side of him was taking up a lot of room, according . to documents. Neither police nor the jury bought it. They took only a few hours to find him guilty. The girl, who was flying alone, told flight attendants what happened and was so shaken she changed seats. She maintained Pascal was 'clearly awake' and put some of his body on her. He's scheduled to be sentenced July 29 and could face up to five years in prison.","The young girl awoke after an in-flight nap to find Michael Pascal's hand grabbing her buttocks .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A PCP-smoking Guatemalan illegal immigrant was convicted on Thursday of the brutal murder of a 19-year-old college student with a ‘good heart’ who had stopped to give him and his baby daughter a ride to a local hospital. Julio Blanco Garcia, 27, stabbed Vanessa Pham near Falls Church shopping center in Fairfax County, Virginia, on June 27, 2010. On Thursday a jury sentenced him to 49 years in prison - 30 years plus the 19 years of Pham’s life. Scroll down for video . 'I have no life': Vanessa Pham's mother Julie Pham has spoken of the terrible loss she continues to feel two years after losing her only child . Guilty: Julio Blanco Garcia has been setenced to 49 years in prison after he was found guilty of stabbing Vanessa Pham, right, to death in 2010 while high on PCP . The victim’s family and friends cried and held each other while the verdict was read out, as Blanco Garcia remained emotionless. Outside . the court, Vanessa’s mother Julie Pham spoke of the terrible loss she . continues to feel two years after losing her only child, reports the Washington Post. ‘I have no life,’ Pham said sobbing. ‘I just stay in my room.’ Pham . had worked two jobs to support her daughter, who wanted to be a fashion . designer and had just finished her first year at Savannah College of . Art and Design when she was murdered. Taken: Pham was home for the summer, looking forward to a new babysitting job and a visit from her boyfriend when she was stabbed to death while giving Blanco Garcia a ride . Jurors listened to a two hour video taped statement from Julio Blanco Garcia as he confessed to the stabbing death of Vanessa Pham . The . guilty verdict followed more than three days of testimony from . detectives, forensic experts and Pham’s relatives and friends. Blanco . Garcia is scheduled to be formally sentenced on Nov. 15. He had denied . the charge of premeditated murder, but admitted to knifing her to death . in a drug-fueled fury after he begged her to drive him and his daughter . to hospital. Blanco Garcia never took the stand during the trial, but . prosecutors played two-hour police interrogation during . which the defendant broke down, admitted his role in the killing and . apologized. 'I remember I asked [Pham] to drop me off at the . hospital,' he told detectives. 'Then she took the wrong way. In my mind, because I was really high, I thought she was going to do . something to me. I had a knife in my backpack... and then I did what I . did.' During this week's trail it was revealed that immigration officials could have deported Blanco Garcia months before the brutal slaying . Detective Derek Hardy said: 'The most important thing that I found or that I noted was the amount of blood that was inside that car' During closing arguments on Thursday, . Chief Deputy Commonwealth’s Attorney Casey Lingan had asked the jury to . find Blanco Garcia guilty of first-degree premeditated murder. 'How much more cruel of an act could this defendant commit against Vanessa Pham?' he asked. 'Stabbing . her as she fought with her fists and her leg... six times in the . lungs... leaving her to bleed out. Daresay, if that’s not cruel, I don’t . know the definition of cruel.' During this week's trail it . was revealed that immigration officials could have deported . Blanco Garcia months before the brutal slaying after he was held at the . Fairfax County jail for a few hours on a public intoxication charge in . 2010. He was released without being . fingerprinted and before federal immigration officials were able to file . paperwork requesting that he be detained until they could take him into . custody because he had overstayed his visa. Clothes: Vanessa Pham's blood-soaked T-Shirt she was wearing on the day she was murdered was also shown to the jury - the slash marks were visible . The Falls Church teenager was found dead in the driver's seat of her car . Though DNA and fingerprints were . recovered at the scene of the June 27, 2010, crime, it was two . and-a-half years before the Guatemala native was arrested because he was . not in the police database. During the trial the prosecutors' first witness - the medical . examiner who performed the autopsy on Vanessa - described the 'numerous . sharp, force injuries' from the incise wounds and added that six stab . wounds were found in the lung alone. The murder weapon was shown in court - . which had dried blood on it - as well as the blood-soaked T-shirt and . blood-splattered car. The medical examiner said Vanessa was alive when the wounds were inflicted and she would have felt great pain. Outside of the courtroom the disclosure that immigration officials previously tried to take him into custody raised questions about whether local and . federal policies had let him slip through the cracks. U.S. Immigration and Customs . Enforcement was notified of Blanco-Garcia’s 2010 misdemeanor for public . intoxication and planned to file paperwork to take custody of him. But before he could be fingerprinted he was released by local authorities due to the low-level nature of the charge. Garcia was finally taken into custody when he was arrested for stealing three bottles of champagne from a grocery store. Bob Dane, spokesman for the Federation . for American Immigration Reform, told the Washington Times: 'We’re . looking into a black hole here as part of the procedure and it . should be a wake-up call for the public to ask how Fairfax County . handles illegal aliens and what they do when ICE doesn’t send the paddy . wagon.' Evidence: The blade from the knife used to stab Vanessa Pham 13 times in the seat of her car in June 2010 . Police also found two diaper cloths in the car: One clean in the back and one up front bloodied from Vanessa's wounds . 'This is not a . case that is about who,' defense attorney Alberto Salvado had said in his . opening statement on Monday. 'This is a . case about why. It is a perfect storm of tragedy.' For two-and-a-half years Vanessa's killing remained one of the area's most notorious unsolved murders. Despite . finding the murder weapon with fingerprints under the driver's seat, . the DNA evidence didn't match anyone in the police database. A . break in the case came only in April 2012 when Julio Miguel Blanco . Garcia was arrested for stealing three bottles of Moet & Chandon . champagne from a McLean, Virginia shop. Initially, . his lawyers tried to get the case dismissed, claiming that the media's . coverage of the investigation tainted their client's ability to receive a . fair trial since nearly all of the evidence in the case was released . before a jury was selected. Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Marum Roush dismissed that claim last week, saying all of the evidence reported in The Washington Post would come out in trial and that jury members could set aside what they learned in the press. Vanessa had just returned home for the summer after her first year studying fashion design at the Savannah College of Art and Design. She had happily told friends that she . had been offered a summer job as a nanny. The defendant himself said she . had a 'good heart' for giving him a ride. The 19-year-old was also looking forward to a visit from her boyfriend Aaron Apsley who lived in Ohio. Around 2:45pm she decided to go to the Fairfax Plaza Shopping Center to get her eyebrows done at JD Nail Salon. It was while leaving the salon that she first encountered Blanco Garcia, standing outside holding his one-year-old daughter. Garcia started his day by going into Washington, D.C. with his daughter to buy $400 dollars of PCP. When he got home he smoked three cigarettes dipped in liquid PCP before going to the mall with his daughter. According . to court documents, by the time he approached Vanessa outside the mall, he . was having a 'severe PCP intoxication' and asked the young woman to . take him and his daughter to the hospital. Surveillance footage subsequently shows Pham's white Scion exiting the parking lot. Taken for a ride: Pham agreed to take Blanco Garcia and his one-year-old daughter to the hospital, but was found less than a mile away stabbed to death in her crashed car . According to an account given to police by Blanco Garcia, Vanessa accidentally took a wrong turn and he overreacted. 'Vanessa did nothing wrong,' a detective paraphrased Blanco Garcia in a report made after his arrest. At . this point, Blanco Garcia was hallucinating and believed the teen was . going to harm his daughter or call the police, so he acted. He . took out a butcher's knife from his backpack and stabbed the girl 13 . times which caused her to lose control of the vehicle and crash into a . ravine on the side of the road. Blanco Garcia ditched the knife and left Vanessa to die, fleeing from the vehicle with his daughter through the sunroof. A . driver spotted the car at 3:34pm, less than half a mile from the mall . and called police. When police arrived, they found Vanessa belted into her . seat and covered in blood with one wheel of the car still spinning. But police were stumped when it came to finding the suspect. Severely intoxicated: Blanco Garcia has spent his day traveling into Washington D.C. to buy $400 dollars of PCP with his daughter, and had smoked three cigarettes dipped in the drugs before going to the shopping center . Even though the knife was left in the car, the DNA evidence produced no matches in the police database. Investigators were certain the killer was a stranger since they had no reason to believe the pretty student had any enemies or was in any trouble. They canvassed the area around the mall and collected DNA from Vanessa's friends and family, local sex offenders and homeless people around the mall, but again, no matches. Vanessa's story was even highlighted on TV show 'America's Most Wanted' to no avail. It wasn't until almost two years later that Blanco Garcia was arrested for stealing two bottles of Moet & Chandon champagne at a grocery store in McLean, Virginia. Even then, it took police until last December 10 to make the connection with his prints. '[Blanco Garcia] was arrested in April for larceny of champagne. Imagine that!' wrote Fairfax County police detective Robert Bond in an email that day. A few days later Blanco Garcia was arrested at his job site in Vienna, Virginia. He said he never told anyone about the killing. A search of Blanco Garcia's computer showed that he tracked news of the investigation on his computer.","Julio Blanco Garcia was sentenced on Thursday to 49 years in prison for the 2010 murder of Vanessa Pham .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A new class of experimental medicines can dramatically lower cholesterol, raising hopes of a fresh option for people who can't tolerate or don't get enough help from Lipitor and other statin drugs that have been used for this for decades. The first large studies of these drugs were presented Saturday at an American College of Cardiology conference in Washington, and more will follow on Sunday. Several companies are developing these drugs, which are aimed at 70 million Americans and millions more worldwide who have high LDL or 'bad' cholesterol, a major risk for heart disease. A new class of experimental medicines can dramatically lower cholesterol, raising hopes of a fresh option for people who can't tolerate or don't get enough help from Lipitor and other statin drugs that have been used for this for decades. The first large studies of these drugs were presented Saturday at an American College of Cardiology conference in Washington . Three studies of Amgen Inc.'s version of these drugs, called evolocumab (ev-oh-LOKE-you-mab), found it lowered LDL or 'bad' cholesterol by 55 to 66 percent compared to a fake drug, and by nearly that much when compared to Merck's Zetia, another cholesterol medication. As impressive as that is, it's still just part of the picture. Doctors want evidence that the way these drugs lower cholesterol also will lead to fewer heart attacks and deaths, because that proof already exists for statins. New studies are underway to test this, but Amgen said it will seek approval for its drug this year based on cholesterol-lowering alone. That was enough to win approval for statins and Zetia, but use of Zetia has declined since 2008, when research showed it failed to help prevent heart attacks even though it cut cholesterol. Hopes are high that the new Amgen drug and others like it will do better. 'I would be happy to see it approved on the cholesterol results alone,' said Dr. Hadley Wilson, a cardiologist at Carolinas HealthCare System. 'We need additional agents other than statins"" to help patients,' he said. Nearly all current cholesterol medicines — fibrates, niacin and top-selling statins — are decades old. Statins such as Lipitor, Zocor and Crestor curb cholesterol production. Zetia, which came out about a decade ago, helps block the absorption of cholesterol from the intestine. The new drugs block PCSK9, a substance that interferes with the liver's ability to remove cholesterol from the blood. They have big drawbacks, though. Statins are pills sold as generics for as little as a dime a day. The new drugs are proteins rather than chemicals, and those tend to be very expensive to make. They also must be given as shots every two weeks or once a month. People can give the shots to themselves with a pen-like device. The companies developing the new medicines have not said what they might cost. 'We were very, very pleased about how well patients accepted the shots, and if they offer better results, especially for those with inherited conditions - people will accept it,' said Dr. Michael Koren of Jacksonville Center for Clinical Research in Florida, who helped lead two of the studies. The three Amgen studies involved about 2,000 patients in all. Doctors tested the drug in people with high cholesterol not taking other medicines, as a long-term (one-year) treatment in people already taking various medications and in combination with statins and other drugs in people with an inherited cholesterol disorder. In general, side-effect rates were about the same for evolocumab vs. placebo or Zetia. In some studies, muscle aches, nausea and a few other problems were a little higher with the experimental drug. Overall safety 'is very, very encouraging,' said Dr. Scott Wasserman, Amgen's executive medical director. Researchers also said: . —Alirocumab, a similar drug being developed by Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., lowered LDL cholesterol by 47 percent vs. 16 percent for Zetia in a study of about 100 people not taking any other drugs for high cholesterol. —Bococizumab, from Pfizer Inc., lowered LDL 45 percent to 67 percent, depending on dose, compared to placebo in 354 people with high cholesterol also taking a statin. 'There's great interest in all of these drugs, but doctors will wait for evidence that they lower heart risks,' said Dr. Neil Stone, a Northwestern University cardiologist and spokesman for the American Heart Association. It may be easier to justify their use in patients with genes that cause high cholesterol at an early age, he said. A spokeswoman for the federal Food and Drug Administration, Sandy Walsh, suggested that might be the case. 'Although we cannot comment on the likelihood of approval based solely on specific indications or populations,' two drugs recently were approved based on cholesterol-lowering for people with inherited conditions,' she noted. A decision on approval also will be influenced by how much the drug lowers cholesterol, its effects on other fats in the blood and other heart signs such as inflammation and blood pressure, and its safety, she said.","First large studies of new anti-cholesterol drugs presented at the American College of Cardiology conference in Washington on Saturday .

"By . Sara Malm . Crimea has moved the clocks forward two hours instead of one in order to change to Moscow time, despite a U.N. vote this week declaring the region's referendum to join Russia invalid. The move, which took place at midnight Moscow time - 8pm GMT - means the Ukrainian peninsula is no longer on the same time as the capital Kiev. The Russian flag was flying high over the House of Officers of the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, where the peninsula’s Prime Minister Sergei Aksyonov oversaw the time switch. Defiant: The Russian flies atop a city clock tower in Sevastopol, Crimea as the region swapped to Moscow time tonight . Symbolically sealing Russia's takeover of the formerly Ukrainian peninsula, a ceremony was held to move the clocks two hours forward at the railway station in the main city of Simferopol. Prime Minister Aksyonov oversaw the switch at 10pm to applause from hundreds of supporters who waved Russian flags and shouted ‘Russia’. ‘Only the first three days will be difficult,’ said Gleb Kulikov, a resident of Simferopol. His friend Sergei Ageyev added: ‘We always lived according to Moscow time before Ukraine's independence.’ The time switch comes as it emerged Russia allegedly threatened several members of the U.N. ahead of the General Assembly’s vote declaring the Crimea referendum invalid. Accusation: Russia allegedly tried to blackmail several smaller Eastern European and Asian countries, as well as a number of African states before the U.N. vote this week . Final vote: The Ukrainian resolution declaring the Crimean referendum invalid was backed by 100 U.N. states, with just 11 voting against . Before the vote, Russia allegedly . tried to blackmail several smaller Eastern European and Asian countries, . including Moldova, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, as well as a number of . African states. However, . despite the supposed threats of retaliation, the United Nations General . Assembly voted in favour of declaring Crimea’s referendum to break away . from Ukraine invalid with 100 to 11. The . news of blackmail accusations comes as the leader of Ukraine’s . opposition party UDAR (Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform), former . boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, announced that will not be running . for president. Klitschko . and will instead throw his support behind billionaire confectionary . oligarch Petro Poroshenko and run for mayor of Kiev. His . endorsement will prove a valuable boost for Poroshenko, who played a . prominent role in the months-long protest movement that led to the . toppling of President Viktor Yanukovych in February. ‘The only way to win is by nominating a single candidate from the democratic ranks,’ Klitschko told a UDAR party congress today. ‘This should be a candidate with the greatest support from the people.’ Klitschko's . withdrawal sets up a May 25 contest between the man known as the . 'Chocolate King' and former prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko. Out of the race: Vitali Klitschko has today announces that he is dropping out of the presidential campaign and will support Petro Poroshenko as presidential candidate in elections on 25 May . Big backer: Klitschko, leader of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform party (UDAR), has instead said he will be supporting Petro Poroshenko, pictured left, for president . The disclosures about Russian threats . came after Moscow accused Western countries of using ‘shameless . pressure, up to the point of political blackmail and economic threats,’ in an attempt to coerce the United Nations' 193 member states to join it . in supporting the non-binding resolution on the Ukraine crisis. In . the end, the Ukrainian resolution declaring Crimea's vote on March 16 . in favour of seceding from Ukraine as having ‘no validity’ passed with . 100 votes in favour, 11 against and 58 abstentions. Another 24 U.N. member states did not cast votes. Western . diplomats called the result a diplomatic success for Ukraine and said . the result of Thursday's vote highlighted Russia's isolation on the . issue of Crimea. A spokesman . for Russia's Mission to the U.N. denied that Moscow threatened any . country with retaliation if it supported the resolution, saying: ‘We . never threaten anyone. We just explain the situation.’ Other side of the same: Supporters of the Ukrainian opposition politician Yulia Tymoshenko attend 'Batkivshchyna' party congress on the Sophievskaya square in Kiev, Ukraine . Race is on: After Klitschko's withdrawal, the presidential elections is now set to stand between Yulia Tymoshenko, pictured today, and Poroshenko . Yes to Yulia: Ukranians listen to a speech by Tymoshenko during the party convention in Kiev . According to the diplomats, the Russian threats were not specific. But they said it was clear to the recipients of the warnings not to support the resolution that retaliatory measures could include steps such as expelling migrant workers from Russia, halting natural gas supplies or banning certain imports to Russia to cause economic harm. Neither Kyrgyzstan nor Tajikistan were present to cast the vote, and the Moldovan Ambassador to the U.N. said he had not been present during any threats of relatiation, but said he had discussed the vote with representatives from several countries, including Russia. Several diplomats told Reuters that Moldova was among the countries subjected to pressure from Moscow ahead of the vote. In the end, the Moldovan delegation defied Russia and joined Ukraine, the United States, the EU and other Western powers in voting yes. French Ambassador Gerard Araud was asked about Russia's allegation that Western powers had blackmailed U.N. member states to secure a strong vote in favour of the Crimea text. ‘When you lose, you have to be a good a loser,’ he told reporters outside the Security Council. ‘I think Russia is a bad loser. They lost and they did by 100 votes.’","Crimea moved their clocks two hours forward on Saturday night .

The unidentified 40-year-old man was attempting to rouse the the crowd into doing the wave when he stood on the railing then plummeted to the ground head first. It was an unfortunate end to an otherwise celebratory pre-season major league game, a rarity in the city since the Expos left in 2004, between the Toronto Blue Jays and New York Mets. Tragic: Many of the 46,121 people who attended a pre-season MLB game in Montreal on Friday witnessed one fan plummet some 50 feet and land headfirst on the cement floor. An ambulance rushed to the scene and the man remained in critical condition Saturday . One of these three men is the victim, who climbed on the railing during an attempt to get the audience to do the wave, before plummeting 50 feet . Witness Ian Tkach told CTV that the man was, like many of the baseball deprived Quebecois in attendance, in very high spirits as he stood at the front of the bleachers egging the crowd on. He then took things a step further when he climbed onto the rails and, with his feet on the bottom rung, leaned toward the field. He lost his balance and fell headfirst to the concrete floor below. The stunned crowd watched in a hush as an ambulance hurried to the scene and carted the man away. '[He] was seriously injured everywhere in his body, he's still in critical condition, we do fear for his life,' said Montreal police officer Danny Richer.

"By . Ryan Gorman . Boston firefighters gathered Thursday at Logan Airport to meet the family of a fallen comrade in an emotional show of respect and gratitude. Massachusetts Port Authority Fire Department members waited silently outside the gate of a flight escorting Lt. Edward Walsh’s mother. He was one of two firefighters who died earlier in the week while trying to tame a blaze in the city’s Back Bay neighborhood. The picture was taken by Max Widmer as he waited to board his plane and the firemen waited for the JetBlue flight that carried her to Beantown free of charge, according to WCVB. Show of respect: MassPort firefighters lined up Thursday at Logan Airport to greet the family of fallen comrade Lt. Ed Walsh, who died the prior day battling a massive blaze in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston . Walsh, 43, and a married father of three children, was trapped Wednesday in the basement after a window broke in the building and allowed high winds to intensify the flames, according to the Boston Globe. ‘We’re in the basement, please come and get us,’ either he or Michael Kennedy, 33, shouted frantically into their radio. The winds fanned the flames to the point all firefighters were ordered to evacuate as the fire reached its seventh alarm. ‘In 30 years, I’ve never seen a fire travel that fast, escalate that quickly, and cause such havoc,’ Deputy Fire Chief Joseph Finn told the Globe. Heroic: Lt Ed Walsh died saving people's lives from a nine alarm inferno that burned the building to the ground . The call came over the radio to get out and stay out. ‘No companies should be going in anywhere; stay away from the building,’ was the order over the radio. Some insisted they were going back in to save the two men, but they were ordered to stand down. Walsh and Kennedy never made it out of the basement, but their actions were credited with saving the lives of residents on the upper floors. ‘These two heroes ran into a burning building and got people out,’ Mayor Martin Walsh (no relation) said at a press conference that evening, according to the Globe. ‘A day like today makes us all too aware of what they are risking in the course of doing their jobs,’ he continued. ‘They are heroes simply by virtue of accepting this duty.’ The inferno eventually reached nine alarms before MassPort and Boston Fire Department firefighters were able to bring it under control. Memorial funds have been set up in their names since the tragedy. Their funerals are set to be held in the coming days. The building burned to the ground, but the two men were the only deaths. The fire has preliminarily been ruled an accident.","Lt. Ed Walsh, 43, left behind a wife and three children after being trapped in the basement of a home that burned to the ground .

"By . Ryan Lipman . When’s daddy coming home? That's the heartbreaking question asked by two young children to the Perth wife of Paul Weeks, who was on board MH370 when it mysteriously disappeared three weeks ago. Waiting 17 days for confirmation, 40-year old Danica Weeks received the worst news possible - her 39-year old husband was among the 239 killed when aircraft crashed into a remote area of the southern Indian Ocean and killed all on board. The couple have two young sons Lincoln, 3, and Jack, 11 months, and moved to Perth in 2011 following earthquakes in Mr Weeks' native New Zealand. Devastated: Danica Weeks has the heartbreaking task of explaining her two young sons what happened to their father who died on MH370 . Setting up a new life in Australia, the Weeks' lived in Perth's northern outskirts - just 15 minutes from RAAF Pearce, the aircraft base for the international search effort for the wreckage. Mr Weeks boarded the plane so he could make his way to Mongolia to start his new fly-in-fly-out job as a mechanical engineer. But since the plane went missing, Mrs Weeks said her world had been turned upside down and she now has the harrowing task of explaining to her sons what happened to their father. 'When you look into your children’s eyes and I feel the pain because I know personally the man Paul was and I now the enormity of what they’re going to miss out on for the rest of their lives,' Mrs Weeks told 60 Minutes in an interview with the Nine Network, set to air Sunday night. 'That is so overwhelming for me that when I look at Lincoln I have to tell him his dad has gone,' she added. The text message that Mrs Weeks received from Malaysia Airlines confirming her husband was killed when the aircraft plunged into the southern Indian Ocean . Still waiting for confirmation on what happened on board MH370, the mother-of-two said she would tell her sons Lincoln, 3, and Jack, 11 months, the truth about happened . Despite not knowing why MH370 crashed, Mrs Weeks said she was going to have to tell her children their father was gone. 'I think I have to because you’ve got to tell the kids the truth,' she said. 'But even Lincoln this morning he was having a meltdown and he’s ""I’m missing daddy I’m missing daddy when’s daddy coming home?"" Is daddy still missing?' In a cruel twist, the first search area off the coast of Western Australia indicated that the Boeing 777 may have passed over Perth before it plunged into the ocean 1800km west of the city. 'We thought they were flying the other way and look until a week they were still searching up there, yeah but to know they had flown straight past us,' Mrs Weeks said of the previous search area. 'So close and I would’ve been out at the shops at the time. Mrs Weeks pictured CNN Live with an image of her husband Paul Weeks. The grieving widow discussed details of her agonising loss with Piers Morgan . 'I’ve thought this through... I was in Perth merrily going along our family way while he was crashing into the ocean.' The search has since been diverted to an area 1100km northeast of where teams had been looking for a week, far off Western Australia, making it unlikely that the aircraft had passed over Perth. The day after the plane disappeared, Mrs Weeks took to Facebook to describe how she was feeling, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. 'Thank you all for your thoughts, in a place I never wanted to be, trying to gather strength for my two beautiful boys, miss my darling with all my heart. X,' she posted. Mrs Weeks found out by a text message from Malaysia Airlines that her husband had likely been killed when the plane crashed in the Indian Ocean. A loving father, Mr Weeks left for Mongolia to start his new fly-in-fly-out job as a mechanical engineer .
